She has a quick temper when it comes to dealing with one of her other teammates (but has a secret affinity to sweets).<br>\r\nExtra: Loves chocolate (but doesn\u2019t like to broadcast that to her team)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alison <br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPokemon Based off of: Quilava <br>\r\nAge: 17<br>\r\nDescription: A small, petite girl (so much that she often gets confused that she\u2019s a little girl) with short red and black hair with a cute face. Over her petite body is a yellow and black hoodie and a red skirt. <br>\r\nPersonality: A hot headed girl who often bumps heads with Midnight over who\u2019s leader and what decisions they should make. She often falls prey to cute guys and whatever tricks they have up their sleeves. Has a vulgar tongue to her.<br>\r\nExtra: She\u2019s really envious of Midnight and Fontina\u2019s figures, often wishes that she had a better body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Fontina <br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPokemon Based off of: Vaporeon <br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nDescription: A shy cute girl with short blue hair (with a few fin-like bangs) who dresses in a white blouse and a long blue skirt. She has the best figure out of the three girls on this team, and is often shy about people talking about her curvy figure.<br>\r\nPersonality: The voice of reason in this party, although, she often has her words of wisdom ignored by the two until she actually makes her point. Loves to read and often gets too deep in her books to realize what\u2019s happening around her.<br>\r\nExtra: She used to be a petite Eevee Moemon, but thanks to the group\u2019s constant eating out during their trips, she developed her figure (and it grew worse when she turned into a Vaporeon Moemon). She\u2019s currently on a diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will be more characters added to this story when they appear. But, do you want to use this team or another?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a dark and stormy night over the grassy plains, thunder and lightning crackling overhead and rain pouring down into the grassy fields. It was almost beautiful to watch nature at work\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHIS SUCKS!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad it\u2019s only beautiful if you weren\u2019t caught outside in the storm, like our three heroines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAli! Hand over that umbrella! That\u2019s an order!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget that! Did you forget that water and me don\u2019t really mix?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, do we really need to argue now of all times?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, Fontina!\u201d barked a voluptuous Mightyena pokemon, her dark hair completely matted down by the rain water and her clothes (a black leather jacket, cut off jean shorts and silver tank top) were soaked and clung to her \u2018assets\u2019 quite well. \u201cAnd Ali! At least move over so I can use the umbrella too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, Midnight!\u201d Ali snarled back, her sharp eyes narrowing behind her red and black short hair. \u201cI paid for this umbrella with the money I won, and you had your chance to buy one yourself but you preferred to spend it on who knows what!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the Mightyena moemon \u2013 Midnight, Ali was a Quilava moemon, and compared to Midnight\u2019s body, Ali was a washboard, hardly having any curves to her name and having her red and yellow hoodie hanging off her body while her black skirt had to have a belt attachment on it just so she could make sure it would slip off her body. It certainly didn\u2019t help that because of this figure that Ali would be confused for a Cyndaquil moemon at times. At least thanks to her red umbrella, Ali wasn\u2019t going to get wet like the team\u2019s so-called \u2018leader\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the third member of the group, Fontina, who was quietly sighing behind her two friends as they continued their bickering. Unlike her companions, Fontina was a fan of the rain (with good reason, since she was a Vaporeon Moemon) but wasn\u2019t a fan of colds so she wore a light blue poncho over her usual attire \u2013 A white blouse and a long blue skirt. Even though the hood of her poncho protected her head from getting wet, the front bangs of her short blue hair (with a few fin-like bangs) and her large glasses still got hit with rain water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd although she didn\u2019t like to acknowledge it, Fontina\u2019s figure was the best of the trio\u2019s, a trim waist and an hourglass figure. In fact, that figure was the reason for some of the arguments that the group had to deal with in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking that thought from her head and trying to put her friends\u2019 bickering out of her mind, Fontina turned her head to the side to look at the view. That\u2019s when something caught her eyes, \u201cH-Hey guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough some miracle, both Midnight and Ali ceased their argument to turn towards Fontina, who was pointing to the side with her hand. Following her hand, the two girls saw that there was a large mansion not too far in the distance. \u201cM-Maybe we can a-ask to stay while t-the storm\u2019s here and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea!\u201d Midnight laughed as she crossed her arms under her bust. \u201cGood thing I saw that mansion first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ali and Fontina sighed before the three began to walk towards the mansion\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-_____________-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mansion itself was rather impressive, almost as large as some of the buildings that the three had come across in their visits to cities. The mansion looked like it was in a Victorian style and had more features that you would see in a castle. However, all of the windows were dark, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any life in the mansion at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 M-Maybe no one\u2019s home?\u201d Fontina suggested, regretting her observation from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place kind of screams \u2018A mad scientist lives here,\u2019\u201d Ali pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBah, you two are just being paranoid,\u201d Midnight growled as she walked towards the door. \u201cIf no one\u2019s here, then we can just relax here without worrying and evil scientists don\u2019t exist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about those scientists in Team Rocket?\u201d Ali pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, T-Team Galatic?\u201d Fontina added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeesh, those two are from different regions!\u201d Midnight sighed as she shook her head when she got under the patio\u2019s roof, attempting to dry out her hair. \u201cNow quit acting like crybabies and get out of the rain!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With everyone on her team submerged underneath the porch, Midnight raised one pruney finger to touch the doorbell and let it fall back to her side patiently. The silence that followed was only broken by the heavy rain that constantly fell in the background. \"Maybe nobody's home?\" Fontina peeped from behind her leader, \"Yeah, this place gives me the creeps anyway, why don't we just-\" Ali's input was ignored however, because Midnight's superior hearing picked up on the faint tapping of footsteps inside the seemingly abandoned mansion. \"Shh!!\" she hushed her younger companions with a finger to her pursed lips, \"Someone's coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli and Fontina followed Midnight's example and cupped their ears up to the heavy door, now hearing the muffled footsteps with their own ears. They got closer and closer to the door as the footsteps themselves grew closer themselves until finally they stopped. The moemon exchanged confused glances before their support gave way, sending all three of them tumbling to the cold wet ground! \"Yes, can I help you?\" a delicate voice asked from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!!\" Midnight whined, having landed flat on her face with her nose breaking the fall, \"THAT REALLY HURT YOU-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Fontina decided to cut off Midnight there before she said anything too stupid. \"Uh, yes, sorry about that.\" she said as she brushed herself off, \"My friends and I were just anxious to get out of the cold and-\" she, in turn was cut off by Ali who had her own way of explaining things, \"Yeah, so since the storm's not letting up, do you think we could stay with you for tonight?\" she asked politely... \"We won't rob you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all stared at the woman behind the doorframe with pleading eyes; she appeared to be a Kangashkan moemon with a slight weight problem. To the more observant (meaning only Fontina in this situation) one could see that her chubby body was adorned rather comfortably in a maid's outfit; thus meaning that it wasn't <b>her</b> decision if they stayed or drowned outside. Still, it wwould be nice to get out of the rain if only for a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was silent for a minute, before her chubby cheeks cracked a smile. That smile turned to boistrous laghter, \"Ahahaha, well I would certainly hope not!\" she howled, sending a vibration that carried throughout her entire body in a quaking jiggle, \"Please, come in.\" she said courteously. She was met with less than polite responses as even the reserved Fontina quickly barged in and out of the rain. She stifled another fit of laughter as she watched them all dry off, namely Midnight's idea of shaking her entire body like her namesake pokemon. \"You poor things.\" her tone was honest and sincere, \"You must be chilled to the bone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to agree with the chubby woman, every inch of them was soaked down to the bone (except maybe Ali, who was wet every other inch) Fontina took it upon herself to remove her powder blue poncho, pulling it over her head to reveal her \"smart girl\" apparal. As she resituated her round glasses on her face, she couldn't help but notice just how dark it was in the mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive my asking ma'am, but do you live alone here?\" she inqueried, only for Midnight to shut her up. \"Don't bug the woman who's letting us spend the night here.\" she said rudely as she adjusted her bra back over a boob shaken loose in her earlier attempt to get dry. \"I don't think she said anything about letting us stay yet...\" Ali corrected her solemnly, \"HEY SHUT UP PIPSQUEAK!\" Midnight barked, \"SAY IT TO MY FACE DOG BREATH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" the woman continued, politely ignoring the less refined members of the party...</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t know the exact details, but he had to take a few of the staff members here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeague?\u201d Fontina questioned, as she blinked a few times behind her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d The woman continued as she turned her attention fully to Fontina and did not pay attention to Midnight and Ali, who were starting to get a little more intense in their argument. \u201cBesides me, there are only a handful of maids here. We\u2019re just keeping the place in order and making sure that all orders and mail is sorted correctly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen aren\u2019t we intruding?\u201d Fontina asked, taking a moment to realize that Midnight and Ali were starting to pull at each other\u2019s hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOW! LET GO YOU LITTLE RAT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU FIRST YOU DUMB BI\u2026 OUCH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, heavens no,\u201d The woman replied with a wave of her hand. \u201cThe master always allows people to stay in the mansion. In fact, that\u2019s how some of the maids got their jobs here. Just so long as nothing is broken or stolen, everything should alright for you and your two friends to stay here for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, thank you,\u201d Fontina said as she bowed her head slightly. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave as soon as the storm passes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not worry, my dear,\u201d The woman stated with a warm smile on her chubby face. That\u2019s when she stood there with her face turning dull. \u201cUh, hmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Fontina asked, now realizing that her two companions were rolling on the floor. \u201cG-Guys! S-Stop it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, I just realized that I forgot to introduce myself,\u201d The Kangaskhan woman replied with a large blush on her face. \u201cHow rude of me not to do so! My name is Shera, and it is a pleasure to meet you all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She\u2019s completely ignoring Midnight and Ali\u2019s rude behavior,\u2019 Fontina thought with a large bead of sweat rolling down the side of her head. \u201cUm, yes, well, I am Fontina, and my two friends on the ground are Ali and Midnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, what a lively duo,\u201d Shera chuckled as she spun on her heels. \u201cWell then, you girls must be soaked. We should get you out of those wet clothes before you catch your deaths. If you\u2019ll follow me, I\u2019ll lead you to one of the guest rooms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Shera was about to step forward, both Ali and Midnight had rolled in the larger woman\u2019s path, only for the Kangaskhan Moemon to jump over them without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Guys!\u201d Fontina whispered at the two fighting companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGRRRR!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRAN OUT OF CLEVER ONE-LINERS, YOU MISBRED MUTT?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-__________________-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, and actually managing to pry her two friends away from each other, Fontina, Ali and Midnight were following Shera through the slightly lit hallways. One thing that caught Fontina\u2019s attention, was that there were several paintings lining the walls \u2013 Each of them depicting a beautiful Moemon girl, ranging from an snoozing Absol girl to a sleek Zigzagoon girl as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Man, this is just somewhat creepy,\u2019 Midnight thought to herself just as Shera stopped in front of one of the many doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright dears!\u201d Shera announced as she spun on her heels and gestured towards the door next to her. \u201cHere\u2019s your room, there are plenty of beds, a restroom and even a television. If you want to go around the Mansion, there are some maps around the halls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are there maps in the mansion?\u201d Ali questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the Master is somewhat forgetful at times,\u201d Shera answered as she unlocked the door to the room. \u201cSo, we set up maps all over the mansion to help him and new maids learn their way around. I\u2019ll be sure to find you girls once dinner is going to be served. So, until then, please, just relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Shera began to turn and walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was out of ear shot\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan,\u201d Midnight sighed as she walked into the room. \u201cShe was a porker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidnight!\u201d Ali hissed as she followed the Mightyena Moemon into the room, Fontina following them as well. \u201cShe let us in and is letting us stay the night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019s tubby,\u201d Midnight replied as she peeled off her belly shirt. \u201cAnyway, dibs on the shower first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ali and Fontina sighed loudly as Midnight slipped into the bathroom, \u201cI swear, sometimes we need to smack her upside the head a few times to get some respect out of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Ali,\u201d Fontina chirped slightly as she removed her poncho, revealing her dry attire. \u201cI realize that she\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but nothing!\u201d Ali growled as she tossed her umbrella to the side. \u201cShe could stand to lose a little bit of that ego of hers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli sighed loudly as she shook her head, \u201cLook Fontina, I don\u2019t mean to yell, but Midnight just gets on my nerves. She was a pretty good friend as a Poochyena Moemon, but ever since she changed, she thinks she\u2019s bigger than sliced bread.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina couldn\u2019t disagree with her friend, it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m thinking while Miss Perfect is showering,\u201d Ali replied placing a hand on her hip. \u201cWe could explore this mansion, what ya think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think we could use some time away from each other,\u201d Fontina answered. \u201cAnd a walk does sound nice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her sopping wet daisy dukes squished as they, along with her undies socks and jacket hit the bathroom floor, leaving her completely naked already as she readied her bathtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into the bathtub and turned on the faucet, the chilly water gushing from the faucet splashing up against her naked body sent shivers down her spine. Looking upwards from the water release, Midnight saw the handy faucet toggle and pulled until the icy water started coming out the higher nozzle. Standing upright, Midnight took the time to gingerly fold her clothes and leave them on the camode, hoping to kill some time for the water to become bearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck one slender finger past the curtain, just past lukewarm. \"Jeez, talk about slow...\" Midnight complained inwardly, crossing her arms underneath her tanned busom. The Mightyena moemon impatiently tapped her foot in disdain for the rusty pipes of the mansion to do their jobs- Oh wait, that was steam rising from the tub! Slowly, the tanned beauty stepped into the clawed porcelain tub and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" she moaned, it felt so good to get out of the cold and step into this shower! The jets hissed as more and more heated water fell on top of Midnight's already soaking figure. She would wait a minute before grabbing the bar of soap, relishing in the lovely warmth that dripped over her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Midnight grabbed a prepositioned bar of soap and a washcloth, tenderly massaging her chilled breasts with the warm fuzzy cloth...<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"Now <i>that</i> was a shower!\" she beamed, kicking the bathroom door open in her usual rowdy fashion. She had quickly made due with a robe left hanging on the towel rack, using said towel as a turban to keep her hair dry. \"Hello~o?\" she chimed about the empty room, \"Guys?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed, immediately jumping to conclusions as usual, \"They must have gone off without me; just like they always do!\" she barked to a nonexistant audience as she aired out her sopping outfit, \"Fine, suits me, I'll just wait right here for them to come back- chubbo said something about maps in the hallways, so we can all meet up back here and I can give 'em a piece of my mind!!\" she growled as she pulled up her cutoffs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, she shoved her sleeve in the leather jacket (ignoring the fact that the fabric inside was still far too wet to be worn comfortably) and plopped onto the bed and waited patiently for their return...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH!!\" she roared not a minute later, \"I'M SO MAD!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that final note Midnight stormed out the doorway, her anger and impatience driving her to sniff out her friends and give them a good thrashing, rather than do the logical thing and just wait for them there...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was one thing that Midnight had to say, that this mansion was very impressive and was very big. Although those two facts were very true, they still didn\u2019t trump the feeling that was coursing through the young Mightyena Moemon\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Where the hell did those two morons get to?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired beauty continued her trek, allowing her still wet clothes to dry as she stepped through the poorly lit hallways. Each step that Midnight took however seemed to throw more fuel on the fire that was Midnight\u2019s anger. If she was in a calm state of mind, then she would\u2019ve noticed the paintings that were hanging on the walls in the hall. In a sense, they still depicted the same Moemon from earlier, only this time they seemed a bit\u2026 Thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this just went over Midnight\u2019s head as she continued her trek through the large mansion, grumbling under her breath. Too bad she didn\u2019t pay attention to where she was walking, and eventually found herself lost in the huge mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she cared at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-________________________-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, where the hell am I?\u201d Midnight asked to no one in particular as she leered at one of the many maps that was stationed in mansion. \u201cHow in the world did I get over here? Where the heck is my room? And why is there a Banana Republic listing on here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll very good questions, too bad Midnight didn\u2019t take the time to really learn those answers when she was in a terrible rage. \u2018This is all because of Ali and Fontina! Where the hell did they go anyway and why did they just leave me behind?! Although, I suppose I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised, they always pull this kind of crap! And another thing, I\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when something hit Midnight\u2019s nose, an all too familiar and sweet smell that immediately dosed that anger in her head and made Midnight grin. It was a smell that she was all too familiar with, the sweet, sweet smell of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCHOCOLATE!\u201d Midnight cheered to herself, after making sure that no one was around. And without a second thought, Midnight began to follow the smell, using her slightly superior sense of smell to lead her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne secret that Midnight kept from her two teammates was her greatest weakness \u2013 An endless love for chocolate, and this sweet tooth she had ever since she was a little Poochyena Moemon. She would do almost anything for a bite of chocolate, but in order to keep her amazing figure, she had to limit what chocolate she ate. Of course, that wouldn\u2019t mean that she wouldn\u2019t sneak a quick bite or a chocolate binge (which is what she used her money to buy instead of preparing for the weather like her companions).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Midnight came across a room that almost any idiot could identify \u2013 The kitchen, which was just as impressive as the rest of the mansion. It was actually more futuristic with brush steel tools and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlah, blah, blah,\u201d Midnight said out loud as she walked through the clean kitchen in her search for chocolate. \u201cNow, where\u2019s that chocolate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Midnight to find her target, for on one of the counters was a large plate of steaming chocolate chip cookies \u2013 which were all roughly the size of about a CD. Midnight licked her lips when she saw the large bits of chocolate that were practically oozing out of the cookies. \u201cHmm, I am a guest here in this house, so it\u2019s only reasonable that I should be able to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight didn\u2019t finish her justification before she ran to the plate, snatched up a single cookie, and chomped down on it. Almost immediately, her taste buds went into overdrive and stars appeared in the young Mightyena Moemon\u2019s eyes! It was the best chocolate that Midnight had ever had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, Midnight had polished off that first cookie, \u201cAh! That was awesome! The rich really do get better perks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from the batch of cookies, Midnight struggled to prevent herself from snatching another\u2026 Too bad it was a losing battle\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more can\u2019t hurt\u2026 Or maybe two more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Midnight kept one eye on the cookies while using the other to scan the room for intruders. Slowly, her fingers crept up to the plate and snatched another flakey confection. Taking a rather large bite out of it, she chewed slowly so as to savor the taste flooding into her mouth. \"Man these're good!\" she raved, taking another chunk out of her prize. The Mighteyena girl, feeling comfortable enough with herself, decided to plunder the fridge for something to wash it down with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping two fingers gripped tightly around her snack, Midnight slowly scanned the fridge for milk. \"Hmm... now where-\" she cut herself off, unable to go without chocolate long enough to finish her sentence, \"coohd id be?\" she finished with a mouthful of masticated cookie. Lowering her upper body deeper into the fridge, our heroine continued to nose her way through the refridgeration unit while hapilly munching away on her cookie, generous rump stuck straight up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fiddled with a drawer on the lowermost part of the fridge clearly labeled 'milk', only to find that it was locked. \"Well this blows.\" she growled, ignoring the set of chocolate fingerprints she left on the handle, \"How am I supposed to eat cookies without milk?\" she gruffly lamented, standing erect now with one hand on her hip indignantly. She took another bite and shoved what remained in her mouth, \"Dere'sh gohtta be a key shumwere...\" she swallowed, eyes travelling over to the cubbards, \"In there maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing another cookie off the plate on her way by, Midnight swaggered over to the cubbards. Her searching may have been more effective if she would have used both hands. \"Dammit...\" she nibbled on the sides of her cookie (one stray chocolate chip marred the sides, she couldn't have <i>that</i>), \"Now where is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key?\" a soft voice cut off Midnight's monolouge, causing the sexy moemon to nearly jump out of her cutoffs. It belonged to a rather Wigglytuff moemon, one with a baby face and  a prodigious belly billowing out from his waist. \"Oh, uh...\" she stammered, having been caught with gooey brown hands rummaging through the kitchen, \"Yeah.\" The moemon, presumed to be the chef judging by his smock, smiled knowingly, \"Top lefthand cubbard, and <i>that</i> key is taped inside the dishwasher.\" the young man lifted up a portion of his belly blubber to reveal a keyring, \"Or it was until I found where Shera hid it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight smiled as he waddled over to the row of cubbards, standing on his tiptoes to unlock the obviously modified tumbler. 'I can see why she hid them, chunks...' Midnight snickered to herself as she watched his belly fold over the counter top. \"Thanks a lot, but how did you know I wanted milk?\" Midnight asked, now perfectly content to let fatso here break out the milk as she leaned against the counter and munched on another cookie. \"It's alright, we all get those cravings every now and then.\" he said calmly, bending down to fiddle with the lock, ('some more than others apparantly') \"But we don't all leave chocolate fingerprints on the drawers, it's fine though.\" he grunted as he stood erect with the desired dairy product, \"I've left my share too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight bit into her cookie boredly, not all to interested in who this guy was or what he had to say about her leaving fingerprints everywhere. \"Yeah, thanks.\" she said curtly, lumbering around the room in search for a glass. Settling on some that looked clean enough in the sink, she let the Wigglytuff moemon fill hers up as she started again on her delicious chocolatey confection. \"So, you really like chocolate chips, huh?\" he asked, grabbing one for himself as he attempted to make small talk with the new guest. Immediately she started to leer at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" she spat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's all over your fingers, my kitchen, and the corners of your mouth.\" he chuckled as he took a swig of milk for himself. Midnight wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and sure enough, there on her tan skin was a smudge of chocolate. \"Shut up.\" she chuckled. \"I'm Wester.\" the Wigglytuff moemon laughed. \"Midnight, I'm staying here for the night while the storm clears up.\" she answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, then you'll get to stay for dinner!\" Wester said excitedly, hefting his fat body from the counter and waddling over to the onion, \"Roast Duck and Stuffing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight raised one of her black brows, \"Roast Duck, rich people really eat that stuff?\" she asked, \"It does sound pretty good though...\" she touched her stomach lightly, which was pretty full up from her innocent snack of \"just one cookie\" Wester grabbed an oven mitt and reached inside the firebox, touching up some arrangements that went unseen from Midnight's angle, \"Go ahead, pull up a chair and wait, it'll be done in  a little bit.\"</span></div></div>",

She certainly didn\u2019t want Ali to get on her tail about being a butterball. \u201cThanks, but no thanks Wester. I gotta go find the rest of my crew. Knowing those two, they\u2019re probably lost somewhere in this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Wester sighed as he drooped his head slightly. \u201cWell, in that case, may I suggest that you bring some of those sweets to your friends? I heard from Shera that you three were out in the rain, and something sweet would probably do wonders for your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight grimaced slightly as she watched Wester scoop up quite a few of the remaining cookies (roughly, he packed about fifteen more) into a paper bag. \u201cSure, that\u2019d great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that if she took those cookies from Wester, then there was no way that they\u2019d make it to her two companions.

But instead, here she was, sitting amongst a large pile of dusty old books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that Fontina knew that there was library in the mansion the Vaporeon Moemon dragged Ali to the room and had begun her search for knowledge. Normally, Fontina was quiet and usually agreed with what the others wanted to do\u2026 Unless there was something to do with books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Fontina would break out of her shy shell and become a book fanatic, practically getting absorbed in her literature, there was a few times that because of this that the group had to stay in a town for longer than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least with the weather outside, the team was going to lose days anyway but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWOW! FIRST EDITION!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli sighed as she watched Fontina dash from shelf to shelf, and each time she added another book to her arms. Normally, Ali would be more than happy to cater to Fontina\u2019s desire for knowledge since she hardly was able to do anything for herself. But with the storm and Midnight\u2019s attitude, Ali\u2019s resolve was thinning quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, jumping from the seat of books she was on, Ali decided that she would go on her own tour\u2026 Or at the very least try to find the kitchen in an attempt to find something that would quell her stomach\u2019s groans.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Apparantly, the heating units installed on the first and second floor were deemed adequate enough to heat the whole house long before the third floor was even constructed. Luckilly enough, Ali was a fire-type Moemon, so her suffering was minimal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, she could still see her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brr... it's freezing up here!\" she shivered, pulling the rolled up sleeves on her hoodie down to her wrists and bundling up in the oversized jacket. \"Why's it have to be so c-cold?!\" Her knees buckled and her teeth chattered, the vast outer cold triumphing over the fire that lay naturally in her belly. Even her short black hair seemed frozen to her face, especially since coming straight from the horrible weather outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, complaining did her little good; either way her tiny frame wasn't properly insulated for the harsh conditions of the third floor, fire type or not. She turned around, dead set on heading back downstairs where the temperment was moderate to warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the young Quilava moemon shivered down the hallway in an attempt to backtrack the way she came. Or, at least the way she <i>thought</i> she came. Apparantly she took a wrong turn somewhere, because she wasn't any closer to the stairwell than when she turned around! Defeated, she hung her head low and turned back around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to wind up even more lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli panicked, she could hear her little heart beating in her flat chest as the anticipation grew higher and higher. Thoughts flooded her head; \"What if I never get out of here?\" \"What if one of these maids is a murder?!\" \"WHAT IF THEY'RE ALL MURDERERS?!\" \"This is how I'm going to die, isn't it?!\" But she shook them off, shifting gears until her little legs were carrying her at top speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way she was gonna freeze to death up here, no way she was going to just give up and die when there were so many more adventures to have with Fontina (and Midnight, when she wasn't a pain) the fire within burned brightly as she continued down the dimly lit, identical hallways in a fruitless attempt to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oomph!\" a sugar-sweet voice cried as Ali ran into something soft and jiggly. It was a Dewgong moemon, and one of the biggest moemon Ali had ever seen at that! Covered all over in thick fat, this thick cream beauty queen was a sight to behold with her silver locks cascading down to the floor, pale icy skin unblemished or marred in any way and looking very much like snow, albei stuffed into a double-x-l maid's uniform. Her big blue eyes stared down at Ali's. Innocently the large woman started to giggle, sending her pillowy stomach (acting as Ali's makeshift airbag currently) ajiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE DON'T MURDER ME!!\" Ali cowered, jumping back from the marshmallowy woman's billowing belly in her initial shock and recoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh aren't you just the cutest little thing?\" she cooed, \"Are you lost, little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT LITTLE!!\" Ali roared, forgetting her initial fear of the dark upper level, \"I'M JUST VERTICALLY CHALLENGED!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dewgong Moemon stifled an amused giggle, \"Oh I'm sorry, I was told we'd be having guests, I take it you're one of them?\" Ali snorted, looking up at the massive woman sorely, \"Yeah, I'm staying with my friends; why's it so flippin' cold up here?\" she asked indignantly, now feeling the goosebumps crawl back up her legs. \"Is it?\" the woman was obviously either suffering from hypolthermia or a complete airhead, \"I never really noticed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Probably all that thick fat...'</i> Ali muttered under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What was that?\" the maid moemon leaned in closer, \"O-Oh nothing!\" Ali jumped back, \"S-So how about we get out of here; preferrably somewhere warm?\" again she looked bubbleheaded, \"But it's warm enough up here, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU COMPLETELY DELIERIOUS?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of shouting back, the Dewgong moemon merely curtsey politely (revealing some creamy white thigh blubber stuffed into some stockings) and cross her hands in a very ladylike fashion that rested atop her porminent stomach. \"No, I'm Clair but it's very nice to meet you.\" Ali blinked, not entirely sure how to respond to such a bubbleheaded question, \"Er... Ali, and I wasn't asking if that was your name, I was just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I just felt a chill!\" Claire said excitedly, \"Why don't we find somewhere a little warmer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SUGGESTING THIS WHOLE TIME!!\" Ali barked, \"AND HOW DID YOU ONLY JUST NOW FEEL A CHILL?!</span></div></div>",

Almost immediately, Ali\u2019s eyes widened when she took a whiff of that smell, and her stomach growled loudly, reminding the young Quilava Moemon of the very reason why she had trekked the mansion after leaving Fontina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as your stomach just suggested,\u201d Claire giggled as she stepped to the side, her large body sloshing at the same time. \u201cAnd since you were complaining about the cold, I figured the best way to cure that would be to get something warm in your stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire gestured to Ali to look into the room, but she was still a little unsure about the larger Moemon\u2019s intentions, so, keeping her distance, Ali peered into the room and her eyes grew even wider at the sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room there were several boxes (roughly about thirty or so) each with a familiar logo labeled on them \u2013 It was the logo for the region\u2019s biggest producers of baked goods \u2013 Swinub Sweets. \u201cW-What the?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the staff lounge,\u201d Claire explained as she began to push Ali into the room, using only her mammoth gut to easily push the smaller girl into the room. \u201cThis place is where the staff likes to relax on break or the master is away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But what\u2019s with all the baked goods?\u201d Ali asked, trying not to drool at the sight of them all \u2013 Swinub Sweets were known to be the best in the region, but were deathly expensive because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you see, every day the master likes to import some of the best sweets for his staff,\u201d Clair explained as she opened up one of the boxes. \u201cBut he forgot to lower the order while he was away, so, we have an excess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Claire produced a rather large bear claw donut, instantly making Ali gulp and look at it with envious eyes, \u201cFeel free to help yourself, they\u2019ll just go to waste if no one eats them, little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well if you put it that way,\u201d Ali replied as she gingerly took the bear claw. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a little girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire only giggled at Ali\u2019s protest, and watched as Ali brought the bear claw up to her mouth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 And the moment that Ali\u2019s tongue touched the donut, tears appeared in the corners of her eyes, \u201cS-So good\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Ali to immediately down that bear claw and immediately ran to another box, looking for another sweet. All the while, Claire helped herself to a donut as well, watching as Ali began to rummage through the large box of donuts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seating herself on the floor near the rest of the books she had scoured from the shelves, Fontina began to read the text out loud. \u201cTo whom it may concern\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Do not read this text for the things you read are not a work of fiction but are based on true facts. In this mysterious world of ours, curses are real \u2013 Quite contrary to those who believe otherwise. From these first few pages on, you will be safe from whatever perils this book may entail, but do not read another page further for your own safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018P.S. <br>\r\nThank you for buying a copy of \u2018Heavy Consequences: Tales of Mythology and Vengeance of the Honen Region,\u2019 your contribution is greatly appreciated.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Signed, Author Maxwell Burton\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! What a clever writing strategy!\u201d Fontina exclaimed with a smile on her face. \u201cThe author makes the book a forbidden fruit and temps the reader to continue onwards by saying not to! I can tell that this is going to be a good read!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Fontina was about to turn the page however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOW!\u201d the Vaporeon Moemon yelped as she held up her finger, and immediately stuck it in her mouth. \u2018Stupid paper cuts!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Fontina was busy nursing her minor wound, she didn\u2019t realize that there was a weird glow that was basking the book. But, by the time she would\u2019ve noticed, the glow had disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-___________________________________________-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 And so to all those who have read these cursed tales,\u201d Fontina read aloud. \u201cI wish you the best of luck to you and those you are closest with. There are big things in your future, but not in the sense that you would realize it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the book, Fontina sighed loudly in joy, \u201cWhat a good read. Really just the thing a person needs on a rainy day is a good book to curl up with and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Fontina was about to continue, a loud growl echoed through the library, making Fontina blush when she realized that the growl didn\u2019t come from a feral beast, but rather her own tiny stomach. \u201cOh my, I-I wonder if that dinner that Shera promised is ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the book on her pile (in hopes of continuing her reading after dinner), Fontina began to head to exit, but as she did, she didn\u2019t notice that the book fell to the ground, sending a loose page from it onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe page read \u2013 \u201cWith a mark of crimson, the curse is complete. To those who bear this fate, your destiny will be laden with sweet. No matter how fast or strong ye be, this curse will make all of that a thing of the past. For with each calorie you take, for a fortnight it will last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd to those who travel with this cursed one, cut your ties before it\u2019s too late.

Without thinking, she took the first bite of her plunder while backtracking her finger's pointed positions on the map; the chocolate stains made it easy enough. \"So... if I take <i>this</i> hallway, <i>those</i> stairs, I should be near our room?\" she asked aloud, swallowing and chomping methodically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight was totally aware that she had already downed more than her share of cookies already, and frankly she didn't really care. She was lost, cold, and wearing poorly dried off clothes. While she would have liked to say no to these wonderful little bites of milk-chocolate heaven for the sake of beauty, she was an avid chocoholic before she was rational. And right now, she needed something to keep her preoccupied. It was either eat cookies or mouth off to her absent friends. More often than not it turned out to be both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, this is all because of my stupid ex-best-friends!\" she growled, nibbling furiously on her current snack, \"Ali<b>skank</b> and... and... oh screw it, it's all their faults!!\" Midnight roared as she stormed down the hallway, unable to come up with a suitable mockery for Fontina's fairly uncommon name. \"Well nerts to them, this means that <b>I</b> get all their cookies!\" she stuck out her slender pink tounge to no one, only to pull it back in as she polished off yet another treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean sherioushly, deshe're great!\" she cooed, squinting her eyes and smiling as she chomped away at the supposedly \"shared\" cookies, loaded with enough to fill up any normal three moemon with sugary sweetness. Midnight was far from the normal moemon. All throughout her self-guided tour the Mightyena moemon happilly munched away at her bounty; in the music room, dining room, the study, lounge, den, every room she meandered about in Midnight always had at least a bite of cookie in her mouth. She would really have to thank that Wester guy later if the storm didn't clear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached one lightly browned hand into the bag, only to discover that besides the one she was holding; there were only two left! \"W-Wow...\" she stammered, staring at the vast emptiness inside her bag, \"I-I knew I was breaking into Ali's share but I intended to leave some for Fontina!\" she gasped, lamenting over her last cookie sadly, \"I guess I better save them for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight?\" Fontina's voice broke the sililoquey abruptly, having suddenly popped out of the library and giving her travelling companion quite a fright in the process. Acting upon her natural instincts as an addict, she quickly removed and trace that remained of her binge. By eating it. Shoving the three remaining disks into her mouth, Midnight quickly choked them down and turned on her heels to face the aquatic moemon. \"O-Oh, hey F-Fontina!!\" she stuttered, face turning bright red in embarassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who were you talking to just now, and what's that in your mouth?\" the Vaporeon moemon eyed her friend laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No one, that's who; and mind your own damn business!\" she snapped, balling up the empty bag and silently tossing it behind her, \"A-And who are you to give me the third degree after you and Ali left me all alone in that scary dark room, huh?! I thought we were friends!\" she hissed venomously at her friend, only for her to stutter nervously in response, \"I-I'm sorry Midnight but you <i>were</i> taking a shower, we left you a note!\" she fibbed, knowing her hotheaded friend well enough to jump to a conclusion about her jumping to a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked. Midnight stammered, growing even redder as her face twisted into one of embarassment on confusion, \"I-I uh... Well I didn't get it!!\" she finally answered, heading opposite to where she threw her garbage, \"Now come on, I think I smell dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina giggled, satisfied with her innocent ruse as she tailed her Mighteyena friend. At the word 'dinner', something seemed to light up in Fontina's stomach, and she was more than eager to finally get something warm in her belly!</span></div></div>",

I was somewhat busy with a book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large drop of sweat rolled down the side of Midnight\u2019s head when she heard that, \u201cBooks, eh? That makes sense, you usually do get absorbed whenever you get a book in your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Fontina yelped with a blush on her face. \u201cI, I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 You\u2019ve never noticed before?\u201d Midnight questioned with a shake of her head. \u201cWhatever, look, I\u2019m not in the mood to try to find that washboard of a teammate of ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said she was looking for something to eat,\u201d Fontina pointed out. \u201cSo, she might be at the\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Midnight growled with a roll of her chocolate colored eyes (it was a bit of irony on her part). \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-______________________________________________________-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, and thanks to Midnight\u2019s keen nose, the two beautiful Moemon had arrived at the destination \u2013 An insanely large dinning hall that had lush red carpet and beautiful wooden walls. And in the middle of the large room was a long table that had several types of delicious foods that were lined on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Midnight and Fontina were in awe (Midnight was a little worried about her slightly full stomach) of the mighty meal, so much that they didn\u2019t realize the other three people in the room\u2026 At least until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Girls! Perfect timing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Midnight and Fontina jumped slightly when a familiar plump face appeared before them \u2013 Shera with a warm smile on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time for dinner, and it was just brought out! I hope you two have an appetite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, S-Shera,\u201d Fontina muttered with a cold sweat rolling down the side of her head. \u201cW-What\u2019s with this meal? I-It looks like it\u2019s for twenty people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we usually do have twenty people here,\u201d Shera explained as she gestured to the side, revealing that there were two more people in the room, both of them seated at the table. \u201cBut Wester\u2019s gotten used to making large meals, so, we\u2019ve been having quite a few leftovers. But enough about that, you two must meet the other two who are here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to the right, Shera pointed out to another Moemon in the room, this one (unlike most of the other staff members in the mansion) was actually quite sleek and thin. He had long white hair (with a streak of purple on the side) that covered up the left side of his rather handsome face. With his legs up on the table, the Moemon revealed that his sleek figure was dressed in a white butler\u2019s outfit with classy black shoes. At the sight of him, Midnight\u2019s heart skipped a beat \u2013 He was an Absol Moemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWalker, please say hello to our guests,\u201d Shera requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Absol Moemon merely sighed as he waved his hand up through the air towards the two girls, without speaking a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well, Walker\u2019s not much of a talker,\u201d Shera sighed before she turned to her left. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got our own spark of life in here as well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost impressive to see the other Moemon bounding up to Fontina and Midnight, even odder was the fact that she was shorter than both of them (roughly Ali\u2019s height) and was dressed in a manner that resembled that of Shera\u2019s outfit \u2013 Cept for the fact that if it was on anyone else, it would look like a huge blanket since it was roughly a triple XL version! She was basically a large butterball (how she was able to move quickly was a mystery) with deep tan, almost giving her a red tint on her skin which matched her dark crimson colored and curled hair. As stated, she was quite huge, and thanks to her height, she was almost a ball of blubber with two large breasts, a huge behind and a gut that looked like a slightly filled water balloon (which was ironic since she was a Vulpix Moemon). \u201cNICE TO MEET YOU ALL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis ball of energy is Ember,\u201d Shera introduced as the cute butter ball nodded her head several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S ALWAYS GOOD TO MEET PEOPLE!\u201d Ember laughed as she shook Fontina\u2019s hands and then made a shot towards Midnight\u2019s\u2026 Only to miss as the dark skinned beauty pulled them away. \u201cAw\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Ember,\u201d Shera explained as she pushed the smaller maid back to her seat. \u201cOur guests are tired and hungry, please go back to your seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe\u2026\u201d Ember moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan what is up with this mansion?\u201d Midnight muttered to Fontina, making sure no one could hear her. \u201cCept for that cutie Walker, everyone\u2019s a porker here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit concerning,\u201d Fontina replied with sheepish chuckle. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure we don\u2019t have to worry, now, hurry up and get to your seat. We don\u2019t wanna look rude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Midnight sighed as she began to walk over to Walker, a smirk on her face as her intentions were as clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Fontina was about to sit down, the doors opened once more, allowing Ali (who was clutching her stomach in what could be pain) being led by a large, doughy Dewgong Moemon Maid (Claire). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Claire, excellent timing!\u201d Shera announced as Ember climbed into her seat (which groaned loudly). \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got our final guest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli took one look at the food on the table and gulped as she held her stomach, but before she could get a word in, Claire giggled slightly, \u201cPoor little child was wandering on the third floor, so I gave her a small snack and we both headed straight here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Small?\u201d Ali asked with her eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s enjoy our meal with our guests!\u201d Shera announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Meal?\u201d Ali groaned as Claire pulled the stuffed looking Quilava Moemon to a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina looked a little concerned for her friend, but Midnight on the other hand was keeping her eyes on Walker\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their guests were not as refined, to say the least. Save for Fontina, the group was loud, boistrous and rude. On several instances talking with their mouths full and even starting a small arguement over which hair care product worked better, resulting in dirty looks and threats to settle things after dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one could see those two hellraisers now, that undoubtedly violent settlement would obviously be overlooked for tonight; as they had made true pigs out of themselves this evening. It would be a miracle if any of them could carry their ready-to-blow stomachs upstairs at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...\" all three of the moemon groaned from their seated positions at the table. Ali, farthest away from her group on the lefthand side next to Ember, clutched her aching middle as the devoured food took it's vengance upon her digestive system. Midnight, sitting directly across from Shera on the left, was already quite wary of her waistline due to her earlier chocolate binge; absolutely <i>refusing</i> to unbutton her cutoff jeans while that hottie mctottie butler could see her. Fontina on the other hand was having very different troubles, ones that involved getting adequate oxygen to her lungs while struggling to digest all the great food she had just inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never.\" Ali grunted, giving up and unbuckling her belt attachment, \"Eating. Again.\" she groaned. \"Oh, so you're not gonna eat that-\" Ember was cut off as Ali shot a death glare past her. \"Fine. Eating. Once.\" she mumbled, finding Ember's touchy attitude towards her plate somewhat insulting. As she swallowed that last morsel, her tummy cried out in pain. \"Are you sure, this roasted duckie looks mighty tasty!\" Ember chanted childishly  as she grabbed what remained of the roast duck in the center of the table (to \"dispose of\"), reaching past her swollen gut causing her upper body to wobble in her uniform, \"Please. Don't talk. Anymore. Ever.\" Ali managed before giving into the pressure, fully undoing one notch on her skirt now. \"So full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her reclined position at the table, Midnight's slender fingers rubbed her distended tummy fruitlessly, the intense pain not leaving her slender beautiful body. What made it worse was that everyone could see how swollen she was underneath the silvery, reflective top she had chosen; her abdomen looked like the top of a disco ball! \"Urp.\" she belched quietly, looking around to see if anyone noticed anything, \"Oh crap, did sweet cheeks Walker hear that?!\" the black haired Mightyena moemon whispered as she nudged her blue haired counterpart with her elbow; unfortunately right in the poor girl's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez...\" Fontina felt blue in the face, she almost couldn't breath. It was true that she had a killer figure with almost all body fat placed <i>very</i> strategically, but her meek appetite was nowhere near that of Ali's or Midnight's. She fiddled with a button on her white blouse, sighing lightly as she finally relieved some intense pressure on her middle. \"That feels... excellent...\" she let out a puff of air, usual skin color returning to her face slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that surely was an... eventful meal!\" Shera chirped from her seat, \"Girls, if you would like some pajamas to change into after you wash up before bed, I'd be glad to assist you.\" she said merrilly; moving with little to no extra difficulty despite having ingested the exact same amount of food as Fontina. 'Probably used to it, cow.' Midnight chuckled. Karma soon took action as her giggling sent a wave of pain radiating up and down her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds... great.\" Ali grunted, \"You in Fontina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, lovely, thank you so-\" she stifled a polite little belch \"much Shera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not at all, it's my pleasure.\" the Kangashkan moemon smiled, \"And Ms. Midnight, will you be joining your friends in-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now. Thank you.\" Midnight huffed, watching conclusively as the gawdly hot Absol moemon made his way into the kitchen to clean up, \"Gotta score... man cake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh forget it kibble-brain.\" Ali quipped, struggling to stand and still teetering due to her new awkward balance, \"He's not... ugh... he's not going anywhere.\" the teensy moemon struggled to form the words. Midnight tried to rebute, come back with a one-liner, and even tried to get up by herself. But couldn't deliver on all three accounts. \"Yeah... you're right... help me up.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI must say, it was quite a lively dinner,\u201d Shera explained as she led the team through the hallways, a small bag filled with pajamas slung over her arm. \u201cI daresay you girls certainly brought life to this dreary mansion, you certainly remind me of the young master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera would\u2019ve gotten an answer from her guests, but Fontina and Ali were holding their stomachs, teetering on the brink of pain or a possible food coma. The only thing that Shera got was a pair of groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was weird, since there should\u2019ve been three groans\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was because Midnight had other things on her mind (other than the pain that was radiating from her stomach), she slowly crept into the kitchen watching as the handsome Walker was bringing the dishes to the plump Claire. Wester was no where in sight as Midnight watched from her hiding space, normally she would\u2019ve just confronted Walker, but after that dinner binge, Midnight\u2019s confidence wasn\u2019t the strongest at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she opted for just watching the Absol Moemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rarity for Midnight to find a handsome male Dark type Moemon, especially in her home town since most of the other local dark-types were related to her (she had a lot of brothers, sisters, and cousins), and other than a few other Dark-Types that she managed to \u2018hook up\u2019 with during her travels, she didn\u2019t opt for anything serious (of course, Fontina\u2019s older brother Noir was an Umbreon Moemon, and he was pretty easy on the eyes) \u2013 But for right now, all Midnight saw was the cute Walker\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Who was now heading right towards the exit of the kitchen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Alright,\u2019 Midnight thought as she zipped up her leather jacket, using it to help cover her slightly distended belly, and yet managed to zip it up just under her impressive bust. \u2018Time to use the good old Midnight charm, going to be hard, my sexy stomach isn\u2019t one of my weapons now.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Walker exited the kitchen, stopping when the Absol Moemon noticed Midnight leaning up against the wall, \u201c\u2026 What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight blinked a few times, Walker had a softer voice than she would\u2019ve figured, oh well, that just made him cuter. \u201cWalker, right? You seem to be different from the others here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust started working here,\u201d Walker simply stated, only keeping his head turned towards Midnight. \u201cAnd I work out\u2026 A lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hmm\u2026 Keeping that sexy body sleek, eh?\u2019 Midnight thought, sauntering up to Walker, making the Absol Moemon raise an eyebrow. \u201cSo, Walker, you ever think about traveling? You look like you\u2019d be quite the adventurer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d Walker replied in a dull tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, in fact,\u201d Midnight snickered as she wrapped an arm around Walker\u2019s shoulders. \u201cHow would you like to go on a fantastic adventure tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Walker answered, pulling away from Midnight to walk away. \u201cI have chores to complete.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight just stood there dumbfounded as she watched Walker walk out of the room, \u2018Was it my behavior at the dinner table? Was it my belch!? Or\u2026 Or could he not be into me?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-____________________________________________-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to escort Miss Midnight to your room when I find her,\u201d Shera offered as she handed Fontina the bag of pajamas. \u201cYou two take a nice warm bath and get some rest. If the storm lets up in the morning, then you\u2019ll all need to be well rested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right,\u201d Fontina replied as Shera closed the door behind her. \u201cWell now Ali, s-shall we\u2026 Is something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on the bed, Ali moaned loudly as she caressed her taut stomach, \u201cOoogh, too much\u2026 W-Way too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Ali,\u201d Fontina said as she winced at her own tight stomach. \u201cWe need to get washed up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Water and me\u2026\u201d Ali groaned\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this wasn\u2019t going to be an argument, Ali was being pulled off the bed by Fontina and being dragged on the floor heading towards the bathroom. \u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, thanks to her stuffed body, Ali couldn\u2019t fight Fontina from dragging her into the bath\u2026</span></div></div>",

But no, Fontina insisted that she bathe first. Ali reminded her constantly, \"Water and me don't mix, water and me don't mix!\" but her pleas were ignored. The hydrophobic moemon had been submerged into the warm waters of the clawfooted tub in a seated position. Too stuffed to even think straight; let alone bathe herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pale skin was flawless save for a birthmark on her back, and she was quite toned. The steam from the heated stew brushed against her chin and some was caught underneath her black bangs. Her usually bright eyes seemed glazed somewhat as she reclined at the edge of the tub, staring off into nothingness as the pain worked its way through her body. Her stomach, strong and fit, was pushed outwards into a taut semisphere. At the slightest disturbance, the water around her would ripple and eventually hit her ticking timebomb belly and cause great pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...\" she moaned again, using one dry hand to subconciously touch the tender sphere on her middle, not even wincing at the intense waving pain that followed her slight touch. \"No one's gonna save you, if that's what your thinking.\" Fontina, just as tired and stuffed as her friend, broke the awkward silence throughout the bathroom, \"The sooner you finish up, the sooner you can get out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue haired moemon sat on the closed toilet seat lid, legs crossed precariously and flipping through a book she had packed just for such an occassion. Having undressed from her usual attire already, Fontina donned a two-piece pair of jammies with a white base and pink vertical stripes; proving a little too small for her volumptuous body as her generous curves more than filled the size-too-small outfit. However, she completely abandoned her big round glasses as they kept fogging up with steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna.\" Ali grunted defensively, \"I wanna stay right here and never move again. Not until I digest all that food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina giggled, \"That's not very good for your metabolism, Ali.\"</span></div></div>",

It was Ember, the runty little doughball of a moemon from dinner! Already completely nude, her body did a natural job of censorship as her big brown belly lapped over her crotch, anything indecent was covered in a thick creamy flubber that jiggled wildly as she rested her leg (used to literally kick in the door) \"Oh, hi everybody!\" she smiled innocently at the two, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!\" Ali shot up and immediately covered her practically non-existant breasts, sending horrible stomach pains up and down her body and causing the water to rustle wildly. \"EMBER?!\" Fontina blushed as she noticed that the immense vulpix moemon was naked, \"W-WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?!\" she shouted. Ember's tripley chinned expression turned blank for a second before her wide grin reemmerssed itself onto her face, \"You can't take a bubble bath clothed, silly!\" she said loudly, taking it upon herself to waddle right into the middle of the lavatory. \"Oh, you want to take a bath together?\" she asked childishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Ali barked, \"NO I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE A BATH TOGETHER!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if not listening to Ali's obvious disdain for the idea, the rotund little woman laughed boistrously, \"Aw, but it'll be fun!!\" Ember giggled as she took her first step into the tub, \"We can wash eachother's backs!!\" Ali watched, still protecting her minimum curves, as the spherical moemon settled herself opposite to her. The minor inconveniance of the nozzle was ignored, as Ember's suffocating backfat swallowed the poor fixture as she leaned back in a seemingly comfortable position; thick doughy legs resting on top of Ali's and her jutting side rolls completely filling her side of the tub. The water, quite full already, poured out of the tub and into the floor with Ember's newly added mass. \"See, it's not so bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli and Fontina were shocked, appalled, and generally grossed out. Fontina because she had seen <i>much</i> more of this strange girl than she would have liked too, including a full shot of the big flabby back. And Ali for the exact same reason; except including that on top of everything, Ember's blubber was trying to eat her. Her toes, all soggy and pruney, just barely had enough elbow room to breath, and she could feel that big reddened gut resting heavilly on her poor appendages. Things were quiet between the three, and very awkward. Finally someone broke the silence:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So is this your first time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-First time doing what, exactly?!\" Fontina babbled, Ali could only respond with a, \"YEAH, FIRST TIME WHAT?!\" Ember giggled again, the lowermost chins resting on her breasts (it seemed she had no neck at this point in her obesity) warbling around lightly. \"Group bathing!\" Ember answered ecstatically, \"I <b>always</b> come in here for Group-Bathing-Saturday!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina stuttered, \"Has anyone ever actually come to <i>join</i> you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Group Bathing?!\" Ali hollered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably not hearing the obvious protests, Ember reached for a washcloth and some soap. \"Here, lemme show you Short Guest!\" before Ali could rebute, a wonderful sensation filled her belly. Her fellow fire type seemed very handy with a soapy rag; as she rubbed it up and down in a vertical fashion, the expected pain never arrived. What occured was a lovely, somewhat tensing experience...<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"Okay, see you next week Group Bathers!!\" Ember waved as she waddled out the door (still naked, mind you) and slammed the door shut behind her. The freshened up, somewhat disturbed, pair of Ali and Fontina stood blankly; not even able to reciprocate her goodbye before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Fontina...\" a now much better Ali peeped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said that she came in here every week for Group Bathing, didn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Fontina agreed glumly, eyes blank and half opened behind her glasses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if we're here for that long you think we should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully we won't be here that long, but yes we should seriously consider switching rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow dressed in matching pajamas, although Ali's fit much more loosely than Fontina's, the two were completely ready for bed. Just as soon as they could push the grotesque, flab filled images out of their minds. \"Ready for bed?\" Fontina turned to Ali, life returning to the grimacing Vaporeon moemon. \"Yeah sure, why not?\" Ali shrugged, \"I'm either gonna dream I'm drowning or suffocating either way tonight so why not just get it over with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the bedroom, the two heard the door slam; it was Midnight, fashionably late as usual. \"Where the hell were <i>you</i>?!\" Ali barked, \"We could have <i>used</i> you to fight off Ms. Touchy-Feely in the tub!\" Midnight shot Ali a glare, ferociously shoving some chocolate comfort food into her maw, \"Back off, I've had a long night!\" she growled, chewing madly on her recent acquisation from Wooster's kitchen. The rebel without a man slammed the door into the adjoining bedroom, leaving her two companions alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH WELL I'VE HAD A <b>SHORT</b> NIGHT!!\" Ali shouted back, \"SHORT AND <i>FAT</i>!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share a bed dear?\" Fontina teased her fiery friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's.\" Ali sighed, smiling at her aquatic friend</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a few hours since the whole bathing incident occurred, roughly about two a.m. to be specific, and ever since Midnight cursed herself to sleep, the night was quiet, save for the occasional crack of thunder, but even through that, our favorite trio was able to sleep soundly for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight had one of the two beds in the room to herself, and was twisting and turning in her sleep. On the other bed, Ali and Fontina were sleeping, back to back, however the younger Quilava Moemon was shivering slightly every now and then, not out of being cold, but rather because of the nightmares that a certain butterball of a Moemon had caused her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Fontina, well, she was sleeping the best, now that the fullness in her stomach had finally subsided. Yet, there was a tight feeling that seemed to covered her entire form. However, that pristine sleep shattered when the latest thunder bolt snapped through the air, causing the slightly curvy Moemon\u2019s eyes to snap open. \u201cAh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning loudly Fontina began to sit up in the bed, making sure that while she grabbed her glasses that she wouldn\u2019t disturb Ali or Midnight. \u201cThat\u2019s weird\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to one of the windows, Fontina pulled the curtains to the side, blinking a few times at the sight of the very same storm that had forced the team to the mansion in the first place. Not only was the storm not getting weaker, Fontina could even swear that the storm itself wasn\u2019t even moving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u2019 Fontina thought to herself as she continued to look at the storm, running her hand to her chin to rub it. \u2018I know that some storms would be able to clear up in a few hours, but it should\u2019ve at least cleared up a little bit. Maybe I should check the weather channel in the morning to make sure that this storm will clear up.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight sigh, Fontina knew she wasn\u2019t going to be able to get any sleep, so, heading towards the restroom, the Vaporeon Moemon decided to splash some water on her face and maybe read another one of the books that she had taken from the library. At the very least, if the storm didn\u2019t clear up in the morning, Fontina would be able to get some rest before the trio left the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind her and flicking on the light, Fontina headed for the sink and stopped when she looked in the mirror \u2013 Realizing something seemed off, although Fontina had a slightly cherubic face, she couldn\u2019t help but notice that there seemed to be a little extra curve to her face, nothing too noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Fontina looked down, noticing that the tight pajamas that Shera had provided her seemed a bit different before she went to sleep. The buttons on the top seemed to strain quite a bit more, even showing a bit of skin in between the gaps. Because of that, the pajama top was raised a little bit over her stomach, which was oozing a little bit over the waist band of her pajama bottoms, giving her the beginnings of a muffin top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little psyched out, Fontina slowly reached behind her and grabbed her thighs and behind. They were soft, which was normally not too strange, but there seemed to be more to grab than usual. And the fact that the waist band on the pajama bottoms were actually cutting into her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW\u2026 Wh\u2026 What the?!\u201d Fontina gasped as she staggered away from the mirror. With a loud gulp, Fontina began to run some water into the sink and immediately splashed some water into her face \u2013 Hoping that this was just some weird dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad it wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I know I ate a big meal,\u201d Fontina muttered shaking her face free of water as she put the glasses on her face. \u201cBut, it\u2026 It shouldn\u2019t be able to do this much damage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Fontina calmed herself down, \u201cThere\u2019s a logical explanation for this\u2026 There has to be!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, you were cursed, remember that book?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Fontina nodded to herself, knowing what she had to do. In the morning, she would try to go for a walk around the mansion, if she kept active, then it was a given that she\u2019d be able to at least keep the wait down until the group headed out from the mansion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was morning now, and the mansion seemed just barely more alive than it did last night. With the same dim lighting conditions and lack of sunshine, everything had a certain layer of gray to coat it's natural color. Except for large rooms like the dining hall, which were equipped with more than their fair share of candles and electronic lighting, the attitude was dull and dreary. Luckilly enough, all the most fun rooms were lightly lit and attractive; <i>especially</i> the dining hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to hide her mysteriously acquired curves, Fontina had rummaged through the drawers in the room to find some workout attire. She had settled on a white hoodie and baggy blue sweats, both of which were far too big on the moemon's figure, even now. And while everyone was eating, our self concious little Vaporeon moemon had opted out of the gorgeous breakfast laid out in front of her... just the sight of everyone's food made her poor stomach growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for another meal in this strange new mansion, now serving breakfast, and everyone in employment had joined our three heroines at the dinnertable for a scrumptious brekkie. \"Sho whash wit da shweats, Fondina?\" Ali turned to her companion, talking through her current mouthful. \"Jeah, it looksh...frumpy.\" Midnight concurred as she took a large chomp out of a bagel. \"N-None of your business, thank you!!\" Fontina said indignantly, her usually pale skin turning quite pink as she was given the third degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina, usually kind and caring in regards to her friends and their wellbeing, was fretting far too much over her figure to notice the subtle differences in both Midnight and Ali's. Take for instance the slightly pooching belly that swelled out ever so slightly from underneath the Mighteyena girl's silvery top, or how the rolled up black sleeves of Ali's hoodie seemed to dig into flesh that mysteriously materialized over night on the young Quilava moemon's skin. In short, Fontina wasn't the only one with a little extra pudge to go around, no matter how small it may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room, the hired help seemed unchanged. Shera's plump tummy still lapped slightly over her belt, but no more so than usual. Claire's wide wobbling body proved flabby, but no more flabbier than last night. Walker's lithe form went unchanged and it was hard to imagine Ember being even fatter! But it was the way they ate, so reserved and mannered, that seemed to contradict their gluttonous and hoggish outer appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same could not be said of Fontina's no-class companions, who had once again lost themselves in the fancy cuisine. \"Oh man!!\" Ali burped slightly as she wiped a little syrup from the corners of her mouth, \"This stuff never gets old; I could eat french toast all day!\" Strangely enough, neither she nor Midnight seemed aware of their slightly distorted figures, or if they did they certainly hid it well. Either way, watching them shovel down more and more food into their mouths... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was making Fontina nauseatingly hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was known within her circle of friends to always be on some sort of crazy diet, since she always overreacted to the slightest amount of pudge that latched onto her body. But for the first time, her diet seemed proportionate to the cause; gaining five, maybe ten pounds in one night was definately a cry for a dietician. But since she <i>certainly</i> wasn't going to find one here in this house of chub, maybe- hey, wait a second, how did Walker manage to stay so slender? Maybe she had better look into his dietary plan later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me.\" Fontina said abrupty, standing up from the table, \"I-I'm going to, uh, use the bathroom.\" she lied, speed-walking out of the dining hall.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a rather large breakfast (which for some reason didn\u2019t seem to have the same effect on Midnight or Ali like dinner the night before) Ali and Midnight stood in front of the doors to the large dinning hall. Although they weren\u2019t in pain like the aftermath of dinner, they still had slightly bulging stomachs, and Ali held a small bag in her hands, \u201cI\u2019m a little worried about Fontina, she\u2019s kinda been acting weird this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeh,\u201d Midnight shrugged with a shake of her head. \u201cYou know how she is, pipsqueak, she probably got a little self-conscious about eat a lot last night, and figures if she skips a meal or two, she\u2019ll be back on one of those diets she\u2019s always on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but still,\u201d Ali muttered before she narrowed her eyes. \u201cHey! You insulted me during that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook ya long enough to notice, washboard,\u201d Midnight laughed loudly with a large toothy grin. \u201cAlthough, if you keep snacking on leftovers, you might not be so flat\u2026 And not in the good way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli grumbled under her breath as she held up the bag, \u201cThis isn\u2019t for me! It\u2019s for Fontina! It\u2019s not right to skip meals, besides, doing that will just lower your metabolism!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Ali began to storm off into the mansion, in high hopes of finding Fontina and finding out what was wrong with her friend. Midnight on the other hand, well, she was aiming for something that seemed a bit more difficult\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking that cold (yet attractive) demeanor of a certain Absol Moemon Butler, and getting herself\u2026 Well, we\u2019d go on, but then this story would have to be re-rated just to tell you the things that Midnight wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, adjusting her silver top to have it show a bit more of her healthy cleavage (which seemed to be a little bit more healthy this morning) and using the lower half to hide her stomach (which was probably the reason why Walker wasn\u2019t interested yesterday), Midnight opened the doors to the dinning hall slightly to peer in \u2013 And once again, luck was on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor standing in the large dinning hall, all alone, was Walker, simply cleaning the long table. \u2018Alright, I won\u2019t fail this time!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure that she was a little bit quieter this time, Midnight slowly sneaked into the room, making sure that Walker didn\u2019t sense her presence at all. If the subtle approach didn\u2019t work with this Moemon, then Midnight would just try a different tactic \u2013 A sneak attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, so good, the closer that Midnight crept towards the Absol Moemon, the quieter she became, going so far as to hold her breath. And when she was just about a few inches away from her target\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Why hello there, Walker!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Absol Moemon could react, Midnight had snatched Walker\u2019s right arm, pulling his arm with both of hers and positioning his small bicep right in between her healthy breasts (Which was easier since Midnight had elected not to wear her bra this morning, hoping to use that to her advantage). For a moment, Walker froze up when he saw where his arm was being held, a small twinge of red appearing on his face. \u201c\u2026 Morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed it is,\u201d Midnight cooed as she pressed more of her sexy body onto Walker\u2019s. \u201cListen, yesterday I kinda got lost in this huge mansion, and I was wondering if you could give me a tour of the place? Just you and me, perhaps we could start with a nearby closet or even some of the bedrooms and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want a tour,\u201d Walker swiftly replied as he jerked his arm free, surprising the other dark-type Moemon. \u201cThen I can arrange something to have one of the others to help you with that. I have too much work to deal with today, and if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to finish it before noon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight just stood there dumbfounded as Walker once again ignored her attempts to hit on him and watched as the sexy piece of man cake she had her eyes on, simply walk out of the room, closing the doors behind him in the process. \u201cWhat the hell is his problem!? I practically throw myself at him and he just brushes me off!? What sort of guy does that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sexy! I\u2019ve got an rockin\u2019 bod and a face anyone would kill for, so why won\u2019t he\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight stopped when a familiar smell lofted through the air and into her nostrils, it was a smell that she had recognized instantly since she smelled the same thing \u2013 The smell of ooey, gooey chocolate! \u201cHumph, maybe something sweet will be able to help me think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was hard to concentrate, finding that each victorian hallways seemed to mimic its predecessor in almost every aspect! Perhaps even worse, Ali's internal compass wasn't exactly tuned correctly to begin with ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\" Ali whimpered, ashamed of somehow managing to, yet again, mistrace her steps and wind up in a very familiar prediacament, \"I'm so lost...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sneakers tip-tapped on the carpet, rattling the old harwood floors underneath their shaggy cover, walking blindly in proverbial circles in a desperate attempt to find a friendly face. Or an unfriendly one, preferrably one that wasn't oil-based and suspended from the wall. the young moemon whimpered and shrunk into her signature hoodie, some of those old paintings were pretty creepy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the corner, Ali finally met a familiar (though unfriendly) face in Walker; that butler that Midnight had the hots for! Actually, he was pretty handsome, with his small yet somewhat elongated chin and his cute little nose, he was almost pretty enough to be... Ali shook out those thoughts, the absol moemon was probably gay or something; she knew that no straight moemon alive could resist Midnight's hot body. Now if it were her own washboard bod, Ali would be much more inclined to believe a lack of attraction, she couldn't help but look remorsefully down her shirt at her small (though, in all fairness just a bit larger than last night) though perky breasts. The young girl sighed solemnly as she remembered time after time she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hey, what're you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalker's suprisingly soft, yet deep tone stirred Ali from her thoughts, \"O-Oh nothing, I uh... you didn't happen to catch me looking down my shirt, did you?\" she turned red in embarassment, one hand releasing its grip on the bag in leiu of covering her mouth; a suprisingly feminine gesture for a renowned tomboy such as Ali. Walker's dark eyes stared, his bleak outlook clear as day, \"Yup.\" he said plainly, turning back to his door and twisting the knob. \"W-Wait, hold up a second!!\" Ali shouted after him, hoping to find solace in Walker's expertise layout of the mansion, \"I-I think I'm lost and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you guys are such pains.\" Walker said plainly, pausing in his doorway to address his young \"guest\", \"Call someone else, I'm not giving you a tour.\" he said coldly, not even looking Ali in the eyes as he shrugged her off! Brought her down to Midnight's level! \"H-Hey you hold up a second, jerk!\" Ali charged, not entirely aware of Walker's extensive martial artist training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held the bag in one hand, full of a soon to be smooshed breakfast for the (dieting) Fontina, and forgetting what precious cargo it contained was preparing to use it as a makeshift bat to whack the indignant butler upside the face with. Walker, in turn, got into fighting position; the Absol moemon straightened, and turned to face his opponent. Ali picked up the pace, steps getting faster and faster as she approached him quicker and quicker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she tripped on a loose floorboarding, knocking her off balance and right into the suprised boy's ribcage. He grit his teeth, falling to his knees in pain. Ali, who was seeing stars at this point, held little sympathy for the poor boy as he eventually toppled over to the ground. \"Y-Yeah, s-serves you right... ugh...\" Ali mumbled in mock triumphance, her own pounding head little evidence of a victory. Until she realised that, 'Hey, this guy's really hurt!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli regained balance and used all of her might to drag the broken butler into his quarters (Finding it much frillier than she would have expected a boy's room to be... N-Not that she had ever <i>seen</i> a boy's room before!) and left him laying on the floor, far too physically weak to actually lift him up onto his... cottony white bed... with frills? Probably just decoration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, are you okay?!\" Ali asked stupidly, of course he wasn't okay he was gagging! Walker held a similar outlook, \"No I'm not okay!\" he wheezed, \"My ribs are broken!\" Ali panicked, \"Oh God, I didn't mean to hit you that hard, I'm sorry! I'msososorry!!\" the younger moemon tried to unbutton his dress shirt, only for Walker to swat her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't flatter yourself, they were already broken.\" He seemed to be getting better by the minute, already to the point where he was hoisting himself up with minimal difficulty. \"Training accident a few weeks back... gotta keep my chest bound by these stupid bandages.\" he grunted. The young Absol moemon unfastened his top few buttons, perhaps in his urgancy forgetting that there was a lady in the room? (\"OR DID HE MISTAKE ME FOR A BOY?!\") <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut slowly, Ali noticed a few things off about Walker's... physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, he was obviously a very thin young man; but he lacked the stick-like figure that a young man would sprout at his age. His middle had a slight hourglass shaped to it, much like a sharper version of what a certain buxom Mighteyena moemon's middle looked like (pre-curse, of course) His shoulders weren't broad, and his arms while muscular lacked a certain... masculinaty that she had seen in her older brother's. And as he faced the mirror, unwinding his bandages...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli could clearly make out a small boob trying to wriggle its way from the confining space of <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">his</span> <b>her</b> wrap up.</span></div></div>",

And you\u2019re acting like you never met someone with a Surname before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli couldn\u2019t help but notice that she herself was wearing a skirt, and tugged down on it slightly \u2013 She knew that there was a valid reason to hate skirts (especially after an incident that occurred in one of the previous cities that the trio passed through \u2013 Which involved a mischievous Cubone Moemon who had a habit of flipping skirts). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Now get out,\u201d Walker growled, her dark red eyes narrowing down on the smaller Moemon in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was because of that harsh glare that Ali sped out of the room, immediately slamming the door behind her in the process. Her heart was beating a mile a minute from the fear that the Disaster Moemon had inflicted into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon however, that fear began to melt away into evil itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Let\u2019s think about this for a second,\u2019 Ali thought as she walked down the hallway, making sure she had Fontina\u2019s breakfast (a little smashed up, but still breakfast) in her hands. \u2018If Walker\u2019s a girl, albeit dressed up a very convincing boy, then Midnight\u2019s been hitting on a girl these past two days.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly a devilish grin appeared on Ali\u2019s face as she began to snicker to herself, after months of traveling and dealing with Midnight\u2019s snotty ego \u2013 the Quilava Moemon finally had acquired a weapon that would be able to finally puncture that over inflated ego of Midnight!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Its cause was a certain voluptuous (and currently sweating) Vaporeon Moemon that we all knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past hour, Fontina had trekked through the hallways \u2013 Trying to maintain a decent fast walk/jog in order to increase her stride. This turned out be a bad idea, since within the first ten minutes of her jog, Fontina was sweating bullets that had soaked into the hoodie and sweatpants she was wearing, just making the clothes cling to her \u2018enhanced\u2019 curves more than she would\u2019ve liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she reached the third floor, the makeshift workout suit was almost a secondary skin to the young Vaporeon Moemon. At this point, it was only weighing her down, but Fontina knew that she wouldn\u2019t be able to remove it (she certainly wasn\u2019t as bold as the ball of lard known as Ember), nor at this point she was actually capable of performing such a task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkipping breakfast was never a good idea, and even though the meal of last night was pretty filling, it had long since been digested into her system and the calories were already used up by the young lass. So at the moment, Fontina was only running on fumes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, running wouldn\u2019t be the proper term for right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta\u2026 huff\u2026 C-Continue\u2026\u201d Fontina wheezed as she used her hand to prop herself on the nearby wall in order to make sure that she would fall over. \u201cGotta\u2026 Lose\u2026 *wheeze*\u2026 Weight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunger and fatigue weren\u2019t her only opponents in this race against weight though, there was a dry feeling in Fontina\u2019s throat that was binding her down slightly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, if only she had a glass of water to quench that dreadful thirst of hers\u2026 Or any clean liquid would do at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck seemed to smile down on Fontina, for as she continued her slow work out, the young Moemon neared a familiar door that had a simple plaque on it that read \u2018Break Room\u2019. Just seeing that sign on the door made Fontina\u2019s eyes brighten up behind her glasses and empower her slightly to increase her slow pace towards it. \u201cM-Maybe I can\u2026 G-Get something to d-d-drink there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more moments later (although to Fontina, it seemed to be hours), Fontina had her hands wrapped around the door\u2019s knob and began to turn, not noticing the sweet, warm smell that was lofting from the door. Her thirst was dulling the young moemon\u2019s senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even when she opened the door, Fontina\u2019s vision only focused on what she was looking for originally \u2013 A large water cooler that sat deep into the room. \u201cWATER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning straight into the room, Fontina made a mad dash for the water cooler and immediately poured herself a small cup of water and downed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then downed another cup of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH!\u201d Fontina sighed with a large smile on her face as she tossed the paper cup into a nearby trashcan. \u201cI really, really needed that. Next time I go for a jog I should\u2026 Really remember\u2026 to\u2026 bring a water\u2026 Bottle\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her dehydration finally cured, Fontina finally realized something about the room she was standing in. Although it was an average break room with a table, counter, water cooler, couch, a fridge and a television, there was something else in the room. Stacked on the table, counter, couch and even on the floor were several boxes of donuts \u2013 Swinub Sweets\u2019 doughnuts to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm smell of the donuts alerted Fontina\u2019s nose that the sugary treats were definitely fresh, for a moment, Fontina\u2019s mouth watered\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Fontina scolded herself as she gulped. \u201cIf I eat any of those then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Fontina, her softer stomach was arguing with her, having been denied breakfast and forced to deal with a torturous jog around the mansion was more than enough! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina sighed loudly, \u201cWell\u2026 Only one. One can\u2019t hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One hour or needlessly excessive gluttony later, Fontina was certainly feeling the effects that eating too much can have on one's body. Laying on the provided couch in an uncharacteristically sprawled out fashion, one leg fell off to the side while one laid on top of the arm; her own arm flopping uselessly in the same fasion of her suspended leg while the other one lay atop her stomach, letting her hand fall down to touch the side of her sweaty side and brush against the fabric of her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Fontina managed to work up much more of a sweat stuffing herself than she did in her exercise regimend. On top of already being out of breath, Fontina's second wind had apparantly come and gone during the feast, leaving her truly exhausted as she lay there (for the first time) mindlessly. She had actually broken the smarts out of her brain with the contradicting compound of stuffing herself silly and working out. In her fear of getting fat, she had in fact set herself up for quite the horrendous fall from her dietary perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina looked down to see her swollen paunch, quite full and raised to a very high altitude; almost as if dinner from the night before had repeated itself. Her hand raised and rested atop her belly, making sure to touch it tenderly so as to not upset its delicate equalibrium. Despite her best efforts, the young moemon still winced at the sharp pain that sparked underneath her skin, her wheezing getting sharper out of fear. If she ever ate again, Fontina was very certain she might explode...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her ears caught the sound of the doorknob, breaking the silence that she had created in the staff's rec room. The old tumbler activated and the springs whined to reveal none other than her best friend Ali, who had a bag at her side, guided by the large Dewgong Moemon Claire. \"Oh my...\" the white haired maid covered her mouth in shock as she observed the warzone that Fontina had left the Staff's Break Room. She wasn't mad, not at all (in fact, it seemed like this bubbly behemoth never got mad at anything!) but merely concerned for her guest's wellbeing. \"Ms. Fanta, are you alright?\" she waddled over to the couch and rustled the misaddressed moemon's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh!!\" Fontina roared in pain, like the persian with a thorn in its paw Claire had done the smallest thing to upset her wellbeing- despite her better intentions. Ali snorted, \"Jeez Fontina, you really packed it away!\" the Quilava moemon giggled as she too came to her friend's side, \"I guess you won't be needing this breakfast that I painstakingly ceran-wrapped for you then, huh?\" she teased. The mere mention of food (not sight, Fontina didn't quite have the energy to look down just yet) made the young vaporeon girl want to weep. Or vomit. She wasn't quite sure, maybe a little bit of both?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, come on.\" Ali offered a helping hand, literally and figuratively as her outstretched arm held out an open palm for Fontina to grab. Which she couldn't, she tried, but Fontina's taut tummy took too much energy away from her to coordinate any sort of strenuous movement. \"Oh come on, you could at least grab!\" Ali whined, upset at having to grab the sweaty girl's lax appendage when she could very well do it herself. \"Ew. You're all sticky.\" Ali teased, hoisting her up. \"Ohhh!!\" Fontina let out her signature cry, Ali's sudden jerking had sent many waves of pain through her aquatic being, and she definately let everyone know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop being a big baby or no breakfast for you!\" Ali patronized her dazed friend, \"Hey, and when we get you laying down boy have I got a story to tell you!\" she giggled ecstatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina, though almost completely out of it,  was concious enough to understand what was going on... for the most part. She knew that Ali wasn't ignoring her plight. Ali was simply doing her job, helping her friend out without any serious complaining, since Fontina would certainly do the same for her. And what's better, with a smile on her face and ready to make Fontina laugh (even if it would probably kill her right now to have her belly surge up and down like that) that's one of the things she really liked about Ali, she was a good friend. Not just to her, but even to Midnight... when the situation called for it. And as her fiery friend hoisted up her no doubt heavier frame, she caught her smiling and laughing even as she struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you're heavy.\" Ali quipped, \"Maybe you shouldn't eat that breakfast I saved for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh!!\" Fontina wailed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just begin cleaning up in here then?\" Claire, though ditzy, caught it too. She knew how wonderful the friendship that Ali and Fontina shared was, and it made the moemon smile. Because she could see it, clear as day, those two were the best of friends. And her sympathy would have been plainly obvious... had it not been for the chocolate frosting around her plump full lips as she \"cleaned\" the rec room; sitting her plump posterior down on one of the (squished, now) boxes and quietly munched on a couple of donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S NOT CLEANING!!\" </span></div></div>",

Managing to find some information from the gorging Claire, the duo were on their way towards the second floor infirmary. Ali was a little in the middle of this situation, on one hand, she was more than willing to help her good friend in her dire need of painful gluttony, but the other part of her was wanting to tell her glasses wearing friend about the secret she learned only an hour ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, thinking about it some more, Ali figured that if Fontina knew of Walker\u2019s true gender, there was a good chance that Fontina would tell the egotistical Midnight (Especially since Midnight was so gung-ho about flirting with the dark Moemon). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Ali\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if she kept this to herself, then Ali would be able to have the joke all to herself and watch the dark Moemon make a complete fool of herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAli, I think we\u2019re\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the flipside of that, if it was revealed that Walker was a girl and that Ali knew that fact, it would probably end badly for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cALI!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly puffy Quilava Moemon blinked a few times as her digesting friend\u2019s loud moan, \u201cUh, yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Fontina pointed out to her friend as she pointed towards a nearby door that had a Chansey sticker on it that held a sign that read \u2018Infirmary\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Ali muttered out loud with her red cheeks turning red slightly. \u201cS-Sorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, just thanks for helping me get here,\u201d Fontina grunted, still wincing from the tightness in her belly. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll only be a minute, I\u2019m just going to get an antacid or two\u2026 Or six\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli nodded as she watched her friend inch into the room, \u201cYou might want to get some more for later though!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed behind Fontina, making Ali sigh loudly as she leaned up against the nearby wall. That\u2019s when the young Quilava Moemon realized that she still held onto the bag filled with cold, one hour leftovers from breakfast. \u201cUgh, I doubt that Fontina would want to eat this stuff now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ali was about to open the bag to check on the food, a small gleam of light moved into her eyes, making her squint slightly as she lifted her hand up. \u201cWhat the?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the light, Ali spotted the cause of the light \u2013 A beautiful emerald green vase that had several carvings that depicted several dragons on it. It seemed to have some jewels embedded into it as well, and for some reason, Ali was drawn to the weird vase to look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping some distance from it, Ali admired the vase \u2013 Noticing that it was well crafted. \u201cWow, this place must be full of rare stuff like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I knew that you admired curves,\u201d a familiar snarky voice cooed behind Ali, making the small girl jump slightly. \u201cBut now you\u2019re admiring a vase? That\u2019s just sad you little mouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli spun around, seeing Midnight standing behind Ali, her hands placed on her trimmed hips (which seemed to be a bit curvier and sunk a little bit into the Mightyena\u2019s skin a bit more than usual). There was also a small stain of chocolate around Midnight\u2019s mouth, but Ali didn\u2019t really notice that. \u201cSo, I take it you haven\u2019t found Fontina yet? Or were you planning on stealing her breakfast as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, you dog,\u201d Ali huffed as she crossed her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t want to deal with your attitude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh cry me a river, you water-phobic wimp,\u201d Midnight barked back. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who has to deal with crap! I keep trying my best material with that sweet piece Walker, but it\u2019s not having any effect on him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, maybe he doesn\u2019t swing that way?\u201d Ali snickered with a devious grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would you know about picking up guys?\u201d Midnight snarled leaning forward (much to the distaste of her slightly puffy tummy) to leer at Ali in the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so flat that people either mistake you for a guy or as a little kid! Guys love a real woman with curves in the right place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna say that again?\u201d Ali growled, seriously not liking Midnight\u2019s attitude right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Midnight cooed mockingly as she stood up straight. \u201cIs the little girl going to cry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S IT!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However things would turn out differently this time, because despite being strong and old enough to become a Mightyena moemon, Midnight was still pretty wimpy. Ali took pride in the fact that, without any of her underhanded tricks anyway, she could hand Midnight's ass to her any day of the week!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lunged at her soft middle head first, hands bared in a startling fashion as Ali headbutt Midnight right in the stomach. Midnight wheezed, letting out a long gasp of air as the dark hair around her face was lifted by the breeze. She went stumbling backwards from Ali's punch, understandably panting after getting the wind knocked out of her. \"Ha... little body... little- little punches!\" Midnight teased, trying to hold back any hurt feelings (or stomachs for that matter) and appear superior. \"WHY YOU!!\" Ali grunted, charging at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Midnight just moved out of the way of the teeny-weeny locomotive speeding her way; even going so far as to laugh haughtilly as she sped off in the wrong direction. \"Come on Pipsqueak, I'm right here!\" she growled, smacking her ass tauntingly. Ali <i>fumed</i>, \"Y-You bitch!!\" she cried, feeling the blood vessels in the back of her eyes strain. She stomped forward once again, only for Midnight to move right out of the way without any difficulty; also coming close to knocking-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the antacids...\" Fontina said warilly as she stepped out of the infermary, only to be greeted with a very familiar sight- Ali and Fontina scrapping yet again. \"Oh... come on guys... I'm not in the mood right now.\" Fontina pleaded. But it was no use, the two were too far gone. \"<i>I'm</i> not fighting.\" Midnight yawned innocently, \"Cheese-for-Brains is the one who wanted to fight.\" The vein in Ali's head nearly exploded, \"WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FOOLING YOU DOG-BREATHED SKANK?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she charged futiley at Midnight who again just meandered right out of the way. \"I.\" she shouted, finally grabbing her by the lusciously tan arm, \"AM.\" she screamed, twisting it, \"TIRED.\" Ali barked as Midnight rose to her feet, \"OF.\" she hissed as the Mighteyena moemon got a good punch in, \"YOU!!\" she cried, getting in a good punch herself... just on a silver-white podium holding a certain vase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them watched, save for Fontina who was far too under the weather to really care right now, as the no doubt priceless vase teetered like a Spinda moemon on the flat pedestal. It wobbled in a circular fashion, already moved slightly with all the vibrations Ali and Midnight had caused, and threatened to tip over and shatter into countless little pieces all over the floor. Thankfully, Ali was able to catch it before her own knock-out punch sent it tumbling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...\" she sighed, placing it precariously back onto its rightful spot. Time seemed to have stopped, even their fight (whos predecessors were uncaring and violent to everything) had ceased in order to ensure the sanctity of that vase. \"That was close.\" Midnight shared the same consent, having to double-check the vase to make sure it was okay. \"I'll say it was... hey, great catch shortstuff.\" she pat Ali on the back, causing the smaller girl to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, hey, it was nothing I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What're you guys doing?\" Walker's voice echoed throughout the stilled hallway, causing Midnight to jump up eagerly. \"Why hello there!\" she cooed a little to loudly, standing to her feet and knocking Ali back into the podium face first, \"What brings you to this neck of the woods, hmm?\" she said sensually. The dreary butler was far from pleased. \"Uh... yeah, I work here.\" Walker said dully, shrugging off the fellow dark-type moemon in a hastilly planned escape route, \"Oh jeez, Shrimp, grab that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli read his mind, not even shocked that he had raised his voice. The little moemon held out her hands awaitingly in an attempt to save said priceless vase, only for it to end up as a million green little decorations on the floor. \"O-Oops.\" Ali squeaked....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, that's all that was said. \"Oops.\" That's all that could have been said; Ali and Midnight's conjoined reckless attitude had broken the most beautiful thing the former had ever seen in her entire life. \"Oops?\" Walker parroted fiercely, \"<i>Oops?</i> That's all you have to say?\" Ali trembled as Walker got closer and closer to her- she was already in hot water with the Disaster Moemon for ramming him in the broken ribs, now it looked like he was going to... Ali gulped at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalker's piercing red eyes met Ali's quivering ones, her thin white brow furrowed in anger. \"That was the Master's favorite vase, an antique from the Rayquazan Era!\" she shouted at Ali, already pale knuckles turning snow white as she gripped his fingers tighter and tighter, \"It. was. PRICELESS.\" she concluded, whipping around to face Midnight and the other half of Fontina, \"You three... you're all putrid, and you're GONNA get out of here!\" <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">s</span>he closed her eyelids, resisting the urge to deliver comuppons to each and every one of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh...\" Midnight and Ali stammered in unison, Fontina was speechless. Here she was, minding her own business (minus that little stuffing incident) and her friends had gotten her into trouble! AGAIN! \"B-B-But-\" she stuttered too, only for Walker to turn around and get into her face, \"Your friends are fools. Fools.\" he reitterated himself angrilly, storming off down the hall. No doubt in search of Shera to let her know about their newest \"guest's\" mysterious dissappearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Midnight gawked, \"He's pretty mad.\" Ali rolled her eyes, \"Yeah, thanks to you Mutt-Mouth!\" Fontina felt her eyes water, having felt so sorry for even being a part of this little fiasco, but if it was fair, Fontina was perfectly fine with-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better go work on him.\" Midnight stood up, only for Ali to grab her heel and pull her back down to the ground. \"YOU'LL JUST MAKE IT WORSE!!!\"</span></div></div>",

It had only been a good fifteen minutes after the vase was broken before Midnight, Ali and Fontina had been pulled into the main dining hall, staring at the broken remains of the vase that were placed on the large table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the three Moemon could feel themselves getting smaller due to the combined leers of most of the staff (Wester was surprised to hear about what had happened, but he still had to prepare lunch for the group). Well, only two of the four staff were leering at them, Walker being one of them and the normally kind Shera wasn\u2019t in her usual good mood either. Claire was munching on a donut that she snuck out from the break room and Ember\u2026 Well, the round ball of lard was actually asleep in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls,\u201d Shera sighed loudly, making all three of the traveling Moemon jump slightly. \u201cI can understand that you\u2019re young and full of energy, and accidents do happen\u2026 But this is a grave mistake that cannot disappear just by saying sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re ungrateful morons,\u201d Walker added, not bothering to remove her sight from the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just made Midnight and Ali lower their heads a little closer to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWalker, I can handle this,\u201d Shera scolded by sending a cold leer towards Walker before she turned back to the girls. \u201cNow look, I realize that things can get out of hand, but there has to be something done about this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say we toss them out,\u201d Walker suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I just say, Walker?\u201d Shera growled, now getting slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you said,\u201d Walker hissed back, her glare now focused on Shera. \u201cBut you know as well as I do that the master\u2019s going to flip out when he gets back and finds his precious vase in a million pieces! And we\u2019re all going to take the heat for it! I say we kick these three out before they bring the entire mansion down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWalker, that\u2019s enough!\u201d Shera roared, actually making Walker\u2019s deadly gaze soften slightly, as well as make Ember wake up and cause almost everyone else in the room to jump in surprise. \u201cI invited these three in from the cold, they\u2019re my responsibility. So, unless you want to be stuck on latrine duty for the next year, I suggest you keep your mouth shut!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven that seemed to make Walker shiver slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Shera turned back to the three heroines. \u201cNow girls, I want to let you know that I have no intention of kicking you out. I know that you\u2019re all good girls deep down. You probably didn\u2019t mean to let his happen, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t the one who dropped the stupid relic,\u2019 Midnight thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That damned, stupid mutt started it!\u2019 Ali thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I didn\u2019t even have anything to do with it,\u2019 Fontina thought to herself as she crossed her arms on her slightly softer stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 I am going to have to request that you three are going to stay here,\u201d Shera said bluntly. \u201cEven after the storm clears up I\u2019m afraid. Walker is right, that vase was the master\u2019s favorite, and no doubt it probably was worth a lot of money to him. So, the only way you three can fix this is by working off the amount that the vase was worth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 What?\u201d All three of the girls questioned at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said, you three are going to have to work here at the mansion,\u201d Shera answered. \u201cThe more you work, the more money will be used to pay off what the vase was worth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-How much was that worth then?\u201d Fontina questioned, a little worried about what the answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, Walker, you usually talked with the master about the vase, right?\u201d Shera asked. \u201cHow much did he say it was worth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so now I can talk?\u201d Walker growled before turning her head to the side. \u201cWhatever. He never gave me an exact number, but he told me that a vase like that could go for somewhere in the tens of millions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Midnight, Ali and Fontina\u2019s jaws dropped at the same time, with Ember snickering in the background at the sight of the three\u2019s faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll try to get into contact with the master to get an exact number,\u201d Shera sighed before she walked to the three. \u201cBut, regardless, you three will still work off the debt you\u2019ve accumulated. This afternoon I\u2019ll train you three on how to clean and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no!\u201d Midnight snapped standing up. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take the blame for what the pipsqueak did!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d Ali barked back as she puffed up her little chest slightly. \u201cIt was your fault in the first place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys! Please!\u201d Fontina pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Moemon continued to argue for a few seconds in front of Shera, until finally\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d Shera roared, forcing all three of the bickering Moemon to the ground. Clearing her throat, Shera\u2019s traditional smile appeared on her face. \u201cThat\u2019s better, now, if any of you have a complaint about this deal, we can simply call the local authorities and have them sort out the matter\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost in an instant, all three of the heroines shook their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Shera chuckled. \u201cVery well then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLunch is ready!\u201d Wester announced from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Shera stated as she turned towards the kitchen. \u201cAfter lunch, I\u2019ll show you girls the ropes and get you fitted in some maid outfits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears could be seen falling from the three girls\u2019 eyes as the staff aimed towards the kitchen\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ali was silent, for she had begrudgingly accepted the fact that once again Midnight had gotten her into trouble. Fontina looked like she swallowed a lemon, having lacked the self control required to refrain from topping herself off at lunchtime. Shera, on the other hand, looked like her usual cheery self despite her earlier unpleasantries with her three newest maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now girls, no need to look so glum!\" the Kangashkan moemon chirped, \"I'm sure you'll have that debt paid off in no time, so long as you work really really hard; and in the meantime you'll all have a wonderful time working here!\" Her words, while in all the best intentions, fell on deaf ears. They weren't looking forward to this, and how could they? Not only had they shattered a one of a kind antique, but they were expected to work as maids until their REAL punishment could be decided! And what could they do other than lay back and accept their fates; nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera's wobbling mass came to a stop right; from the meager attention Fontina managed to hold together, she detected that they were somewhere on the second floor. \"A-A linen closet?\" Ali stuttered, fearful of <i>ever</i> having to hear that strong scary tone in Shera's voice ever again. \"Yeah, <i>ritzy</i>...\" Midnight spat sarcastically, earning a swift jab to the side from her Quilava counterpart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Ali's relief, Shera didn't turn around and deliver a swift backhand to the pompous moemon, but instead let out that sugar-laden chuckle that they had all come to recognize her by, \"Well originally maybe, but I've made this my special little project around this house.\" she said, a twinkle of pride glistening in her brown eyes, \"With some help expanding the room, I've turned this into somewhat of my own little escape where I can preform my hobby in peace...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chubby hands grabbed the doorhandle, twisted it, and yanked; revealing a suprisingly brightly lit room filled with uniforms of varying shapes, styles, and sizes! In the corner, there sat a wide stool next to a small table that contained little more than a sewing machine, a few threads in varying shades of black and white, a Wailmer-themed pin cushion, and what looked to be an unfinished blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sewing!\" she concluded, beaming proudly at the small knook she had created for herself. \"Its true, the master realized just how expensive it was to keep ordering new uniforms after the general wear-and-tear, so he asked me to take up knitting and, well, I guess I got a little carried away...\" she blushed, turning sideways (though not allowing much more room) for the three to squeeze into her humble corner, \"Pick out something you like, dears, I've got plenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, all of the day's hardships melted away for a certain canine moemon. Getting turned down by sexy hunk Walker (yet again), breaking that vase, her fight with Ali, even turning down lunch! Everything was a-ok when she saw those beautiful, sexy maid uniforms hanging so neatly on coat hangers! \"Oooh!!\" she squealed, the first of her group to jump at the opportunity of free clothes, \"These are so <i>cute</i>; Shera, you made these?!\" she grabbed at something very victorian, something pretty stereotypical that a maid would wear in a cheap porno flick. She imagined it, the low-cut top half allowing her chocolate breasts to spill out ever so slightly, the short bottom frilling out from her thighs, giving her a youthful- yet sexy approach to her appearance. Midnight sprouted a scheming grin, no doubt coming up with plenty of ways to make Walker bend over and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, I-I never really thought anyone else would be so enthusiastic about them though...\" Shera's expression grew even redder, raising a plump hand to cover the visible side of her face in an embarrassing fashion. \"And I can hem too, Dear, that uniform seems just a little too-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!\" Fontina's enthusiasm matched Midnights as she caught sight of a particular selection, one almost exactly like the featured dress in her favorite mystery novel, \"Th-This is just like-\" Shera smiled knowingly and took the liberty to finish her sentence for the excited moemon, \"The dress worn by Cassandra in 'Mansion'?\" she chuckled again, \"Well I'm somewhat of a fan myself, so I decided on making some cosplay that afternoon, if you want I could let it out for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut again, Shera's gentle nudges at the girls' puffier waistlines were interrupted yet again by Midnight, who had picked the most absolutely adorable dress for her washboard friend, Ali. \"Oh Ali, you'd look so cute in this one!\" much to the Quilava's dismay (and fiery fury), Midnight held up a frilly dress that was much more suited for a child... and a flat child at that! \"WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'D WANT TO WEAR THAT?!\" Ali shouted, snatching it from Midnight's hands furiously. \"Oh but, you seem a little too... erm, \"grown up\" for that dress, Dear.\" Shera struggled to find a suitable diagnosis for Ali's problem. She wasn't <i>too</i> grown up, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SEE, SHE THINKS I'M TOO GROWN UP FOR THAT DRESS!!\" Ali stamped her foot at Midnight, who only laughed, \"I'm just trying to help you, Shorty, everyone knows you have a babyface anyway, at least you'll attract <i>somebody</i> in that cutesy-frilly thing!\" Fontina blushed, taking it upon herself to thank Shera for both of her less-than-refined friends. \"Really, we'll work really hard for our debt and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S IT!!\" Ali shouted, balling up her fist in anger and lunging at Midnight yet again, \"I'LL KICK YOU RIGHT BACK TO THE KENNEL POOCHY!!\" But, despite the proven path that these fights seemed to follow, Shera merely ignored the two feuding females in leiu of their respectable companion. \"I'm sure you will, Ms. Fontina- oops, Fontina- but if you'll please...</span></div></div>",

Looking down at her proportionally gifted body, Fontina placed her hands on her softer stomach, which somehow seemed to be a bit softer than how she really remembered it being before she entered the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something weird going on in this mansion, and it looked like Fontina would have more than enough ample time to find out what it was. After all, she and her friends would be stuck here even if the storm cleared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls!\u201d Shera announced, actually pulling Midnight and Ali apart from each other, and ending their fight in an instant. \u201cThat\u2019s better, now, could you three please get undressed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Midnight asked with a large bead of sweat rolling down the side of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli was just as stunned as Fontina was a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to adjust the clothes to fit your figures,\u201d Shera explained with the warm smile on her face. \u201cThe faster you three do this, the faster I can adjust your uniforms and the faster we can get that debt paid off in no time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Midnight sighed as she tossed her clothes on the ground, now only dressed in her silky black bra and panties (that clung to her figure, making a few impressions in her chocolate colored skin). \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to measure myself for a while now anyways!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think your bust grew along with your ego?\u201d Ali muttered under her breath as she crossed her arms under her now-existent chest (which was clad in a more modest red bra with matching panties). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I have a bust, short-stack,\u201d Midnight chuckled placing a hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ali could actually get a remark in, Fontina slowly stepped from behind the rack of maid uniforms, instantly catching the attention of her two companions. \u201cC-C-Could you not stare?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, that task at the moment was impossible \u2013 Both Midnight and Ali knew that their quiet, bookworm of a friend had a better figure than both of them, but they had only seen her dressed in her normally baggy clothes so they couldn\u2019t get a good read on Fontina\u2019s figure. But there it was, clad in some frilly light blue undergarments, her impressive bust almost looking like it was about to spill out from the bra and her shapely hips gave her an almost perfect hourglass figure (with the slight beginnings of a pudgy belly appearing in the middle). The more her two friends stared, the redder Fontina\u2019s face turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright!\u201d Shera interrupted, feeling the tension that building in Fontina\u2019s head. \u201cMidnight, dear, could you com here first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me,\u201d Midnight replied as she shook herself free from her trance at looking at Fontina\u2019s body. \u201cMight as well set the bar for everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the larger Kangaskhan Moemon, Midnight lifted her arms up in the air as Shera lifted up the measuring strip up to the right places and began to tighten the strip. A minute later, Shera stood up straight and smiled, \u201cEighty-three, sixty-one, and eighty-one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad! Not bad at all!\u201d Midnight laughed as she turned away from Shera and sauntered over to her clothes. Along the way, she purposely bumped her hip into Ali\u2019s back, forcing the smaller Moemon stumbling over towards Shera. \u201cTry to top that, shrimp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli huffed loudly before Shera began her task of measuring the Quilava Moemon\u2019s tiny body. A few moments later, Shera made her declaration, \u201cSixty-seven, fifty-nine, and seventy-one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my,\u201d Midnight chuckled, pulling her daisy dukes back on her shapely legs. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ve got you beat in all three categories, half-pint!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Ali growled as she made a dash for her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Fontina-dear,\u201d Shera calmly announced, making the red faced Fontina blush slightly more. \u201cThe faster you get over here, the faster we can get this over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Fontina scuttled over to Shera, and lifted her arms up. As Shera ran the measuring strip over her body, Fontina could almost feel the measuring tape sink into her soft skin a few times. Time seemed to slow down for this measurement, with Fontina\u2019s face burning a deep red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone!\u201d Shera announced as she stood up straight. \u201cNinety-three, sixty-six, ninety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Midnight and Ali gasped, both of them almost dropping their clothes in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 P-Please,\u201d Fontina yelped as she dashed for her currently borrowed work-out clothes. \u201cIt\u2019s n-not a big deal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig is exactly what it is!\u201d Midnight growled, her eyes now green with envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli sighed loudly as she placed her hands on her chest, her own measurements had improved slightly (she\u2019s wasn\u2019t a fan of her waist measurement though) but the same was for her two companions\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then,\u201d Shera announced, gathering all three of the girls\u2019 attentions. \u201cYou three return to your room and relax until dinner. By then I should have the uniforms fixed, but we\u2019ll get you three working tomorrow morning. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll start you all off with a partner to help your work and show you the ropes.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh man, this is so embarrassing...\" Ali's demure was as red as her type's namesake as she stepped out in front of her friends as they all had before her. Shera's poofy childish dress was actually the only one that was small enough to fit her, as even the lardball Ember's choice of clothing was too vertically advanced to fit Ali's petite stature. \"Oh come <b>on</b> Ali, it looks fine!\" Midnight urged her from her seated position on the bed, rudely pulling up her stockings instead of giving her full attention to the modeling Quilava moemon (as her friends had so graciously given their full attention to Midnight during <i>her</i> glorified catwalk) \"Sh-Shut up!\" Ali froze like a Stantler in headlights: W-Was she really cute?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all actuality, yes she was. Even going so far as to say 'adorable' wouldn't be construed as over the top. Ali's new dress was black at the base with a white apron wrapped around her waist, of course, but there were a few custom items noticable about the spread that seemed custom, like they were put there just for Ali! And indeed there were, Shera had done a magnificent job of customizing each girl's selection to better suit their personalities while she was tailoring their uniforms. For instance, before, Ali's uniform was a simple fabric with nothing special about it with a very generic shape, almost like a halloween costume for a small child. But after Shera was done with it, the dress <i>looked</i> basically the same, and to the untrained eye it would appear almost just as it did when Midnight yanked it off the hanger. But actually Shera had ever so slightly tightened the ruffles in the uniform's shoulders, making it seem a little more grown up than before. The Kangaskahn seamstress seemed to loosen the skirt's hem and add a few more frills at the bottom to accentuate Ali's small, childish stature though. Shera had even gone so far as to replace the clad-white fabric of the uniform's undercoating with a pattern which resembled very pale white fire burning against a <i>slightly</i> darker white background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I AM NOT!!\" Ali barked back at Midnight, who had finally gotten one of her leggings rolled up somewhere during that paragraph. Midnight dismissed her friend with the wave of a hand, \"I didn't say you were smokin' hot, Ali, just <i>cute</i>.\" she grabbed another legging and started to roll it up her tanned calve, \"Like one of those cheap dolls you get at the mall, that's it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in all fairness, Midnight was calling the kettle black when it came to looking 'cheap'. While Ali's dress looked like it was made for her, Midnight's looked much more suited to a woman of much older, much more desperate status when it came to men. Not that she didn't have the figure for it, which she certainly did, it was just how the dress seemed to present itself. But again, it wasn't the dress' fault that Shera had taken Midnight's loose, haughty personality into play when making adjustments. Take for instance how tight and thin the fabric was, now stuff Midnight's (growing) light milk chocolate body into the dress and cut off some circulation. She looked wonderful with her low-cut top, which put her cleavage on a proverbial pedestal as it literally spilled out of it, and her low-cut bottom, allowing her thick whipped-chocolate thighs to strut their stuff, but the middle was the problem. Shera had all the intention of making Midnight look good (just as the notes and quick doodle the Mighteyena girl had dropped by her quarters some time last night depicted) but knowing how vain the dark-type moemon was, Shera had taken the liberty to tighten the waist just a bit to accentuate her \"sexy\" persona. And, since silver was 'slimming' in Midnight's book, she had the seamstress line her cuffs with a silver fabric; inadvertantly turning her normal belly shirt into a boobie shirt, due to lack of suitable fabric on Shera's part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight hummed slightly as she finished rolling up yet another stocking during yet another long-winded paragraph, wincing slightly as she leaned over her pinched belly. \"Geez, you'd think she would have done a better job with these.\" Midnight, as always, had to complain, \"I mean, seriously I can hardly breath in this thing!\" Ali was the first to quip, \"Maybe it's not the dress' fault, <i>sixty-one waist</i>, maybe you're just wearing something more suited to my slender, <i>fifty-nine</i> waist.\" she teased, now more than eager to rub Midnight's own measurements in her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I still have bigger boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY YOU-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring Midnight and Ali's little scrap, their volumptuous friend cowered behind the doorway; absolutely set on just letting the cops come and take her away. <i>Anything</i> was better than going out with her new uniform on! Her normally pale, seafoam skin was almost as red as Ali's after having difficulties squeezing her... 'assets' into the dress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was quite beautiful actually, not suprising since 'beautiful' was exactly what Shera strived for in Fontina's dress. Rather than the generic black fabric used for everyone else's uniforms, herself included, Shera had found a bounty of a lovely navy fabric so dark that it almost <i>seemed</i> to be black. From far away, the blue was unnoticable unless compared to another one of her uniforms, this was done purposely; something just to say that its creator appreciated how kindly Fontina treated the house and how she refrained from being as rowdy as her friends. Aside from the blue fabric, Fontina's dress had many more special qualities unique to only her dress; such as the extra pocket sewn across her right busom, the light perrywinkle option instead of the white for her hems, or just how \"smart\" her outfit made her seem. Shera was even going so far as offering to find a particularly old and feminine pair of glasses lying somewhere around the house that would go <i>great</i> with her new outfit! And despite Fontina's protests, Shera <i>still</i> managed to get ahold of her lens thickness and curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, however, Fontina's eyes almost watered from behind her big round glasses as she hid behind the doorframe. Not because she was embarrassed, or because she didn't want to be a maid. Or even because her uniform was <i>already</i> tight on her plumping body (she would cry about that later) It was that Shera had taken the time to make her something that was unique to her; and only her. And the fact that something so beautiful was going to get dirty as she cleaned the house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough guys, come on!\" Fontina piped, batting away the slowly accumulating tears from her eyes with the back of her knuckle, \"We've got lots of work to do around here...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn't leniant enough to assign them roles that would put them close together, having learned exactly what happens when you put Midnight and Ali together in the same room. And while she had no problem with a little slacking off, Ali insisted that she would work hard to pay off that looming debt in no time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with her choice of partner, that didn't seem like it would happen any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been paired with Ember, not only due to their shared type but their small statures as well. A maid had to be tall to reach the top shelves of things as they dusted, rearranged, or cleaned; and both Ember and Ali proved too short of moemon to live up to that standard. This was why, long ago, Shera had assigned Ember the position of cleaning up after meals (in no small part contributing to her serious weight problem later in life) and had thusly assigned Ali the same position as the chubbsy-ubbsy Vulpix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what we do is...\" Ember explained professionally, one hand crossed over her bobbing busom while the other one's pillowy armfat engulfed the former's hand, \"Clean up.\" she giggled, losing her composure and ending up rolling on the floor from her hilarious joke. Ali grumbled, of all the people she had to get stuck with it just <i>had</i> to be the only one she had seen naked. But she was right, the dining room was left quite the mess; but only in certain areas: Like where she, Midnight, and Ember sat during meals. For the most part, thanks to everyone <i>else's</i> kind table manners and proper etiquite, the dining room needed little to no cleaning other than clearing the table of dishes. And thanks to everyone's portly frame and large appetites, there was nary a scrap nor spoonful left! Except on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy Yummy, I love Walker so much!!\" Ember giggled. After Ali heaved the massive girl off of her back, not recieving any sort of thank you by the way, the portly vulpix moemon waddled her way first thing over to the young cross-dressing Absol's plate: left almost completely untouched. \"Walker doesn't eat breakfast?\" Ali asked, watching Ember's balloon-booty wobble disgustingly as she helped herself to the butler's table-scraps. \"Mmph, nope, Walker jush takesh a few bitesh an' leavesh it all to me me me!!\" Ember chirped, turning around with Walker's plate in-grip and patting (what she could reach of) her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli grimaced, that was pretty nasty. Not the food thing, it hadn't been sitting out more than maybe ten minutes before she and Ember had gotten to work. Just the fact that Walker treated Ember as something as a garbage disposal, it just got to her somehow. \"Mmm, yum yum, Walker calls me his little Trash Disposal!\" she said happilly, \"A'cause I can eat a~ny~thing!\" Ali sweatdropped, 'A-And she's proud of that?' Ember waddled over to her fellow fire type curiously, \"Do you not like Walker?\" she asked innocently, her cutely tripled chin wobbling slightly as the rest of her tried to reach a standstill. \"W-Well no, I, I mean she-er-he's a great-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then here, he insists that I eat because if I don't it wastes perfectly good food, so you can eat too!\" Ember shoved a spoonful of egg and cheese into Ali's mouth as she answered, \"See, plenty of food for us to eat!\" she cut herself off with a nonsensical giggle. Was she... <i>excited</i> about eating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'God... I hope everyone else is having a better time than I am...'</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And while she had no problem with a little slacking off, Midnight was surely taking advantage of that field because, after all, it was all that little Mouse's fault anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer main priority was simple; flirt as well as she could as often as she could with Cutie-Pie Walker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue not only to their shared type and general \"chemistry\" that Midnight had insisted to Shera was there, Midnight and Walker were the ideal candidates for cleaning the first floor. Actually, Walker was assigned this position long before Midnight came along, being the tallest of the hired help at that time (excluding Claire, who's stomach constantly knocked over the Master's knick-knacks as she cleaned) With Midnight proving just as tall as Walker, it was no problem for her to get a ladder like Walker and clean off some of the higher altitudes of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't too focused on anything going on in the living room as she cleaned off a chair, she was more concered about oggling Walker's buns as they wiggled around in those tight dress pants! \"So, how about I dust off <i>your</i> cushions later, hmmm- no no no, that sounds stupid.\" she whispered to herself, the young Mightyena moemon was currently rehearsing what she could say to Walker to really get inside his... well, you get the picture. \"Hey... you've been dusting that chair for thirty minutes now.\" Walker's drole tone broke Midnight from her trance, only to be whipped right back into work. \"Y-Yeah, s-sorry 'bout that.\" she whimpered, tan skin blushing profusely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalker crossed \"his\" arms over a bound chest, the bandages keeping her small boobs from flopping about in her dress shirt. She wasn't too happy with Midnight's poor work ethic, she obviously hadn't worked for very much in her life. Ever. This was exhibited simply by the fact that while Midnight was off in La-La Land, Walker had cleaned almost the entire room. He would certainly be making a note of this to Shera when it came time to deliver the payrolls. \"Yeah... you're pretty much useless.\" she quipped, heading for the door, \"Only a real amateur tries to clean everything spotless, you go over what's dirty first and then take the rest of the room easy- its the only way you'll get done in time.\" she turned around, her dark red eyes staring directly into Midnight's, \"I suggest you pick up the pace.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight couldn't help but sniffle at being called \"useless\". She <i>wasn't</i> useless, she was just... preoccupied. <i>'How 'come he turns me down every time?!'</i> Midnight whispered to herself, now actually sitting down on the job in her freshly cleaned chair, readjusting her breastline to a more comfortable level (hiked up for a sexy -though ignored- effect) <i> 'I mean, I'm plenty sexy, he's plenty sexy... what's the deal?!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'God, I hope everyone else is- ooh, is that chocolate?'</i> she started to salivate, her better instincts and less-than-fair judgement waning in anticipation of Wester's latest confection. \"Oh Wester~\" she skipped off with a hungry gleam in her eyes...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And while Shera insisted that each and every bit of work was necessary, Fontina's partner was far from hard working!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she and Claire had started cleaning, the massive Dewgong Moemon spent more time gasping for breath than she did cleaning!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of a type in common wasn't the only reason Shera had insisted that Fontina work with Claire. Mostly it was so that the naturally hard-working Fontina could compensate for the \"good intentioned\" Claire, who despite her best efforts, was in no shape to go around cleaning two whole floors by herself. And it showed in the thick layer of dust that had accumulated over the top-most levels of the bookcases on the third floor. Fontina turned a cynical eye to Claire, who only giggled and blushed in response, \"I-I don't do so well on ladders...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a crime that the Dewgong moemon had allowed such treasures of literature to grow dusty and undoubtedly untouched for such a long period of time. Normally, she would have raised an upstaged hand and started cleaning them herself... but she had been doing that all day on <i>two</i> whole floors! Claire's figure had cost those levels of the house their shine, but Fontina had given it back to them through backbreaking hard work and plenty or elbow grease that she pulled from her volumptuous aquatic body; at this rate she would lose that pudge in no time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for some reason, all that cleaning left her so... worn out! It was terrible, her body ached, her boobs ached, her feet ached... EVERYTHING ached! On top of that she had busted a seam on her uniform shortly after breakfast (which was, in itself massive.) But again, things get worse as, despite her dietary efforts, Fontina was hungrier than she'd ever been in her entire life! Her stomach grumbled loudly under the dusty uniform Shera had so painstakingly made for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you hungry?\" Claire giggled, \"Or was that just me again?\" Fontina grumbled something under her breath; while she was always one to pull her own weight, Claire's was simply too heavy to toe alongside it. \"No, I'm fine.\" Fontina huffed as she removed a book from the shelf to dust it off personally, \"I just- oh...\" she nearly fell from the ladder after that little spark of hunger pain. Claire waddled over to her side immediately, stabilizing the legs of her tool so that the young blue-haired moemon may get down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really shouldn't push yourself so hard, come on, we're done for the most part.\" Fontina felt her eye twitch at the obese seal meomon at Claire's mention of 'we', \"Why don't we grab a bite to eat in the breakroom... I definately remember the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina, while initially reluctant, was later dragged inside. Needless to say, all those sweets definately satiated that ungodly hunger of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'm having such a... good... time...'</i> Fontina smiled softly as she nodded off right next to Claire on the couch...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week had passed by, and just as the storm continued (which only Fontina seemed to notice) so had the chores that our three heroines had to deal with (as well as their secret binges). It was an early morning when Ali realized something about her maid uniform when she was finally finished putting on her outfit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 To be honest, though, she wasn\u2019t the one who realized it first\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see London, I see France,\u201d Midnight snickered as she walked up behind her shorter companion, making Ali jump. \u201cI see a certain Quilava\u2019s unattractive\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Ali snarled as she spun around to leer at her taller traveling companion (if you could still call them traveling). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight only snickered at the look at Ali\u2019s face, \u201cSeriously squirt, you might wanna think about asking Shera to get you a bigger uniform. All that \u2018cleaning\u2019 you\u2019ve been doing with that oversized butterball must\u2019ve made your uniform shrink, heh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli blushed when she pulled down the skirt of her maid uniform, she was feeling more of a breeze with this outfit than she usually did. However, it wasn\u2019t because her bottom half had grown (although that did contribute), it was actually due to the fact that her normally flat body seemed to develop more in a week than four years of puberty \u2013 actually giving her a slightly larger bust (as well as the beginnings of a pot belly). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when the young Quilava Moemon got a better look at Midnight, that blush disappeared and a large smirk appeared on her face as she crossed her arms, \u201cSpeaking of uniforms, yours looks like its seen better days, mutt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight barred her teeth at the smaller Moemon, but she couldn\u2019t argue with facts. The uniform was tight and form cutting when Midnight had it mad for her, showing off a decent amount of light milk chocolate skin from the low-cut top and skirt \u2013 But after one week of giving into the temptation of her vice, chocolate, the damage had been done. Some of the seams were starting to pop around her waist while her impressive bust was threatening to escape from her top\u2019s confines, trying to follow the example that her improved buns had begun to peek out from under the skirt whenever she sauntered around. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m just getting sexier. I\u2019m a growing girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, growing taller\u2026 Or wider?\u201d Ali quipped back with a large smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can easily kick you out into the rain, ya know,\u201d Midnight growled. \u201cSo, what\u2019d you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli chuckled nervously, certainly not looking forward to dealing with rain water (she was still recovering after Ember\u2019s second \u2018group bathing\u2019 intrusion, which added to her water phobia). \u201cUh, n-nothing! We should probably report to the dinning hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Midnight sighed, adjusting the uniform to put it on the edge of decency in hopes that she could get Walker\u2019s attention. \u201cI\u2019m all ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, have you seen Fontina?\u201d Ali asked as the two began to head towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Midnight sighed with a shake of her head. \u201cMy guess is that she\u2019s still in the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Ali stopped and turned towards the bathroom\u2019s door, rapping on the door a few times, \u201cFontina? Are you in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Ali asked through the door while Midnight already left the trio\u2019s bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Fontina grunted from the bathroom. \u201cJ-Just putting on my uniform!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, alright,\u201d Ali replied. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the dining hall so, we\u2019ll see you there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Fontina heard the bedroom door close, she exited the bathroom door \u2013 sighing loudly as she looked over her uniform which at this point seemed to be almost painted on her body! Unlike her two friends, Fontina\u2019s body seemed to be like dough rising in an oven over the week. Her impressive curves only improved over the week, popping several other seams in her attempts to clean. Although her bust and hips had improved, Fontina grimaced at her pillow like stomach and the fact that if she looked down at her body, the beginnings of a double chin were threatening to make themselves known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it boggled the Vaporeon Moemon\u2019s mind, there was no way someone could gain this much weight in a week \u2013 Sure, she expected to gain some weight thanks to the monstrous meals and snacking that Claire had suggested during their \u2018chores\u2019, but she would\u2019ve burned it off during her work\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Perhaps it was this mansion itself and the fact that she wasn\u2019t traveling \u2013 After all, traveling with Midnight and Ali managed to help her burn whatever calories she gained during the travels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it looked like it wasn\u2019t going to be possible to lose weight while she was here\u2026 Unless\u2026 \u201cWalker! He\u2019s basically remained the same weight! I should ask him!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While she was by no means quite the \"fatty\" Ali had played her out to be, the short little pest had insisted on making fun of her at every single bite that she attempted. And Midnight, knowing full well that <i>Ali</i> was the one gaining weight in this situation, she just couldn't seem to place the increasing tightness around her middle... or that small roll of what was probably water weight that peeked over her corset...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid little shrimp.\" Midnight growled along with her stomach to an empty hallway, \"Just because she's getting a little fat doesn't mean that <i>I'm</i> turning into a porker.\" And with a little assistance from her good friend Denial, Midnight was surely right! She was plenty sexy and slender just... a little bit thicker! A growing girl just like she tried to say earlier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'grumble grumble grumble'<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStill, whether she was just growing or not, Midnight sure was hungry. \"Jeez, and that bacon looked <i>so</i> good... just the thought of... oh man.\" the Mighteyena moemon whimpered as she clutched her groaning belly in agony. She had opted to skip most of her breakfast, something that in retrospect was far from the best idea. Especially because even now, had she not seen Ember gobble it up before her very eyes, Midnight's brekkie would be cold and unappetizing. Maybe now that Ali was out of the house with Shera, she could pilfer some grub from the kitchen without arbitration...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking down at the small roll of pudge that had forced itself up past her outfit's corset, Midnight couldn't help but feel a twinge of 'hey wait that's blubber' go down her entire body. Deciding to put a stop to this once and for all, Midnight decided to do the only thing she could: test it. Suddenly stopping in the middle of the hallway, Midnight readied an examinatory finger. With an almost worried look in her eye, she inched the probe closer and closer to her plush middle, \"It's just water weight, it's just water weight...\" she repeated over and over, almost wary of her dismissing it earlier, \"No, it's chocolate sauce, all that food I've been eating has made me fat- no no, it's JUST water weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, before she could even get a solid answer, Midnight's attention was distracted by some very sexy-sounding mumbling. She could place that voice, she <i>knew</i> that voice from somewhere. It was soft, yet masculine. Stern, yet alluring. Those seductive pipes could only belong to one moemon in this entire house: Sexy-Piece-of-ManCake Walker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Midnight's adoration took first priority above everything else. Having gotten used to flirting with men by this point in her life, Midnight's instincts led her to pulling down her top, hiking up her skirt, and reapplying her makeup. She ignored the suffocating embrace that her uniform caused, taking a deep breath (popping several seams) and readjusting her corset. Her superior hearing took command, guiding Midnight to her current target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, on the far left, was Walker's room. She made a mental note of this, because <i>now</i> he couldn't get away from her. Now, she could show up at his door late at night and they could- 'Hey, wait, was that... no, it couldn't be!' she tiptoed quickly towards the door, 'That's not...' but unfortunately it was. The shy, mousey little mumblings that waltzed in the air with Walker's soft yet stinging commands could only belong to the quietest moemon in this household: the Vaporeon moemon (and currently ex-best friend) Fontina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'H-How dare she!!' Midnight gasped, eye actually twitching out of what felt like a minor brain hemmorage, 'Th-That aquatic hussy- a-after all I've done for...' she growled, furious, and put her ear to the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Mmphmmh, mmppmh.\" 's sounded like Walker, but the \"Mememe, me me, mme\" 's had to be Fontina's. Oh she could just imagine all the dirty talk that bispeckled skank was talking her hunk of man-meat into doing!</span></div></div>",

Even in her current plight, the ever-observant bookworm couldn't help but notice just how frilly Walker's room was. If her brother's room was any guide to a room of Walker's personality, she expected a lot more work-out material and metal. But no, everything was lacy and white, including the blanket her sizable rump was squishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalker rolled her eyes, all these girls were really starting to bug her. All day every day it was \"Walker, wanna head back to my room?\" or, \"Walker, why don't you open up more?\" or, \"Hey Walker, are you sure you're Mom's not a Clefairy- because you just took me to the moon.\" seriously, she was getting really sick and tired of having to deal with this new group. And that was just Midnight. The little one was a pest, and this nerdy one was just too quiet. If anything, at least Midnight wasn't all skirmish and meek. Not that she liked that, it was just a whole lot better than glasses-girl here. Taking all of these factors in, it wasn't hard to fathom the depth of the young cross-dressed Absol's response; \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina's heart sank, her chubby face fell to face her defeator, her stomach in all of its pudgy glory. \"O-Oh, o-okay...\" the Vamporeon girl whimpered as she solemnly hopped off of the bed and rose to her feet. Again, Walker just rolled her eyes, \"Good, then get out.\" she said coldly, \"I've got a job to do, you should probably report back to Claire.\" Fontina's head, still hanging low, started to shiver along with the rest of her body, \"A-A-Alright...\" she snivelled, forcing Walker's attention back to the plump young woman as she trod out the door. Was she... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne raise of her head proved that yes, behind those big coke-bottle glasses, Fontina was balling her eyes out. \"Oh jeez, you are <i>not</i> crying!\" Walker hollered as she felt her eyebrows furrow in disdain, \"You are so pathetic!\" This did little to quell Fontina's blubbering; in fact Walker's little outburst only loosened the knobs on her waterworks. \"I-I-I-I'b sorry!\" she squealed, \"I-I-I-It's just dat... I'b gainding zo buch weight and... and... I don'd dow whad to do!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalker wretched, she had little patience for crying chicks. \"Oh come on it's not... well, that uniform does look a little tight and-\" she stopped there, closing her eyes and massaging the well-worn crease between her eyes. \"Look, you wanna come outside with me, that's fine, but I'm not training you since all you'll do is just get in the way.\" she barked, over Fontina's silenced sobbing \"But you can work out, just... I don't know, do what I do.\" she brushed the problem off, moving past the blubbering hourglass to grab some earplugs in preperation for the day ahead with Midnight. \"Just don't make it a habit, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANKYOU!!\" Fontina practically tackled the poor \"boy\" in her joy, thrusting her entire curvage onto his body, \"You've made me so habby, thankyou thankyou!!\" Again, Walker wretched as a slight hint of red crept up on his cheeks, \"Y-Yeah whatever just get off me!\" she hollered, \"Oh Walker!!\" Fontina squealed...<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<i>'Wow... Fontina, who woulda thought?!'</i> Midnight grimmaced as she took a step back from her impaired eavesdropping, <i>'she's just throwing herself at him, and here I thought she was all shy and... reserved!'</i> she took another step, <i>'But... hey, I'm not scared of <u>Fontina</u> of all people, this is far from over!!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'That puffy skank had no idea what she's got coming!'</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the tensions over a small misunderstanding were starting to grow, Ali had different concerns to deal with. The moment that the filling (also known as \u2018Make-Midnight-Self-Conscious\u2019) breakfast was over with, Shera had come up to Ali. At first, Ali thought that Shera was going to have Ali a different job today (hopefully since she literally couldn\u2019t stomach any more \u2018cleaning\u2019 with Ember). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thankfully, that hope came true. Shera did indeed have a different job for the young Quilava Moemon, but it wasn\u2019t the job that Ali would\u2019ve expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of this color?\u201d Shera asked as she fingered some fine cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, red\u2019s always a good color,\u201d Ali replied through an armful of cut cloth that completely covered Ali\u2019s upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Ali, dear, you don\u2019t have to carry the cloth like that,\u201d Shera snickered at her younger co-worker. \u201cYou\u2019ll tire yourself out before we reach the register!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Shera needed to purchase more cloth and fabric, and since it was the Kangaskhan Moemon\u2019s preference to feel and see the cloth in stores \u2013 The two Moemon had traveled via one of the vehicles of the mansion to one of the local towns. Odd thing was, the rainy weather that had trapped the two seemed to continue no matter how far they managed to get away from the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn\u2019t the concern at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Shera, if you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d Ali asked as she poked her head through the armful of cloths and fabrics she was carrying. \u201cBut why exactly do we need all of this? Don\u2019t you have your endless closet of clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera froze for a moment before she turned towards the slightly plumped maid in front of her, \u201cWell, it\u2019s actually for Ember\u2019s sake. You see, she\u2019s getting close to popping out of her usual uniform so I have to make her a new, bigger one. That usually takes a lot of material, and since I had to use a good section for you and your two friends, I had to restock them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was true, Shera had another reason for buying more fabric \u2013 One of those three was holding the materials right this instant. Shera may not have been the sharpest knives in a kitchen, but she was by no means dumb or blind. Over the last week she noticed that all three of the former-guests now turned maids were struggling with their uniforms \u2013 Popping seams, showing more skin than what was originally intended, and Shera was certain that she heard a rip from Fontina (there wasn\u2019t a rip on her uniform yet, so that made Shera assume the worse \u2013 She\u2019d have to get the girls\u2019 measurements again and order some \u2018unmentionables\u2019 for them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the master and his companions who were usually traveling, most of the residents of the mansion had put on pounds. But the only one who seemed to put on weight just as fast as the three girls was Ember herself, this would have to be discussed with the master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShera! Earth to Shera!\u201d Ali yelped making the older Moemon shake her head. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust admiring this fabric,\u201d Shera replied with a smile. \u201cNow then, how about after we pay for this, we get a cup of tea? Wester\u2019s tea maybe good, but I know an excellent caf\u00e9 in this town that can make a tea like no one else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not much of a tea person,\u201d Ali answered with a large bead of sweat rolling down the side of her head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now we\u2019re stuck in a mansion working for a stupid mistake.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli sighed loudly, which in turn made Shera sigh, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Ali, I know things are looking bad for you and your friends. But trust me, once the Master gets back, we\u2019ll be able to discuss this calmly and hopefully things will get better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t really seem to make Ali feel better. So, she kept her eyes out on the grassy plains that were rushing past the large van\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 That\u2019s when Ali noticed something in the not to far distance, several yards ahead of the car on the side of the road, there seemed to be someone walking alongside the road. Ali sat up and lean closer to the window in an attempt to look at the person out in this weather (from what she could see, that person didn\u2019t have an umbrella or a poncho)\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the person just fell to the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShera!\u201d Ali yelped, scaring the older Moemon slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What is it!?\u201d Shera gasped as Ali pointed towards the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just saw someone out there!\u201d Ali answered as Shera began to slow the van to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that the Van came to a stop, Ali slammed open the door (not caring about her hydrophobia at the moment) and ran out to where she saw the person fall. Shera quickly did the same and followed Ali, \u201cW-Wait for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later back in the van\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take too long for the two maids to track down the person who had fallen and bring them back to the van. Tired, wet and just trying to catch their breaths, both Ali and Shera agreed to bring the fallen person to the back of the van and regain their composure there for a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during this time that the two got a good look at the person they had just saved \u2013 which turned out to be a knocked out girl! She was small, petite girl (roughly the same size that Ali was before she reached the mansion) with long white/bluish hair that would reach past her butt if was standing up. The girl looked to be like a doll more than a living being \u2013 With pearl white skin and wearing a weird outfit which resembled that of a blue and white one-piece swimsuit with long blue sleeves that had some weird red lines sewn into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was breathing deeply, but had a flushed face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera placed her hand on the girl\u2019s forehead and gasped, \u201cShe\u2019s got a fever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Should we get to a doctor?\u201d Ali asked as Shera stood up and made her way to the front seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re only twenty minutes from the mansion,\u201d Shera answered as she jumped into the seat, buckling the seat belt over her impressive, chubby frame. \u201cThe town\u2019s over an hour, remember? We\u2019ve got medical supplies back at the mansion! So, I\u2019m going to punch it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wha\u2026\u201d Ali started to question until Shera slammed her foot into the gas pedal, sending the car tires screeching loudly and making Ali fall back into the cloths. \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Midnight's eyebrows strained upwards, seeming genuinely concerned for the petite moemon, \"I hope so, the poor little thing's been through a lot today.\" It was terrible, the tiny girl just laid there in bed; tossing and turning, letting out the occassional murmer, sometimes even kicking her legs. \"She sure doesn't look too good, maybe I should go over there and give her another blanket?\" Fontina nodded and smiled, proud of Midnight's new motherly developments towards the injured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, she's really looking bad...\" Midnight said, concerned for the tiny moemon underneath the bedsheets, \"Look at her, she's sweating!\" Fontina panicked, lifting her hand from atop her exposed forehead, \"Midnight, get me something cold?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe addressed Mightyena moemon growled underneath her breath, still not all too sure as to where she and Fontina stood now that she had learned that the latter was a filthy horn-dog. That part wasn't too disturbing, what was irking her was the chubby Vaporeon's business with Walker; <i>her</i> claim! \"How about your ice-cold heart, ya banshee...\" she mumbled, only for Fontina to turn around at the utterance of her friend's addressing. \"Hm, what?\" she asked innocently, \"O-Oh nothing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the haughty hottie came back with a towel drenched in icewater, slathering it atop the pale forehead belonging to their patient. She squirmed, not quite taking the exposure to water very well. \"Oh... oh jeez, she doesn't like water- you know that!!\" Fontina hollered, splashing the droplets off of her friend's head. Midnight snickered, \"Yeah, I know, I just couldn't resist.\" she grinned maliciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the tiny frame shot up from underneath the blankets, her short black hair a little matted from Midnight's treatment. \"GASP... Y-Y-YOU KNOW I HATE WATER, YOU POORLY PEDIGREE'D SKANK!!\" she shouted immediately, raising a fist in anger to threaten Midnight. \"Well, looks like you're cured from your little scare shock.\" Midnight answered plainly, standing erectly and allowing her belly to pooch out in a parabola. \"Wh-What?\" Ali answered, actually too confused to insult the obvious paunch Midnight was growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, Shera told us all about it.\" Fontina answered, sitting down next to the out-of-uniform Ali on the bed, \"Apparantly, you freaked out after finding that girl passed out in the fields.\" Ali sweatdropped, remembering now that she was perfectly fine with finding someone out in the rain with a growing fever. What <i>actually</i> made her faint was Shera's crazy driving. \"Hey I'm no wuss for stuff like that!\" she hollered, \"It was Shera and her road rage!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight and Fontina looked at each other questionably. \"Shera? No way!\" Midnight chorffled, \"Yeah, you must have had a bad dream, she doesn't have a mean bone in her body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" the addressed Kangaskahn moemon cleared her throat in the doorway, seemingly the only employee choosing to remain in her uniform at such late of an hour. \"I'm glad to hear you all think so highly of me!\" she said in her usual pleased-as-punch manner, \"And I'm even more glad to hear that you're feeling better Ali, you had us all pretty concerned over you- Oh, Ember saved you some popcorn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Popcorn?\" Midnight quirked an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember?\" Fontina asked meekly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember SAVED food?\" Ali asked, just as confused as her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm pretty shocked myself.\" Shera giggled, \"Anywho, I just came to check up on you, and to tell you that our newest guest is feeling better as well, if not just a little bit quiet.\" Ali shot up again, her natural concern overtaking her swimmy head, \"Th-that's great, where is she?!\" she stood up to her feet a little too quickly, noticing that she had been dressed in her pajamas (hopefully Ember had nothing to do with that; something about her got under Ali's skin) \"W-Woah...\" she slurred, almost falling back to the bed's cushiony comfort, \"I-I don't feel so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you get right back into bed, Ali.\" Shera scolded her lightly, waddling over to the smaller girl's side and tucking her back into bed, \"You can take tomorrow off until you feel better, but for now you need your rest.\" Ali, Midnight, and Fontina gulped- it almost seemed like Shera <i>wanted</i> them to stay here forever; flaunting a break in front of Ali's face like that! That was a whole day's paycheck in the toilet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and...\" Shera smiled lightly as she plopped down next to the indentured maid, \"As for our mystery girl...\"</span></div></div>",

She had heard from Shera that it was Ali who had found her in the field when she collapsed, and had rushed out to help her. A total stranger helping her was a foreign concept to this young, mysterious Moemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you girls will get along well,\u201d Shera announced, making Kyrie jump slightly. \u201cFor now though, we should probably let Ali get some rest.

While the Quilava moemon was much calmer now that she had already been awoken, she still couldn't shake the occassional recurring nightmare that was Shera's terrible driving. But even then, as her tiny body kicked lazilly in its heavy slumber, Ali remained asleep and (for the most part) at peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she wasn't shivering from the occassional draft that spirited itself into her room or moving about in a correographed to her current dream, Ali actually got some well-deserved sleep after a long and hectic day; unwinding thoroughly in her dream world. Currently locked in a world of fantasy and makebelieve (namely one where she sported a 36DD bra), the tiny fire-type snoozed happily for the first time in quite a while. A hot blush materialized on her face, not because of her illness but because of all the hot guys suddenly swarming around her otherworldly self, a tall and fiery Typhlosion moemon with curves in all the right places...<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n'Mmm... why yes, I think I'll take you up on that offer, a date sounds wonderful/'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh thanks, I am pretty beautiful aren't I?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gee you really know how to spoil a girl, don't you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oops! My skirt just <u>happened</u> to get caught over this active vent!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" she grinned contentedly, perfectly happy with the idea of living out her days in this fantasy realm. What was so much better in this world than the other one? In the real world, she owed a blue-coo billion dollars to her new master and acted as a houseservant! No, this world seemed much nicer; one without the household, one with the freedom she hadn't stopped craving of the open road and travelling, a world where guys flocked to <i>her</i> instead of Midnight. And so she would for as long as she could! At least for tonight anyway. Maybe dream another, even better dream tomorrow! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli's smile grew even wider as the pleasant escapades of Dream Ali filled her conciousness. Dreams were always fun, they could take her anywhere she wanted to go! In fact, maybe that's just what she should- <i>'Hey, what's that smell?'</i> both Alis pondered to themselves, smelling the exact same- somehow familiar aroma. It smelled just like dinner; a rich, fancy dinner that was surely served to someone besides her. A bluebeard sociallite deserved the wonderful meal that belonged to that smell, not either of the Alis present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait, there it was! Right in front of the tall, slender makebelieve moemon's nose- a chicken cordon bleu sandwich dipped in cheese! At first she resisted, but Dream Ali found herself munching away at the glorious treat floating in front of her. It was delicious, the real world Quilava moemon licked her lips as she savored the imaginary tastes that she was fabricating. Until another smell hit her nose, this time one of... mashed potatos and gravy with leftover bacon from the cordon bleu! Ali licked her lips enviously at the light fluffy spuds that her dream self got to devour instead of her! But wait, another smell; this time something rolled around in batter! It was... Wester's Special Baked Falafal? That was odd, seeing as how she'd never met Wester before. Wait, Wester, that sounded familiar... who cares, chow time! Dream Ali was happy to cast aside the confusion for another bite. Some sautee'd mushrooms? Sounds yummy! Calabash Chicken? Pile it on! By this point drool was pooling in the side of Ali's cheek! Fluffy golden baked biscuits? Everything sounded great to Dream Ali's newfound appetite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait... it had come at a cost! Dream Ali's slender figure had ballooned! Literally; she was a Wailord! What was once a skinny (though imaginary) frame had expanded outwards in an exaggerated balloon fashion, her face sprouting multiple chins that rested on her enormous breasts! Her butt, prized throughout the dream, was a jiggling mass that kept her on the ground; far too fat to even lift! She looked like... she looked like Ember! Ali started shivering again, eyebrows creasing as her ideal self continued to swell and expand, growing fatter and fatter; and dumber and dumber, only craving more and more food to fill her gluttonous demands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she stopped, a massive and unrecognizable form of such scale that Ali's mental camera had to pan out to get everything. The once smart, sexy dream Ali was just a big behemoth who kept eating and eating until... she grabbed the camera. \"MOAR!!\" she cried before Ali woke up in a jolt...</span></div></div>",

Sitting up so quickly must have startled the young china-doll girl, explaining why she had backed away so far from Ali's sitting position. Currently, still in her bathrobe mind you, Kyrie stood at the foot of Ali's sickbed with a concerned look in her bright yellow eyes. She didn't say a word, only continuing to stare at Ali like a foreigner who hadn't learned the language of a country she was trapped in. Feeling sympathy, Ali smiled, ignoring the cold sweat she had awoken into and mustering up all the kindness in her heart. \"Hey Kyrie, you feeling better?\" she cooed softly, making sure to touch her still slender (for the most part) arm for confirmation as to reality and sighing in relief. The teensy mystery type peeked out from the bedframe slightly, nodding gently as confirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a familiar smell hit Ali's nose... that was... Chicken Cordon Bleu! And mashed potatos, and cheese, mushrooms and... everything! Everything Ali had just dreamed about was currently flooding into her sinuses like a traffic jam! Ignoring the little girl for a second, Ali started to shiver and grow wary of her surroundings, making <i>very</i> sure she wouldn't start ballooning up like her dreaded dream what-if. However, her stomach had other ideas, not caring as to whether or not Ali blew up like a Quilfish or not; and it accentuated that point with a loud rumble. It startled not only Ali, wary of sudden obesity, but also Kyrie, who ducked back behind the bedframe with a frightened <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"eep!\"</font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli laughed, turning a deep red as she tried to coax the cowardly girl from her bunker. \"Oh, hey, come on now I just skipped dinner that's all, it was just my stomach!\" she said softly, rubbing her stomach to prove her point (which almost seemed to pur as Ali stroked it) \"Mmm, see, I'm just a little hungry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie's expression softened, her fear being replaced by cautious relaxation before a sudden spark of realization took her. The girl left the room for a second before coming back in while straddling a large plate of food; yup, all the meals Ali had dreamed about alright! Ali was taken aback at the sheer enormity of it all, \"O-Oh thanks Kyrie, but I-I-I well I couldn't, I just-\" but she was cut off by Kyrie's gentle presentation of a single bowl of chicken noodle soup. Just from the shape of the noodles, Ali could determine that this wasn't store-bought... Shera had made this for her. \"Oh... thank you so much Kyrie, and tell Shera thank you too!\" she choked back tears of happiness, no one short of her brother and Fontina had ever done anything so nice for her, she wasn't really quite used to it... and for the girl she rescued earlier in the day to bring it to her gave her such a rewarded feeling deep inside of her fiery belly. \"But hey, Kyrie, if all I get's the chicken soup, who's all this dinner for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and shyly, Kyrie took a step back from her savior. It was almost cute how she snuggled up into her too-large bathrobe in her cowardice, in her adorable meekness. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"M-M-Me...\"</font> she said weakly, Ali having to remain pefectly quiet just to hear her <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"A-A-A-And y-you...\"</font> she managed, <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"B-But I don't really-\" </font>Ali smiled warmly and made room for the shy girl, scooting over in the spacious bed that she and Fontina shared and patting the now free space beside her. \"Hey come on, I don't think I could finish all that if I tried!\" she said innocently, patting the space again, \"Hop up, it's your dinner too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie just stood there for a second, like she was processing the new information before acting on it. She elegantly tiptoed over to the bed before meekly taking her seat beside Ali, hands folded politely in her lap. As she shivered in her seat, absolutely terrified of being in such a new position, the bathrobe fell slightly off of her left shoulder; revealing her pale doll skin and a good majority of her long seafoam hair. <i>'Wow, she's really... pretty!'</i> Ali couldn't help but comment to herself, accidentlally catching a glimpse of Kyrie's small busom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kyrie smiled at Ali's warmth and generosity. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Thank you...\"</font></span></div></div>",

Kyrie had been taking small bites of everything herself, and wasn't in much of a hurry to eat too much, her appetite's size seeming to match her tiny figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on and Ali had finished all of her soup, which had been heavenly by the way, she was surprised to find that despite eating a pretty large helping of chicken soup (the bowls in this mansion were Shera sized after all) her stomach still gave off a loud rumble, practically begging her for more as the Quilava moemon felt pangs of hunger hit her as though she hadn't eaten anything at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing furtively at the rest of the spread she noticed that Kyrie hadn't eaten much, but had seemed contented with the amount she had eaten already, which left a lot of the food intact. Ali felt herself begin to drool at the sight of the succulent chicken cordon bleu, the rich, creamy mashed potatoes with melted cheese on top, not to mention the desserts, pastries of all kind piled next to the plate! It all looked so <i>GOOD!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli shook her head clear of those traitorous thoughts. Here she was, going crazy about this food when she was trying not to become a whale of a moemon! She crossed her arms and turned away from the food in defiance. There was no way she was going to give in! No matter how scrumptious the food may be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled in annoyance, making her eye twitch slightly, yet she remained steadfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach roared a little louder, this time accompanied by a few pangs of hunger. This time, a bead of sweat rolled down her face as she spared a glance back at the feast behind her. Through a tremendous effort of will however, she remained firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a third and final time her stomach rumbled, though it practically roared at her this time, demanding to be sated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay fine!</i> She thought angrily, glaring down at the offending organ as she spun around, <i>I'll eat a little more!</i> Without pause, she picked her fork back up and dug into the mashed potatoes. Once that was done she moved onto the main entree with little signs of quitting, her previous fear of becoming a fatty overwhelmed by her newly found voracious nature. Deep within her mind as she kept mindlessly devouring the food her brain had conjured up the reason for her gluttony as simply making sure that Shera's goodwill wasn't going to waste, or something of that nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Kyrie was watching with shock. She had eaten only a little bit of food, never having been a moemon with much of an appetite. Ali hadn't seemed much bigger than her though, and yet here her friend was, going through an entire feast as though she was eating for two or three moemon all at once! Kyrie smiled, not being one to judge, since she was happy just spending time with her savior and new found friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after Ali had licked every plate clean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh...\" The fiery red-head groaned, rubbing her severely distended gut. She couldn't believe that she'd eaten that much food, and somewhere in the back of her mind she felt like maybe eating all that food hadn't been the best choice, but as the lethargic yet contented feeling in her body reminded her, she probably couldn't have stopped eating even if she had wanted to. The food had been so good! Now though? It was all packed into her swollen belly, which on her smaller frame gave the impression of a moemon who coming to the end of their second trimester, the pale skin already peeking out from her bathrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt herself falling into the familiar sleepy feeling of a food coma, which she noted seemed to be happening more and more as of late, she mumbled some form of a good night to Kyrie and fell fast asleep. The Kyogre moemon simply giggled and chose to lay down next to her friend, since she was feeling pretty tired herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs our two heroines slept... </span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t want to admit it, but that dream didn\u2019t sit well with her, and the less she ate, the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, aside from the munching through the air, the room was quiet. Although, it seemed like Kyrie was just enjoying being with Ali\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Kyrie,\u201d Ali started, making the china-doll like Moemon jump slightly on the bed. \u201cSorry! I didn\u2019t mean to scare you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Kyrie smiled slightly with a cold bead of sweat rolling down the side of her head. \u201c<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s alright\u2026\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just wondering,\u201d Ali continued, a small blush on her face for scaring her new friend. \u201cWhat were you doing out there in the fields?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie blinked a few times as she thought about the question, her bright golden eyes glazing over slightly as she went deeper into her thoughts. This went on long enough that Ali herself had finished her bowl of soup and began to dig into mashed potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until, <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cUm, I\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026 D-D-D-Don\u2019t really know\u2026 I could b-b-b-barely remember m-my name</font>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmnesia?\u201d Ali questioned, through a mouthful of mashed potatoes. \u201cOh well, at least you\u2019re alright, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get your memory back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie nodded back in reply\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another large dinner, both Fontina and Midnight were walking through the halls, both of them with a broom in one hand and a dust pan in the other. The only thing that the two had to do left for the day was to sweep the first floor, and while it was an easy job, on a full stomach, it made the task a little more difficult. Even more so that Midnight was glaring at Fontina from behind the voluptuous Vaporeon Moemon\u2019s backside (which seemed to fill out more of the maid uniform than it did this morning for some reason, not that Midnight noticed). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018\u2026 I just don\u2019t get it, why would MY Walker would be interested in Fontina?</i>\u2019 Midnight thought as she leaned against her broom, watching as Fontina actually did the job. \u2018<i>Sure she\u2019s got some better curves than me, but she keeps them hidden most of the time! Who the hell wants some frumpy\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Midnight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mentioned Moemon snapped from her hateful thoughts to realize that Fontina was looking at her right now, gleaming her eyes at her behind those large glasses. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Midnight growled, taking the broom in her hand as she began to sweep the hallway, in a rather violent fashion. \u201cJust peachy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina was a smart Moemon, and she knew something was wrong with Midnight (sure, it seemed like her uniform was getting a bit tight on her, and the fact that the three were stuck here would put anyone on the edge), but the Mightyena Moemon seemed to be a bit more hostile this evening\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidnight, if there\u2019s something wrong, please, you can tell me,\u201d Fontina sighed, a look of pure concern in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 You really wanna know what\u2019s pissing me off?\u201d Midnight snarled stopping her sweeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, we\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Fontina asked with a warm smile on her chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026\u201d Midnight growled as she spun around and barred her teeth at the Vaporeon. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, ya backstabber!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Fotina gasped at the outburst...</span></div></div>",

Midnight stomped her foot in an infuriated fashion and stiffened her arms like a child. She opened her mouth as if to speak, only for a loud ripping sound to fill the hallways which they traversed. Both girls grew pale and wide-eyed at the sharp sound of stiches giving way and fabric getting pulled apart by only their healthy bodies. Both of the two were far more acquainted with busting bras, but never... clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were silent as both Fontina and Midnight awaited the moment of truth between them; what had caused that rip? Had it been Midnight's swelling yet succulent figure that had pushed her uniform too far, or was it Fontina's slowly expanding physique? Both were quiet, neither of them wanting to face the fact that one of them might have finally busted out of their uniforms... all this rich, fattening cuisine surely had its downsides...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-U-U-Uh...\" Midnight stammered, struggling to catch her mind back on track, \"I-I-I'll, uh, tell you what's been bugging me...!\" she said with considerably less enthusiasm than the last time, a cold sweat rolling down the side of her face. Fontina couldn't muster a word, not only was she being harrassed by one of her oldest and dearest friends, but there was a chance that she might finally have undone all of her hard work on her diet; having gotten too fat to fit in these uniforms! \"W-W-Well why don't you tell me then...?\" Fontina struggled to form a coherent answer, little to no faith in herself or her figure at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight moved her arm, only to feel a slight breeze that wasn't there before. It ran down her side and ticked her slight muffin top caused by her tight stockings and contricting belt. She wavered in her rage, fighting off the blush that tried to force its way onto her demeanor; meant to be foul. \"Y-Y-You... and, uh...\" she found herself unable to formulate the sentences in her mind now as she felt the cold air slide up from her waist to brush up against the bottom of her left breast, causing her to remain in her ridiculous, childish stance with her appendages kept vertical at her side, \"W-W-W-Walker!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina was experiencing similar weakness in her morale, putting her even more timid than usual, as she felt the backside on her dress give way. The collar of her dress, elegantly sewn and patterned, had ripped slightly in an almost unnoticable fashion in order to give way to her newer flabbier neck. Her belt had tightened, the used fastening slot grown worn and stretched. But most noticably was the breeze she was experiencing as well, weaving up the backside and wrapping around her plush middle. \"Wh-Wh-What are you...\" Fontina shuddered, being very careful not to invoke any more torture upon her uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Midnight, Fontina was fully aware that she had been growing; whereas if Midnight weren't reminded by a certain washboardy rat, her natural confidence and flirtatious nature would overcome. But despite awareness on Fontina's part, there was one thing that she failed to analyze about the situation... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Midnight had riped their uniforms at the exact same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Midnight started to back away as if something had frightened her. \"Y-You know, I can't even l-look at you right now, Fontina!\" she lied for her own sake, better to be in a fitting uniform when she chewed out her former friend. \"Th-Th-That's not fair...\" Fontina mumbled, backing away herself as her eyes softened behind her coke-bottle glasses. She was used to Midnight being mad at Ali but never at her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Midnight scurried off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Gotta find Shera... then Walker... then maybe Wester...

But you wouldn\u2019t catch Shera, one of the head maids of this manor, complaining about the job. Nope, it just wasn\u2019t in her nature to complain about the job, especially after the master was so kind to provide the Kangaskhan Moemon with a job, a roof over her head, and even give her a room to work on her sewing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, incidentally is where she was at the moment, working on a few remakes of a few certain maid outfits. It was something that she had set out to do after managing to get the materials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part she was done with Ali\u2019s and Fontina\u2019s new uniforms (making them at least two and a half sizes bigger than originally), and all that left was Midnight\u2019s maid uniform, which would probably be a bit more difficult to recreate since the Mightyena had all those additional features and some pieces were cut out. Throw in the fact that the curvaceous Mightyena Moemon was having her own growing concerns\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShera!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera turned from her sewing machine and turned towards the door to her large closet of clothes to see Midnight walking into the room with her left hand clutching on the tighter looking uniform on her milky chocolate body. One look told Shera what she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight had ripped her uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there Midnight,\u201d Shera greeted with a warm smile on her face as Midnight finally reached her. \u201cWhat brings you to my corner of the mansion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Midnight was about to answer quickly, but immediately shut her mouth, not willing to admit that she had ripped the uniform \u2013 even though the rip was quite large and visible, but she wasn\u2019t going to admit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I needed some advice,\u201d Midnight huffed with a little twinge of red. \u201cAnd I was thinking you\u2019d be willing to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera smiled brightly, \u201cOf course, dear. As long as you and your friends are working in this mansion, you\u2019ll be considered family. And actually, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I was making some spare uniforms for you and your friends. I finished your friends\u2019 just a moment ago, and I wanted to look at yours to make sure I had the right style for it. So, why don\u2019t you go change into one of the bathrobes I\u2019ve got in here, hand me your uniform and we\u2019ll talk while I work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that sound good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Shera started as she began her work on Midnight\u2019s spare (and larger uniform). \u201cWhat is it you wanted to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow dressed in a large fluffy white robe that was completely covering her milky chocolate body, Midnight was seated on the ground near Shera. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll come out and say it. Shera, what kind of women does Walker like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that got Shera to stop her sewing, blinking a few times at the younger Moemon, <i>\u2018\u2026 Walker\u2026 I knew this would happen if she kept dressing like a man. I suppose I should tell Midnight here about it.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear, I think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause, no matter how many sexy poses I shoot his way, he only brushes them off!\u201d Midnight continued with a huffed face. \u201cAnd then earlier, I heard Fontina in his room with him in it\u2026 And well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Midnight couldn\u2019t say what she thought had happened behind the closed doors. But this only continued to puzzle Shera, <i>\u2018\u2026 Is Walker actually like that?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously though, is Walker into girls like Fontina?\u201d Midnight asked. \u201cSeriously, I\u2019ve been traveling with that watery nerd for a few years and she\u2019s never been willing to take initiative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I don\u2019t think Walker really has much of a taste for girls,\u201d Shera replied as she continued with her work. \u201cBut, I have to ask, what makes you think that your friend and Walker are\u2026 in a relationship?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, I overheard them in Walker\u2019s room earlier,\u201d Midnight answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but did you ask Fontina or Walker about it?\u201d Shera asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike they\u2019d really tell me,\u201d Midnight replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe you\u2019re just mistaken,\u201d Shera commented as she continued her sewing. \u201cI\u2019ve know you girls for a while now, and I\u2019m a good judge of character, I doubt that Fontina would do something like that. And if you\u2019ve been traveling with her and Ali, wouldn\u2019t you three have a deeper trust between each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight was about to retort, but she had to admit that Shera had a point. And the Kangaskhan Moemon continued, \u201cDear, I\u2019ve been on this world for a good while, and you shouldn\u2019t let a good friendship get broken over something that could be a simple misunderstanding. I suggest that after I finish with your uniform, that you should get yourself a glass of milk from the kitchen, head back to your room and sleep on the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen in the morning, after you have a cleared head, ask Fontina about the matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Midnight had to give that one to Shera\u2026 Besides, it\u2019d be good excuse to sneak some more cookies from the kitchen as well\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The late-night darkness enveloped the room, like draping the entire room under a curtain. There was barely a trace of the outside world with the drapes drawn to keep out that pesky sun in the morning. But even if they had been left to flutter about, the sky outside was almost as black as it was in here! Normally, no one with a 9-5 job would experience this harsh degree of darkness. But it would seem that Fontina, our meek and watery heroine, had stayed up late enough to experience this level of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't because she wanted to, she wanted anything but a crash tomorrow afternoon. She couldn't get to sleep, plain and simple. There was nothing more to it, except for the gnawing psychological experience of rapid bloating, impending poverty and the feeling one gets when their best friend is scaldingly upset with them. Had they been experienced individually, Fontina may have been able to shrug each of them off much easier. But the weight of a piano (or perhaps a Snorlax, since this is a pokemon based story) seemed to rest upon her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay stiffly in bed, tucked in nice and neat, and didn't think to move a muscle as she stared blankly yet solemnly at the ceiling. <i>'Oh... my life is hell...'</i> she said to herself, never one to actually complain about anything. She took a deep breath, only to marvel at how far her swollen sweaterpuppies forced the quilt into the air, sending her deeper into melancholy. What's worse yet, Fontina was far too meek to turn on one of the bedside lamps so that she could at least thumb through a few of the books from the library, lest wake up her bedside comrade Ali. So all she could do was sit here and think about all of her troubles and wallow in them like she Grumpig she was becoming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed quietly and rolled over onto her side, <i>'I can't live like this, I'm going to go crazy if I just sit here all by myself without anything to do!'</i> she thought frettingly, <i>'Maybe, just maybe, if I'm quiet enough I can speed walk down to the library and that'll solve two of my problems...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporen moemon silently unblanketed herself and gave the remainder of the quilt to Ali before stumbling about in the dark for her slippers. Thanks to a draft, a portion of the curtain gave way to the slight luminosity that was outside, making her stumbling a little bit more about her own lack of coordination and less about the growing darkness. Had her room been hardwood, like it was <i>supposed</i> to be before Midnight taken the back room all to herself, this would have been much harder. But luckilly, her rubber-soled bedtime footwear had decided to get stuck right next to eachother as she kicked them off after her hard day's work and clung to the carpet. She snatched her glasses beside the alarmclock, fiddled with them for a second before managing to get the arms out, and placed the coke bottle lenses on her head. At least something was going right for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, curse her recent string of bad luck, the draft soon faded and the curtain fell back over the window; cutting off her primary, though meager, source of light. <i>'Oh crap.'</i> she borrowed one of Ali's trademarks, <i>'How am I supposed to, oh wait, my headlamp!'</i>. Fontina would rummage about on the end table before finally feeling the long, metallic neck of the booklight Ali had gotten her so long ago. \"Yes!\" she said proudly to herself, feeling the bad times just melt away as she clung to the cold metal luminator. Quickly, she turned it on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for a ridiculously powerful flash of light to emenate from the tiny bulb! It blinded her, apparantly she had faced it towards her in the darkness, and she let out a tiny yelp. \"Nngh....cut dat thing off, wouldja?\" Ali mumbled, grabbing her double covers and pulling them closer to her as she rolled over. \"Sorry...\" Fontina squeaked, flicking the off switch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll just use this when I get in the hallway...'<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nIf during the day, the stormy season no less, the mansion's hallways were dark and hard to see in then the night was just Hell. Only now did Fontina grow to appreciate the dim lighting that the flickering bulbs provided, and how much of a necessity they really were. But luckilly, now that there were no small echidna-esque moemon to blindsight with her super-powered headlight, Fontina had her very own light to guide her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have looked like a mess; her blue hair mussed from tossing and turning in the bed, pajamas tight fitting, morning breath, and a somewhat antennae looking device wrapped around her forehead that blinded people. But who was going to see her? Besides, she needed to get up and do something before she went crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling that to herself over and over again, perhaps as an excuse for staying up so late and stumbling about like a madwoman in the dark in search of things that would keep her awake even longer, Fontina quietly trudged on. She winced every time one of the floorboards creaked underneath her. At first, it was because she was afraid that she was going to wake up. Then, after reaching a hallway that wasn't inhabited, it turned into worrying over whether or not she had woken someone up and they were following her. But after that it just reminded her of her weight, which in turn made her feel every time her jelly rolls wobble and her breasts bounce up and down even more than she had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were terrible in Fontina's head, things that were usually so nice and organized in there had been knocked over due to the inconsiderance of her poor self-esteem. But it wasn't hard to catch Fontina on one of these spells, just ask Midnight and Ali. She was a smart girl, but when she got down on herself, she really took it all the way and got into full-blown depression! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut depressed or not, Fontina always loved books. They took her mind off of the things that troubled her in her life (that, granted, was usually made hectic due to her friends.) Fontina was never one to complain about anything to anybody, substituting a good complaint with a nice cozy nook to read in. Which is why she had decided on this place, the library, to settle her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... the lights are on....\" the volumptuous moemon remarked as she cracked the doorway. Either way, company or not, Fontina was getting a book whether she looked like a slob or not. Whoever her fellow midnight bookworm was, they had better not be in the mood for conversation... okay, maybe just a little. She never was one to be mean.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, the water Moemon crept up to the door and peered into the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take Fontina long to figure out who was in the library, especially since the culprit was standing in front of some of the same shelves that Fontina had looked over a week ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mythology section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was none other than that Kyrie girl that Ali and Shera had brought earlier to the mansion, looking over some of the books that were on the shelf.

Kyrie\u2019s eyes nearly bugged out as she staggered back at the sudden appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful!\u201d Fontina gasped as she caught Kyrie before the smaller girl bumped into the bookcase. \u201cWhew\u2026 We didn\u2019t need a big mess to clean up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie blushed slightly as she and Fontina stepped away from the bookcase, allowing the taller Moemon to hold the book towards Kyrie, \u201cAnd here\u2019s your book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Kyrie took the book from her new acquaintance, \u201c\u2026 T-Thank you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Fontina replied with her a smile on her face. \u201cAlthough, I have to wonder, any reason why you\u2019re in here tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I wanted to\u2026 To read s-something\u2026\u201d Kyrie answered sheepishly, with her head lowering down to the ground. \u201cC-Couldn\u2019t sleep\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina\u2019s smile grew brighter, at least through all her troubles there was another person who shared her love for reading, \u201cWell, I myself couldn\u2019t sleep. Would it be too much trouble if I were to join you in your reading?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, the nervousness in Kyrie\u2019s face disappeared into a small cute smile, but then was covered up as the bathrobe wearing Moemon lifted up the book she had in her hands, \u201c\u2026 N-No\u2026 Its f-f-fine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Fontina began to search for a book to help calm her nerves for the late night\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyrie quietly took her seat near Fontina, something admirabe since there were no actual seats near the aquatic moemon. Instead of dragging one of the many chairs available, though a little too far out of reach of Fontina for her sake, Kyrie struggled to climb the small mountain of unshelved tomes and awaited her new friend's selection. She held her legs still as they dangled off of her mountain of books and crossed her arms daintilly, holding her head low and eyes up as she patiently waited on Fontina to make her decision. Her long turquoise hair brushed against the book in her lap, \"Our Raging Seas: Collector's Edition\", as it cascaded down from her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Fontina's plump posterior turned around to show a satisfied, though slumber worn moemon with a promisingly thick book in her hands; \"Back You Filthy Mongrels: Tales of Peasant Revolt in Old Johto\". She beamed widely at the prospect of finding such a critically acclaimed book, her excitement clearly visible in her newly formed dimples. \"Look Kyrie, first edition!\" she cooed over her 900-page conquest. Kyrie raised her head slightly and flashed a timid smile, \"Th-That's a nice book...\" she peeped. Fontina squealed, \"Oh I know, I've heard such good things about it, I've wanted to read it ever since I was a little girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina started to excitedly climb the stepladder until she was at about eye-level with Kyrie, lowering her plump rearend on the padded metal and snuggling up; her new beau of a book distracting her from the sizable amount of thigh squeezing from the railway on the ladder. As the blue haired moemon flipped past the table of contents, already lost in her new book, Kyrie looked on in confusion. \"W-What're you doing?\" she asked meekly. Fontina looked up, confused at the strange young girl's even stranger question, \"What do you mean?\" she quirked her head and let out a little smile, \"I thought you said I could read with you?\" The porcelain girl felt herself quiver, \"O-Oh, it's just... there's some chairs over there a-and you shouldn't... well, you know, you'll get hurt if you fall off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina looked to her left, sure enough there <i>were</i> three plush armchairs that either of them could have used instead of their rather rickety choices of seating. Fontina chuckled a bit, \"Hey, you're the one sitting on books Kyrie.\" she addressed the frail girl jokingly, only for her to hang her head even lower than before. \"Oh, but hey, we could <b>both</b> sit over there if you want!\" Fontina panicked, leaning forward slightly to get her attention, \"You know, so neither of us fall off and get hurt!\" Kyrie's head rose to reveal a slivered smile and a slight blush, \"O-Okay...\" she said quietly as both she and her new plump friend climbed down their respective towers to commune at the safer (and undoubtedly more comfortable) seating arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie took tiny, slow steps as she trudged along the carpet; by the time she had reached her seat, Fontina was just waiting on her by the chairs! Slowly and in an embarrassed fashion, Kyrie lowered her tiny body into the armchair on the far left, somewhat suprised when Fontina took the middle one and letting out a small squeak. \"What's wrong?\" Fontina asked, leaning over her book to address the timid mystery-mon. \"N-Nothing, I um... just sat on a needle.\" she lied, wary of confessing her initial wariness of Fontina's easy-going attitude towards her. \"Oh, well would you rather switch seats, I don't feel anything in my chair.\" Not that she could, with a booty so well insulated, \"N-No, b-but thank you... Fontina, is that your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe addressed Vaporeon moemon smiled, \"Yeah, that's right.\" she said proudly, \"I hope you're name's Kyrie, otherwise I've just made myself look like a real dork.\" they shared an innocent giggle, \"Y-Yeah, my name's Kyrie, you're not a dork.\" Fontina laughed, sending her full breasts up and down with each breath, \"Oh I'm a dork, don't let me fool you.\" she said innocently, \"And lately I've been such a klutz, plus you know I'm getting kinda chubby lately.\" she instantly covered her mouth, why did she just throw that into innocent conversation? That was so akward, why couldnt she just keep her big mouth shut about things that no one else wanted to talk about?! Now Kyrie was just going to think she was fishing for compliments and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think you're chubby.\" Kyrie said softly, cutting off Fontina's internal debate amongst herself, \"I-I think that you're... really pretty...\" she blushed, fearing her own social incompetance would have chased off one of the nicest people she'd met in a very long time. Fontina blushed too, half-expecting the little girl to just patronize her or just avoid the question entirely... but pretty? \"Oh thanks Kyrie, that means a lot coming from someone who's so cute!\" At this, Kyrie's already delicate demeanor exploded in a flurry of red, burgundy, and even purple. No one had ever really complimented her like that before. At least, she couldn't remember anyone doing so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Th-Thank you.\" the turquoise headed girl said in a normal tone of voice. She was actually loud enough to startle Fontina somewhat, considering just how quiet she'd been this entire time. \"So, do you have any clothes, I've only seen you in that bathrobe since Shera took you out of the infermary.\" Kyrie shook her head a resounding 'no', \"I-I don't have anything really, Ms. Shera said that- that she'd make me some clothes... I told her she didn't have to but...\" she traied off, looking away and tapping her fingers innocently over her still unopened tome of the sea. Fontina's expression saddened, \"Oh, that's awful, you don't have anything?\" she sympathized with the young moemon, especially after having to split \"nothing\" three ways with Midnight and Ali during their travelling days. Kyrie lowered he rhead again, seeing that this train of conversation was putting a downer on the already quite akward conversation the two were having, \"N-No, b-but don't be sad about it, M-Ms. Shera said I could st-stay here until things looked up for me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina grimaced somewhat, wary of what might happen to the poor and fragile little girl should her luck be the same as her own party's. \"Yeah, that's how my friends and I wound up here.\" she said, \"You know, Ali and Midnight, did you ever get a chance to talk to them after Ali and She- er, Ms. Shera picked you up?\" Kyrie nodded slowly, \"Y-Yeah, I really like Ali, she was really nice... but Midnight is a little scary... she's so loud...\" Fontina snorted, cutting off Kyrie's description, \"W-What, did I say something funny?\" she stammered, only for Fontina to start roaring, \"Y-You bet you did, it's okay Kyrie, everyone feels that way about Midnight, she's all talk though!\" Kyrie smiled lightly and looked down to her clasped hands, \"I-I'll have to talk to her then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings continued on like this for about an hour or so; two equally shy moemon complimenting eachother and swapping stoeis, each afraid that the last thing they said would scare the other one off. They got along swimmingly. Eventually, the subject of Fontina's indenturement came up into conversation; \"And that's how, once again, one of Ali and Midnight's little squabbles got me into a world of trouble, I don't think we'll <i>ever</i> get out of this mansion at the rate things are going...\" Kyrie ducked down shyly, \"Y-You know, I could... talk to Ms. Shera... to see if I couldn't start... you know, working here to help pay for the vase...\" she stuttered. Fontina was touched, she never expected something like this. But from what she'd heard, the world had been pretty tough on Kyrie, especially since losing her memory. Maybe she was just trying to do her part to make the world a better place? \"Th-Thank you so much Kyrie, but you don't have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Kyrie actually interrupted someone. \"I-I don't mind, I really don't!\" she said with an angelic smile on her face, \"I-I've got nothing better to do, and you really could use the help!\" Fontina felt her eyes start to water, she was just so kind! \"Thank you so much Kyrie!!\" she lunged over the two armrests, her breasts flopping over the flanks and rubbing up against Kyrie's washboard body as she enveloped her friend in a big, warm hug. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yes... I like where this is going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new voice startled both of them, letting out matching squeaks as they immediately let go of eachother. It seemed to come from nowhere, but in a library this large that was surely a ruse. \"Aww!!\" it whined, sounding much less menacing and deep, \"Why'd you stop?!\" Kyrie cowered behind Fontina, forcing the latter to be the begrudgingly brave one of the two. \"Who are you?\" she shouted to the seemingly empty library, \"This isn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's not funny!\" the voice shouted indignantly, sounding much closer now than it did before. Fontina's eyes darted around the room in search of anything strange. Then after realizing that the entire house was strange, training her sight to catch something that didn't belong. She turned around after hearing some footsteps coming from the left side of her, and then turning again when she heard something dropped on the right. As Fontina stared off in front of her, Kyrie took the back in order to double their sight; unfortunately, it was Kyrie who caught the small figure slowly rising from behind one of the bookshelves and it left her too scared to say anything other than \"eep\". The figure took a deep breath and yelled out, \"I KNOW IT'S NOT FUNNY, IT'S <b>HOT</b>!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Fontina spun around with Kyrie desperately clinging to her middle. \"Wh-What the?\" she stuttered, catching sight of the lewd offender as her eyes focused. Even Kyrie peered over the taller girl's shoulder to catch a glimpse of the loudmouth little... eight year old? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was absolutely true; someone of very, very small stature had taken to standing on a lower bookshelf to make themselves seem taller and make their voice echo throughout the library. They were dressed in what <i>looked like</i> a guard's uniform with a few custom attachments like a hood, long flapping sleeves, and elongated cuffs on their pants to drag across the floors of the mansion. Fontina raised one eyebrow questionably, \"Huh?!\" was all she could muster in leiu of an intelligent remark to the little perv. The booming little body jumped down to stand at the top of Fontina's muffin top rather than over her head and pointed at Kyrie, \"Yeah that's right, hug her middle, we need lots more action here!!\" it hollered directly in her face, causing the more timid girl to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think we'll be doing that any time soon!\" Fontina yelled at the indignant adolescent over Kyrie's shrill yelp, \"And stop that, you're scaring her!\" She looked down at the young body; judging strictly by the short black hair this little pervert was a boy. Exactly as she'd figured. \"Hmm... you're right, she doesn't seem like the type to get all hot and bothered when she's scared...\" he crossed his arms and sighed, \"But then again, this is my mansion and I'd like to be entertained here.\" he said plainly, \"But, then again again, how am I supposed to get her to tae her clothes off when she's screaming?\" once more, the erratic young man changed his position, \"But then again again again, that's not necessarilly a bad thing... but then again again again agai-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina took it upon herself to pop this little zit with her upstaged fist. \"Come on Kyrie, I'll take you back to your room.\" she tugged irately at Kyrie's shoulder who could only respond with a snivelling \"O-Okay...\" But after the mere notion of going back to bed was mentioned, another voice came out of the blue to startle Kyrie. \"Oh nice vork Ethel, now ze're going avay!\" the thickly accented rantings seemed to come from the ceiling; where a figure slowly slid into a standing position... upside down. \"You like ladies?\" he smiled, baring fangs in attempted sensuality, \"I asked Shera if she vould put them in, ze vonder of magnets, ah?.\" he chuckled before Ethel threw a book at him, \"THAT'S NOT FAIR, I'M THE COOLEST SO I SHOULD HAVE THE COOLEST SHOES!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethel?!\" Fontina started to blush, \"You mean you're a... a...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M A BOY!!\" he hollered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But certainly not a man.\" the batty man on the ceiling released, his gaurd jacket unfolding to make him more aerodynamic and allowing him to fall to the ground gently, \"Unlike moi, Monsieur Ivan Dracule.\" he flipped the short bangs from his face in (again, attempted) seduction. His shoes tapped loudly somehow on the carpeted section of the library as he made his way over to the lovely ladies in the room. \"My, I do love a voman vith glasses.\" he remarked on his way over, \"Mostly because I can see myselv in zem, but zat's not ze point.\" Fontina narrowed her eyes menacingly at him, never actually one for violence on her part. Somehow, something in the back of her mind told her that was about to change if he kept this up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan Dracule was obviously a Golbat moemon, being too tall and fully grown to be a Zubat. He was tall, pale, and had a cropped haircut. His guard outfit was... mostly unimpressive. It looked like a very nice cross between a police officer's outfit and a halloween costume for the vampire wannabe's. Sure, after reading a certain book in her youth, Fontina would have been all over this phony-bologna vampire, but again that was a long time ago. \"Look, w-why don't we just go?\" Fontina started to struggle, her growing rage unable to be repressed, \"Hey, you two haven't made out yet!!\" Ethel barked loudly. \"Yes I must admit, I vas somevat looking forvard to zat.\" Ivan chuckled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for the door to open abruptly, sending both Ivan and Ethel back to their hideyholes. \"Crap!\" Ethel whispered before disappearing behind the bookshelf. \"Later.\" Ivan said in a hushed voice before clinging to the wall. Fontina turned around to see a scowling, intimidating Noctowl moemon with a very displeased look on her face. \"Ivan. Ethel.\" he barked coldly, \"Stop screwing around and let's go, shift's almost up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shift?\" Fontina and Kyrie asked in unison. The tall, blank slate of a man caught them in his rather wide eyes. His hat had an emblem on it that seemed to mesmerize them as the lights bounced off of it, like two wings around a diamond. \"What're you two doing up?\" he didn't sound irritated at them, just naturally serious. \"You should really be in bed. Anything happen in here?\" he asked professionally. Fontina's eyes darted both right and left to see both Ivan and Ethel shaking their heads 'no'. However, she was in no mood to let those two wretches off easy. \"Yes sir, Ethel's on the right behind a bookshelf, and Ivan's trying to clim back up on the ceiling.\" she smiled. \"I see. You two go on back to your rooms.\" he said dimly, \"I run my regime very strictly, and I'd hate for two such young women to hear what'll happen to those two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina giggled, \"Sure thing.\" she nudged back to Kyrie, equally as unremorseful, \"Come on Kyrie, I'll take you back to... do you have a room yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they quickly skipped out of the room, Fontina heard the nightowl crack his knuckles before whispering, \"Hide and seek, my favorite game.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she <i>closed</i> the door, Fontina could hear \"OH COME ON HORUS THIS ISN'T-\" and a rush of pained yelping. Somehow, Fontina would get to sleep much better tonight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn\u2019t long till morning crept over the mansion once more, although, it wasn\u2019t like anyone could tell with the mysterious storm still raging outside. But then again, with the dim hallways slightly a bit brighter and the smell of delicious food lofting through the air, it didn\u2019t take much to wake up the already groggy Fontina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she escorted Kyrie to her room, Fontina had retreated back to her and her friends\u2019 room, still a little bit confused with the trio of new faces that the two had met only a few hours ago. Because of the two perverted characters \u2013 Ethel and Ivan \u2013 Fontina was pretty sure that Kyrie was now scared for life due to their perverted words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was that other third person, that Noctowl Moemon \u2013 Horus if Fontina was correct, he seemed to remind Fontina of a certain dark Moemon butler\u2026 Personality wise at least. But he did seem a little kinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, retreating back to her own room, Fontina had spent the remainder of the night thinking about the situations \u2013 The vase, the new faces that the mansion had revealed, and of course, Fontina\u2019s biggest concern (and growing), he own weight. Of course, when she thought of that, Kyrie\u2019s kind words had helped her get a little sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it didn\u2019t take long for the alarm to make Fontina\u2019s eyes snap wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a nice shower and finding a slightly larger maid uniform (it was easy for Fontina to figure out that Shera had made a new one), Fontina made sure to wake up Ali before she headed for the main dining hall. Although she wanted to talk to Midnight about the previous day, there was one thing that Fontina knew about Midnight \u2013 And that was never to interrupt her beauty sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Fontina dear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fontina turned around in the hallway, she realized that it was none other that Shera who had called out to her \u2013 A large smile on the Kangaskhan moemon\u2019s face as she walked briskly towards the younger Moemon, her arms held behind her back. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you up so early!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Ms. Shera,\u201d Fontina replied as she bowed slightly to the older Moemon. \u201cI\u2026 I wanna say thanks for the new maid uniform, it\u2019s just as beautiful as the last one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it child,\u201d Shera answered with a blush on her face as she raised a hand to her chubby cheek. \u201cI love sewing, I\u2019m just glad to see you enjoying my work. So, how are you this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I could be better,\u201d Fontina muttered as she placed her hand on her slightly chubby stomach. \u2018It\u2019s even bigger than yesterday\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you ever need an ear to chew,\u201d Shera offered as she kept her hands behind her. \u201cI\u2019ll be more than happy to oblige. Anyway, since I caught you first, I figured that you\u2019d like to be the first to see something rather cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina raised an eyebrow as Shera stepped to the side, seeing only the empty hallway behind her, \u201cUm, Shera? There\u2019s nothing behind you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera blinked a few times before she spun around, \u201cOh come now, dear, there\u2019s no need to be shy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small, yet familiar \u2018eep\u2019 as Shera turned around, revealing she had Kyrie in her hands, the only difference was that she was dressed in a fancy and frilly Victorian styled black and blue maid outfit with a longer skirt that covered her legs save for her feet. Around her neck was a delicate sky-blue ribbon and bow and even her long aquamarine hair was tied up with two similar bows that gave her two long tails of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie\u2019s face was almost glowing a bright red as she folded her hands in front of her slim waist. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw,\u201d Fontina cooed as she leaned forward, ignoring the fact that she grunted slightly thanks to her stomach. \u201cThat\u2019s cute Kyrie, but, why are you dressed like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 Wanna help\u2026\u201d Kyrie mumbled as she poked her fingers a few times. \u201cI-I wanna help you and Ali!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina stood up promptly, \u201cKyrie, I said that you don\u2019t have to help pay for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2026 I at least owe Ali!\u201d Kyrie retorted, her face red but her voice louder than before. \u201cAnd\u2026 And I wanna help! You and Ali are so n-nice and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now girls,\u201d Shera interrupted as she placed her hands on the two girls\u2019 shoulders. \u201cKyrie, I told you it was alright to help them out, and Fontina, she wants to help, so there\u2019s not going to be a problem. Now\u2026 Shall we head to breakfast before we get to work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually Shera,\u201d Fontina started as Kyrie hide behind the voluptuous vaporeon\u2019s ponderous thighs. \u201cI wanted to ask, are there more people who work in the mansion? Maybe some sort of night shift?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an adequate way to describe us, I guess,\u201d A serious voice sounded through the hallways, making both Kyrie and Fontina jump slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Horus, it\u2019s a rarity to see you up and about in the morning,\u201d Shera stated as the very same Noctowl Moemon from the last night in the library walked through the hallway, a cup of coffee in his hands. \u201cFrom what I can guess, these two met you last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, they ran into Ethel and Ivan first,\u201d Horus sighed with a shake of his head, making his hat shift slightly over his head of feathered hair. The older Moemon took another sip of his coffee before he turned towards the surprised Moemon. \u201cSo, I figured I\u2019d best stay awake and apologize for their rude behavior. Besides, I hadn\u2019t had a chance to meet our new staff. And I see you\u2019ve worked your touch with the uniforms again, I gotta say, give you some fabric and you can work magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the compliment, Horus,\u201d Shera replied with a smile. \u201cBut still, you and the other two usually sleep during the day. And you\u2019re usually too serious to be bothered to greet guests\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had some training with Walker today, as well as some paperwork,\u201d Horus answered with another sip. \u201cSides, this is my thirteenth cup of coffee so far, so one day of running on caffeine won\u2019t kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thirteen cups?!\u201d Fontina gasped slightly. \u201cThat\u2026 That seems a bit excessive. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not bouncing against the walls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYears of practice,\u201d Horus answered as he turned his cup upside down to reveal that it was emptied. \u201cNow, how about I accompany you ladies to the dinning room? It\u2019s been a while since I had some of Wester\u2019s good breakfast, and I could use a refill of coffee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fontina kept at Horus' side as they, Shera and Kyrie walked down the hallway. Something about Horus seemed very distant, very aloof, almost menacing towards the newer members of the household. But then Shera would recite an old story from their youth and he would let out an amused chuckle that, for what it lacked in volume, seemed sincere and lighter than his usual self. However, for all of his slight informalities toward the Kangaskhan maid he made up for in strict etiquite towards both Kyrie and Fontina. In a way it was flattering to be called Ms. for once, but Fontina told herself that in the long (long, long, long long) time that she would spend in the mansion, Horus would gradually open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie tugged at Fontina's side nervously for the first half of the trip, clinging tightly to the water moemon's dress and burying her face in her side. It was easy to see why; Horus was a very tall and intimidating figure to the strong, let alone to poor meek moemon like Kyrie. Perhaps noticing this, the Noctowl moemon decided to take action by addressing her first. \"How cute.\" Horus said in his tone, \"She's shy.\" This seemed to coax Kyrie from Fontina's lovehandle long enough for the young nightowl to place a hand underneath her chin, raising her face up slightly in order to get a better look at the young mystery moemon. Kyrie's demeanor wavered slightly as Horus smiled; something that wasn't done often, but happened to be a very moving expression. \"Hey, she is cute.\" he said gently, \"Just like a china doll; she'll be a real looker when she grows up a little bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis simple action seemed to work wonders, as while Kyrie still kept herself latched at Fontina's swollen side, she now partook in the conversation a little bit more by laughing at things that she decreed funny. Fontina looked down at Kyrie and then back at Horus; it wasn't anything big by any means necessary, but Horus seemed very interested in getting to know the newest members of his household. \"So, Fontina,\" Shera broke the young plumper's concentration, \"Horus is a large contributer to our master's selection of books!\" Shera too, she seemed pretty intent on getting Horus to know both of them, like a distant uncle to his long-lost neices. \"Oh really, that's nice!\" Fontina said enthusiastically, \"What're yours?\" Horus thought for a second, \"Well, if I'm not mistaken, I think just about all of the mystery stories are ones that I've donated.\" he said plainly, \"I've always been a big fan of whodoneit's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, I've always liked the works of Sir Vincent Oddish, I-I think I've taken more than my fair share of his works from the library...\" Fontina trailed off slightly and awaited Horus' return remark when Kyrie started tugging at the back of her dress. The Vaporeon moemon looked down to her side to catch Kyrie looking around nervously. \"Hey, Kyrie what's wrong?\" she asked her smaller friend, sincerely wondering what could have gotten the young girl so upset. \"I-I-Is the ground sh-shaking?\" Kyrie seemed very upset by this prospect, \"No I don't feel-\" Fontina paused, Horus had obviously felt it too. \"Actually, I think it is Kyrie; nice senses.\" Horus seemed mildly bemused by the idea, like somehow what occurred on the ground wasn't his problem, \"An earthquake?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera chuckled, sending her doughy stomach into a tizzy. \"No, I think I know what's causing it.\" she said, pointing down the hall. There, not so far off in the distance, was a by now familiar sight that was Ember prancing down the hallways. Her maid uniform, not-so-much-unbelievable-as-it-was-expected stuffed to burst with all of her caramel colored weight. As she skipped down the halls, her belly went up and then came crashing down to her thighs, also sent on violently random wobbling sensations as her enormity hit the floor at full force. Even her boobs experienced cataclysm as they felt the full force of gravity and the lackthereof during her midair spells, making slight flopping noises as they bounced in rhythm with her gut and cheeks. \"SHERA!!!\" she sang, somehow managing to defy the laws of physics and go even faster than she was at full momentum, \"YOU GOT THEM UP FOR ME!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, two flabby bodies collided in a trainwreck of blubber, the older and more mature maid's gnerous spread being rammed into by Ember's unforgiving expanse. Surprisingly enough, Shera only let out a strained \"oof\" as she and the volumous Vulpix moemon collided, shrugging it off like a light punch to the belly. \"I thought you deserved a little break today Ember, why aren't you at breakfast?\" she pacified Ember's childish attitude with her motherly demeanor, \"You didn't tell me!\" Ember whined. Shera turned back to a spooked Fontina (who was sure that the speeding blubber bullet was going to run right over her) and a trauatized Kyrie (who had not yet seen just how humongous Ember's girth really was), \"I thought it would be a good idea to introduce Kyrie to Ember alone to reduce the chances of startling her... but then I got a little carried away with her dress and just had to show somebody!\" Shera turned red and returned her hand to its usuall cheek-adjacent position, \"Obviously the whole 'not startling her' plan didn't go too well, seeing as how I forgot to tell Ember to just go onto breakfast...\" she giggled as Fontina slowly helped the seafoam haired moemon up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber looked up at Horus adoringly, \"Hello Mr. Horus!!\" she chirped, doing an akward little curtsey and lifting up her too-tight skirt slightly. The older moemon chuckled, \"Hello Ember.\" he smiled at her and rustled her burgundy hair with one strong hand, \"My, you're getting taller every time I see you.\" Ember giggled as he put a finger underneath her lowermost chin and rose her face into clearer view, much like he did with Kyrie earlier, \"And prettier too.\" Ember squealed slightly, as her fat cheeks turned a dark shade of brown, \"Thank you Mr. Horus, I make sure to eat lots of cakes and cookies to make sure that I'm extra sweet!\" she smiled widely as Horus let out an even louder laugh (obviously for her sake, if Shera was the mother of the house then Horus was definately the father) \"Well it certainly works, I'll be sure to leave you something sweet before I head off again.\" Ember squealed again, \"Oh thank you Mr. Horus, can it pleeease be strawberry banana truffles pleeease?!\" He smiled warmly, \"Of course it can.\" he said before extending a hand, \"Why don't you escort me to the dining hall, its been a while and I think I might manage to get lost if you don't show me how to get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ember took his hand, Fontina couldn't help but note the lighthearted smile on Horus' face. The Vaporeon moemon turned to her msterious little friend who seemed to be giving him the same look of approval, raising up her pretty little face to show just how soothed being around Horus had made her. She silently turned to her Kangaskhan superior, \"Hey Shera?\" she whispered. \"Hmm, yes dear?\" the head maid of the house turned. \"Horus is a really nice guy, isn't he?\" Shera smiled back at her, \"Yes, he really is a sweetheart isn't he?\" she turned back to the front, \"Don't let him fool you though, he's absolutely vicious when it comes to his training with Walker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie and Fontina exchanged confused glances; not at the prospect of some sort of physical training (he obviously did <i>something</i> to stay fit after all that sugar and caffene) but at the idea of this nice guy being vicious. \"Training?\" Kyrie repeated quietly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon after, Ali managed to awake from her zombiesque daze and catch up to the little travel group that the four had convoyed in her absence. After complimenting just how <i>cute</i> Kyrie looked in her super deluxe dress (much to the smaller girl's embarrassment) she would notice Horus. She wasn't impolite by any means, but the intimidating new guy holding hands with Ember certainly did put off the little echidna moemon. But after catching the down-low from Fontina, Ali was perfectly fine with the night gaurd... but how he could tolerate Ember's childish behavior was still a mystery beyond solving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the party burst their way into the dining room with the short and stubby little Vulpix moemon as their guide. Horus was the first to take his seat, not even having to second guess where he sat that day as it was at the righthand side to the head- opposite Shera, who was second to take her place at the table. Ember was next, chosing to sit next to the already seated Claire (their blubbery bodies rubbing together due to the lack of adequate space between seats, so they struggled to scoot their chairs away from eachother) Ali, Kyrie and Fontina were the final ones to take their seats; respectively on the diagonal left, across from, and diagonal right to Walker who had taken her seat further down the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli couldn't help but notice that instead of coldly ignoring everybody in the room, Walker's demeanor had changed to one of intense fury. She ground her teeth and clenched her fists as she focused on one side of the table; somewhere that Ali had <i>never</i> seen her look before. Then again, Horus- the dashing new guy- had never sat there before. Maybe the two were connected? Slowly, Walker's pale skin turned bright red in her fury towards the Noctowl moemon, her purple eyes almost seeming bloodshot as her anger continued to rise further and further. Ali rose an eyebrow to Walker's questionable behavior, but dismissed it as nothing and better off forgetting about. This <i>was</i> Walker though, the big secret she had was that she was a girl, so what else might she be hiding?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs said Disaster moemon fumed away in her own little corner, Claire Shera and Horus seemed like three peas in a very tight pod; regailing in tales from their childhoods and catching up like the old friends that they were. This didn't seem to sit well with Walker. \"Hey, <b>you</b>.\" she barked from across the table, \"Don't act like you don't have anything to say to me.\" Horus seemed untouched by the scalding hatred coming out in deathglare form from Walker's purple peepers, \"What, the last round was fair. I just bested you, you've had plenty of time to train.\" he said calmly. Walker's brain hemmoraged right there as shown by her uncharacteristic rage face. \"Don't give me that you-you... you narcissist!\" she barked, \"I <i>demand</i> a rematch!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli looked back over to Horus who, instead of seeming annoyed with Walker's sudden outburst of character, actually seemed to just shrug it off. \"I wouldn't have it an other way, Walker.\" he chuckled, \"But do we have do it right now? I've already asked Wester to prepare an extra plate for me, and it'd just go to waste if we have one of our sparring matches.\" Walker found more steam to blow out of her ears, \"I-I-I-I'LL DECIDE WHEN WE FIGHT!!\" she stammered, \"AND IT'LL BE RIGHT NOW IF I WANT IT TO!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Fontina and Ali ducked down to soothe the poor, frightened little maid. \"Hey, come off it Walker, you're scaring Kyrie!\" Ali piped up, \"Besides, you can fight after breakfast, doesn't that like, make you burn more carbs or something?!\" Walker turned her fury onto the fire-type, only to be met with her signature unwavering stare. \"Fine.\" she huffed, falling back down to her normal level of morning irratation. Another voice came from the background, one that everyone in the entire house (except for the tow newly introduced members of course) had learned to dread. \"Hey, stop picking on Walker!!\" Midnight shouted as she quickly made her way to her seat beside him, blubbery booty jiggling in her hurry. \"Oh great, our daily dose of retarded all in one balanced breakfast.\" Ali quipped, \"Don't you have a milkbone to chew on somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight snarled, \"Oh go choke on your own lack of sex appeal.\" Thankfully, before the fight could escalate any further (unlike last time, where Ali and Midnight resorted to throwing dishes {adding at least another thousand to their combined debt to pay for the whole set which had to be replaced}) Wester's familiar cry of \"Hey you guys, food's ready!\" sent all of the less controled mouths in the room watering. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Urp.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli let out a small belch as she eyed her precariously distended stomach. For some reason, her outfit was much looser on her than it had been these past few days, but that still didn't settle her growing concerns about her growing waistline. For some reason, while many other dreams had passed her by, the rapid expansion of Dream Ali seemed to shake the young echidna moemon to her very core. She was trying to eat less (<i>trying</i>, mind you) and was very upset with how much her paunch seemed to poke out these days. Her womanly curves were finally coming in, but as she had reminded a certain Mightyena moemon dozens of times, \"boobs are just strategically placed fat\", meaning that there was at least some weight gain going on. Regardless, all she could do now was lay back in her chair and suffer the consequences of overeating rich food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp, excuse me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina too, was having trouble controlling herself. It seemed like all the walking she did, instead of burning unwanted calories, only seemed to make her hungrier than she was when she woke up! Her plump tummy bulged out further, still retaining it's softness and plush consistancy despite its stuffed status. As she looked down to inconspicuously massage her tummy, a more definate double chin made itself known as the neckfat creased in her curiousity. Her fingers kneeded the soft expanse in front of her solemnly, because in a perfect worl all this blubber wouldn't have laid itself on her belly... or anywhere for that matter. Still, the gnawing feeling in the back of her head to finish off what was left of Walker's first and only omlette was very much present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belch... sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight had lost inhibition control yet again during this meal, as if she had any before. Instead of modestly stuffing herself like her two companions had, Midnight insisted upon eating as much as she could in a relatively quick fashion. Not out of gluttony no, but mostly just because that was how she had eaten her entire life. To go along with her \"rough chick\" attitude, she also had a very rough way of eating her food. And it definately showed in her paunch, slowly expanding behind the let-out corset that she still hadn't realized had been altered. Even now, as gurgle incoherently about how full she was or how good the food is, she reached over to the disdain of both Walker and Fontina and took it upon herself to finish off the Absol moemon's omlette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...perp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Kyrie, who as Ali already had seen, had quite the appetite and clearly exhibited it to the entire spectation of the household. She wasn't loud like Midnight, nor overly mannered like Fontina, or even as much of a moaner as Ali. Somehow through her tiny, ladylike bites she had managed to keep up just enough only to fall short under the least amount eaten between the four. Her dress was modest, and didn't very much show her swollen belly, but it was definately present on the shrimpy girl's body. But it must have been too much for her, as Kyrie's beautiful golden eyes were left half-open in her daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.\" Walker finally said after a long session of silence between the table, \"Can we fight now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorus chuckled. He too had eaten the absolute bare minimum of what would be considered a healthy breakfast. But unlike his Absol sparring partner, he had consumed his entire omlette, mushrooms and all (something that really irked her, he knew that she hated mushrooms) his spinach and greens as well as the side of dipping sauce Wester had so lovingly made himself. Oh, and seven consecutive cups of coffee. \"I don't see why not.\" he addressed the stable of sleepy fatties before him, \"Ladies...and Wester... I'll be spending the rest of the day with Walker, so I'll have to excuse myself.\" somehow, he seemed somewhat irritated at having to fight Walker... or at least that's what the barely coherent Ali could concieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only imagine the hawt things those two could be doing....\" Midnight grunted as she grabbed bits and pieces off Walker's plate, \"Getting all sweaty and stuff like guys do when they fight...\" Ali threw her napkin at her, \"Midnight, you're such a perv.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera was the first to actually put her \"game\" face back on, wiping off the mask of the slightly sleepy woman she was just moments ago to get right back to work. \"Alrighty then, I guess we should divide up the chores evenly then?\" she said merrilly, \"Claire, you and I will tackle the first floor.\" Kyrie awoke slightly to address the plump maid, \"Wh-What do I do Ms. Shera?\" she asked in a sleepy tone, \"That's just what I was about to ask you dear!\" Shera cooed to the Ali-sized girl in front of her, \"You get to clean the kitchen today since Ember will be taking care of Ali-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?!\" Ali jumped, now fully awake as Ember started to giggle. The massive Vulpix girl pat her belly and licked her lips, \"Oh yum yum yum, that means you can eat until you feel all better today, you're so lucky Ali!!\" she cried. Ali's thing black eyebrow twitched, \"TH-THAT'S NOW HOW NORMAL PEOPLE GET BETTER!!!\" she wailed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Anywho, it's just for today and it'll help you get started.\" Shera continued on despite Ali's obvious and clearly stated protests, \"I want you to pick between two of our newer maids here- Midnight or Fontina!\" both addressed moemon perked up slightly at their names (not at Ali's screams, though) \"But whoever she doesn't pick gets the hard job... taking care of the second <i>and</i> third floors today, I'm sorry we're so understaffed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie ducked down... she didn't like this kind of scathing attention...</span></div></div>",

The option of choosing who she would work with was growing heavier with each second as the mysterious Moemon looked over her two choices of who to work with as they both digested their breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Kyrie wanted to work with Ali, in hopes of getting closer to the very person who had helped her in the first place and had become her first friend in the mansion. But, Ali was probably still a little weak from yesterday, and thus was already walking around the table with Ember to take care of some of the uneaten food (most of the food was around Walker\u2019s barely cleared plate). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that left Fontina, the Moemon that Kyrie had bonded with the night before, and was actually quite interested in spending more time with the beautiful Fontina. After all, it would\u2019ve been great to continue their conversation last night before the two perverted night staff members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, there was the third one \u2013 Midnight was her name if Kyrie remembered correctly. Even though Kyrie was a bit afraid of the milk chocolate skinned Moemon, Kyrie did have to admit that she was afraid of both Ali and Fontina before she talked to them. Maybe Midnight was nicer than her cold demeanor suggested\u2026 Kyrie hoped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that and the glare that Midnight was conveying a very strong message\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Well\u2026 M-M-Midnight?\u201d Kyrie answered Shera\u2019s question with a small yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent choice,\u201d Midnight grunted as she stood up from her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie turned back to Fontina, who only smiled back at the smaller Moemon \u2013 Apparently, there weren\u2019t any hard feelings from the water Moemon. If Kyrie was a Psychic Moemon, she would\u2019ve been able to read Fontina\u2019s mind about thinking that this would be an excellent chance to get some exercise (so long as she didn\u2019t get near the break room of course). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d Shera announced as she pushed herself from the table, watching as Claire was waddling towards the door. \u201cLet\u2019s work hard today people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYAY!\u201d Ember cheered with a mouthful of food in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s got way too much energy,\u201d Midnight grumbled as the slightly bloated Kyrie walked over to her. \u201cAlright squirt, I guess I\u2019ll have to show you the ropes of how to work here. Count yourself lucky!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou barely work at all, ya mutt!\u201d Ali commented from the other side of the table, letting Ember wolf down most of food that Horus had decided to neglect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, what\u2019d you say?\u201d Midnight spat back, holding up her hand to her eat. \u201cI don\u2019t speak runt!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie staggered back slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she should\u2019ve chosen Fontina after all\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps she should\u2019ve gone with Fontina after all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWalker\u2019s fighting against Horus?\u201d Wester questioned as he walked up behind the two, a broom now in his hands. \u201cOh my, seems like that\u2019d be a good match again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain?\u201d Midnight questioned, snapping out of her stupor to turn around to face the pudgy Wigglytuff Moemon. \u201cAre you saying that the two have fought before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Kyrie had gotten the basic idea on how to clean dishes, so while Midnight questioned Wester, the petite Moemon began to work on the dishes by herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Wester answered with a large smile on his face. \u201cIn fact, the two usually train together when the whole staff is here. It\u2019s because of our current understaffed situation that the two haven\u2019t been able to train together. I\u2019d offer to train with Walker, but I have too much work in preparing meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, while the Master is here, he has most of the staff train with each other. But only if they want to or if they\u2019re able to, sometimes though, the matches get rather heated. So, I\u2019d guess that a match between the two of them would be good, after all, both of them used to be on the Master\u2019s main team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsed to be?\u201d Midnight questioned, unaware the Kyrie was halfway done with the dishes by now. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, its nothing really major,\u201d Wester replied with a shrug. \u201cHorus had to train the two new members of the night guard. And Walker, well, Walker had some issues personality wise and got injured a while back\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight stopped listening to Wester as she crossed her arms over her healthy chest, \u2018Walker\u2019s injured? I can use this to my advantage!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Midnight\u2019s head began to fill with several different scenarios \u2013 One with her dressed in a tight nurse\u2019s outfit that had the top few buttons unbuttoned to show her healthy milky chocolate colored cleavage as she nursed a wounded Walker in his bed. Once again, we\u2019d go further, but that\u2019d change the rating on this story due to the content\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, h-how do I use this thing?\u201d Kyrie asked, snapping Midnight out of her delusion, making the Mightyena Moemon blink a few times\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Kyrie was pointing towards the dishwasher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where do they usually train?\u201d Midnight asked leaning up against the now activated dishwasher, a cookie in her hands before she munched on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s a gym on the first floor,\u201d Wester explained as he handed Kyrie a huge chocolate ship cookie as well. \u201cWith the exception of Walker and the night staff, it usually gets underused while the master and his team are out. It\u2019s also got a portioned off area that\u2019s used as a dojo there too, so it makes the ideal place to have a match.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSho, how wuff one giff fere?\u201d Midnight questioned through a mouthful of chocolate chip cookie while she lifted another from the paper plate that Wester had brought over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie had finished her cookie rather easily and was on her second, for some reason she could get enough of the sugary treats (even though she was still quite full from the large breakfast). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 If you\u2019re asking how to get there,\u201d Wester muttered brushing some crumbs off of his uniform. \u201cThen all you need to do is head out of the main dinning hall and head north. Shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find if you follow the maps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Wester,\u201d Midnight chuckled as she picked up another cookie. \u201cI\u2019ll put that information to good use\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 D-Don\u2019t we have w-w-work?\u201d Kyrie muttered before Midnight wrapped her arm around the shy moemon\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get your pigtails in a twist, squirt!\u201d Midnight snickered before she placed the cookie she took and fitted it in Kyrie\u2019s mouth. \u201cThanks to that walking butterball and that puny spitfire, most of the dishes were cleaned off, and we\u2019ve rinsed them all as well, so, unless you\u2019ve got any other jobs for us to do Wester\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m used to cooking lunch by myself by now,\u201d Wester pointed out as he rubbed his chin. \u201cI suppose I could handle this by myself for now. So, if you two wanna take a break to watch Horus and Walker duke it out, I suppose that if you two are back in an hour I might just be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKay! Thanks!\u201d Midnight announced as she pulled on Kyrie\u2019s wrist and grabbed the large paper plate of cookies at the same time. \u201cLater Wester!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Wigglytuff Moemon could get another word in, Midnight had already dragged Kyrie out of the kitchen and disappeared. For a second, Wester just stood there before he smiled greatly. \u201c\u2026 Ah, to be young. Maybe I should pay some visits to the gym too. After all, I don\u2019t want to be cooped up in my quaint little kitchen for the rest of my days.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUm, M-M-Midnight,\u201d Kyrie muttered as she followed the taller Moemon through the hallway towards the gym. \u201cA-Are you sure that w-w-we should have left Mr. W-W-Wester\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiff ah baid,\u201d Midnight retorted with chocolate crumbs spilling from her cookie filled mouth. With a deep gulp, Midnight swallowed the chewed up cookie in her mouth. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry, kiddo. Wester\u2019s a hard worker and he\u2019s done this without anyone\u2019s help before. Besides, we\u2019ll be back to help him later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, if y-you\u2019re sure,\u201d Kyrie replied before she nibbled on one of the cookies that Midnight had given her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat a girl!\u201d Midnight chuckled as she placed a hand on Kyrie\u2019s shoulder, making the smaller Moemon jump slightly. \u201cNow don\u2019t worry! You\u2019re going to thank me later! It\u2019s not everyday you get to watch a fight between two hot studs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Studs?\u201d Kyrie questioned with her face turning redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the two finally came across the large double doors to the gym (it was actually thanks to a nearby map that helped guide the two). And the moment that the doors were opened, both Midnight and Kyrie were surprised and amazed at the sheer size of the gym \u2013 Which could be on par with the size of an official city gym! The equipment was some of the latest and most expensive on the current market, and there plenty of good classics, like four weight benches, three treadmills, there were even a couple of Bowflexes in the gym as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeesh, with equipment like this, it\u2019s a wonder why this mansion\u2019s filled with fatties,\u201d Midnight mused, unaware of her own lack of proper exercise and poor dietary choices\u2026 As well as the layer of chub that was growing on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie was rather curious with the equipment, walking to one of the exercise bikes and observed it, \u201cUm, w-what in the w-w-world do these\u2026 These\u2026 These\u2026 ACHOOOOO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large cloud of dust erupted from the work out bicycle, making the doll like Moemon erupt into a fit of sneezing. And with a larger sneeze, Kyrie fell backwards and landed on her small butt, \u201cOof!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight couldn\u2019t help but snicker loudly at the cute sneezing fit by the runt that the original runt had picked up. Although, Midnight had to admit that the doll-faced Moemon was pretty cool for helping to pay off the debt that Ali had gotten them into\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Well, either that or a complete sucker. Midnight was still thinking how to classify the smaller Moemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s sound caught Midnight\u2019s attention, showing another set of opened doors in the gym. Silently stepping towards the doors, Midnight peered inside the room to see a large red mat on the ground that had two people on top of it, one of them was standing and the other had their back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on the ground was none other than Walker himself (or to the rest of us: herself) growling loudly as he (she) pushed off of the ground, having exchanged his (her) usual butler\u2019s outfit for a baggy white gi with a black belt tied around his (her) waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other person on the mat was of course \u2013 Horus, still dressed in his security officer\u2019s outfit, save for the fact that his hat was no where to be seen and to make things more confusing was that he seemed to have a mug of coffee that he sipped on casually. Midnight could feel a large bead of sweat rolling down the side of her head, <i>\u2018\u2026 Is he actually drinking coffee while they fight?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more time!\u201d Walker growled, immediately getting into a ferocious fighting stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWalker, I keep telling you that you shouldn\u2019t be so hasty,\u201d Horus sighed, taking another sip from his coffee. \u201cAnd you need to learn how to control your anger, otherwise\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalker charged forward and jumped into the air, snapping his (her) leg up to deliver a powerful kick towards the Noctowl Moemon\u2019s head. Only to miss as Horus merely leaned backwards. The moment that Walker landed on the mat, he (she) quickly threw a punch towards Horus\u2019 stomach, but once again, the Noctowl Moemon stepped to the left, dodging the fury that was sent his way. \u201c\u2026 Your opponent\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the momentum, Walker spun around to unleash a swift high kick, this time however, instead of dodging, Horus lifted his right arm up and stopped the attack with a loud slamming sound. \u201cCan easily read your moves!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing his cup of coffee into the air, Horus immediately wrapped both of his hands around Walker\u2019s ankle and immediately spun around to throw the Absol Moemon through the air and land on the mat with a loud slamming sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the throw, Horus lifted his left hand up and caught the falling cup of coffee, and immediately, he too a quick sip from the mug. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t also have to point this out, but you\u2019re still recovering too. I prefer not to fight people in that condition, so, you can see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Shut up!\u201d Walker snarled as he narrowed his (her) red eyes down on the Noctowl. \u201cI\u2026 I won\u2019t lose to you\u2026 Or to anyone else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight stood there at her hiding space, her mind racing with several thoughts\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Holy hell! That birdbrain can fight!!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Walker\u2019s butt looks so cute in that outfit!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hmm\u2026 I bet I could take that feather head down in a second\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Should I cheer for Walker?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Maybe if I step in, I can score some hawtie points!\u2019</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyrie watched the odd display with growing feelings of abandon. For as long as she could remember, not long granted, the odd little moemon hadn't been one for fighting. Especially not when she was being forced to watch. While Midnight soaked up the violence like some sort of sick display, giggling and blushing as she oggled the hotties on the floor pound eachother's faces in (well, not exactly <i>eachother's</i>, Horus was pretty much dominating the whole competition), Kyrie could only feel empathy for the young butler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way he winced every time Horus delivered one of his sharp punches, his eyebrows dancing with rage as they twitched, his violent battlecries and his refusal to just lay down and be done for the day. Somehow, from somewhere deep inside of her, Kyrie felt like she had been there. Just from somewhere, some time... she had felt like that. The image of a strong, burly man came to mind; sillouhetted by the harsh sunlight... it almost made her want to cry. But Walker's pain was real, not some fabricated mental picture that was surely just fabricated and nothing else. Horus was really getting to the Absol moemon... and for Midnight to do nothing but just stand there getting horny was very much a turnoff for Kyrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Midnight... where was she? Kyrie looked around with nervous little squeaks emenating from her mouth as she searched, but the Mightyena moemon was no where to be found! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, think you can read <i>this</i> featherhead?!\" Midnight suddenly made her appearance known with her familiar taunts, lunging into the battlefield without hesitation. She smiled widely, her sharp teeth pearly white and grinning with anticipation as she charged. Horus stared blankly at the war-ready woman making her way towards him, averting his gaze from her chest as she took her steps in a mighty fashion. She reached him, finally, and delivered a quick side kick that would be effortlessly dodged on Horus' part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Hell?!\" Walker shouted, painstakingly lifting \"him\"self up from his crouched position, \"You, Loudmouth, what do you think you're doing?!\" he attempted to reason with Midnight bluntly by telling her off, only to no avail. \"I'm standing up for you, sugarcheeks!\" she said with a proud twinkle in her eye, \"Pellet-for-Brains here thinks he can pick on you like that, well I'm about to prove that I'm not just all bark!\" Walker's eye twitched and a red tint of embarrassment crawled its way into the butler's already quite flustered face, \"HE'S NOT PICKING ON ME, WE'RE FIGHTING!!\" Horus chuckled, \"Actually, we really are in the middle of something here, so if you wouldn't mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no way, don't even try to get me with that \"Mr.NiceGuy\" act!\" Midnight leaned forward slightly and put a hand on her hip, \"You're a jerk, you know that; and I'm gonna beat some respect for Walker into you!\" she picked up the longest segment of her uniform and charged once again, her (once) stong calf muscles pushing her forward at top speed (possible). The dark moemon readied herself, bending her knees a bit to get leverage as she jumped... straight into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorus effortlessly dodged yet again, Walker on the sidelines with her head resting in her bruised palm, \"You're just making a fool of yourself, you should really just cut it out and get back to the kitchen.\" Walker grumbled. \"Now now Walker, if the young lady wants to play, let her play.\" Horus chuckled slightly, readying his battle stance (Actually just him standing. He's <i>always</i> ready for battle &gt;:D) and took a sip from his still unspilled coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's adorable how she wants to fight for you Walker.\" Horus teased his young protegee, \"It's probably best that cute little girl, Kyrie, isn't here to see this...\"</span></div></div>",

So, while the others were busy with Midnight\u2019s surprising combat abilities, the petite Maid scurried out of the gym and into the halls\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back at the fight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Hmm\u2026\u2019</i> Horus thought as he spun to the right, just barely able to dodge a good left hook. \u2018<i>I can just barely dodge her attacks, I have to say, this one does know her stuff.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on that train of thought, Horus quickly ducked to dodge Midnight\u2019s powerful kick, and not wanting to be called a pervert, Horus leapt to the side. <i>\u2018If I wasn\u2019t tired from Walker\u2019s fight and my own lack of sleep, I\u2019d be able to defend myself properly.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around Horus quickly leapt back as Midnight threw another punch his way, \u2018<i>Still though, she does have experience and does know what she\u2019s doing so\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Midnight crouched down slightly and leapt upwards, delivering a harsh uppercut towards Horus. Luckily, Horus managed to pull back just barely in time to dodge the attack, but the punch caught the visor of his hat, sending it flying off into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! How do ya like me now?!\u201d Midnight laughed as she threw her other fist forward\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Only for it to be caught by Horus\u2019s opened hand, \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me, Miss Midnight,\u201d Horus stated as he wrapped his other hand around Midnight\u2019s wrist. \u201cBut, I have other matters to tend to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight\u2019s eyes widened when she realized that her feet had left the ground and her back had just slammed into the ground, her eyes widened as the pain rang through her body. \u201cWhew\u2026 You\u2019re quite the little spitfire\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Walker growled as \u2018he\u2019 stood up from \u2018his\u2019 seated position. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve gotten that out of the way, can we get back to our own fight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorus merely picked up his hat and began to dust it off when he turned towards Walker, \u201cSorry Walker, but I really need to my paperwork done. Maybe on my day off I\u2019ll spend the entire day sparing with you, but in the meantime, maybe you should spar against Midnight here\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, as long as she dresses properly for it\u2026 From what I\u2019ve seen, she might be a balanced sparing partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalker\u2019s eyes narrowed down at Midnight (who was at the moment sitting on the mat with a daydreamed look in her eyes with a small drop of drool forming in the corner of her mouth \u2013 Walker could only imagine what the perverted Mightyena Moemon was thinking of). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Horus sighed as he looked at the stained wall. \u201c\u2026 Be sure to inform Shera about this little mess here. It was my fault for bringing coffee in here so, yeah, I\u2019ll take the blame for this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, the feather-headed security guard walked out the doors, leaving Walker to grit \u2018his\u2019 teeth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, sweet-thang,\u201d Midnight cooed as she walked up behind Walker, leaning forward in order to show off some of her (enhanced) cleavage. \u201cHow about we have a little\u2026 Workout of our own?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d There was just so much that Walker could take. And when all three of the unwanted guests showed up, that fine line had shortened, and to learn that the one person that Walker wanted to beat considered the mutt of the group to be on par with \u2018him\u2019\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 That just broke the line. \u201c\u2026 Leave me alone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Midnight questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLEAVE ME ALONE, YOU DUMB B*TCH!\u201d Walker barked, surprising the Mightyena Moemon. \u201cTHE MOMENT I MET YOU, THIS MANSION\u2019S GONE TO HELL! YOUR POOR ATTEMPTS AT PICK UP LINES AT LIKE A KNIFE JABBING ME IN THE BACK! KEEP THE HELL AWAY FROM ME! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAND IF YOU TRY TO PULL SOME MORE CR@P LIKE THAT, I\u2019LL MAKE YOUR LIFE HERE A LIVING HELL!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Walker stomped out of the room, leaving a shocked and distraught Midnight standing in the padded room. It was just like that coffee mug, something shattered inside of her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 And to rub salt in the wound, Midnight\u2019s stomach was growling loudly, \u201c\u2026 I\u2026 I wonder if W-Wester has more c-c-cookies\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight ran out of the gym, heading straight towards the kitchen for some comfort eating\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gentle sobs filled the hallway, the work of Kyrie's hysteria being the small droplets of tears that dripped from her golden eyes. Her nose was runny, though no snot flooded from her nose to make those tricky clots on the carpet. The tiny moemon whimpered, shoulders quivering as she quietly cried to herself wishing that someone was there to comfort her and tell her that things would be alright. That no one else would get hurt in this mansion. The poor girl hadn't felt that in a long time; the gentle touch of a fellow pacifist to soothe her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie sniffled as she continued to play the recently portrayed scenes of violence over and over again in her head, unable to stop her mental rewind button and forget that any of that had ever happened. As she hobbled around, Kyrie's face grew flushed and her eyes hazy. Slowly, she covered corner and started clutching at the aching heart beneath her tiny breast. She <i>hated</i> fighting, so why couldn't she get the image of Horus kicking Walker around like a hackey sack out of her mind?! Quietly, Kyrie's knees slowly slid apart and she fell to the ground, landing on her posterior as she clutched her head in agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she remembered that Ali didn't have to work today, but... No, she couldn't do that. Ali didn't want to have to comfort some crybaby about fighting and more importantly, <i>Kyrie</i> didn't want for Ali to have to comfort her. The Quilava moemon had already done quite enough for her, and she really didn't want to abuse the privilege of having friends. Friends... had she just used that word? Did she... did she really have friends here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was powerful; powerful enough to get the young mystery-type up off her bum into a wobbly standing position. \"A-Ali...\" she whispered, a small blush added to the effect of her crying eyes... Her pace evolved from a slow, steady treading to an almost frantic dash. \"A-Ali!\" she said quietly, her brow creasing somewhat in her determination to find one of her two closest friends. She had memorized where Ali's room was, a skill that could no doubt prove very helpful, and started in the direction of the nearest staircase; her destination was the second floor, the hallway on the left after taking three rights and the fourth door down. She started up a staircase with great anticipation, the thought of finally having friends to comfort her when she cried driving her to seek out these friends. For the first time, someone would console her and tell her that it was okay for her to cry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie's increased pace put her at Ali's doorstep in a matter of minutes, a task that still took the room's occupants a good half an hour or so. The confidence that had guided her to this room had simply shattered, even the door seemed to overpower the young moemon as she cowered beneath its impressive glory. Kyrie meekly shrunk into herself, barely able to lift a hand to let out a gentle \"rat-tat\" on the door. She squinched her eyes shut, no doubt Ali would be angry at her for disturbing her day off... especially when she was so sick! She would probably yell at her and never want to be friends with her again!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But then Kyrie stopped, Ali wasn't like that. She had saved her life out there in the rain just a few days ago, so why would the young Quilava moemon yell and scream at her friend? That word again... 'friend'... it drove Kylie into making another, much more confident knock at the not-so-impressive door! She stood there, eyes almost totally dry now, and expected an answer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for one to never come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat confused (this <i>was</i> Ali's day off, where else would she be but her room?!) Kyrie checked the doorknob: unlocked. Feeling a little ashamed at herself for breaking her friends' privacy like this, Kyrie slowly turned the crystal knob and entered the room. Dark. Her tiny hands fumbled around for the lightswitch; it was evident that she had the right room! One side of the bed was messed up, a cheap music player on the corresponding nightstand, and the other side was neat with books on the side! Didn't Ali and Fontina share a bed together? This had to be the right room! Disheartened somewhat, Kyrie resigned to go back and find Midnight so she could get back to work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there, crudely written in black marker and tossed carelessly on the dresser, was a note specifically addressed to Kyrie! A light blush filled her cheeks as the diminiative moemon unfolded the paper... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Kyrie-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigured you might come by here to see how I was doing. In break room on the third floor, stop by if you want!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Ali'</i><br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" Ali moaned, never in her entire life had she experienced this much pain. Well, this <i>kind</i> of pain. It was unbearable, stomachaches were terrible! Granted, she had always had a large appetite, but she had always managed to keep herself in check from eating far too much. Like today. At this rate, Ali felt like she was going to explode into a million little fire-typed pieces! She attempted to kick her legs, only for a large brown weight of flab to keep them pinned down, \"So... much... hurt...\" she groaned, wincing as another pain shot through her body. To think, she wasn't even sick! Or at least she wasn't when this whole thing started. The enormous body pillow filled with jello resting on her gullet proved to sicken her plenty. Suddenly she knew how toothpaste felt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber giggled, \"Oh come on Ali, <i>pleeeeeaaase</i>??!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInadvertently, the Vulpix moemon lowered her bulk onto Ali's body even further, her caramel colored middle engulfing the smaller girl and pinning her down completely. In one sausage-y hand she held another treat from the Swinub Sweets box, what <i>used</i> to be Ali's favorite food was slowly becoming her worst nightmare. The wrapper crinkled as Ember's expertise though somewhat slow fingers unwrapped the plastic, \"You'll never get better if you don't eaaaat~!!\" she whined, kicking her flabby legs in mild amusement. Ali wretched as Ember's body quivered and jiggled all around her, \"ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT!!\" she gave in yet again to Ember's demands, unable to take this sort of torture for much longer, \"J-Just give it to me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber squeaked excitedly as she lowered the honey bun into Ali's mouth, unable to feed herself as the Quilava's arms were being held hostage by the Vulpix moemon's suffocating middle. Ali took a pained bite, retching as the sweet dough traveled down her throat and piled itself onto the impressive amounts of food Ember had already shoved down there. \"Goodie!!\" Ember squealed, reaching into the box for another dose of medicine for her patient, \"Keep eating like that and you'll be all better in no time!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Ali could <i>not</i> keep eating like this. And even if she could, there was little to no chance of it making her feel any better. By herself, with Ember laying on top of her no less, Ali had consumed three whole boxes of Swinub Sweets. Mostly it was either donuts or muffins, but apparently Ember had broken into a box of buns, sweet rolls and dumplings this time. Great. Truth be told, Ali's main concern wasn't getting Ember off of her stomach as it should have been. It was how much she had eaten today! She could deal with Ember's suffocating embrace all day if she had to (well, maybe not <i>all</i> day) but it was all this food that was making Ali sick! It was all the food that was making her wince in pain! And it was all this food that was going to make her FAT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pictured herself at Ember's enormous size, no doubt that was how this little butterball had gotten so huge in the first place. Having a huge wobbling belly like Ember's, gigantic fat arms, heaving breasts, a huge rear end, and an encroaching third chin. It made her sick just thinking about it. But then again, that could have just been the food since she was already sick. At any rate, Ali was both sick and sick and tired of having Ember on top of her, squishing all this food into her face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, Ember's heavy form rolled off the couch with a heavy thud. She had stood up! Ali couldn't believe it! She- She was free! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now for the belly rub!\" Ember giggled, \"Nothing makes a sick person feel better than a belly rub after a nice big breakfast!!\" Ali was visibly not amused, but she was too stuffed stupid to respond coherently! All she could muster was a pathetic \"C-c-c-cc-cah-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cupcake?\" Ember jumped the gun on that one, digging around somewhat for the 'desired' pastry, \"I'll get it!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli grimaced, she actually meant to say \"Call Shera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber bent over, causing a loud ripping sound to fill the break room as her dress had gave way to the vast expanse of blubber Ember held so dear, but it seemed to fall on deaf ears. \"Cupcake!\" she said triumphantly, slamming the prepackaged frosted treat on the end table next to Ali. \"Now for the belly rub!\" Ember said excitedly as Ali shut her eyes...</span></div></div>",

Oh! You mean the new girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Ali saw her opening, Ember was now putting her childish mind to thinking about the new maid, which in turn had made the young blobby maid pull back slightly \u2013allowing Ali to slide off the couch and land on her stomach. \u201cURK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the most graceful of landings, especially considering that Ali\u2019s distended gut was completely full and landing on it wasn\u2019t the best thing for it at the moment, even worse was that Ember had turned back to Ali. \u201cOoh! Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Ali yelped as she used whatever energy she had left from being stuffed completely full to get to her feet and stumble towards the door. \u201cI\u2019m just going to answer the door!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was someone at the door?\u201d Ember questioned as she picked up a sweet bun and began to munch on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the air-headedness of her blobby co-worker, Ali opened the door to see Kyrie standing in the doorway, some tears in the corner of her eyes, and her hands folded in front of her.

Another friend!\u201d Ember announced suddenly appearing behind Ali, making the young Moemon jump slightly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Which in turn allowed Ember to grab both Ali\u2019s and Kyrie\u2019s hands, \u201cJust in time for a mid-morning snack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Ali yelped before she and Kyrie were pulled into the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sweat trickled down the young maid's neck as she fruitlessly scrubbed and scrubbed away at the permenant layer of filth that had attached itself to the decorative china. To think that someone needed all of these dishes to <i>not</i> eat off of them! The times that her mother struggled to provide for her and her six brothers and sisters were all put in perspective, as while her family was struggling, certain people got to live life fancy enough to not eat off of plates! Fontina let out a strained grunt, giving up on cleaning this tarnished piece and moved away from the china cabinet- she didn't mean to think those terrible thoughts. It was just... well, she wasn't exactly sure what it was that was making her so irritable today. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, combined with the fact that she had to do all of the work on both the second <i>and</i> the third floors, with a little pinch of the matter regarding her still-climbing weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought a hand to her slightly rounder cheek. It felt softer, smoother, and considerably more round than the last time she had thought to touch her cheek. It made her very uncomfortable to think that even her face was puffing up with chub! As she walked down the hall, Fontina lowered her head in self-loathing shame, letting out a small \"Oh...\" as her bispeckled eyes travelled to the slightly bouncy middle that she had garnered. It just reminded her of why she shouldn't be upset about having to work so hard! All this exercise was sure to shed some of those pounds and inches in no time! Combined with her intentions to skip dinner tonight for some jogging down to the library, Fontina would be slender and svelt in no time! She raised her hands in triumph, replaying the plan in her head with great fervor- confidence restored and energy charged anew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil her stomach growled. Loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what's the point?\" she said flatly, letting her arms fall down uselessly to her chubby sides and make a loud slapping sound, \"I mean, I gotta eat. I'll die if I don't.\" she woed, grabbing a broom from the closet to sweep up a dust buneary that had formed underneath the china cabinet. \"And I mean, even if I <i>could</i> go without eating and everything, I still probably wouldn't.\" she said solemnly, knowing just how much she liked to eat good food. \"But still, I'll just have to watch myself more closely!\" she said, sounding a bit more confident than before, \"Yeah! I can do this, with a little moderation and calorie counting, I should be fine in no time!\" she whooped, raising her hands yet again in premature victory, letting the broom fall uselessly to the ground with a large clacking sound. \"Crap!\" she whispered, grabbing the sweeping utensil from the floor quickly, \"Gotta do my work first though!\"<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"Kyrie, what's wrong?\" Ali asked, tied with concern for her sensitive friend and the sharp pains in her stomach, \"You've been crying, did Midnight say something mean to you likeshealwaysdoestome?\" she said the last part flatly, furrowing her brow somewhat at the thought of all the countless insults that cur had delivered. Kylie simply shook her head, choosing to remain silent in the face of prosecution. The little tearlets in the corner of her eyes had dried up considerably, the only evidence of her tears being the puffy red texture of her eyes and the flushed features of her face. But still, while she had cried before, Kyrie simply didn't have the gall to cry in front of Ali, who had seemed really strong emotionally since the two had become acquainted. After all, she had it so much worse off than she did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TELL ME!!\" Ali said, violently shaking Kyrie like a ragdoll to illustrate her point, \"TAKE ME SOMEWHERE ELSE AND TELL ME!!\" Ember's head poked up, \"Cupcake?\" she half-asked half-offered, eager to make sure that Ali got the nutrition that she so desperately required in order to get well again. Ali pointed at the big flabby sack of fat that had situated herself opposite to her smaller (horizontally, not vertically) friends, \"She's been stuffing me ALL DAY!!\" the Quilava moemon said hysterically, \"And laying on me! LAYING ON ME KYRIE!! Please take me back to my room where I can digest all this FOOD!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite Ali's obvious hysteria, Kyrie giggled. Ali was actually pretty funny when she was hysterical, what with all her funny faces and stuff. \"Okay Ali.\" she said quietly after calming her muted chuckles. Just as she had thought earlier, Kyrie's discomfort regarding fighting didn't really bother her now that she was with Ali; her first real friend in a very long time. The porcelain skinned moemon grabbed Ali's rougher hand and she started to stand up from her seated position...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ember started to raise immortal h-e-doublehockeysticks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAH!!\" Ember wailed, not actually crying but still accomplishing the same affect, \"B-But Ali'll never get any better if she doesn't e-e-eat with me!!\" She really wasn't a very good actor. Ali, even in her stuffed and stupid state could smell this act from a mile away (though, she could have just been already distrusting over Ember anyway) Midnight used to pull the same crap back when they were younger. \"Oh save it, we're not gonna-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh n-n-no... please don't cry...\" Kyrie whispered, lowering her head and releasing Ali's hand as she apologized, \"W-We can stay here with you if you want...\" Ali feverishly grabbed at Kyrie's hand, \"No! No! You've gotta tell me what's wrong with you! PLEASE!!\" she rasped. But her pleas fell on deaf ears, \"Goodie!!\" Ember squealed, clapping slightly and sending wobbling sensations throughout her entire body.</span></div></div>",

Her two brothers and four sisters, she may not have been the youngest of the group (that title belonged to her younger brother), and she wasn\u2019t the slimmest of her siblings (that fact was set in stone long before she gained this weight in the mansion). <i>\u2018I wonder\u2026 What would they say if they saw me today?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fontina swept absentmindedly, her thoughts trailed back to a memory of her siblings, and her days before she became a Vaporeon Moemon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---- Three Years Ago at Celadon City -----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an oddly quiet morning in the small apartment building, which allowed a small, teenaged Eevee Moemon to sit in one of the roughed up chairs with a book in her hands. Her short brown hair brushed up against her slightly puffy cheeks and the simple blue dress hugged her slightly chubby frame, and snuggled in between her blossoming chest was a blue stone that had several bubble like emblems etched into it.<i> \u2018Finally, a chance to just relax and read\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to open the book, a black gloved hand snatched up the book she was opening up, making her large eyes blink a few times behind her glasses, \u201cHuh?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, the Red Volcano Badge of Courage,\u201d A suave voice chuckled making the young Moemon girl look up to see its owner leafing through the pages on the book. \u201cI swear Fontina, you always have a nose for classic books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOIR! GIVE IT BACK!\u201d The young Fontina complained as she jumped from the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning up against the chair with the book in his hands was none other than the eldest brother of Fontina\u2019s family \u2013 Noir, the Umbreon Moemon, dressed in a black vest with a white short sleeved shirt and black jeans that showed off his slim physique. Topping his handsome face was finely combed back black hair that was pulled back into two small tails that were held back with a pair of golden rings. Noir chuckled as he reached down and roughed up his younger sister\u2019s hair, \u201cAw, don\u2019t be like that, squirt. I know you love your books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoir handed the book back to Fontina who immediately clutched the book close to her developing chest and small tummy, making her older brother stand up straight a smile on his face. \u201cNow then, are you nervous about your birthday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d Fontina admitted, not looking at her brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to worry about, squirt,\u201d Noir replied as he held his hand forward. \u201cI went through the same thing, Blaire went through it, so did Kay, Miyu and Pamela. And eventually, Jin will go through it as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But, what if I chose wrong?\u201d Fontina asked, referring to the Water Stone that was hanging around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSquirt,\u201d the Umbreon brother sighed as grabbed Fontina\u2019s hand. \u201cHow about you follow me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Huh?\u201d Fontina questioned as Noir began to lead her younger brother through the apartment, they didn\u2019t have to go too far, just to one of the rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of the bedrooms in the apartment, and inside it was another member of Fontina\u2019s family, Miyu, who was simply laying on the carpet watching TV with a large bag of chips near her that she kept reaching into every few seconds. Being one of the middle children, Miyu wasn\u2019t too much taller from Fontina, but she was bigger, no doubt about that. With her leafy green hair pulled out of her pretty face with a leaf-embroidered hair band. She was dressed in a lime green tank top and camouflaged shorts that strained themselves around her chunky rear and waist that was pointed directly towards her younger sister and older brother. \u201cMiyu here had troubles deciding what way she wanted to grow up as, but she found her way. And as a Leafeon Moemon, she certain enjoys it as well, although, I think that sunbathing of hers has made her a bit too lazy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ears work at a hundred percent though,\u201d Miyu yawned loudly before she stuffed more chips in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoir laughed a little bit before he led Fontina away, just in time to dodge some potato chips that their sibling had thrown at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill not convinced?\u201d Noir asked as he walked over towards one of the windows and opened it up. \u201cLook out there, there\u2019s Pamela and Kay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina looked out the window and saw her older sisters (it wasn\u2019t that hard, they were only on the second floor of the apartment building) jogging around the building\u2026 Well, one of them was, the other was waddling behind the one in the lead\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was no surprise for Fontina, after all, Kay was the Jolteon of the family and was a natural born athlete as illustrated by her slim, bright colored body that had a blue sports bra covering her miniscule chest and shapely buns, mostly made to show off her six pack abs and long legs. Her face, while pretty was sharp and her spiked back blond hair made it look even sharper, \u201cCome on Pamela! You wanted me to help you melt those college pounds away, so get your rear in gear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela was almost the complete opposite of the younger sibling, where Kay excelled in sports, Pamela was a natural born genius with education and had spent many nights tutoring Fontina and giving her the love for literature. She was also the lucky member of the family who was able to get several scholarships for a college\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was good and bad, good since she was a great student there, it was bad for her however since the freshman fifteen had actually multiplied for the young Espeon Moemon. Her round face was flushed and her normally trimmed violet hair was a mess and stick with sweat. The gray sweatshirt and sweatpants had clung to her enhanced curves, which made her the second fattest of the family, with her body more in an apple shape with a large belly and a developing behind and thunder thighs, with a small, but ample bust that bounced in her sweatshirt with each step she took. \u201cI\u2026 Can\u2019t\u2026 BREATHE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Kay laughed as she jogged in place before she ran circles around her enlarged sibling, poking the fluffy Espeon Moemon in her most troubling spots (the spare tire that was her belly and the large buns that she called her ass). \u201cNo pain, no gain!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh yeah, that reminds me,\u201d Noir chuckled as he rubbed the back of his head. \u201cJin and mom went out to get some stuff for your birthday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I was wondering where they went,\u201d Fontina admitted as the two walked away from the window (and ignoring Pamela\u2019s cries for help to get her away from her health nut of a sister \u2013 Kay).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoir would\u2019ve said something to that conversation, however, a wondrous smell lofted through the entire apartment \u2013 Smells of various meats simmering in several spices and sauces, the sounds of grease sizzled through the air and kitchen utensils clanking against each other. Both siblings knew what this meant, and the clock on the wall alerted them both that it was almost dinner time, eventually, all the family that was nearby would be gathered in the small room that served as both the dining room and living room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both of the siblings walked towards the kitchen, and saw the last and second eldest Moemon of the siblings. And although Noir was the oldest and the bigger brother to each and everyone of his siblings, Blaire \u2013 the residential Flareon Moemon could easily be mistaken for being the eldest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Needs a bit of salt,\u201d Blaire muttered to herself as she pulled back the spoon from her mouth as she sampled the pot of gravy that was being cooked in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoir and Fontina watched as Blaire zipped around the kitchen, her heavy footsteps echoing through the entire apartment and sending the pots, pans and silverware jingling against each other. Every time Fontina saw her big (both literally and age wise) sister, she couldn\u2019t help but be confused at the large mass that jiggled with each and every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd take Blaire,\u201d Noir began to explain with his arms crossed. \u201cShe always had an affinity to cooking, and while she has helped mother out with the cooking and with us, she\u2019s taken it to another level.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, Pamela wasn\u2019t the only member in the family that was a college student, Blaire was a student a local cooking college, learning the tricks of the trade while brining several dishes home (and several exotic ingredients) for the family to eat which really helped with the food bill. Unfortunately, since she was the registered family cook, Blaire had also faced the freshman fifteen that Pamela had to deal with\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Only on a much grander scale\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH! Noir! Fontina!\u201d Blaire squealed as she waddled up to the counter that the two were standing behind, a large tray of steamy, butter rolls in her hands. \u201cGlad you two are here! Would you mind doing me a favor and taste test these rolls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Noir and Fontina could get a word in, Blaire set the rolls on the counter and spun around, making the medicine balls that were her butt bouncing against each other in the tight black shorts she had squeezed into (making them seem like they were struggling against each other to take up more room inside the fabric) and showed off the underwear that was stretched of the hams she called her legs and butt. She was also wearing a black tube top that exposed her drum of a belly (and it usually acted as drum since she always tasted her food while she cooked and got taunt several times) while the tube top only managed to barely cover her tanned skinned bust\u2019s decency which could be on par with the size of basketballs. Her chipmunk cheek like face still had beauty to it and she had her sandy yellow hair tied back into one long tail to keep it out of her face. While she was big, Blaire had no blemishes or stretch marks on her large body (if Fontina knew what would happen three years later, she would\u2019ve been able to compare her eldest sister to a familiar Vulpix Moemon that she met).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Maybe she took it to a level too far?\u201d Fontina asked as she and Noir snatched a roll each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoir only shrugged as he popped the roll in his mouth, as soon as he gulped, the Umbreon Moemon knelt down slightly, \u201cShe\u2019s just doing what she loves and loves what she\u2019s become. And trust me Fontina, you\u2019ll love what you\u2019ll become, trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But what about you?\u201d Fontina asked through a mouthful of roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe?\u201d Noir questioned as he stood up straight and rubbed his chin. \u201cWhy did I become an Umbreon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m actually rather curious about that myself,\u201d Blaire stated as she munched on a few of the rolls as well. \u201cYou never did tell anyone why you chose to become an Umbreon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell us!\u201d Fontina asked as she pulled another roll from the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Well, alright, since both of you got me on the spot,\u201d Noir chuckled nervously as he ran a hand through his head of hair. \u201cFine, I choose to become an Umbreon Moemon because\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaire leaned on the counter, her large breasts starting to smoosh into her plate of rolls and up into her chubby face while Fontina leaned closer to the older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Its just cool to be dark,\u201d Noir answered with a loud laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Fontina and Blaire looked at their older brother laughing loudly at his own answer, both of them knowing that he was just pulling their legs. Blaire sighed as she stood up straight (using the counter to help her balance her weight), \u201cAnyway, dinner will be ready soon, so get ready you two\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----- Back to the Present -----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina smiled to herself, remembering the good days was always a fun time\u2026 But remembering Blaire, Pamela and Miyu dealing with their weights (well, Miyu didn\u2019t seem to care about her weight), Fontina looked down at her own pudgy body. She was roughly nearing Pamela\u2019s size during that time frame, but her sisters had gotten bigger the last time she saw them (even Kay seemed to put on a few pounds after she went on her own journey).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it destiny that Fontina would get big? Get as big as Blaire herself?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFontina dear, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina dropped the broom she had in her hands, realizing that Shera was standing next to her now with a concerned look on her face. \u201cOh S-Shera, y-yeah, I was just thinking about my brothers and sisters\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have siblings?\u201d Shera asked, blinking a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSix of them actually,\u201d Fontina chuckled\u2026 Only to have her good memories get drowned out by her growling stomach, making her face turn bright red. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries, child,\u201d Shera giggled to the side. \u201cI came to get you, its time for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner?!\u201d Fontina gasped, more concerned how much time she had spent going through her memories rather than the event itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, so come now, everyone\u2019s waiting,\u201d Shera requested as she grabbed Fontina\u2019s plump arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Fontina wasn\u2019t going to be able to sneak away from dinner like she thought she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ali took a deep breath, her cheeks and chest swelling with oxygen so as to flatten out her stomach a bit. The young fire-type moemon turned blue in the face before she released her load of oxygen, allowing her stomach to pooch back out uselessly. Yep, no doubt about it now; Ali was fat. And it was much more noticable now that she had stripped down to her underwear. The young moemon poked at her paunch with a flat expression on her face, brow creased and eyes narrowed on the pudgy middle she had accumulated. Her lips pursed as she started poking it more and more, watching as the unwelcome visitor to her waistline quivered uncaringly. She cupped it in her hands, the pillowy texture almost made this chubby belly of hers seem inviting- like someone could just lay down on it. But Ali knew better. This was a girl's worst nightmare, actually coinciding with her worst nightmare ever (see Otherworldly Expansion, fellow readers~~)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned, hoping to see what other guests her party crasher had invited; just as expected, a fat rearend and chubby arms. Her black panties were wedged between two plump thighs, a hint of cellulite detectable on their plush expanse. She grumbled, pulling her underoos from yet another wedgie caused by the simplest of movements- ironically this time it was turning around to meet her rear face to face. Like her stomach, Ali cupped one chubby bum cheek in her hand. And again, like her stomach, it was soft to the touch and jiggled as she did so. She could see the little fold where her butt fat was getting to heavy to blend seamlessly with her thighs and was starting to lap over its neighboring property. Things were already tight in that neighborhood, what with constant wedgies, the occassional chafing and the unwelcome sensation of the upper levels of her thighs rubbing together. Her calves, a little lower, seemed largely unchanged if not a bit thicker, but as last night proved while pulling up her pajama bottoms, they had gone from toned to wobbly and weak. Actually, her pajamas were what brought this round of self exploration on, as last night that unwelcome guest Paunch had busted not one, not two, but <i>three</i> buttons on the once loose garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wouldn't be the end of the torture for those poor innocent pajamas. Because again, last night, the rest of Ali's expanding figure had made itself known to the world by busting the top button on the flannal shirt. She had to admit, finally sprouting some sweaterpuppies was an advantage she couldn't pass up. And they sure were blossoming finely. Continuing her tradition of cupping recently fattened parts of her body, Ali cupped her breasts proudly as the fleshy lumps wobbled about in her hand. They weren't big like that freak Midnight's, but they were definately a start for becoming the Typhlosion moemon she wanted to become. However, the rest of her was a forewarning of he becoming like the Typhlosion moemon she <i>didn't</i> want to become (again, see Otherwordly Expansion~~)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" the young Quilava moemon said dryly as she let her boobs fall out of her hands \"Just great.\" Even as she spoke, the slowly developing double chin she had acquired creased and wobbled slightly; sending an unfamiliar and revolting shiver throughout her psyche. She sighed heavilly, expression relaxing in her defeat and put her hands around her chubby tummy again, \"Well, sitting her complaining isn't going to do much other than make me angry.\" she said solemnly, reaching for the bathroom's lone coat hanger that held her dress. She knew that it would be too tight on her, it had been getting increasingly tighter since Shera last hemmed it out, but she inwardly dred the day that she split the seams on her uniform. Slowly, her slightly thicker fingers unzipped the back and she carefully stepped into the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven unzipped, Ali's soft exterior filled the maid's uniform to its absolute capacity. Her budding breasts straining the top, somewhat ponderous posterior peeping from underneath the skirt, and her full stomach nearly popping out of the middle. She gulped, a small amount of sweat trickling from underneath her black hair. 'Come on Ali, you can do this!' she whispered, clumsilly feeling the back of her dress for the cold zipper. Her fingers recognized the plastic material and started tugging at it, iching it closer and closer to the top. Or, they were <i>supposed</i> to be inching it, the little thing was moving at Slugma's pace as it crawled up the teeth of her dress, until it finally just stopped all together. Ali scowled, \"Come on!\" she huffed, pulling harder and harder at the stubborn fixation until she finally got a response. Just not one that she particularly expected or cared for. A loud ripping sound filled the bathroom as the sewn on teeth of the zipper seperated from the body of the dress and fell uselessly to touch her bum like a tail. Ali was silent, her eyes wide open and eyes dialated to the point of being little dots. Her lips tightened and her neck grew stiff as she turned to face the crippled zipper, letting out little half-formed sentences as she go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah...\" she stuttered, sweat running down the back of her neck, \"NO WAY!!!\" she screamed, followed by a loud string of obscenities that would surely raise the rating of this story to Mature. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She burst from the bathroom in a hurry, interrupting Midnight's latest lounging session. \"WHERE ARE MY SWEATS?!\" she hollered, \"MY BACKUP UNIFORM, ANYTHING!!\" The shorter moemon screamed yet another long list of oddly specific curse words directly in Midnight's cherubic face when she gave her lax response of \"Too big for your britches, Tiny?\" after which she smirked and leaned back on the bed. \"THIS IS <i>SO</i> NOT FUNNY MIDNIGHT!!\" Ali barked, \"WHERE'D YOU PUT THEM?!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight shrugged carelessly, \"No idea.\"  before rolling over on the bed to continue painting little 'Dark' symbols on her toenails. Ali fumed, before realizing something about Midnight's demeanor. While she was always snarky and sadistic, something seemed different about her this morning. It wasn't her careless attitude towards Ali's dilemma, she was always like that, or her relatively usual vanity, because again she was always like that. It seemed obvious enough, but she just couldn't quite put a finger on the change in Midnight this morning... before it hit her like a brick. Slowly, Ali's distress disapated and was quickly replaced with malicious intent to rub Midnight's nose in something other than cookies. \"I see <i>you're</i> not wearing <i>your</i> uniform either, huh?\" Ali taunted with a mischevious grin on her face, \"What was that about <i>me</i> being too big for my britches, huh Porky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Midnight's round brown cheeks grew red and flushed, \"D-Don't you talk to me like that you little pipsqueak!\" she barked back, \"You're just jealous of my killer bod is all!!\" Ali snickered darkly, \"More like killer on some pies, how much you weighin' in at Chubs?\" she laughed before Midnight lunged up from the bed baring her teeth. Ali just giggled and jumped out of the room, hopefully finding her sweats in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight sighed angrily before she sat back down on the bed, lamenting on how terrible that little shorty was to her. \"Made me mess up my toenails!\" she whined before pulling down on her once-fitting (okay, still a little tight then) belly shirt turned-tube top. Yes it was true, Midnight couldn't quite paint on her uniform this morning. In fact, she'd been having more and more trouble trying to put on that suffocating piece of work all week! She regretted ever asking Shera to make that damndable thing, especially now that Walker had been such a jerk to her. Walker... just the thought of that embarrassing day last week was enough to make Midnight want to claw her eyes out! Or, rather, eat some cookies; seeing as how that was the logical replacement for self mutilation. And eat cookies she would, as her eyes traveled back over to the baggie of the chocolate chip confections that Wester had been supplying her with after hearing about her distress one night in the kitchen. The Mightyena moemon stuffed on in her mouth, now grown accustomed to choking back her feelings of unrequited love for the cross dressing (though she didn't have to know Walker's true gender just yet) butler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat back down, the Mightyena moemon let out a heavy grunt as she attempted to reach past her stomach- grown so fat that it now bulged out to form a milk chocolate muffin top over the waistline of her sweat pants. It was a soft, round dome that jiggled and wobbled quite noticably with every step, since none of her tops could quite cover her kangaroo paunch. It wrinkled up into a small spare tire when she leaned over, her engorged breasts brushing up against the large lower roll from underneath her silver top. Her plush bum spread wide throughout a pair of borrowed sweatpants, so large that they couldn't stop the coinslot effect that her hunched position presented. She couldn't help but notice how her stomach touched the blanket as she hunched to paint her toenails, but rather than freak out about it, Midnight simply reached for another cookie to satiate her appetite.<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"FONTINA!!\" Ali shouted, bursting into their shared room sweaty and out of breath, \"HAVEYOUSEENMYSWEATSIVELOOKEDEVERYWHERE!!\" she panted and wheezed pathetically after such a long trek throughout their living quarters. The blue haired water type could only blink unresponsivley, \"Um... what?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparantly, <i>everyone</i> had grown too fat to wear their uniforms, as Fontina had squeezed herself into a pair of lounge clothes only a size or two bigger than Midnight's. That was about two or three sizes too small for her. Her breasts spilled from underneath the straps on her tank top, grown too engorged and flabby for any of her bras to fit. Normally she would have asked Shera (or Claire, judging by how big her breasts were getting) for a spare, but underwear was just one thing she didn't quite feel comfortable sharing with another moemon. So she would have to suffer until she worked up the nerve or bought a new one once she got a chance. Her doughy, now fully formed, double chin was always visible now whether she spoke or not as it blended almost seamlessly with her chubby cheeks. \"No Ali, I haven't seen them.\" she said in a concerned tone, snapping the copy of \"Across the Honchkrow Floor\" shut in order to assist her friend. The blue haired girl grunted as she wriggled her way to the edge of the bed, belly covering her crotch as she heaved her mighty bulk from the plush comforter. Standing up, her torso formed three distinct sections; Her breasts, which were largely in charge of her figure, her belly, second in command, and the slowly growing spare tire that rested itself above her pale muffin top. She tugged down on her top in an embarrassed fashion, only for it to pop right back up over her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO TIME!!\" Ali shouted, \"THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING OUT LIKE THIS!!\" she gesticulated to her zipper with pointed thumbs, nearly out of breath and ready to pass out any second. Fontina felt similar distress about two days ago when she outgrew <i>her</i> uniform. So that's probably why Ali had come to her. Because she was fat. Yay. \"Okay now hold on Ali.\" Fontina said, reaching out to her friend with a soft comforting hand, \"You can wear one of my old ones, it's no problem.\" she smiled, prompting Ali's tiny frame to jump up and hug her older friend. \"Thanks Fontina... you're awesome.\" she said gratefully, \"Where do you keep 'em?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top drawer on the right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Fontina's surprise and Ali's remorse... they almost fit (save for the legs of course :P)</span></div></div>",

Not that she had much of a choice in the matter. Until Shera had finished with the extra large uniforms, she\u2019d have to work with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 A thought just occurred to me,\u201d Ali thought out loud as she pulled up the long skirt of the uniform, preparing to take some safety pins she had to make sure she wouldn\u2019t trip over the fabric as she worked. \u201cWhy do we have to wear the uniforms? I mean, it\u2019s not like this \u2018master\u2019 is even here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think its just to make sure that we\u2019re professional,\u201d Fontina answered as she walked back (trying to block out the fact that she was actually waddling) to the bed to grab her book. \u201cI mean, the way we\u2019re dressed now, if someone came to the door and we answered it we would\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started slowly, with only small vibrations that only began to shake some of the lightest pieces of furniture. But then the shaking began to grow stronger, and stronger, sending both Ali and Fontina fell to the floor, both of them yelling and screaming as the shaking got stronger and stronger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cALI! GET UNDER THE TABLE!\u201d Fontina shouted before both chubby girls quickly crawled under the nearby wooden table in an attempt to protect themselves (although, Fontina\u2019s heavy frame took up most of the room underneath it). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as quick as the earthquake came, it ended just as quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 That was weird,\u201d Ali admitted crawling out from under the bulk that was her friend Fontina\u2019s blobby body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, are you alright?\u201d Fontina asked, as she slid from the table, pushing the fact that her thunderous thighs brushed against both legs of the table at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and I could make a few bad jokes to it,\u201d Ali sighed as she dusted off the borrowed maid uniform she had on. \u201cBut I\u2019ll refrain from that. Anyway, what was that about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust seemed like a regular earthquake,\u201d Fontina huffed as she pushed herself from the ground, her face slightly flushed from the action. \u201cB-But, we\u2019re far from the plates\u2026 So an earthquake shouldn\u2019t have been that strong\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Ember jumped a few feet in the air and crashed?\u201d Ali chuckled with a large smirk on her face. \u201cLooks like she\u2019d serve as a wrecking ball or something to that effect\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Fontina answered as she walked towards the door that conjoined the rooms. \u201cAli, I\u2019m going to check if Midnight\u2019s alright, could you see if everyone else is alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, no prob,\u201d Ali replied as she ran towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Ali walked through the hallways, stepping over some of the broken dishes and ornaments that now riddled the hallways. \u201cThe earthquake must\u2019ve been a lot stronger than I thought\u2026 That or maybe Ember just crashed right through here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli chuckled to herself as she turned the corner, however she stopped when she noticed that someone was on the floor, quivering as she held her legs close to her slightly chubby frame. Her sea-blue hair tails were laying on the floor and her slightly chubby face was skewed with a look of confusion and fear. Ali immediately knelt down to Kyrie\u2019s side, \u201cKyrie?! Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost as if the doll like girl didn\u2019t even register Ali\u2019s presence near her, she just kept on the floor shaking\u2026 <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201c\u2026 He\u2026 He\u2026</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s c-c-coming\u2026\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ali questioned as she shook Kyrie slightly, in hopes of snapping Kyrie out of this trance\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh man, are you getting heavy...\" Ali grunted as she hoed Kyrie down the hallway, the once waif-like girl now straining against Ali's largely unused forearms, \"Of course, I guess I'm not one to talk, am I Kyrie?\". Not even a twitch, no movement of any kind that would register that Kyrie had any comprehension of her surroundings. Which was strange considering just how well the young moemon had been doing socially this past week. She had learned to come out of her shell so much in these past seven days, in no small part thanks to Ali and Fontina looking out for her. Much like two older sisters would look out for the younger, more sensitive sibling. Looking down on her rounded, doll like face in such distress, the young Quilava moemon could only reflect on the fact that just yesterday Kyrie had experienced her first 'laugh out loud' moment when Ember laughed so hard she shot soda out her nose. Ali had never seen the young moemon laugh so hard in her entire life... but now she was reduced to <i>this</i>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"H-He's coming... h-he's really coming...\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt scared her. The young fire-type was scared for her new friend. Admittedly she knew little to nothing about Kyrie's past, thus giving her little insight on her mental or physical health, but the signs that this little mystery moemon wasn't well might as well have been neon and flashing. \"Hey come on Kyrie!\" Ali stopped and repositioned the diminutive moemon in her arms, \"Say something like-\" here she did her very best to imitate Kyrie's meek voice \"-<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">'P-Put m-m-me d-d-down, y-you'll get h-h-hurt!'</font>, or, I dunno something!\" she let out a low growl as Kyrie continued to babble on and on in her arms like a useless sack of potatoes. \"HEY KYRIE!!\" she hollered, \"Wake up in there, you're starting to scare me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as predicted, no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't just leave her there, out alone without a friend in the world like she had been found. No, Ali had to carry Kyrie through with this one. Maybe Shera could help her, or at the very least she could go wake up that Horus guy. He seemed pretty knowledgeable with things like this. But for now, Ali could only shrug and heft around the chubby girl bearing the obligations of friendship. However, something in the back of her mind told Ali that lugging Kyrie around may have been easier a week ago. Before she gained her share of the mysterious pudge that seemed to follow Ali and her companions around like a bad smell. Her sleek, angular chin was coated in a layer of facial fat; giving it the appearance of a rounded triangle with too much junk in it's angle. Her cheeks were rosy and flushed, maybe the signs of a fever (Ali wasn't a doctor!) but they always seemed to get like that nowadays. As she sat in Ali's arms, Kyrie's middle folded up in a cute little valley- her non-existant breasts getting just plump enough to resemble little hilltops for her chubby terrain. Even her arms and legs had grown a little thicker, evidenced by the soft layer of flab that engulfed them and made them swing more slowly as her body bounced with every one of Ali's steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaaan.\" Ali groaned, huffing and puffing from the foreign activity of exercise, \"So not cool, I knew I was getting kinda chubby but... huff... this is practically suicide!\" From behind her, in a small pile of dishes and nick-knacks tossed carelessly by the tremors, a disgruntled voice rose to make a snarky comment as usual. \"Of course you are, I've seen how you and your friends eat.\" it coughed, \"I'm surprised you're all still mobile at this point... oh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Walker; the cross-dressing butler s/he! Ali wasted no time, \"Oh crap, Walker are you alright?\" the smaller moemon requimed, only for Walker to spit back at her, \"What, don't you like my china cabinet blanket with broken porcelain accessories?\" she snapped, \"NO I'M NOT ALRIGHT!!\" Ali jumped slightly as she sat the still vegetative Kyrie down beside the buried butler. \"What happened?\" the Quilava moemon asked, knowing full well to expect some sort of sharp response, \"I mean, why're you buried under all this stuff?\" the Absol moemon growled, her eyes wincing slightly at the intense pain she was experiencing, \"I was just walking down the hallway when this stupid piece of junk fell on me!\" in her fury, Walker let slip a heavy handed slap against the heavy cabinet, causing something to rattle inside and break, therefore causing the cabinet to rest even heavier on Walker's legs and thereby getting it's revenge. She in turn, as it was so very lady like, let out a long, loud, and exotic string of cuss words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walker!\" Ali shushed her, \"Screaming isn't going to help!\" Walker stared at Ali, hoping to channel her intense hatred into one glass melting stare directed at Ali's pupils. However, that strange light inside of the young moemon flared up again and rendered all of Walker's arbitration useless. All the Absol moemon could muster was, \"...Fine... what's with tiny over there?\" she pointed the the rocking Kyrie, only for Ali to shush her again. \"Nevermind, can you walk?\"  she asked, helping Walker stand from the pile of rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh'yeah, I think I can-\" and for the first time since Ali's \"employment\", Walker let out a yelp. Of pain. A human (well, moemon) emotion. \"N-No...\" Ali grabbed Walker's waist, still bandaged up from that age-old injury during training. \"Alright, um... okay, I-I can do this...\"</span></div></div>",

Ali nearly stumbled herself and almost sent Walker to the ground again, but managed to stabilize herself at the last second. \u201cA-Another one?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli turned towards Kyrie, who was now actually reacting in a different manner than she was earlier, her eyes were closed and her hands were gripping her puffier arms and through the large scaled shaking, Ali could see that the doll like Moemon was shaking herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just like the last one quake, this one didn\u2019t last long. \u201cMan, what is with these earthquakes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat last one wasn\u2019t an earthquake,\u201d Walker growled through her gritted teeth. \u201cIt was more like something broke through a wall or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be safer to assume that a wall fell?\u201d Ali questioned as she slowly walked towards the shivering Kyrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----- </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Walker was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the second floor someone had busted through a wall, with bricks, wood and various broken d\u00c3\u00a9cor riddling the floor as the bright sunlight from outside poured into the dust filled hallway. Slowly, the culprit who broke the wall slowly stood up from the floor, his tall muscular frame easily the same height of the hole behind him. Dressed in a long red vest and black pants, the man stretched his muscular arms, allowing the light inside of the building to reveal the black circular and line tattoos that riddled his dark tanned skin. His long red hair fell past his broad shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large man looked to his left and then to his right. Then, a large smirk appeared on his rugged face before he cracked his neck loudly. \u201cYou\u2019re here\u2026 I know you\u2019re here my eternal foe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took a step forward, the entire mansion shook once more, sending some dust falling from the ceiling above, \u201cYou may have escaped your fate once, but I the great Atlus will not allow you to escape from me a second time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another chance to look left and right, the mountain of a man named Atlus blinked a few times at his surroundings, \u201c\u2026 Uh\u2026 Now, which way do I go to fight my eternal rival? Damn new age buildings!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large Atlus growled loudly before he charged down the right, disappearing a few seconds later. And just as he disappeared into the halls, one of the nearby doors opened up to reveal Claire stepping out into the hallways with a donut in her mouth. She munched on the sweet for a few seconds as she looked at the large gaping hole in the wall before she swallowed the sweet completely. \u201c\u2026 Oh my, I didn\u2019t know we were adding to the mansion, is this supposed to be where a new patio\u2019s going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large maid merely shrugged her shoulders as a second growl echoed through the hallways, making the large Dewgong Moemon place her hands on her pillowly stomach, \u201cOh yeah, its breakfast time too. I should hurry before everyone eats everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Namely the possibility of a broken and/or damaged Midnight. If something had happened to her, the team would be without a leader. Though, it really didn't matter much if they had a leader or not right now, so it seemed to just boil down to that deep rooted friendship the three shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina poked her head into Midnight's personal room. Before the quake, it was very much like the room that she and Ali shared, save for an actual bed in lieu of a pull-out sofa. But after the cataclysm, it seemed that Midnight's room suffered far more damage than the room she so haughtilly discarded. Ironic. But that wasn't the point, there was broken porcelain from nick-knacks pre-arranged on the shelves everywhere in both little pieces and big chunks of white material. The bed was wrecked, but that was probably just Midnight's morning slothliness at work. The armoir had tipped, along with everything inside of it, and the door had busted into three fractions as well as millions of splinters. The dresser had miraculously remained on all fours, only to be scooted all the way across the room and get caught on the doorknob, which broke, again causing lots and lots of sharp pointy spears of wood to litter Midnight's abode. And there, on her back, was Midnight herself moaning in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohh...\" she whimpered, eyes narrowed to block out the light from the ceiling lamp. Fontina noticed a little blood on the carpet, and a gash running down her arm. \"M-Midnight!\" the Vaporeon moemon stammered as she made her way through the wreckage to meet her friend, \"Wh-What happened?!\" the dark type moemon whined a little bit more before sniffling, \"I-I don't know, I was just doing my toenails and... I just tipped over and fell off of the bed...\" her head lulled over to the side, \"Face first.\" Fontina gasped, ducking down with a heavy grunt to check Midnight's pupils for any signs of dilation. She was fine, but it was a little hard to tell with her dark brown eyes. \"Are you okay?\" Fontina asked, putting a chubby hand on her friend's forehead. \"I-Is Walker here?\" Midnight asked, still squinting. Fontina narrowed her eyebrows, \"No, why would he be, are you okay?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight groaned a little before responding with, \"Good- I don't wanna have to act tough in front of that jerk anyway- no I'm in <i>so</i> much pain, Fontina!\" the addressed moemon laughed a little and rolled her eyes, somehow she got the impression that Midnight would be okay. The Mightyena moemon shuddered and grabbed her flabby upper arm, wincing at the sting of her own touch. \"Ow!\" she hissed. \"Don't touch it, you'll get it infected!\" Fontina chided her friend, looking around for something to bandage her up with. \"Wh-What, you calling me dirty?\" Midnight chuckled weakly, one eye closing somewhat while keeping the other one on Fontina's chubby face. She could only laugh in response, \"Come on, we can joke after we get you all fixed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight let slip a small toothy grin, \"Thanks Fontina.... you're great.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen suddenly, a second earthquake echoed through the entire house again! What was left standing in Midnight's room began to rattle once more, the stationary becoming mobile and the broken porcelain starting to bounce up and down. The precariously perched Fontina lost her balance and was sent tumbling forwards, letting out a loud \"Oof!\" when she probably should have been shouting safety instructions. Strangely enough, the quake didn't seem to last long. And while the first one was brief at best, this one seemed more like a dangerous tease for things to come! When all things were still again, Fontina decided to warilly open her mouth, \"Phew, that was close.\" she sighed, \"Are you okay Midnight, I- OH MY!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been sent tumbling forward during the earthquake, remember that dear readers? Meaning that she had landed on top of Midnight, the poor dear. Her soft, creamy expanse rested heavilly on top of Midnight's whipped chocolate body, their soft stomachs pressing together behind loungeabout clothes as the heavier of the two slowly tried to engulf the smaller. But that wasn't what had startled her. Fontina had lunged forward, and since they weren't exactly toe to toe, instead of Fontina ending up in Midnight's breasts (as she is the taller one) things ended up on the reverse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight, the quick tempered Mightyena moemon, had inadvertantly began to motorboat one of her longest and most trustworthy friends with muffled pleas for oxygen. \"Mmmphphmm!!\" she hollered with newfound vigor, wriggled about between the overfed moemon's fat breasts, \"I-I'm sorry!\" the blue-haired girl shouted before popping Midnight's head out, \"A-Are you okay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES, I'M FINE!!\" she shouted, blushing ferociously, \"J-JUST GET ME IN THE BED SO I CAN LAY DOWN FOR A SEC AND GET MY BEARINGS!!\"<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"Y-You're sure you're okay?\" Fontina asked meekly, as she set Midnight's aching body on the plush confines of her bed. Midnight pat the patch on her arm, made from a ripped curtain in her room, weakly and let out a small, \"Yeah, I'm cool.\" Fontina smiled and sat down next to her, causing the bed to creak noticably and Fontina to burn the bright red of embarassment. \"S-So how about these quakes, huh?\" she asked, mostly just trying to change the subject, \"I mean, they're crazy right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight nodded, \"Yeah, whoever heard of a three second quake powerful enough to wreck a small city?\" she huffed, struggling to sit up a bit, \"Hey Fontina, would you mind drawing the curtains a little, the sun is really bright today.\" the water type nodded with fervor (especially after the embarassing incident of paragraphs 6-7) and released the mattress from the burden of her weight. \"Oh wait, that's right, didn't we use your curtain?\" she asked, turning back to the damaged dark-type, \"For what?\" she asked dimwittedly, \"You know, your cut, we used it to bandage it up.\" Midnight rolled her eyes, \"Well, I guess I can deal with a sunny day over a gash in my arm.\" she said begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait a second, Midnight.\" Fontina said, holding up a finger, \"Why's the sun out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'unno, maybe because it's daytime. Duh.\" she said sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina shook her head, causing those round cheeks of her's to wobble around somewhat, \"Nonono, I mean, it's rained every day since we got here, and it rained just last night!\" she peeked her head out the window slightly, \"But if you'll look outside, you'll see that everything is completely and totally dry!\" Midnight pursed her lips, sitting up completely now, \"Well yeah, that is kinda wierd I guess, but isn't everything usually dry after it stops raining?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It stopped raining, but whatever got rained on for that long is still going to be a little wet- but outside looks like a normal summer day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were quiet- things were getting strange around this mansion. Fontina rest a fist in her outstretched hand dutifully, \"We'd better get to the dining room, everyone'll go there first to see what's up.\"</span></div></div>",

And the floor, what is this soft substance on the bottom of my feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to look around, the massive Moemon bent over and ran his tattooed hand on the carpeting, \u201cIt feels like grass, but it\u2019s softer and it\u2019s blue. No doubt my arch-nemesis is the one behind this! She always did like blue\u2026 Atlus will find and destroy you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Atlus\u2019s yellow eyes narrowed down on the nearest door, and he immediately slammed his foot into it, sending the door flying into the room, \u201cHeeeeere\u2019s ATLUS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that Atlus crouched down and walked into the room, he was almost blinded by the gleaming light from the room, \u201cURK! It\u2019s a trap! I\u2019m being blinded!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, eventually, Atlus\u2019s eyes began to adjust to the light and he observed the large room \u2013 Taking note that the room was made up of a fine, white and gleaming porcelain, bright lights reflecting from the ground and all around the walls were several paintings that depicted the ocean with several Magikarp and Remoraid leaping from the waves. Atlus was almost in aw as he slowly walked deeper into the room, \u201cPerhaps this building is a castle, this does resemble that of a grand hall or\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cURK!\u201d Atlus grumbled out as he stumbled backwards, grabbing his now bruised shin. \u201cSonva\u2026 What the hell?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus narrowed his eyes down on what he had just rammed into, but then tilted his head slightly at the sight before him, \u201c\u2026 Oh, this is a throne room. There\u2019s a throne right in front of me\u2026 But it\u2019s not a throne I\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the weird \u2018throne\u2019, Atlus peered into the seat, realizing that he was looking what appeared to be a small bowl with water in it. \u201cHmm, perhaps my arch nemesis has gotten stronger since our last fight. It\u2019s obvious that she\u2019s taken over this castle, and made this room her throne room\u2026 It\u2019s a weird throne still, and what\u2019s this lever here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus pushed the lever on the side of the \u2018throne\u2019 slightly, allowing a loud unfamiliar sound to him to echo through the room and make the large Moemon jump slightly as he watched the water disappear into the throne and then reappear a few seconds later. \u201cWHAT SORCERY IS THIS?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 It\u2019s called indoor plumbing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">--------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the Dining Hall, everyone was stationed in several different parts of the distorted room, apparently the large table had taken a powerful hit from the two quakes, with its legs now scattered on the ground with it flat on the carpeting. Standing in the corner of the room was Ali and Fontina looking over the still shivering Kyrie who kept muttering under her breath. When Fontina and Midnight arrived at the dinning hall, Wester had asked for one of the two girls\u2019 help in sweeping up broken dishes in the room, and unfortunately, Midnight had saw this as a chance to get some more comfort food in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the room, next to the fallen table was Shera, carefully bandaging up Walker\u2019s busted leg with Claire sitting on the ground next to them holding up the first aid kit. Ember wasn\u2019t too far off, but she was curled up in the large ball that she was, still sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking those who should be asleep, a familiar trio was in the room as well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZis is so vrong and cruel!\u201d Ivan groaned loudly as he tried to fix his mess of cropped hair. \u201cI know zat ze earz can move wiz romance, but zis is so vrong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw shut your fanged trap, Dracule,\u201d Ethel growled as he pulled his skull like hood over his head. \u201cI don\u2019t like being awoken during the day either, but two earthquakes are kinda something to take notice of!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthel then turned his head towards Ali, Fontina and Kyrie in the corner and smirked devilishly and muttered under his breath, \u201c<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u2026 besides, I heard that women get turned on during natural disasters. We play are cards right and</font>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what?\u201d Horus questioned as he walked up behind his two subordinates, a tray filled with several coffee cups held in his hands. Ivan was too preoccupied with his hair to really notice the Noctowl Moemon\u2019s presence, but Ethel nearly jumped out of his uniform when he heard that raspy voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remind you two that we\u2019re not doing overtime, so I suggest you two get some coffee while we discuss this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthel sighed loudly as he took two mugs, knowing full well that Ivan wasn\u2019t going to grab a cup for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Shera, where do we stand with injuries?\u201d Horus asked as he walked up the Kangaskhan Moemon, who was just finishing up with Walker\u2019s injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, aside from Walker\u2019s broken leg,\u201d Shera sighed with a sad smile on her face. \u201cEmber\u2019s got a few bruises, and Kyrie\u2019s freaking out a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorus shook his head when he saw Kyrie being comforted, \u201cPoor thing looks like she was held at knife point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 What kind of saying is that?\u201d Walker pointed out, taking one of the mugs of coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for damages,\u201d Horus continued, either not hearing Walker\u2019s complaint or just ignoring it. \u201cI sent Ethel and Ivan around the third floor, some of the paintings fell from the walls and there are a few broken antiques, the floor doesn\u2019t look like it took too much damage there, but what about the other floors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst floor\u2019s the same I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Shera sighed loudly. \u201cThe master\u2019s not going to be happy about this, especially since his collection of rare golden plated limited edition statues got busted in the process.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got them insured,\u201d Horus replied with a sip. \u201cHeck, he\u2019s got everything insured here, I doubt he\u2019ll have to worry too much about it. As long as the building itself is in tack, we should be good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Claire sighed with a carefree smile on her face. \u201cAnd I bet he\u2019ll be really glad that the new patio is coming along great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Shera and Horus\u2019s eyes widened when they heard that, making them both turn towards Claire and ask at the same time, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hole on the second floor wall,\u201d Claire replied with a bright smile on her chubby face. \u201cIts coming along greatly, and that worker you had come is really fast and efficient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorus sighed loudly with a slap to his forehead, \u201cGreat, there\u2019s a hole in the house and we\u2019ve got a trespasser\u2026 This is why I think we should get Houndoom Security guards in here! Shera, if the house doesn\u2019t explode in the next five minutes, I\u2019ll be amazed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that Horus finished his sentence, a loud explosion rocked the entire mansion, almost shaking its entire foundations. Horus lowered his head grounded his teeth, \u201cI could almost feel that coming, just as I finished that sentence!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was getting louder, it sounded like wood splitting somewhere in the mansion! \"Wh-What was that?\" Ali managed to squeak as Fontina held both her and Kyrie close to her large expanse. \"I-I don't know...\" Horus said quietly, seeming less and less in control by the second. \"Everyone please be quiet, and no sudden movements.\" Shera said in a hushed though commanding tone, \"Don't do or say anything unless it's absolutely necessary until these quakes are over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was about the worst thing Shera ever could have said. The feeling one gets when they're told not to do something is doing exactly what one was told not to do. Just not on a conscious level. How else could one explain that Ali's nose was starting to itch really bad, and her breathing was becoming somewhat labored. Or the fact that Fontina, who hadn't had any breakfast at all, still felt the pressure in her belly that threatened to waltz right up her esophagus and become a loud burp? Both women felt these urges, but as another large 'CRRAAAAACK' filled the bottom floor, they become much less urgent in lieu of their safety. Still, some things cannot be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" Midnight's voice clamored for an audience, \"Did'ja feel that last one? Made the whole kitchen shake something fierce!\" she practically shouted as she debuted into the kitchen in all of her boisterous glory, \"I mean seriously, that one felt like it was coming from right under ground!\" she was met with all kinds of sharp gazes and piercing glances, none so powerful as the severely peeved Ali and Fontina... except the unforgiving death glare that belonged to Walker. \"Shut. Up.\" she said quietly from her propped position on Shera's lap, \"Sit. Down.\" the Absol moemon continued advising the Mightyena moemon and gestured over to her friends. It took a second for any sort of response, but the one that followed was hardly worth the wait:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't tell me what to do, you jerk!\" the lupine moemon growled as she started for the wounded disaster-type, \"Seriously, what gives you the right to order me around and treat me like some dumb bimbo?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you <i>are one</i>!\" Walker gave a horrible example of being quiet to the rest of the household, raising her voice in anger and even trying to lift her damaged body up from Shera's lap, \"Now sit down and <i>shut up</i> or we could all be crushed by this whole damnable mansion!!\" the butler's low tone of voice reverberated throughout the creepy silence that filled the mansion. Midnight, putting her safety ahead of her pride (for once, since this time she would die in sweats; atrocious) slowly backed away from the wounded moemon, backing towards her friends who had huddled in a corner. \"Okay, okay...\" she whispered very quietly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACHOOO!!\" Ali's nose had itched for far too long, and she let out one giant earth shattering sneeze, \"e-excuse me...\" she stammered, avoiding all the wide-eyed glares that surrounded her. She too became wide-eyed as the creaking and cracking of wood immediately picked up at a much faster rate. The sound waves from Ali's sneeze picked up, bouncing like pinballs off of the dining room walls and carried against all manner of broken decorum. Grunting became obvious from upstairs as it grew louder and louder, some mysterious groaning coming from the ceiling above. That one sneeze may very well have caused a chunk of the second story to collapse into the first! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that theory proved pretty popular with the rest of the help as a large lump of wrecked brick stone and wood started forming on the already trashed ceiling. \"Oh nice job, Ali!\" Midnight chided, forgetting that she too was supposed to hush, \"O-Oh Ali...\" Fontina said in a disappointed tone, \"Keep that damn mouth shut!\" Walker howled. But amidst the vocal displays of anger, a new voice arose as the ceiling continued to sink further and further down. One that was gruff, commanding, and a little over stimulated. And it was clearly heard amongst the groaning of pipes and cracking of foundations as the overhead level finally gave way, one large hole appearing before the rest collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN THIS INFERNAL THRONE!!\" Atlus would shout before he collapsed along with the ceiling. Just a few seconds earlier, the large redheaded man had gotten splashed with water from the back of the toilet- hoping maybe there was some way he could convert his enemy's throne into one he could call his own. He came crashing down, and while nobody was hurt, the entire foundation of the house shook and vibrated with Atlus. Exactly, it shook <i>with</i> Atlus. The caved-in second story of the house was much larger and heavier than the weight of the statuesque moemon, but for some reason unbeknown to the rest of the astonished moemon, Atlus's impact onto the solid ground seemed to shake it in a new way that caused more and more things to fall from their shelves! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone waited for the dust cloud to settle, light coughing filled the room as the dust dissipated; only to reveal Atlus playing with pipes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never in my long life have I seen such wizardry!\" he said, furrowing his brow as he scrutinized your basic everyday L-pipe, \"Holes... that are removable!!\" he stared to the ceiling, and back again at the pipe, then back to the ceiling... and then back to the pipe once more. \"These holes... these things... they must be the work of my immortal nemesis!\" he shouted, crushing the angle of the pipe with one mighty grasping motion, \"I must find a way to convert these holes... not this one though, I think it's broken.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH WILL YOU SHUT UP!!\" Ali shouted to the large man, that indignant inside of her flaring up again, \"YOU JUST WRECKED OUR ENTIRE HOUSE TO PLAY WITH PIPES?!?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?! GET OUT!! GET OUT!! GET OUUUUUT!!!\" she screamed, panting with everybody in the room staring (save Ember, cuz she's still sleepin') The wave of courage remained strong, even as Atlus started lumbering towards her, dwarfing the Quilava moemon with his massive build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" he said in a much more serious tone, looking down in Ali's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you...\" he said, the gold in his eyes flaring up violently, \"<i>YOU</i>, my eternal rival...\" he rasped, pointing downwards at...</span></div></div>",

Oh, such sweet, delicious\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Atlus could continue, he felt something banging up against his shin, making him turn down to see Ali kicking his shin, \u201cI thought I was getting tackled by a Caterpie, but it\u2019s only a runt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust what the heck is your problem?!\u201d Ali snarled at Atlus, keeping her resolve just as strong as the large mysterious Moemon narrowed his sight on her. \u201cAnd why are you scaring Kyrie?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus only chuckled as he lifted his hand up and reached around Ali to reach for the back of her borrowed uniform. Before Ali could react, Atlus was lifting her off the ground with only his pointer finger and thumb clamping on the fabric. The fact that he was able to easily lift her off the ground (especially with her recent weight gain) was able to make Ali flinch and gulp slightly. \u201cA reason? Very well you stuffed runt of a Moemon, you want my reasoning? Very well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his face curled up into a wicked smirk, Atlus stood up tall, increasing the distance between Ali and the floor below her. \u201cApparently my mortal nemesis didn\u2019t tell you anything about her \u2013 Do you see these markings on my body? My clothing? Or even my power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove his point, Atlus lifted his large foot up into the air and slammed it into the floor, sending a powerful shockwave through out the entire mansion. But even more impressive was the fact that he had sent a large amount of the debris from the table flying into the air for a few seconds before they landed on the ground. \u201cHaven\u2019t you wondered what your scared little friend was? What sort of Moemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I should introduce myself\u2026 I am Atlus \u2013 The titan of the earth! The king of earthquakes! The earth god himself \u2013 Groudon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone\u2019s eyes widened when they heard Atlus\u2019 roar throughout the room \u2013 Everyone had heard of the legends of Groudon, the Continent God of this world with the ability to control the land and create a constant bright sunlight and was known as the creator of the lands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that didn\u2019t seem to persuade a certain Quilava Moemon, \u201cSo what? You\u2019re a big idiot who thinks he\u2019s Groudon? What does that have to do with anything?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t get it, do ya, you worthless mortal?\u201d Atlus chuckled turning his wrist to make Ali turn towards Kyrie. \u201cIf I\u2019m Groudon, and this girl you know as Kyrie is my eternal rival\u2026 Well, perhaps Moemon are stupid now-a-days\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is the goddess of water and my timeless foe \u2013 Kyogre!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie\u2019s eyes closed as tears began to well up in the corner of her eyes, and the smirk on Atlus\u2019 face grew more demonic, \u201cAnd now\u2026 To finish what we started at that city known as Sootopolis! And no one will get in my way this time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a simple flick of his wrist, Atlus tossed Ali through the air, \u201cAAAAH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli closed her eyes, waiting for the moment of impact\u2026 However\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cURK! For a dainty little girl, y-you are a little on ze heavy side!\u201d Ivan groaned as he struggled slightly to hold up Ali\u2019s heavier frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, what a way with words,\u201d Ali muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while Atlus tossed Ali through the air, Horus took that opportunity to jump on the larger Moemon\u2019s back and grab Atlus\u2019s neck and raised arm, \u201cSHERA! GET EVERYONE OUT OF HERE! NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU DARE OPPOSE THE GOD OF EARTH!?!?\u201d Atlus roared stumbling about, trying to shake the Noctowl Moemon off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cETHEL! IVAN! ANYTIME YOU WANNA HELP IS GOOD!\u201d Horus snarled slamming his foot into Atlus\u2019 back a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera quickly lifted the injured Walker in her arms while Claire actually rolled the sleeping Ember out of the room. Fontina and Midnight were both helping in trying to carry Kyrie out of the room with Ali leaping from Ivan\u2019s arms and following her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAMN IT! RELEASE ME!\u201d Atlus snarled as both Ivan and Ethel leapt onto Atlus, following their boss\u2019s orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTELL ME THIS ISN\u2019T THE ONLY PART OF THE PLAN!\u201d Ethel shouted as Atlus stumbled about, carrying all three of the other Moemon about slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAS SOON AS I COME UP WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, YOU\u2019LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW!\u201d Horus shouted back tightening his grip around Atlus\u2019 neck, trying to perform a choke hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZIS IS GOING TO RUIN MOI\u2019S HAIR!\u201d Ivan cried with tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took three of the most highly trained moemon at disposal to successfully wrap around Atlus' large neck, yet no one could squeeze the air out of this behemoth! His tanned skin was tough and hard as armor, while rough as stone and just as thick as a tree trunk. Their opponent was a monster, nay a God, an yet the persistence between them was just as strong as it would be with any other intruder. \"RELEASE ME YOU FOOLISH -&gt;GACK&lt;-\" Ethel tightened his grip, the tiny arm of the diminutive boy reaching just around his adam's apple. \"Quiet!\" he shouted, \"This is <b>MY</b> mansion, you'll speak when <b>I</b> say so!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost type back-flipped off of Atlus' sturdy pecs and got into battle position, \"I don't even need you guys to take down some Groudon impersonator!\" he shouted cockily, \"Even if it was Groudon himself, you guys just might as well sit down and have a cup of coffee!!\" He ripped the sleeves from his guard uniform to reveal a small vest and scarf, bringing the thin cloth over his face and narrowing his sights. \"As much as I would enjoy that, Ethel,\" Horus grunted as he picked up the slack of his cocky subordinate, \"This is serious, impostor or not!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NO IMPOSTOR!!\" Atlus roared, bucking and braying like a wild Tauros. The flying pair of guards kept wrapped to the monstrosity's neck, but only long enough to be flicked off like insects. \"THE AUDACITY!!\" Atlus bellowed again, ramming Ivan into the wall with his mighty shoulder, \"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK OF THE GREAT ATLUS LIKE I'M NOT EVEN HERE!!\" He grabbed at Horus, who scrambled up the intruding body like a drowning rat in search of higher ground. \"Ethel!\" Horus commanded, \"This isn't a game!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost type smiled from beneath the black scarf, his gaze half-hidden by the lopsided hood; letting only his left eye show the malice behind it. \"Oh yeah it is.\" he said quietly, smirking to himself, \"And <b>I'm</b> the winner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once the tiny frame disappeared in mid-taunt without so much as a cool effect. No shadow whisking him away, no puff of smoke. Suddenly he reappeared, along with his foot that was slammed into Atlus' perfectly sculpted jawline. While it didn't hurt, it certainly took the large man by surprise, \"Wh-WHAT TRICKERY IS-\" yet his outburst was cut short by another sudden slash to hit his chest. Again, little more than a flesh wound if anything, but it scared the pants off of him. \"How'dya like my Shadow Sneak?!\" Ethel's voice taunted, coming from many many places at once, \"Too much for ya, huh Tiny?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother quick burst of speed allowed Ethel to propel himself at Atlus' torso, aiming for the kill as he held his small (usually concealed) dagger above his head. For theatrical effect, imagine that this takes in slow motion: the small adolescent ninja's small yet built body shooting directly at Atlus' Adonis-esque pectorals. His golden eyes slowly face the approaching ninja, only to find that it is too late, there is little he can do to escape this fate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept summon up a wall of the previously erected foundation of land beneath the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Ethel didn't hit the barrier face-first (as predicted) and simply back-flipped from the wall of dirt and landed on a rickety shelf. \"Phew, that was close!\" he laughed, dropping the serious demeanor for a second to live up to his true comedic character. \"Ethel, vat's zat he's doing?\" Ivan questioned from the other corner of the room, \"It looks like dirt, kinda.\" the smaller guard mused, wiping some of the substance from his small blade. \"Yes, I vigured as such, zis man iz Groudon after all, non?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so sure!\" Horus' voice called from the other side of the wall, \"This... <i>man</i> could still have some weaknesses, don't give up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the other side, Horus was having his own difficulties with Atlus. The enormous man had seperated him from the rest of his squad, and he knew it! The \"God\" had lumbered towards him and pushed with all his might, easily enough to outclass Horus' own. The caffeine junkie had been sent flying into the wall, but fortunately, the air played to his strengths. He released his hands and prepared for the impact to come, dropping like a bomb onto Atlus and his sturdy foundation. \"TAKE DOWN!!\" Horus shouted, hearing some bones pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his surprise, they weren't <i>all</i> his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis elbows, long reinforced by years of hard training with Walker and the others, had become callused and hard enough not to feel the devastating effects of landing like a double-headed hook onto Atlus' shoulder, his knees nowhere near fragile enough to be broken by Atlus' plated spinal cord. Atlus on the other hand, while not devastated by the attack, had certainly felt it's effects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You...\" he grumbled, reaching behind him to catch the pesky pigeon who had so impudently thought to attack him. When he did, Horus' next resort was a swift kick to the nose. It did nothing. \"I have long since honed my body to perfection, impudent one.\" Atlus' voice rumbled lowly, \"You, a mere goose without his flock, cannot hope to penetrate my exterior.\" Horus backed down, keeping his fists clenched whiteningly tight, \"IVAN, NOW!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as bossy as alvays, eh Horus?\" the thickly accented drawl came from above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his magnetic shoes for traction, Ivan Dracule had walked over the wall and positioned himself over the current fight. Piecing apart Horus' codewords \"Don't give up\" meaning, \"Come back me up\", allowed him a little insight to the current situation. When Horus called for backup, he got what he asked for. \"Vine!\" Ivan shouted, releasing the magnets on his shoes and falling down- using his cape to fall down in a much more controlled manner- and landing directly on top of Atlus' shoulders, \"TOXIC!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Atlus, while not \"human\" per say, was taken aback when a mere mortal's teeth punctured his impenetrable skin. His rock hard, sand paper like, tooth chipping skin! Ivan's pronounced canines chomped right into his trap muscles and he felt something warm fill his veins. At once, the vampire jumped from his back and landed on top of the wall once again, spitting out a disposed toxic cartridge like tobacco. \"You like eh, Monsieur Groudon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus only chuckled, cracking his neck loudly and forcing the purple liquid from his veins with sheer pressure. \"FOOLISH NOSFERATU!!\" Atlus howled, \"I am the God of EARTH, your poison is secreted from the plants that <b>I lay foundation to!\" Ivan scratched his noggin, ignoring the cowlick that sprung up in the back, \"Vat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a ground type, poison doesn't work against him.\" Horus said in a disappointed fashion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still here you know.\" Atlus said in a menacing tone before using his mighty arms to punch Horus in his middle, sending him flying into Ivan. He chuckled menacingly before again his \"impenetrable\" wall had been penetrated. This time in a much more practical fashion. \"STOP TALKING!!\" Ethel shouted, readying some blue capsules in his palms. He had <i>broken</i> a wall created by Atlus' Earth Power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SKULL TECHNICAL TECHNIQUE: BLIZZARD!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold\" Ethel grabbed a hold of Atlus' head with his freezing hands, making him roar in pain like a lion. He began bucking and braying once more, throwing Ethel all about the room. He crashed through his own wall and forced all three of them outside into the horrid sunlight in hopes of melting away Ethel's frosty touch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IMPUDENCE!!\" he shouted, \"NOW THAT WE ARE IN MY ELEMENT, THERE WILL BE NO HOPE FOR YOU!!\"</b></span></div></div>",

The tremor seemed to grow weaker as a large pillar of earth erupted from the ground in front of the Groudon Moemon. \u201cROCK TOMB!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a powerful punch, Atlus slammed his fist directly into the pillar of rock, shattering it into millions of pieces that flew through the air towards the night staff. However, thanks to the groups obviously superior speed, they managed to dodge the jagged pieces of stone \u2013 With Ivan skidding to the side, Ethel disappearing without a trace and Horus leaping from the big pieces to get closer towards the titan of a Moemon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with the last stone, Horus leapt high into the air, pulling back his right arm and holding it back with the other, almost making his right arm growling a metallic silver, \u201cThe only one who\u2019s paying is you! STEEL WING!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus merely tightened his muscles and pulled back his own fist, basking it in a powerful blue flame, \u201cFOOLS! Your attempts are useless! DRAGON CLAWS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue flames seemed to sprout out three claws that Atlus threw forward, making it come in contact with Horus\u2019 fist, sending a rush of light and blue flames through the air. For a moment, it looked as though both of them were evenly matched, neither one of them budging with the force that they were creating with their attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Atlus took a mighty step forward, and smirked wildly, \u201cPuny mortal! Did you honestly think that you could win with just that amount of force!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, no!\u201d Horus growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus raised an eyebrow, only to realize that something was standing on his broad shoulders with something exceedingly cold clamped to the sides of his head. \u201cSKULL TECHNICAL TECHNIQUE: BLIZZARD!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Atlus could properly respond, a deep freeze ran through the Groudon\u2019s head, making him lose his concentration and allowed Horus to go over his Dragon Claw attack and slam his glowing arm right into Atlus\u2019 neck, making the larger Moemon gag loudly as the force knocked him to the ground with a loud booming sound that caused a large amount of dirt to fly up from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Horus and Ethel leapt back and landed on the ground, both of them breathing hard. Horus removed his hat and wiped the sweat from his brow, \u201cDamn\u2026 He was a tough sonvagun, good job Ethel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeh, he was all talk,\u201d Ethel chuckled, before he turned towards the mansion to see Ivan step out from the large hole in the wall. \u201cAnd thanks for the help Ivan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Ivan sighed as he walked up to the other two security guards. \u201cMoi was dodging flying rocks, FLYING rocks. If moi was struck wiz one, zen zat would\u2019ve been a tragedy for ze entire world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour ego\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d Horus sighed putting his cap back on. \u201cNow then, we gotta figure out what to do with the big guy here and\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Horus could finish, a powerful wave of heat pushed back all of the dirt and dust, and even made all three of the security team skid backwards. And standing amongst the flying dirt, was Atlus himself, his entire body glowing with a powerful red aura that make his skin turn to a bright red with smoke rising from his body. \u201cDO. YOU. THINK. YOU\u2019VE. WON!?! YOU. HAVEN\u2019T!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass at Atlus\u2019 feet began to catch on fire, growing stronger and stronger as Atlus crossed his arms over his chest, \u201cEVERYTHING! I\u2019LL BURN\u2026 EVERYTHING TO THE GROUND! ERUPTION! ERUPTION! ERUPTION! ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUPTION!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZis is bad!\u201d Ivan yelped as he turned towards Ethel. \u201cQuick! Use zat technique of yours! Cool his head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you nuts?!\u201d Ethel snapped back pointing towards the Groudon Moemon that now had flames dancing around his body. \u201cEven if I did, the guy\u2019s on fire! FIRE! I\u2019d get burned to a crisp in a matter of seconds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Horus growled as he narrowed his eyes at the going-critical Groudon. \u201cWe better do it fast! Ivan! You\u2019ve mastered that Air Cutter right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 Wait,\u201d Ivan gasped as he came to realization. \u201cHorus! No! Zat technique is strong, but if we do zat while ze oaf over zere is like zat, zen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think I don\u2019t know that?!\u201d Horus growled loudly as he grabbed his right bicep tightly with his left hand, making his right arm glow bright silver once more. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have a choice in the matter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what the hell are\u2026 You two\u2026 talking\u2026\u201d Ethel began to stammer off as a large smirk appeared on his face, drool starting seep from the corner of his mouth. \u201cOooh yeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Horus and Ivan blinked a few times, realizing that Ethel was staring at the mansion, more specifically the exposed second floor\u2026 and even more specifically at the fact that Kyrie was standing at the second floor dressed in the swimsuit, sleeves and head fins she was wearing when she was found \u2013 However, it looked like it was a size or two smaller and showed off the blossoming breasts, hips and tummy that were the result of her recent weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorus\u2019s eyes widened as he quickly pulled down his hat over his eyes, \u201cW-What in the world is she wearing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of the sexiest things I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d Ethel howled with a large smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Now if only she was a little older,\u201d Ivan pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a Kyogre Moemon,\u201d Ethel pointed out. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d have to\u2026 worry\u2026 Oh hell yeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now?\u201d Horus asked, not bothering to pull his hat back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthel, Ivan and even Atlus were watching Kyrie as she began to dance about the second floor, swaying her hips in a seductive manner and using the unattached sleeves as if they were fans as she spun around, her long hair waving about her body. There were mixed reactions amongst the fighting four, like how Horus kept his eyes covered by his hat, while Ivan and Ethel couldn\u2019t turn their eyes away. Atlus however, his eyes were widened at the sight of the mesmerizing dance, \u201cNO! STOP! STOP IT NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crash of thunder crashed through the air, making Horus look up to the sky to see that where the sunny, clear sky was, there was now a dark clouded sky. A smirk appeared on Horus\u2019s face when he came to realization, \u201c\u2026 Rain dance\u2026 Ivan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan snapped out of his stupor from watching Kyrie, blinking a few times, \u201cO-Oui, sir?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing the technique now!\u201d Horus announced as he grabbed his right arm again, making it glow bright silver as he ran forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right!\u201d Ivan yelped as he slammed his right leg into the ground, creating a powerful wave of air to surround his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, it began to rain, the water falling onto everyone outside \u2013 Including Atlus, who\u2019s skin was starting to steam and lose the fiery red aura that was around him, \u201cNO! THIS CAN\u2019T BE\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAIR CUTTER!\u201d Ivan shouted, delivering a powerful roundhouse kick that sent the air that was around his leg to fly through the air and fly towards Horus\u2019s back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of getting hit by the attack, the Noctowl Moemon leapt on the attack and rode it, propelling him towards the surprised Atlus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I AM GROUDON! THE STRONGEST IN THE\u2026\u201d Atlus roared\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTEEL WING!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Only to get Horus\u2019s empowered attack directly in his neck sending him spinning up into the air with his eyes blanking out. As Atlus spun through the air, his entire body seemed to pop into a large cloud of red smoke that fell to the ground, sending a large amount of mud to fly through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from the amount that was flung, it would appear that something smaller than the giant that was Atlus had fallen in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rain continued to fall thanks to Rain Dance, all three of the night staff began to investigate where \u2018Atlus\u2019 had fallen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not be defeated!\u201d Atlus\u2019s voice sounded\u2026 Only, it sounded a bit lighter than it did a few minutes ago. \u201cI am a god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure that stood up from the mud was none other than Atlus, only\u2026 It looked to be one third of the God Moemon. Standing in between the three was a small miniature Atlus (almost bordering on the chibi level) with a slim, tan body with his large clothes hanging off his small body and his long red hair matted with mud. The tattoos on his body were gone, and it was as if the three were looking at a teenaged\u2026 Or kid version of Atlus who was caught playing in the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will destroy each and every one of you!\u201d Chibi Atlus roared, stomping his foot into the mud a few times. \u201cI will not take any of this disrespect from such commoners! I will\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAH!\u201d Atlus screamed loudly as he went flying through the air courtesy of Ivan\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud splash of mud echoed through the air as Ethel laughed, \u201cHa! That\u2019s what you get for messing up MY mansion!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHorus, what happened to him?\u201d Ivan asked shaking some water from his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell if I know,\u201d Horus replied with a smirk. \u201cBut, if he goes flying with that attack, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be much of a problem. And we owe a lot to that young Kyrie girl\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorus and Ivan turned to the second floor, just in time to see Kyrie fall to the floor, exhausted and her face flushed. \u201cStill, there\u2019s a lot of damage\u2026 But before that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I AM A <b>GOD</b>, DO YOU PUNY ONES UNDERSTAND THAT WORD?!\" a once proud deity screamed and hollered like the child he so much resembed, \"G-O-D; <i><b>GOD</b></i>!!\" the super-deformed Atlus squirmed about in Claire's soft lap. \"Oh!!\" Claire squealed, tightening her grasp around the squirming legendary and forcing him into her generous adiposity, \"He's just so cute! I can barely stand it!\" Atlus' expression only darkened as the back of his head was slowly enveloped by cleavage, one golden eye twitching as his cheeks became a harsh lava red, \"U-UNHAND ME MORTAL!!\" he shouted, his resolve somewhat questionable, \"I-I WILL NOT BE SEDUCED BY THE LIKES OF YOU, ...y-you... BIG BELLIED CODFISH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AW!!\" Claire squealed, her own resolve strengthening as she cuddled him in an even more affectionate manner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we be serious here for a second?\" Ali turned to the crowd of onlooking members of the staff, most of them just as exasperated as she was with just sitting around watching Claire snuggle around the tiny lord of the land. \"He totalled this house; <i>our</i> house, the place where we all sleep and work and... well you know!\" Ali turned back to the shrunken idol and outstretched a pudgy finger in his direction, \"Something has <b>got</b> to be done!\" Midnight, behind her friend, cracked her knuckles threateningly, \"I say we just give him a five-second head start, and do whatever feels right when we catch the shrimp!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd seemed very pleased with that idea, as a resounding cheer of agreement circled throughout the mob. Fontina, however, tried to play peacemaker as always. \"Now hold on a second!\" she hollered over the outbursting crowd, \"Even if we <i>do</i> beat up Atlus, what will that solve?\" She struggled somewhat to lift each of her heavy legs over one another to waddle beside Ali, \"The mansion will still be in shambles, and then there will be even less hands to help fix it.\" Atlus pried himself from Claire's busom to voice his disapproval, \"My hands will assist you in NOTHING!\" he spat back, his still prominent brow furrowing together, \"Even with this large-chested wench holding me back, my feet alone are enough to take down all of you soft squishy mortals!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather calm voice managed to quell the roars of the crowd, one so unusually calm and put-together that no one was really surprised when it was Shera. The large Kangaskahn moemon waddled in a very elegant fashion towards the crowd, the look in her eyes not one of anger or hatred, it wasn't one of pity or even sadness. It was the most terrifying look Ali, Fontina, or Midnight had ever seen. Ever. A completely and totally unreadable expression: Shera was blank as a slate. From behind her, where her blubbery form once stood in the ruined hallway, Kyrie (now dressed in her regular attire again) peeked her head into view. She was, as usual, quiet. It seemed that whatever effect Atlus had on Kyrie had dissapated for now, rendering her only somewhat of a recluse. But hey, that was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Atlus stopped howling and carrying on as his opposing mob parted to make room for the intimidating head maid. But his lapse of ego didn't last very long, returning to him in a swift, though somewhat shaky fashion. \"Wh-What, you have something to say Large One?\" he popped his mouth with a cocky sneer. Shera didn't flinch. She didn't wince, she didn't draw back, she didn't even get angry. Shera lowered her head and smiled gently in the demi-Groudon's face and smiled a very eerie smile. \"How would you like to get cleaned up, you got awfully messy out there in the mud.\" she said in a stoic manner<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's about damn time I was offered my Godly treatment!\" Atlus said haughtilly, signalling his captor to release him from her suffocatingly flabby embrace, \"I was starting to think you people had forgotten that Gods are supposed to be worshiped!\" Shera smiled some more, narrowing her eyes at the small boy in an almost cheerful manner. \"Ali, would you be a dear and help me keep Kyrie company?\" she turned to Claire, who had now fully released the now-mobile diety, \"Claire, find Ember and help her draw the bath- the poor dear has gotten so filthy, he may be in there for <i>hours</i>.\" she stretched the word in a very... chilling manner, extending one chubby hand for Atlus to grab and be escorted by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well I don't know about hours, housewench.\" Atlus said, reaching out to grab Shera's hand, \"Maybe the better half of a-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he stopped midsentence as Shera's hand engulfed his. No one quite understood why, until Ali walked ahead of the two to meet Kyrie in the hallway. The look on Atlus' face was one of pure terror and pain. Judging by the veins popping up from the back of Shera's hand and the whitening of both her knuckles and Atlus' hand; she must have been squeezing pretty hard. \"Ah...Ah....\" he whimpered, the weighty woman dragging his little body down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli's brow remained furrowed until she met with Kyrie, who stood next to her and seemed to be in much better comfort than earlier. She smiled at her Quilava friend and wrapped her in a tight hug, \"Th-Thank you so much... for earlier...\" Kyrie said quietly as she let go of Ali's pudgy form. All the hate that Atlus' presence seemed to slink away, as Ali started to smile too. \"Hey, no prob.\" she said in a quiet, though confident tone of voice, \"That's what friends are for; come on, you better be here for this too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie nodded silently and followed the other three...<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"Unhand me land whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw you were right Claire, Atty's really cute!\" Ember said in a cutesy-utesy sort of manner as she dangled the boy off of the ground. She twirled him around as his little legs stayed lifeless, swaying about in the air as he was spun about like some plaything for this immensely tubby moemon. \"I said let go of your God, gluttoness!\" he growled before Ember enveloped him in a hearty embrace. \"I'll feed him, and water him, and give him lots of love!\" she squealed, \"Can we keep him, please please please?!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NOT SOME HOUSEHOLD MONGREL!!\" the eons-old diety proclaimed as, much to his dismay, both Ember <i>and</i> Claire started pinching and prodding him- telling him just how adorable he was with every probe. \"This is disgraceful... in my prime I had hundreds of females at my disposal!\" he said to himself, \"Geishas, prostitutes, harlots, concubines! But now all I have is... these people...\" he let out a low rumble from the deepest part of his chest as a wave of disappointment flowed throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli and Kyrie, meanwhile, were taken aback at the spacious amount of elbow room that this lavish bathroom had provided. Since neither one of them had done much cleaning in Shera's dominion of the household, neither of them had ever laid eyes on this part of the mansion! The part with elegant stone floors, golden faucets and fixtures, and a grotto. A <i>grotto</i>! How much money did this master have to spend on himself anyway?! However, putting aside the jealousy and avarice that this lavish bathroom seemed to garner from her, Ali had some questions that needed to be answered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he, the little guy, he's Atlus?\" she sounded disbelieving, and she had her doubts, but Kyrie reassured her that the pipsqueak only a hair's length shorter than her, was Atlus: the God of the Earth. \"So does that mean, you know since you're Kyogre and everything, does that mean that you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Kyrie shook her head a resounding 'yes'. \"I-I don't remember much about my life before you rescued me, b-but seeing Atlus has brought back a few memories... ones that I'd... rather have left forgotten...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now dears.\" Shera's voice silenced the room, everyone far too afraid to upset her at this stage in her intense fury. \"There's no reason to make such a fuss. Ember, place Mr. Atlus in the bath so we can get started.\" Without hesitation, Ember removed the baggy garments (much to EVERYONE's dismay), picked him up, and let Atlus be; red-faced at the sight of his Godlihood exposed to eight mortal women's eyes. Shera, unaffected, waddled over to the side of the tub and dipped his head under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus' head shot back up slowly as he reclined back into the tub, enjoying his anticipated \"pampering\" with some... mixed results. \"O-kay, that was a little rough.\" he said in a wary tone of voice, \"But hey, I'm not one to pass up a good-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera immediately doused his long red locks of hair with shampoo and started beating the pulp out of his scalp. \"<b>Oh this is no good, I will definately have to get all this caked mud out.</b>\" her voice seemed to grow more gravelly and intimidating, \"<b>Oh to heck with it, why not just <i>cut</i> it out, I'm sure Mr. Atlus would look wonderful with <i>short</i> hair.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-NO!!\" Atlus shouted, jumping from the tub to expose his manhood yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I suggest you sit down and <i>relax</i> Mr. Atlus</b>.\" she said with a malignant twinkle in her eye, \"<b>You'll be at this mansion for quite a long, long, long time working off the damages you've caused.</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"...eep...\"</font></span></div></div>",

CURSE THIS INFERNAL CONTRAPTION!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, most injuries were recovering. For a certain chibified (I know it\u2019s not a word!) deity, his pain from his humiliating loss was only the beginning of his pain. Not only was he embarrassed from not only the loss, being treated as child and being stripped naked in front of several commoners, but it only went downhill from there. Everyday was another indignity to the God of Earth, starting with his hair \u2013 Once he had long, luscious locks of fiery red hair that were as unruly as the rays of the sun on a dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was cut short (save for the long, thin tail that was tied back with a thin black thread. And he was forced to wear these weird clothes that the \u2018Large One\u2019 referred to as \u2018denim overalls\u2019, which he was forced to wear along with a smaller version of his red vest. Although they were comfortable, the fact that he had to wear these dreaded things while he was forced by almost everyone in the mansion to re-build the damages that he caused. And while he did get help from different members of the mansion, that didn\u2019t stop Atlus from getting his thumb hit by the contraption called a \u2018hammer\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! The wall\u2019s done!\u201d Atlus howled throwing the hammer to the ground with a loud slam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly enough, the interior wall was actually built rather well considering who was building it, the basic framework was completed, but it would take some time to get the proper wiring and insulation (after all, there was an incident in the last month when Atlus was trying to figure out how a \u2018lamp\u2019 worked and he got zapped). \u201cAnd I can\u2019t take this anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeesh, you certainly act spoiled like a god,\u201d Ali huffed as she waddled towards the fuming Atlus. \u201cYou actually did a good job here though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph! Of course!\u201d Atlus laughed loudly with his tiny arms crossed over his chest. \u201cEverything that I make is a work of art! And at least I haven\u2019t been lazy like the rest of you bunch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! We\u2019ve been pulling your weight around here, you smart ass!\u201d Ali growled as she slammed a meaty leg into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s your weight that needs to be pulled,\u201d Atlus huffed with a roll of his yellow eyes. \u201cEspecially since it looks like you ripped open another hole in those garments of yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli gasped as she quickly turned her body around, eliciting a loud ripping sound to echo through the hallway, and her plump face blushing a bright red. Over the last month, this was the third maid uniform that Ali had outgrown/ripped, only this time it ripped in a proper place, namely near the chest area where she actually had developed something that she had been dreaming about for ages \u2013 cleavage. And not just simple cleavage, but enough to nearly rival Midnight\u2019s bust size (at least, before the three entered the mansion). Unfortunately for Ali, that wasn\u2019t the only thing that had grown, the rest of her rounding form looked to be on the path to follow a familiar Vulpix Moemon\u2019s figure \u2013 a wobbling double chin that peaked out every time Ali spoke, while her stomach and lower half looked like they doubled in size over the last mouth, pushing her maid uniform to the point where it was a second skin on her with frills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d Atlus laughed loudly. \u201cHow the not-so-mighty have fallen! It\u2019s pathetic to see that not only my eternal rival has grown soft, so have her companions! But it\u2019s also very comical!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis coming from a midget,\u201d Ali countered using her arms to cover up the rip in her uniform, she\u2019d have to talk to Shera about this again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour insults mean nothing to me, fire mouse,\u201d Atlus spat with a sneer on his face. \u201cTell the Large One that I\u2019m done for the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, it wouldn\u2019t kill you to learn our names,\u201d Ali pointed out as Atlus rolled his eyes, unaware of the third figure that was sneaking up on the two in the shadowy hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, would a noble take the time to learn the names of the serfs that works beneath him?\u201d Atlus retorted, not noticing that a large, bulky shadow was slowly creeping up behind him. \u201cYou lousy fools may have me under your control in my moment of weakness, but as soon as I get my power back I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cATTY!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus\u2019s eyes almost bulged out of his eye sockets when two meaty arms wrapped around his neck and pulled him into a familiar tanned bosom and belly. \u201cURK! T-The Young Kit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli blinked a few times as Amber\u2019s large frame bounced about the field, wagging Atlus\u2019s smaller body through the air as she continued to dance about the hallway, making a small earthquake of her own. \u201cAtty! I heard in the halls that you\u2019re done! YAY! Now you can play!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Release me you bulbous b-b-buffoon!\u201d Atlus gagged as his face began to turn slightly blue due to the lack of air that was getting through his lungs. \u201cI\u2026 I have n-no time f-f-for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, Atty, you\u2019re always the kidder!\u201d Ember laughed as she quickly ran down the hall, jiggling all the while with Atlus in her death grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli could feel a large bead of sweat roll down the side of her chubby head, <i>\u2018\u2026 I can\u2019t tell if Ember likes Atlus as a love interest, or if she thinks he\u2019s some sort of pet. Still though, I wish I could talk to him one on one, he knows about Kyrie\u2019s past. Sure she\u2019s gotten better, but still, there\u2019s still more that\u2019s holding her down\u2026\u2019</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ali still had to deal with some work before she was done for the day, so she slowly began to waddle down the hallway, still having one of her puffier arms covering over the rip over her chest (which she secretly smiled at).</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That's it, you've got it!\" Fontina cheered as she watched Kyrie sweep, much to the smaller girl's embarrassment. \"F-Fontina, this isn't the first time I've swept... just my first time on carpet...\" the Kyogre moemon turned somewhat red at Fontina's approval. \"O-Oh yeah...\" Fontina stuttered, turning a little red herself as the realization that she was acting just like her big brother Noir popped into her head. \"S-Sorry, it's just-\" Kyrie cut her off with one of her little giggles, \"I know, I understand, you just want me to know that you think I'm doing a good job so I won't get discouraged.\" she smiled sweetly, her golden eyes reflecting the sunbeams that flowed through the windows. \"Y-Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better get back to work, w-why don't you sit down?\" Kyrie said, repositioning the broom in her hands as she gave Fontina a worried look-over, \"You look really tired.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, under the circumstances of an unimaginable debt being held over her head, Fontina would turn down the offer of a well-deserved breather (that's just the type of girl Fontina is, after all). But after all the stress of keeping such a shambled mansion in order was obviously taking it's toll on Fontina, stressing on obvious. Every day for the past month, Fontina had struggled to keep her maidly duties in line while still keeping track of another cumbersome line. Namely, it was the one around her waist. And boy, she seemed to lose track of the latter a lot easier than the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I think I'll take you up on that offer, Kyrie.\" Fontina wheezed, puffy face beet-red with exertion. Sweat trickled down her cheeks even now as she painstakingly waddled over to one of the four plush chairs on this side of the wing, the weighty water-type's blubber soon engulfing a large majority of the seat. As she hefted herself down, Fontina let out a heavy grunt of relief and breathed in and out heavily. \"Th-Thanks Kyrie, I'm so sorry I can't work today, I-I'll make it up to you I swear.\" the Vaporeon moemon said in a winded tone as she struggled to regain her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh n-nono!\" Kyrie rushed over to console her ballooned friend, \"I-I don't mind at all, you just sit right there!\" she pat the back of Fontina's chubby hand, \"Let me help earn your keep, you guys work so hard!\" the seafoam-haired girl said with a smile on her face. Fontina welled up, her eyes growing somewhat misty as she whole-heartedly thanked the young(looking) moemon. \"Okay...\" she said quietly. Kyrie just smiled wider, \"Okay then, back to work!\" she cheered, holding up the broom in a celebration of her first voiced opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie couldn't help but take one last look at Fontina; ALL of Fontina. While she had been chubby since Kyrie had first made her acquaintance, Fontina had been expanding at an exponential rate ever since. Normally, this wouldn't bother Kyrie so much if all that extra weight hadn't taken it's toll on Fontina's ability to work hard and remain in a good mood. She always did her best, and it seemed that the heavens above had decided to reward her with the unwanted curse of obesity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, \"obese\" was a keen word to describe the far-past-chubby moemon. As she sat down, she had to wriggle her wide hips between the armrests of the comfy living chair, noticeably bulging underneath her altered uniform as they wedged into the fabric-y appendages. Her stomach, quite large now, sat lazily atop her cushiony lap, making itself comfortable as she tried to do so herself- finding that the ungrateful gullet was hogging all the space for itself. Her arms wrapped around the doughy convex, plush mixing with dough as the appendages sat atop their jiggly sister. And atop all of this sat the crowning lesbian queens that were Fontina's breasts. They were gigantic, shattering the par that Claire had worked so hard to set in a few short months of employment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving and wheezing, Fontina's face was a bright red as sweat trickled down from her somewhat longer blue locks. The trail traveled down the rolling hillside of her puffy cheek and either settled in the crevice of her second chin (always completely visible now) or pooled inbetween her bra-busting cleavage. She watched with a sort of envy as Kyrie expertly maneuvered her plump form across the carpeted floor, scraping up splinters, dust, and so-on-so-forth. It made her a little sad, not only because Kyrie was more mobile, but it seemed that she had grown up past the cute little girl who used to hide behind everyone's backs. Yup, Kyrie had really started coming out of her shell a lot more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I could talk to Ms. Shera if you want...\" Kyrie said quietly, letting out a cute little grunt as she bent over to brush debris into the dustpan, \"About positioning you somewhere you don't have to work so hard...\" Fontina blushed somewhat. Great, now even <i>Kyrie</i> thought she was too fat to work! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, n-no thanks.\" Fontina said quietly, \"With Ali taking up extra shifts and Midnight signing up for kitchen duty, I think all the easy positions are taken...\" Kyrie let her head hang slightly, expressing the lowerost facial roll that would soon blossom into her pale second chin, \"I-I heard that Shera doesn't like doing the mansion's accounting, m-maybe you could do that?\" the deity moemon squeaked, \"Y-You wouldn't have to work near as hard, and Shera might even pay you more than usual...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie grunted again as she bent over to scoop up yet another load of her dustpan when a quiet \"shrrrip\" sounded through the hallway. Kyrie's beautiful pale face turned neon pink as her hands shot to her backside, covering up the mar in her adorable blue uniform. All this time hanging out with the cursed Fontina and her buddies hadn't done much for her own waistline, though Kyrie failed to make the connection. Her waif-like form was buried underneath one several pounds heavier. Her face, round and cherubic, was a precursor to the rest of her; also quite round and cherubic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie's stomach, for example, was doughy. Not fat, not chubby, but doughy. The flabby middle jut out like a small tire and jiggled whenever the opportunity arrived. Her breasts, small and perky, had become... medium and perky. They too loved to embarrass the poor moemon, Ethel found the fleshy orbs perfect target practice for his grabby hands and always found something round and soft to compare them too. Her godly bum was actually rather small in comparison, though not without it's charms (and dimples) All in all, Kyrie had become quite the little chubster lately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh...\" she stammered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do... do you wanna go see Shera now?\" Fontina asked, trying to cover up for Kyrie's wardrobe malfunction, \"No problem with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Kyrie said quietly, holding her hands behind her back (over her bum, so as to hide the pair of light blue panties wedged up her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh, one more thing?\" Fontina asked in a pleading tone of voice, \"...Help me up?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the rest of the main group was in the hallways, our sights immediately turn towards the familiar kitchen, with various delicious aromas lofting through the air. The smells were coming from the stove, where a familiar Wigglytuff Moemon was at hard at work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something seemed different about Wester, perhaps it was the fact that his hair was combed differently or maybe it was that his uniform was extremely baggy on his thinner frame. \u201cHmm\u2026 Smells good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! It does!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWester smiled when he heard that voice, making his slightly sleeker (yet still chubby) face turn to the side, \u201cAh, excellent timing Midnight, you get the dishes done from lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike those dishes could really stand a chance,\u201d Midnight replied, her own face curled up into a superior smirk. \u201cSo, what you got cooking for dinner tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why not take a taste test for youself?\u201d Wester offered as he took a spare spoon and lifted it into one of the pots he had on the stove. One quick scoop, Wester held up the spoon towards Midnight. \u201cI assure you, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhenever you cook, I rarely am,\u201d Midnight answered, taking the spoon and fitted it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, a rush of flavors erupted in Midnight\u2019s mouth, making the Mightyena Moemon blush greatly and her cold demeanor instantly melted away as she allowed the tastes to settle in her mouth. \u201cHMMM! Mashed potatoes! And do I sense a touch of garlic and shredded radish skins?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I was hoping I could stump you today,\u201d Wester chuckled as he rubbed the back of his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to make you guess incorrectly for a good two weeks now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d Midnight proudly exclaimed as she placed her hand on her large hip, tossing the spoon into the sink a few feet behind her. \u201cMy taste buds have evolved, I can guess whatever ingredients you\u2019ve put in the food with a single taste! Haha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWester smiled even brighter, at first when Midnight had signed on for kitchen duty, she wasn\u2019t in the best of moods and seemed to only munch on the sweets that Wester had hidden around the kitchen (heck, it was impressive that she managed to come across his private stash of fudge and Swinub Sweet cream donuts in the first week). Eventually, Wester managed to ease Midnight into the work of the kitchen, by first simply asking her to be a good taste tester for his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she was reluctant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut eventually, the delicious smells had brought Midnight into the position of Taste Tester, and after the first few days, she began to do other work in the kitchen \u2013 Such as sweeping and cleaning the dishes, and actually doing a better job of it. There even some times when Wester would have Midnight help him with some basic cooking (mostly desserts though), and even managed to get her interested in the culinary arts slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was because of the combined efforts of taste testing Wester\u2019s food and the fact that she usually munched on sweet foods during her work, that Midnight\u2019s figure had changed drastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone were the trim waist, sleek legs, and overall slimness that belonged to the Mightyena Moemon, all of them covered by what could be best described as several layers of fluffy flab. With her uniform resized (and modified to accommodate her size, including the adjustable waist to accommodate the spare tire that was her gut), Midnight had really grown horizontally \u2013 almost to the point where she was either rivaling or grown past Fontina\u2019s new size. The maid uniform was still in the same style with the silver lining and the low cut in the front that showed off the endless cleavage that was her chest, both of the milky chocolate mounds struggling with each other to find room over her expansive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most impressive aspect of Midnight, was her backside, and while the skirt was lengthened considerably, her meaty thighs and medicine ball sized rump always made the skirt ride up several times to the point that Midnight unconsciously pulled her skirt down (which in turn made her breasts struggle even more in the confines of the top and often spilled from the gaping hole). Even her darkly beautiful face was rounder, having already sprouted a full grown second chin (and the makings of a third one in the works), but she still kept her beauty, especially now that her black hair seemed to have become even longer and silkier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed Midnight,\u201d Wester chuckled as he turned back to his preparations. \u201cThanks for your help, I can handle the rest of this stuff, so, why don\u2019t you go take a break? I\u2019ll call you when the food needs to be served.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Midnight yawned as she stretched her meaty arms over her head, making her bust bounce slightly (she had actually out grown her bras about two weeks ago, but its not like anyone would complain about it). \u201cSee ya in a while Wester\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dum dee dum, dum dee de dum dee~\" Midnight lightly phoned in the lyrics to her favorite pop song as she made her way down the halls, strutting her stuff as she tried to find something to occupy her sweet time with. \"Hum hum hmm hum... Got a secret, yes I do... hmmhmmhm...\" she said in a rather girly tone, imitating the vocalist best her somewhat vibrant voice would allow. Her swagger was even directed in a sort of choreography in tune to the rather rapid beat; meaning that every couple of steps, her wide flaring hips would be popped as she danced to the beat. For some reason, Midnight had just been in the best of moods lately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, sure, the mansion being ransacked by a holy home invader wasn't good. But other than that, things had been going great for our little (speaking figuratively of course) Mightyena heroine! She had so much fun working in the kitchen, especially these past few weeks, she and Ali had gotten in a lot less fights, and when they did she always seemed to come out on top! On top of everything, she was learning how to cook for herself now, so that whenever her friends <i>did</i> manage to continue their journey they could eat actual food rather than the freeze dried travel packs they'd all come to live off of! But probably the best thing about it was that Midnight had absolutely no reason to be so far up Cloud 9! None at all! It was just a sort of natural high that she only got when there was a little extra spending money that she could blow, or when some really cute guy took her out to dinner in a town she knew she'd never visit again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup, all things were looking just so wonderful for Midnight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhmhmm... Just a pretty la~dy...\" she bobbed her head a little, making little hand gestures as her expanse moved to the rhythm, each step causing her abundance to fight amongst itself for room in her tight garments, \"But'cha know, y'know...\" she trailed off slightly with a deep sigh, crossing those big arms of hers behind her head as she forced it back slightly in a reclining fashion. \"Oh man, there's nothing to do...\" she lamented with a sort of half-hearted sorrow, \"I might as well have just stayed in the kitchen, seeing as how everyone's busy!\" But of course, deep down in her heart of hearts, Midnight knew that not <i>everyone</i> was busy in the mansion. As it so happened, Walker the jerkfaced butler had broken his leg during that whole fiasco a month ago. And while his rock-hard bod had taken some serious injuries beforehand, this time he was busted up pretty bad. Maybe if Midnight just so happened to drop by, the two could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing profusely, Midnight dismissed the thought with a haughty pout. \"Hmph, I don't even wanna <i>think</i> about Jerkface.\" she said in a rather childish tone of voice, crossing her arms as she continued to both voice her opinions and trek down the hallways, \"Not even for a whole 'nother month, if ever!\" But the cherried topping to her chocolate cheeks said otherwise; Midnight would very much like to have gone up and 'visited' with poor injured little Walker. But that would mean admitting defeat, and Walker was a real jerk to her that day! That was something that the stubborn Mightyena moemon would never forgive him for: all she was trying to do was help him after all! How was <i>she</i> supposed to know that he would flip out after she got inbetween that fight? \"Never mind that...\" she said, trailing off in order to help break up the monologue, \"He's getting me all upset and he's not even here! Well he can just stay in his room and sulk all day if he wants, no skin off my perfectly pore'd nose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, our husky (lol) heroine let out a miffed huff and continued onward, pushing thoughts of foreplay and dirty romance with Walker out of her mind with no abandon. The top priority was finding a way to entertain herself for a good couple of hours, especially after slaving away in the kitchen with Wester. She deserved a day off! So, trapped on the first floor (Shera's office was on the second, if she found Midnight taking a non-preapproved day off, there would be heck to pay) without so much as a foggy idea as to entertainment, Midnight could only sing and hum as she sauntered down the hallway when the idea hit her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not just like a little bath in the tub, no, a real killer bath like she used to have back home! That would certainly do the trick, and luckily this constantly absent 'master' she'd been forced to serve was just loaded enough that he could afford his own private grotto (or at least that's what Ali had told her)! With a mischevious twinkle in her eyes, though not many could see it due to her cheeks fighting for facial property, Midnight's plan quickly came into fold. With Shera tapping away at her computer upstairs, Fontina Claire and Kyrie all cleaning upstairs, and Ali stuck with Atlus (and thusly probably Ember, those two were inseperable lately...) Midnight would have a clean path to the Master's chambers and therefore...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>His <i><b>BATH</b></i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA truely amazing spectacle for Midnight's dark eyes to behold. While not by any means a \"grotto\" as previously described (grotto was a word that conveyed too much of a \"natural\" feel), the master had done an excellent job of recreating what one would look like in the shiniest, most expensive variety of porcelain available. There was the bath floor, tiled with little teeny-weeny flakes of rare stones, which encompassed the room and dipped in to make the actual bath. There were several spaces, mostly around the walls, where the structure jutted out to make hard seats so that people could plop their mighty chocolate rears on and relax, this not being a \"pool\" and lacking a more shallow end. All around the room there were decorations of gold (maybe plated) dragon-esque statues; a prominent and constant figure being emulated was the Dragonair; but among the others were Gyarados, Kingdra, and Rayquayza. These fine statues were all ornamented into ways that would assist the bather- the Gyarados notably being the faucets and the Kingdra acting as jets. On top of everything, there was a skylight that allowed the wonderfully bright afternoon sun to shine in and illuminate <i>everything</i> in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight was speechless. It was the most glorious thing that her eyes, in all of their travels, had laid upon.\"Well, no use in standing around with my clothes on!\" she said, eager to submerge her form in a wonderfully hot bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Midnight began to undress, starting with the pesky adjustable waist. She untightened the corset in the back and let the useless girdle fall to the tiled floor beneath her, gut sagging out even further now that it was unrestricted. So tight was her dress around her belly, that every aspect of said stomach could be seen beneath the fabric- from her bellybutton to her jelly rolls, Midnight was wearing a thinly layered second skin. It was for that reason that Shera had opted out of a back zipper for outfits designed to fit Midnight's more \"generous\" figure, instead one that stopped underneath her busom, but then again that caused another problem. As she pushed one boob over to the side, Midnight's meaty fingers had trouble grasping the tiny thing. \"Ugh, Shera...\" she grumbled, wrestling with her own tittie for space in her own dress! Finally she anaged to push the zipper down some and force it the rest of the way down with her pudgy digit. She would have to put in another request for that head maid of hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as she slid the tight dress from her form and removed other articles of her attire (heels, tights, gloves, etc.) Midnight soon stood buck naked on the cold ground of the unused grotto. The tile was so perfectly polished that one could see Midnight from a complete worm's-eye view (if one was to look at the floor, which I wouldn't reccommend) Completely unrestricted by her clothing, Midnight's flabby body swelled to greater proportions. Her stomach drooped over her crotch, hanging low and swaying now that it was free to wiggle around a bit. Her wide, blubbery hips were dimpled and had cellulite in a few unsightly areas. A layer of chub sagged half way over her knees as her ankles had slowly been devoured by her carnivorous calves. Luckilly, all Midnight could see should she look at the floor was a first-hand perspective on those awesome titties of hers. Swollen and engorged to such an extent that she barely had to deny that a belly was underneath them at all- as she couldn't see it half the time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like I said... better do this... it's kinda chilly...\" she told herself, taking a dip into the mighty wading pool. As she lumbered about, her body was clumsy and inconsiderate- unable to decide where each designated sector of flab was to wobble and for how long. She lowered one tree-trunk like leg into the bath, and then another. Soon, she stepped into the bath fully and was wading around in it's crystal-clear bath. \"Ooh, feels nice~\" she cooed, blushing somewhat as she looked around, steam had begun to rise from the waters flowing from the Gyarados' mouths as the lake already in the bath began to warm. \"No way... it's motion activated?!\" Midnight almost squealed. \"A girl could really... oof... get used to this!\" she said, pausing a little to sit down on one of the side benches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weighty moemon reclined, half of her silky black hair drenched as the upper half stayed dry. Her round cheeks grew flushed, and her eyes as hazy as the vapors that filled the room. Subconciously, Midnight's hands were drawn to her belly. A round, jiggling magnet to her hands that shook in rhythm to the water's movements. She gripped it, massaging it somewhat as a warm cooling sensation overcame her, closing her chocolate eyes and letting out a deep, almost sexual sigh. As she massaged, her plump fingers gripped her flabby middle- her denial about her weight a true testament to her strive for beauty and confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh... this is so wonderful...\" she sighed, sinking slightly before taking a deep breath and submerging her entire head underneath the waters, coming up baptized to the pampering ripples of the Master's bath. No, this was her bath now. She would never stoop to using another bath ever again, not so long as she lived in this household. Heck, maybe she'd invite Fontina. Maybe Ali too, heck even bring Kyrie! This sort of pleasure needed to be shared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a light burp, apparantly one of her hands massaged a little too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm...\" she moaned, rubbing her tummy, \"Rich people have life so~o good....\"</span></div></div>",

This allowed the tubby girl to float off from her seated position in the bath and just float about the large bath, making a simple dead man\u2019s float. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, there was the thought of work that loomed in the back of her head, but she didn\u2019t care for it at the moment. All that was on Midnight\u2019s mind was just to soak herself inside this luxurious grotto of sorts. With her back submerged in the water, Midnight could feel that her body was as light as a feather (fat chance, lol), with the slightly cold air washing over her front side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold air complimented the warm, Jacuzzi-like bath, so much so that it was able to make her eyes grow heavy\u2026 Slowly lulling her into a deep sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until loud, booming music leaked into the room, making Midnight\u2019s eyes shoot wide open and making her stand up in the water. \u2018<i>Crap! Someone\u2019s there!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the loud music, Midnight could hear footsteps getting closer and closer. There wasn\u2019t a lot of time, so Midnight quickly waddled through the churning water, trying to get to the edge as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS\u2019alright!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat unfamiliar voice only made Midnight run (waddle) faster to the edge of the pool, Midnight may not have the best morals, but she certainly didn\u2019t want to get caught in a place where she wasn\u2019t supposed to be\u2026 Not when she found this hidden paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Hide! I have to hide!\u2019</i> Midnight thought to herself as she climbed out of the pool, her meaty legs slapping against one another while she looked frantically for a hiding spot\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018There!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, right in front of Midnight was what appeared to be a large walk in closet that was opened. Perhaps Midnight was too mesmerized with the bath before, but she didn\u2019t notice it until just now\u2026 Besides, it was the perfect hiding space for a girl of her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling quickly into closet, Midnight closed it just as another pair of doors were opening. \u201cAh, good ole grotto, how I\u2019ve missed your luxurious waters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a small crack in between the two doors, Midnight was able to see whoever was entering the bath area. And just like the voice, it was someone that Midnight didn\u2019t recognize. As he walked (although, it looked more like dancing) along the edge of the water, the weird guy\u2019s sleek form loomed over the edge of the water until he pulled back. \u201cAh, just as s\u2019alright! Everything\u2019s fancy n\u2019 classy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleek man was dressed in a checkered button up shirt that was encompassing several shades of blue and had a pair of white jeans under it. Atop of his head of messy long locks of white hair was a blue cap that had a pair of wing like symbols on the sides of it with a pointed mark on the front of it. From her hiding space, Midnight couldn\u2019t help but notice how handsome the strange man was, and that he had a pair of smooth blue jewels hanging around his neck\u2026 And if she had to guess, they were both probably twenty, no, thirty times more expensive than the rest of his clothing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when a new thought popped in Midnight\u2019s head, \u2018<i>I\u2019ve never seen this joker before\u2026 He\u2019s wearing some fancy jewelry in comparison to the rest of his clothing\u2026 He must be a thief! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018\u2026 And what the heck is he doing to my clothes?!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Midnight was hiding and pondering, the strange intruder had danced across Midnight\u2019s discarded uniform and unmentionables, having crouched down on the well polished floor and looking over the clothing that Midnight had neglected to grab in her attempts to hide. \u201cHmm, hmm, hmm\u2026 Nice classic work! Almost a treasure cove\u2026 Or should I say island? Ha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight\u2019s face was burning slightly, oh, how she\u2019d love to be able to step on out and smack him upside the head for rummaging through her clothes\u2026 But, even if she did, what if he was armed? She was completely nude to boot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer current train of thought was interrupted as the supposed thief raised his hands in the air, something hooked in between his two thumbs. And instantly recognizing the item, Midnight\u2019s face lit up brighter than the sun when Atlus was working outside. It didn\u2019t help that the weird man was whistling loudly, \u201cDamn! Imagine the ass these fit on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the piece of straw that broke the Camerupt\u2019s back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight pushed open the doors and ran out, all of her glorious body jiggling with each furious step she took towards the weird stranger, her fist pulled back. \u201cBASTARD!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn\u2019t even move as Midnight closed in, and even when she threw her punch at him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 However, the only thing that Midnight\u2019s punch hit was air\u2026 \u201cWhat the?! Where\u2019d he go?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mightyena Moemon\u2019s question was immediately answered when she felt something pinching her butt, making her jump slightly, \u201cHmm\u2026 Dat ass! Dat\u2019s the one with them panties!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight quickly turned around, not even caring that she was giving the weird guy a show, all she wanted to do was knock his block off! And since he was standing up when she began to turn, she had the perfect shot to get him with her elbow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again, the mysterious Moemon seemed to disappear at the last second, but then reappear in front of Midnight, making the Mightyena Moemon jump slightly when she saw his smirking (if not handsome) face. \u201cHey! Let\u2019s dance it out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even get a word in, Midnight realized that the weird man had grabbed her other free wrist and began to twist her around, making Midnight\u2019s hefty body spin around quickly. For a few moments, the weird Moemon continued to spin and spin the confused Mightyena until he relinquished his grip and allowed her to spin to a slow stop, her tree trunk legs wavering and her eyes spinning. \u201cUgh\u2026 Y-You b-b-bastard\u2026 When I get a h-hold of you I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight\u2019s threat didn\u2019t finish, since the mysterious man simply raised his pointer finger up and gently pushed Midnight\u2019s stomach, tipping her into the large and deep pool of warm water that was behind her. \u201cTIDAL WAVE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a large splash echoed through the room along with the weird music, the man smirked as he watched Midnight float belly up with a completely dazed look on her face. With a wink, the man spun around on his heel and waved his hand over his shoulder. \u201cLater, baby! Catch ya sometime!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man slowly began to walk out of the room, but stopped when he lifted his other hand. A small blush appeared on his face as he looked at his most recent treasure, \u201cHmm\u2026 Black silk, nice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a quick pocketing of Midnight\u2019s panties, the man and the music that encompassed his being disappeared into the halls \u2013 Leaving only a dazed and floating Midnight in the bath behind him. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m gonna kill that\u2026 Perverted bastard\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Doo doo doo doo~\" the mysterious young moemon beeped monotonously, reciting something he had heard in his earlier travels. Sinnoh sure was a fun place, all kinds of music and lively customs. Lively girls especially. His eyes narrowed as he craned his neck behind him, a certain large lump in his pants catching his attention. \"She blinded me with scie~nce...\" He trailed off as one hand reached into his back pocket, fondling his newest treasure between his thumb and forefinger, whipping it out and stretching it between his two index fingers again- still in a state of disbelief at the size of them! He let out a low whistle as he canvassed their enormity, \"Daaaaaaaaaaamn~~\" he said childishly, \"Baby got back, yo.\" before rubbing them up against his cheek, \"Baby got nice taste too, angel soft~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled, the erotic blush returning to his cheeks once more as he continued to fondle Midnight's conviscated undergarments. The mysterious blue-and-white clad moemon outstretched one index finger and placed it behind the waistband and elastic lining of the tree-trunk sized right leg and started to twirl the undies around like a cane. \"She's a pretty big girl!\" he replayed the images of what had just transgressed in his mind; a fat, naked chick with a really nice tan coming at him in the bathroom... \"Been done before~\" he said in a cheeky manner to no one in particular. \"Anyways, um... first thing's first... which is... um... okay, so first thing is...\" he scratched his head, moving his cap up and down slightly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea why he'd stepped foot in here! It was boring! Nextly, where's Shera? She always managed to greet him whenever he came in! And thirdly, \"Oh yeah, I snuck in and didn't call ahead of time~\". Fourthly, \"Onward to find Shera!\" he shouted to himself, taking a big step forward and resuming his trek around the mansion in search of the staff...<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"Hey party people!\" the still un-introduced moemon shouted into the foyer. Usually, his old crew would be waiting for him there whenever he came home. \"Oh right, duh, they don't know I'm here yet.\" he chided himself. It was just as he'd always remembered it, the first floor foyer. Dark, dimly lit, a fireplace, some sofas, and brown. Lots of brown. He never really cared for the color. Lord knows how many times he'd petitioned to get it repainted something cool, like lime green or electric blue, only to have his suggestion shot down out of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, \"Oh man, I'm never gonna find her...\" somehow ignoring the fact that this was the first room besides the bathroom that he'd checked. Laxly and without hesitation, he plopped himself right down on the couch, thusly returning to exactly where he left off the last time he was here: slacking off and avoiding finding Shera. They had played this game for a while now, he'd go off and try to avoid working and Shera would always be the one to drag him back after a long, fruitless search only to find him back in his workspace like nothing had happened. It was so fun to watch that vein in the side of her head throb like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe folded his hands behind his head, kicked his feet up and layed down, whenever he actually <i>wanted</i> to find Shera though, these long searches always seemed to pop up. \"Ah whatever, she'll find me sooner or later... I just hope Kruger can handle everything down in-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the foyer door shut, footsteps flooding the room along with peeved voices. \"Look, I don't <i>care</i> if it was an accident, you've still got to pay what you owe around here!\" a small though brash voice said in an irate fashion. \"Look fire rat, I'm a deity, and as a deity who's working FOR FREE, I should be entitled to some sort of accident protection clause!\" he hollered back. \"Oh, okay. So maybe I should just call up the night squad so they can hand you your godly rump again?\" the more feminine of the voices trailed off, \"Or maybe I'll call you-know-who, I saved you from her once after you broke that vase, all I have to do is tell her where you've been sleeping and it's all over...\" the masculine one became much less so, \"p-please... don't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey-o!\" The mysterious moemon called from his seated and unnoticed position. He rose slightly from the couch, not enough to really require any effort however, and waved with two of his fingers at the two of the shortest members of the staff. \"Eep!\" Ali shouted, jumping back slightly. Atlus sneered, \"For such an \"esteemed\" mansion this 'Master' of yours runs, servant woman, it seems that anyone who puts even half their mind to it can break in...\" Ali blushed, \"Sh-Shut up Atlus!\" she shouted, \"W-We've got an intruder here, can't this wait!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus stared at the man with a dull expression, being frank and blunt as always, \"Look stranger, I assure you, you definitely do <i>not</i> want to break in here... there are plenty of insane people roaming around this glorified corral who will probably hand such a scrawny thing like yourself quite the beating.\" he pointed his finger at Ali, \"Take this battleaxe for example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-SHUT UP ATLUS!!\" she shouted again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaaaan... you guys are weak~\" the strange moemon groaned before getting up and simply sauntering out of the room, \"Tell Shera I'm here, 'kay?\" he said laxly, \"I'mma go hit the library, see if she's there...\"</span></div></div>",

Hmm, might as well check since I\u2019m headed there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a snap of his fingers, music began to play around the mysterious Moemon, \u201cYeah! I voted for Pedro~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the comfy foyer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis mansion keeps becoming more and more of a mad house,\u201d Ali sighed with a shake of her head as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that its any of my concern,\u201d Atlus growled with his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cBut shouldn\u2019t we inform the large one about this guest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I have no clue where Shera is at the moment,\u201d Ali replied looking into the hallway, trying to find the mysterious intruder, only to find that he had disappeared into the enveloping hallways. \u201cBut, I more curious about how he knows her. Atlus, go try to find Shera and try to bring her to the library, I\u2019m going to go after him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I have to do this?!\u201d Atlus spat back. \u201cThis household belongs to neither of us, and this so called master should\u2019ve gotten more security instead of a harem of fatties if he wanted to make sure he didn\u2019t get robbed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but if it turns out the guy is a thief,\u201d Ali explained with a flat look on her chubby face. \u201cAnd Shera finds out that we knew that, what do you think is going to happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran down Atlus\u2019s spine, remembering the last few times he got punished by the large one for \u2013 One, wrecking the mansion. Two, rebelling against his second punishment to fix the mansion. Three, accidentally walking in on the large one when she was changing clothes. Four, breaking the \u2018controller\u2019 to the fat fox\u2019s game system when she kept beating him at the \u2018video games\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Fine\u2026\u201d Atlus growled under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to knock this time,\u201d Ali warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI KNOW!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the near emptied hallways, the blue dressed Moemon continued to dance through the halls, adding a bit of a livelier tone to normally dull mansion with his jovial steps and electrifying music. The atmosphere seemed to become a bit brighter as he sung to himself, \u201cYeah! I was born in a crossfire ~\u2026 But it\u2019s alright now, back in the~\u2026 I need to learn the words to this song!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he reached the doors to the library, the blue moemon\u2019s musical tone began to die down slightly. And slowly, he slowly creaked open the library doors, he may have been a loud person in the mansion, but he had a small amount of respect to be quiet in a library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s see how long that lasts, shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the door enough for him to look in, the blue dressed Moemon pulled back slightly, blinking a few times at the sight that in the library, \u201cSwish, swish\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his view point, the mysterious Moemon was getting quite a good view of a decent show. In front of one of the many book shelves was another maid that he hadn\u2019t seen before, but man, was she big, even bigger than the chocolate skinned babe that had took a swing at him in the bath, and that was saying something. From what he could tell, she was putting away books on the shelves, shuffling her hips inside that large, if not somewhat tight maid uniform, her overly curvaceous figure moving to its own accord with her long blue hair billowing slightly over her meaty back. \u201cNice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the girl began to turn, making the mysterious moemon\u2019s eyes widen at the two bouncy mounds that were struggling to get free from the confines of her uniform\u2019s top (he didn\u2019t notice that the same was holding true for her gut, but he likely didn\u2019t care). <i>\u2018DAMN! Looks to be around Xiamou\u2019s size! OOOH! And she\u2019s wearing glasses! Totally righteous! This girl\u2019s almost out of a manga! I\u2019m willing to bet my hat that she\u2019s shy too!\u2019</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFontina,\u201d a calm voice cooed through the library, getting the mysterious moemon\u2019s attention back into the room, where his eyes grew wide once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the engorged, glasses wearing beauty was another maid (one that he never saw before, but he wasn\u2019t going to complain) only when compared to the large one she was standing in front of, this one seemed to a porcelain doll (albeit, she was smaller and was a little bubbly with a small rip in her uniform to show that creamy white skin that was poking out) and she reminded the mysterious Moemon about how Ember looked after a month or two after she decided to get sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he had to play this cool, two lovelies were in the library\u2026 And if he played his cards right, then he might be able to get a few more souvenirs to go with the little treat he had hidden in his back pocket. So, with a sly smirk, the blue dressed Moemon slowly walked through the hallway, there was always another way to get into the library other than the front entrance\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fontina took a step forward and reached out to touch her friend's shoulder, \"Oh Kyrie, I'm so sorry... I should have guessed that's what you were doing...\" she brought the smaller girl into a heartfelt embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice. Kyrie rather enjoyed the overall softness that Fontina's body excelled in producing. She was warm and comfortable, and every part of her fluffy body seemed to hug at her just as much as her arms did. And Kyrie smelled faintly of the ocean, understandable given her heritage. The scent soothed Fontina as she took a deep breath, bountiful chest heaving and enveloping the side of Kyrie's head as she breathed deeply. Still, despite the emotional depth of the problem at hand, Kyrie remained strong. She had gotten so much better at that lately, remaining strong and holding back tears when she was upset. So soon the two women broke away and stared fondly at one another for a second...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Kyrie... if you ever want to talk, I'm here for you.\" Fontina said, smiling kindly towards the younger girl, \"Th-Thanks...\" Kyrie sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think we should try Shera's office again?\" Fontina asked, grabbing half of her mountainous order, \"She wasn't there last time, but really where does she go besides the market?\" Kyrie sniffled once more as she made her way over to the hill of literature and managed to pick up what she could, \"Uh-huh...\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\"Holy crap~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the eavesdropping intruder could manage after witnessing something so... enlightening. Since when did he employ legendary creatures here at this mansion? Huh, weird. Anyway, he ducked down behind one of the bookshelves and removed his hat- sticking the bill in his mouth as he gnawed at it in his tension. <i>\"Oh man oh man oh man!!\"</i> he thought, <i>\"These two righteous babes are totally sweet!!\"</i> he gnawed a little bit more, relishing the taste of bill and fabric in his mouth, <i>\"'Kirikizan: Tales of the Black Knight'? I was so gonna read that!!!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeked over the bookshelf to watch the two moemon waddle their way towards the entrance. That big one 'Fontina' seemed to be having a lot of trouble with the strenuous act of lifting and lugging both her bulk and those books. And the littler one seemed to be having just as much, if not more trouble simply picking those things up and not ripping her dress any further! Maybe if a generous manly-man were to offer some sexy assitance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey chickadee's~\" he popped up from his hidey-hole completely composed and nonchalant, \"You guys really look like you could use a hand, so would you mind if I-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEEEK!!!\" Kyrie screamed, dropping her pile of books instinctively. However, looking back at her previous encounters with creeps in the library, this reaction isn't totally unfounded. \"Woah, hey what did I-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay back creep!\" Fontina lunged forward at him. Having used <i>her</i> previous encounters with perverts in this library to her advantage, Fontina began by using her bulk to it's fullest extent and attempts tackling the strange man...</span></div></div>",

He only stood there, as he was a little mesmerized with the large maid was bounding and bouncing towards him (the jiggling of her chins, breasts and gut were mesmerizing with each step they moved), and then she jumped at the unnamed Moemon\u2026 Or at least tried to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hell\u2026\u201d the unnamed Moemon muttered as his entire body began to get overshadowed by the large Moemon. \u2018Time to become a speed lover!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire mansion shook, sending dust flying from the ceiling and shaking most of the furniture in the building. Kyrie was standing with her eyes wide and a small blush on her face, not just with the fact that Fontina had acted so boldly to protect her, but also she was able to see that Fontina\u2019s large skirt had lifted up greatly to reveal the large hams that were slightly constricted in the tight sky blue panties on them. \u201cA-Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet,\u201d a familiar jovial voice cooed from behind the Kyogre with a snicker following. The voice made Kyrie jump in surprise as she turned around to see the unnamed Moemon tucking something into his back pocket, stuffing it. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see that you honestly care\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Get away from me,\u201d Kyrie stuttered slightly, she had become more open over the last month, but this was a stranger\u2026 In the library, the same one where two perverted Moemon had appeared in front of her over a month ago, this was actually scaring her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unnamed Moemon looked confused with his eyebrow raised, blinking a few times he lifted his left arm up and sniffed, \u201c\u2026 Do I offend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading the situation, namely watching as Kyrie walked backwards towards Fontina who was trying to push her bulky body up off the ground, the unnamed Moemon shook his head, \u201cWhatever, I try being a nice guy, and I almost get crushed by a ton of beauty. If that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be, laters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding out of the double doors from the library, the weird Moemon dashed out into the hallways just as Fontina finally managed to get to her feet, her uniform stained in sweat, \u201cA-Are you okay, Kyrie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah,\u201d the legendary Moemon muttered, lowering her head. \u201cW-Who was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I honestly have no clue,\u201d Fontina answered wiping some sweat from her brow, feeling that there something to be weird with how she lifted her arm up, like there was some less restriction. \u201cBut, we should probably tell Shera about\u2026 Kyrie? Is something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-There\u2019s another rip,\u201d Kyrie pointed out, walking behind Fontina and pulled on the fabric on the back to reveal that there was a long, yet clean cut in the beautiful material. \u201cUm\u2026 F-Fontina?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Fontina sighed, not really happy that she made another rip in her uniform in one day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What\u2019s that one t-thing that you wear to contain\u2026 um,\u201d Kyrie gushed, with her face turning a bright red. \u201cYou know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! A bra?\u201d Fontina questioned, wondering where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, didn\u2019t you wear one today?\u201d Kyrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina\u2019s face went red when Kyrie asked that and she slowly lifted her plump hands to her large bust, feeling them both slightly and her face went as red as a tomato when she realized that she was going commando for her upper half! Steam was almost flying from her face at the embarrassment that was coming off her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure that she had one on! She remembered the confinement feeling as the delicate undergarment tried to contain her massive mamaries but\u2026 What could have happened?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the hallway, the unnamed Moemon had made some distance from the library and was holding up a large piece of sky blue fabric that looked to be stretched to its limits. A large smile and blush appeared on his face as he licked his lips, \u201cD-cups, full of justice! So far, I\u2019ve gotten some good souvenirs, and it\u2019s only been an hour since I got here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking the large bra into his other back pocket, the unnamed Moemon snapped his fingers a few times as a beat began to come from around him, \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual you want to be loved by anyone~. Hmm, maybe I should drop these two souvenirs to my secret place before I continue my trek\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving his hand from his back pockets, the mysterious Moemon turned his head to see\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All the way from across the hall, simply from the large hilltops of a woman's curvage peeking from behind the next wall no less, this unamed stranger's eyes widened as he caught the jiggling sensation that was the overweight Dewgong maid entering the hallway. Having heard her footsteps this far away was no real shock, those heavy knockers of hers always seemed to weigh her down even since they were kids. He had caught her in the middle of one of her many snacking breaks, contentedly stuffing her face on many an ill-gotten donut pilfered from the Swinub Sweets boxes upstairs. Her chubby cheeks bulged outwards, stuffed with chewed pastry, and the corners of her mouth stained with creme and jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intruder's seemingly instinctive smile grew even wider as all of her entered the hallway. Since he had last seen her, Claire had grown considerably round. With a big belly that divided into two distinct jelly rolls in her tight maid's outfit and increduous knockers that lived up to the name \"strategically placed fat\", being soft, squishy and inviting. Her black tights helped hold those plump ham-hock thighs of hers together very nicely, though her heels seemed a little labored with their load. As she chewed, her jowls churned along with the mush in her mouth while they bounced against her chest. She turned, long silver-white hair sitting perfectly groomed atop her head, though not to notice the stranger. Only to take another gluttonous bite of the donut in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire?\" the stranger asked, now fully turned around to face the bulbous beauty behind him, \"Sweetiecakes Claire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of her designated nickname, the overweight moemon looked up from her snack with a small gasp. Her gray eyes grew wide and watery, and her cheeks grew appled as she waddled over as fast as she could to embrace her long-lost friend. \"HEY!!\" she cooed, \"I'M SO SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS YOU!!\" she wrapped her large wobbling arms around the mysterious man's lithe frame and locked him in a tight hug. She pulled him close, squishing his taller frame against her enormous upper half lovingly, \"Oh my gosh it's been so long... uh... uh...\" Eyes were rolled as the young moemon struggled for air. Claire kept him in that embrace for maybe a solid thirty minutes before he had to give up and tell her his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanner!\" he laughed, \"Don Tanner, how could you forget my name?!\" Claire laughed too, releasing Don Tanner from her squishy embrace, though keeping her arms outstretched to his shoulders. \"Right, sorry D. Tanny!\" she giggled and smiled warmly at him, \"Where have you been?! Have you told anyone else you're here yet?\" The former intruder-turned-welcome-houseguest huffed, \"Nah, I'm waiting until Shera shows up, I'm tired of running around here... all I do is get yelled at.\" he shoved his hands in his pockets before Claire removed hers to get another bite of donut. Don Tanner lamented, he could already feel the glazing in his hair where she had allowed that pastry to touch him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the rewelcomed Don Tanner palmed one of Claire's impressive hooters, \"So, you sure filled out, huh Claire?\" he said abruptly. Luckily, Claire was just the sort of girl to not be bothered by such immaturity, \"I mean seriously, lookit these things!\" he squished around for a little bit with a thoughtful look on his face, \"Hmm... no bra, black lingerie?\" he asked. Claire pulled away, \"Yeah, how'd you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky guess~\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\"Fontina?!\" Ali asked as she and her pint-sized partner barged into the library, \"I heard you scream, everything alright in here?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie, Midnight, and Fontina turned to see their late friends arrive. \"Wow, those new curves of yours weighing you down shorty?\" Midnight quipped as she placed one chubby hand on her curvaceous hip. Ali grumbled, \"If anyone's curves are weighing you down, it'd be yours- your kind <i>do</i> have five sets of 'em.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys cut it out, this is serious.\" Fontina stopped the bickering, \"We've got an intruder in the house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli's breathing hastened (well, hastened further, she had been waddling down the hallway pretty fast). \"Y-Yeah!\" she stammered as she struggled to catch her breath, \"M-Me and Atlus caught him in the Foyer, I was looking for Shera when I heard you scream!\" Midnight and Fontina's eyes widened as they heard Ali's side of the story, \"Did he steal your underwear too?!\" they both asked at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli's lips pursed, her expression changing to one of much less fearful. \"N-Nooooo... why, did he steal yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight's milky chocolate skin grew incredibly red, looking like a caramel dipped apple from the neck up, and Fontina's glasses went foggy as she blushed. \"Oh my gawd, he did didn't he?!\" Ali fumed, \"That sick little pervert!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwahahaha!!\" Atlus let out a haughty bellowing laughter, \"Well I guess we don't have to worry about anything <i>valuable</i> getting stolen!\" Ali smacked him on the back of the head, \"Be serious!!\" she commanded of the tiny deity, \"What're we gonna do, guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill him!\" Midnight huffed, struggling to even cross her arms at her high weight and overly generous build. Fontina sighed, crossing her arms and resting them on her big billowing tummy. \"Maybe we should just find Shera?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Ali stomped her foot, sending all of her blubber aquiver underneath her uniform, \"We can't just go to Shera, something's gotta be done about this guy!\"</span></div></div>",

BAM! BIFF! POW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus was now on the ground, twitching with four fresh bruises now growing on the back of his head as the four plump Moemon maidens stood over him, each of them with a fist raised (even Kyrie was a little surprised with what she just did). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus-sized my ass,\u201d Midnight seethed through her teeth, not coming to terms with her exceptional weight gain yet, so the irony was lost to her when she made the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Ali growled, crossing her arms under her now moderate chest. \u201cWe can deal with this guy, and from what you guys said, I\u2019ve got a plan to trap him. All we need is some proper bait to work with. And since he\u2019s perverted, I know what the perfect bait would be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting that freak get anything else from me!\u201d Midnight barked. \u201cHe may have been cute, but when he stole\u2026 Uh, some unmentionables from me, he lost any points he had before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-And I\u2019m still puzzled how he got my\u2026 B-Bra,\u201d Fontina sputtered with her glasses becoming even foggier than a few moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ali didn\u2019t want to ask Kyrie to do something so embarrassing, but unfortunately, that left only one possible person amongst this small group\u2026 And as soon as it dawned on Ali, her eyes widened, \u201cW-W-Wait a second! I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Volunteer to donate?\u201d Midnight finished as she placed a meaty hand on Ali\u2019s puffy shoulder. \u201cGood to hear, runt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait!\u201d Ali yelped as Midnight began to pull her behind some bookshelves. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m the one coming up with the plan and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 And that\u2019s why you\u2019re being so selfless to offer!\u201d Midnight interrupted again as both she and Ali disappeared behind some bookshelves, all the while Kyrie and Fontina couldn\u2019t help but blink a few times in what had just transpired in front of them and Atlus\u2026 Well, he was still twitching on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back near the master\u2019s room, Claire was standing outside the opened door munching on a few more of the pilfered donuts she had with her. No sooner had she finished off the last of the sweet treats than Don Tanner himself stepped out of the room, closing the door behind him. \u201cAll set Sweetiecakes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 What\u2019d you have to do in there anyway, D. Tanny?\u201d Claire asked, a little more interested in checking the box she had for any crumbs or icing that she may have missed while eating the donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I had a few souvenirs that I wanted to secure,\u201d Don Tanner answered with his arms thrown behind his head. It wasn\u2019t a lie actually, but the Dragonair Moemon would\u2019ve preferred to not have those things on her person when he met up with Shera, so, he quickly stashed them in one of the secret, secured locations that he knew about in the room. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to give them out once Shera finds me, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019ll call everyone for a big feast or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we\u2019ve been feasting almost every day,\u201d Claire laughed slightly, putting the totally emptied box of donuts underneath her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s not everyday that we get new faces here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Could\u2019ve fooled me,\u201d D. Tanner muttered under his breath, giving Claire\u2019s fluffy body another view, mostly at the added curves she had in his months of absence. With a cough (while still looking at the impressive bust his apparent friend had). \u201cI\u2026 I see, so tell me Claire, I can assume that we\u2019ve got like five new workers here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d Claire answered with a large goofy smile. \u201cThey made a really big mess, well, some of them did a bigger than others, and broke some stuff. So, they\u2019re paying off the debt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat actually struck a chord in Don Tanner\u2019s music filled soul, he wasn\u2019t one to really have people owing others anything. Rubbing his chin, the Dragonair Moemon sighed loudly, \u201cI see\u2026 Hmm, Sweetiecakes, mind doing me a favor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, D. Tanny,\u201d Claire replied with a slight bow, giving Don Tanner a good view of the valley that was the Dewgong\u2019s vast cleavage. \u201cWhat ya need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking himself out of his hypnotic stare, Don Tanner pulled his cap off and pulled out a small piece of paper from the rim of the hat and immediately held it out to Claire. \u201cHead to the kitchen and give this Wester. We\u2019re gonna make tonight be a night to remember!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Claire answered, slowly taking the paper from D. Tanny\u2019s hand and fitting it between her cleavage (it was more secure and safer than the pockets on her uniform after all). \u201cBut, what are you going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still going to go find Shera,\u201d Don Tanner answered with a smirk and a spin on his heel. \u201cI gotta tell her what\u2019s been happening on my little trip and since I got back, sides, I wanna see what else happened to this place\u2026 Ya know, see it with my own two eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Atlus has done a good job of repairs,\u201d Claire replied putting a hand on her chubby cheek. \u201cBut, I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with another grunt filled bow, Claire turned around and began to walk off\u2026 Don Tanner crouching down to watch her walk away, a smirk on his face as he saw the black lacy lingerie peak out from under her skirt \u2013 The both lucky and unlucky material squeezing onto the pale hams of her big behind for dear life. \u2018<i>She may be cold as ice, but Claire\u2019s attitude and buxom body sure can light my fire!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Claire had waddled around the corner and made Don Tanner stand up with his arms thrown behind his head. Now he was alone again, his two souvenirs safely hidden and locked away from the world, and his music was starting once more, allowing the Dragonair Moemon to continue his dancing through the halls. \u201c~Burn baby, burn\u2026 Burn baby, burn~ Disco Inferno!~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long for Don Tanner (or maybe it was, he didn\u2019t have a watch on him and only used his music to tell the time for him since he had the timing for each song down in his head) to walk through the halls, each of them emptied (which was true most of the time), but there seemed to be something odd about the halls\u2026 It was more quiet than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, Don Tanner came across what appeared to be\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were big, somewhat lacy though not too much, and the fabric seemed a little stretched. From here, Don Tanner could make out the slight bulges and lumps in the fabric that signified that the pair had been worn recently, perhaps mischievously falling out from underneath some young woman's legs, perhaps a borrowed pair too big for her to wear comfortably, so they slipped off. However the case, whether someone in his employment (besides Claire or Ember maybe, but these were far too small) was ditzy enough to lose these red, white laced underpants was really none of his concern. All that really mattered right now was that, by law, those panties were on his property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, they were <i>his</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, arbitrarily enforcing the law wasn't don Tanner's style, so he might as well just say that he wanted them. He sauntered over to the discarded pair of underooes with a happy grin plastered across his face, dimpling those pale cheeks of his, and looked around for a second before his circling of the undergarments came to a close. Not once did he realize that the gigantic \"X\" marring his carpet, nor that the panties were in the direct center...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you <i>undressed</i> me!\" Ali whispered as she, Fontina, Kyrie, and Midnight covered corner to watch their trap unfold. However, herself and the lattermost mentioned had taken to arguing behind the wall in low voices so that no one but each other could hear them. The black-and-redheaded moemon huffed and gesticulated wildly with her flabby arms, only for her canine counterpart to visibly scoff. \"Oh please, we're both girls, it's not like you've got anything I haven't seen before.\" she said, uncouthly scratching the uppermost flesh of her soft boobie as a sort of silent affirmation to her somewhat crass social upbringing, \"Besides, it's not like anyone else will be undressing you any time soon, what with that belly you've got under those still-kinda-itty-bitty-titties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli's face turned a neon pink as Midnight called into question her newly sporting bosom, something that she had actually grouped into the \"tolerable\" section of gaining weight. Of course her next action was to defend against Midnight's rhythmical mockery, she jabbed a chubby finger into Midnight's huge chest and snarled, \"Yeah well at least I can still see my feet\"-a lie of omission-\"past my tits, you hormone crazed pound Poochie, yours are so huge I bet you have to have Fontina lace up your girdle, that is if you even fit into it anymore, I never see you wear it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight flared a nostril and snarled, \"Yeah well nuts to you, not-so-teeny-weeny!\" she bean dipped Ali's growing sweaterpuppies with a quick finger, \"You just proved my point! My breasts <i>are</i> huge, aren't they?!\" She tried crossing her arms over them, but the collective layer of plush over each appendage was too great; maybe to cross each other alone, but not while Midnight was so well-endowed as she was, she settled instead for crossing them underneath her bloated milk sacks and pivoting her wide hips and her gaze slightly away from her teeny nemesis, \"No man will ever touch that slowly inflating body of yours now, except maybe one of those chubby-chasing pedophiles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S IT!!\" Ali shouted, breaking cognito and jumping off of her feet and attacking Midnight. She headbutt the loudmouthed girl after a loud battle cry from both of them. \"Guys?!\" Fontina rasped, remaining hopeful that her friend's lack of couth hadn't reached their target yet, \"<i>Remember?!</i> she signalled to the strange pervert man on the other end of the wall with her chubby fingers, \"You can fight later...\" Kyrie said meekly, trying very hard not to get thrown into the middle of all this craziness... why couldn't she have just stayed in the library?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Midnight whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too!\" Ali rasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked each other up-and-down one last time before turning heads away in a huff. Unfortunately, while everyone's backs were turned, a certain someone had caught wind of this little dispute and waltzed his way over to the heart of the matter. \"Woah, hey, everything alright down here?\" he asked, honestly concerned for any escalating violence, \"I heard some pretty nasty things up here, what's up?\" Fontina's face turned blue as her jaw dropped, fully expressing any chins she may have garnered under her period of being cursed. Kyrie's eyes began to water as her golden peepers started wobbling, her cheeks turning bright red with uncertainty and embarrassment. Midnight blushed heavily as her heavy body was taken aback at his sudden appearance, and Ali just babbled, \"Y-Yeah something's wrong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interloper's head cocked slightly to the left as she pointed an arbitrary finger at him, \"Y-You're wrong!\" she finally stammered after a great deal of difficulty dealing with her embarrassment, \"Stealing all of our underwear like that- it's deplorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head cocked again, this time to the right, before a look of epiphany shone brightly onto his face, \"Oh, so these're <i>your</i> panties?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into his no-doubt hammerspace-granted back pocket to pull out what looked like a bullfighter's tease. The large, red fabric danced as the air caught them, causing a sort of flapping effect. \"Y-Y-You!\" Ali stuttered, her finger dropping slightly in her confusion and just pure blind rage before it stiffened back up again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET HIM!!!\" she shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Don Tanner mumbled as the gaggle of heavyset housekeep charged at him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ali, Midnight and Fontina bounded towards Don Tanner (Kyrie was standing back from the future battlefield in the hallway), the Dragonair moemon quickly tucked the picked up panties into his back pocket and quickly jogged backwards. A smirk appeared on his face as he watched the show in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp and down. Up and down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially that one Vaporeon girl, it was a smart idea for the perverted Moemon to take the horrible confines of that wondrous bosom, the way those medicine ball sized breasts struggled against the fine fabric of her maid outfit, giving Tanner plenty to imagine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad his imagination was taking over, otherwise he would\u2019ve noticed a large bloated canine Moemon actually catching up to him with her fist drawn back, \u201cHa! GOT\u2019CHA NOW!\u201d Midnight barked as she threw her fist down towards Don Tanner\u2019s head, however, he quickly spun his entire body around, dodging the fist at the last second and making Midnight stagger a bit on the carpeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know,\u201d Don Tanner started spinning backwards with him walking backwards, noticing that Midnight was already doubled over, with her milky chocolate colored skin immediately covered with sweat. \u201cThis may be me speculating but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonair Moemon didn\u2019t get a chance to finish as Fontina bounced up towards him, trying to grab him, and as much as Don Tanner would\u2019ve enjoyed that (especially if he could\u2019ve gotten a chance to get smushed up against those massive mammary glands and perhaps cop a feel on \u2018Dat Ass!), it would\u2019ve been a bad idea, so just as Fontina was about to close her arms on him, the speedy Moemon leapt back, just barely dodging the chucky maiden\u2019s grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Don Tanner had forgotten about a small, tubby and budding Quilava Moemon, and took a powerful headbutt right into his slim gut, sending him tumbling backwards and onto the ground. \u201cURK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! That\u2019s for taking my panties!\u201d Ali cheered as she jumped (more like bounced) up and down with her fist pumped up. \u201cNow, hand back everything you took, ya dirty thief!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick backwards roll, Don Tanner was back on his feet, his hand on the ground along with his feet. However, instead of his joyful and playful face, his eyes were narrowed and his smirk seemed a bit more diabolic, \u201cThief? Well, that\u2019s just rude, and frankly, I don\u2019t like getting attacked in my own house! So, its time for some payback and some fan service!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEXTREME SPEED!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd disappearing in a white and blue blur, Don Tanner sped past Ali, Fontina and Midnight, several different kinds of sounds echoing through the hallway. A few seconds later, Don Tanner skidded to a stop right in front of Kyrie, making her jump back slightly, her uniform tearing slightly at the tighter regions. Don Tanner slowly lifted his head up, his eyes overshadowed by the rim of his hat. \u201cNine point six seconds, that was the time till everyone\u2019s pleasure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a snap of his fingers, Don Tanner spun around to watch as several ripping sounds echoed through the hallway, and several shreds of fabric flew through the air, each of them belonging to one of the three targeted Moemon who just stood there with small scraps of clothing clinging to their tubby bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds for it to register for the three Moemon girls what just happened, but when it did\u2026 \u201cAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIEEEEE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli quickly scooped up whatever cloth she could get from the ground and used it to cover up her exposed womanhood, not really concerned with the fact her large pillow like stomach would do a good job of covering it. While her increasingly improving bust was struggling to break free from the confines of her bright red bra, which her face was exactly the same color as her bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina landed on the ground , her arms immediately wrapping around her bountiful bust, barely able to wrap around the milky orbs without them spilling over her creamy colored skin, her large stomach flowed over her thunderous thighs while her large behind showed that her sky blue panties were nothing more than a thong in the cavernous as of hers. Her glasses were completely fogged up and she was on the verge of breaking out into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for Midnight, she had it worse. Her clothes were practically painted on her before, but without the bindings of her uniform keeping her body in check, her milky chocolate body swelled up slightly, popping her bra off of her large, shiny body and making her eyes widen with the life of them immediately disappearing. Her large body just quivered before she ran towards one of the nearby curtains and hid her large, bouncy body behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Don Tanner had pulled out his cell phone and had recorded everything, the clothes ripping off, and each of the girls\u2019 reactions. Pushing a few buttons on his cell phone, Don Tanner had sent the video to his own private computer, a large blush and smile on his face as he flipped the cell phone shut and fitted it into his pocket, \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon Tanner stopped when he felt some tiny petite fists slam against his back, making him raise an eyebrow. Slowly turning his head back, Don Tanner saw that the small, chubby Kyrie pounding her tiny, plump hands on him. \u201cY-You\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when a hand was placed on Kyrie\u2019s head, making her stop when Don Tanner turned the rest of his body and smiled down at her, \u201cHmm, twin tails, very nice! And such deep yellow eyes, yep! You\u2019re definitely a little cutie of a legendary Moemon! Kyogre if I\u2019m correct!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie\u2019s golden eyes widened when she heard that, did this perverted, thief know about her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, as much as I\u2019d love to stay and continue enjoy the impressive sights,\u201d Don Tanner admitted, spinning around to walk past Kyrie, doing a little moonwalk in the process. \u201cBut, I gotta find someone and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Don Tanner walked backwards into something incredibly soft, that something wasn\u2019t there a few seconds ago. It was as soft as cream and a little like fabric. Slowly, Don Tanner lifted his right hand up and reached past his head, grabbing onto a good portion of whatever he had walked into and squeezed it a few times a look of horror covering his face. \u201cOh\u2026 Uh\u2026 H-Hello Shera!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAH!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Don Tanner fell flat on his face in front of the large Kangaskhan Moemon, his eyes spinning and her fist raised up with a large blood vessel pulsing on her forehead. \u201cGreat to see you too, Master Don Tanner\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster?\u201d All four of the other girls in the room questioned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ali pushed the bathroom door open meekly, making sure that a certain lanky pervert hadn't snuck any glances of her naked, dimpled behind while she changed. Feeling confident that she was indeed alone in the hallway, she let out a deep sigh of relief and fully emerged from the lavatory dressed in a large black t-shirt that hung off of her entire body and some red plaided flannal pants. \"It sure was nice of Shera to give me these clothes...\" she remarked aloud, feeling how loose the oversized garments were on her. They must have actually <i>been</i> Shera's, judging by how big the sizes were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long black t-shirt was plain and simple; long enough to come down over Ali's swollen upper half and wide enough to allow her to swim comfortably in it. Plus, black was supposed to be \"slimming\", so that was good right? (Though, the noticable hump in her middle was undeniable...) And the pants were pretty much the same, the red plaid design dragged out and distorted due to the high requirement for them- but Ali was just too short to fill them out! She had to pull up the legs so far that noticable folds had bunched up over her feet, and she was forced into walking on the back of the pant legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way it was nice; having clothes too big for her. Even after all the weight she'd gained, there were still clothes that were too big for her. Of course that was a given, but feeling them and wearing clothes that were far from her size was a little bit different than just knowing that there were fatter moemon out there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, content with these baggy clothes, and started towards the door to the foyer- almost relishing the sound of fabric dragging on carpet behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shera, thanks so much for letting us borrow these clothes.\" was the first thing the Quilava moemon said as she popped into the designated \"meeting room\" for today's fiasco. She quickly made her way over to the couch beside Kyrie and plopped her hefty hiney down next to the pudgy diety. Midnight, squeezed into an armchair that was far from compatible with her immense weight, just rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, I was just about to thank you myself,\" the canine moemon said dryly, \"But you think you could have done a better job with mine- seriously, they're so... <i>uncomfortable</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ali had gotten new garments to cover her shame, so had the rest of our heroines. But again, like Ali, all of the clothes recieved belonged to <i>Shera</i>, which was a big problem for two of the girls whose respective figures were a little \"fuller\" than their head maid's. Midnight, in particular, had been squeezed into the biggest top Shera could find in her closet. It was white, sleeveless with thick straps, made of thick fabric, and above all things- huge. However, despite how many average sized people could fit into this titanic top, Midnight was having all the trouble in the world- what with those equally titanic titties of hers. Her milk chocolate skin bulged out of just about everywhere on that tank top, from her jiggly upperarms clogging the armholes to her lovehandles desperately wedging themselves out from under it. Above all, her lowermost roll bulged out from underneath it, leaving a large crescent shaped tummy roll completely visible to the world. Her sweats, gray with two white stripes distorted by her fat, were like a vicegrip to her beyond-chubby thighs. So tight in fact, that her feet seemed to just pop out, the rest of her fat cankles suffocated underneath a thick gray fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina was having similar difficulties, being very close to Midnight's overall weight. But she lucked out and got something a little thinner, so even though it was tight it didn't feel near as heavy. She too had a tank top, but it was one of a stretchy, light material that contorted to every curve of her bloated form. Most of her tummy was exposed, that was something that could be remedied with the ritual re-rolling of the too lax material back over her dome like middle, but the black top was very comfortable and liberating- but she wouldn't dare step out of the mansion with it on. But the main curse was the short-shorts she had been forced to wear. It seems that every bottom in Shera's closet was too small for her to fit into but this pair of spandex short shorts, one that stretched over the back of her own bottom and left a very visible panty-line after effect. Her jiggling thighs spread out from the leg holes like baking bread, dimpled and wide as she sat on the couch; squeezing next to Shera (who she couldn't really look at right now, why'd she have such tiny pants in her closet anyway?!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie drew the longest stick of the draw. Being thinner, smaller, and overall a tiny girl, she had the \"fortunate\" luck of getting something from Ember's closet. Luckilly, it was something from a while ago and it was very form-fitting to even Kyrie's chubby potbellied body. However the image of a smiling cupcake across her budding busom was a little disheartening to her- everyone else found it absolutely and unbearably adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely no problem, Ali.\" Shera said with a smile, \"I'm glad <i>someone</i> appreciates them as much as I have.\" this was, in no small way, a shot at Midnight without being a direct shot at Midnight. Being bluntly mean would just be totally unShera-like. \"Anywho, I've called this meeting so that you can meet and discuss with our- well, yours too, I guess- <i>our</i> Master.\" At this, the somewhat frumpy moemon gesticulated to Don Tanner, who cocked his outstretched hand in a lazy wave to acknowledge the greeting. \"Yo~\" he sang in his usual informal tone, glancing over all the portly beauties wedging themselves into his furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd imagine we <i>really</i> need to get acquainted.\" Midnight hissed in Don Tanner's general direction. \"Oh calm yourself, Cur.\" Atlus, who was seated directly beside Kyrie, rolled his eyes in moderate intolerance of Midnight's sarcastic attitude. \"Out of all of you, the 'Master' is the only one who hasn't struck me.\" The chibi diety turned a haughty nose up to the bloated females of the room, who all shared their own little hints at rage towards his blatant favoritism and betrayal (Midnight's being an actual growl escaping the volumous caverns of her chest). This seemed to please Tanner enough to raise his hand for a fist pound, only for Atlus to questionably eye the balled up appendage and stare him down- the fist slowly falling back down to rest on Don Tanner's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess I'll start.\" Ali said, ignoring the awkwardness that was the figurative elephant in the room, \"<i>You're</i> our master?\" Tanner smiled and nodded his head once, \"Yeah, that's me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeppers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expected as much.\" Tanner said, seeming somewhat disheartened. \"But hey, no worries, I understand- I'm not all stuffy and stuff like what most people would expect a 'Master' to be.\" Atlus rolled his eyes at Don Tanner's justification of his lacking social graces. \"'Stuffy and stuff?'\" he repeated the phrase aloud, \"I find it hard to believe that a man such as yourself with such low vocabulary and social skills can function, let alone lead a house of any sorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I like you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough.\" Shera broke in, \"The point is that <i>this</i> is our master now, and the whole point of your employment was so that you could work to repay your respective debts... I think we should really start on that now.\"</span></div></div>",

Everyone\u2019s attention was drawn to the Dragonair Moemon. Taking moment to push up his hat, Don Tanner lifted his eyebrow and spoke calmly. \u201cWhat\u2019s this whole \u2018debt\u2019 thing all about? Are you telling me that these four lovely ladies and little god of earth aren\u2019t working here out of the courtesy of their own hearts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI continuously get pummeled, choked, and thrown around,\u201d Atlus huffed loudly as he jumped from his seat, in an attempt to get out of his conversation and away from these crazy people.

After a few moments of silence, Ali sighed loudly and answered, \u201cWe were just guests here originally, but we\u2026 We kinda broke something thanks to the mutt over here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Midnight barked jumping from her seat (sending her milk chocolate colored skin into a terrible if not amazing ripple that made all her juicy bits jiggle in a timely manner). \u201cYou were the one hit the stand!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because you kept laying into me!\u201d Ali seethed back as she stomped up to Midnight and poked the Mighyena Moemon in the large peeked out stomach. \u201cIf you had control over that muzzle of yours, you might not have gained so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies! Ladies! That\u2019s enough!\u201d Don Tanner interrupted, using his Extreme Speed to stand beside the two large, lovely ladies and dive his arms in between them to make sure that a fight wouldn\u2019t break out. \u201cNow then\u2026 Uh\u2026\u201d Don Tanner then tapped the bill of his cap a few times, trying to gather his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with a shrug, he just turned towards Fontina and lifted a finger towards her, \u201cYou, uh, Megane Vaporeon! Could you please explain to me what incident that the shrimpy Quilava and the bulbous Mightyena are talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d Both Ali and Midnight complained at the same time, however, their complaints were ignored by the usually dancing Moemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina scrunched her nose slightly at Don Tanner and his apparent nickname for her, \u201cMy name is Fontina, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could learn my name at the very least\u2026 That and return my undergarments\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon Tanner tilted his head to the side and shrugged, \u201cNot important at the moment! What is important is you answering my question!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we kind of broke a very fancy looking vase,\u201d Fontina explained, her arms crossed under her quite impressive bust. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Don Tanner laughed loudly, making everyone (including Shera) jump slightly at the intrusive laughter. \u201cIs that all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Don Tanner\u2019s sentence to sink in, and there was an awkward silence floating about the room. All through out the silence, Don Tanner stood in the midst of the room with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until Kyrie herself, broke out of her shell and spoke up, \u201cUm\u2026 W-What d-do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what these guys told ya,\u201d Don Tanner answered with a shrug. \u201cBut, I\u2019m willing to guess that the vase that you guys are talking about had a lot of dragon pokemon designs on it, with a few jewels thrown into the mix, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli, Midnight and Fontina all nodded at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust as I thought,\u201d Don Tanner snickered to himself as he nodded a few times. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you have to worry about that little debt concerning breaking that vase. I\u2019ll just make another one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, there was an awkward silence echoing through the room, and even Shera had a surprised look on her face. \u201cUh\u2026 M-Master Tanner\u2026 W-What are you saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m saying I made the vase,\u201d Don Tanner replied with his hands on his hips. \u201cRemember? You said I had to get out and try some new stuff. A pottery class was all that was available at the local YMCA and I poured my heart and soul into that vase.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was dumbstruck at the information that Don Tanner so casually placed on the table, all with a smile on his face. Atlus however, was the first one to speak up\u2026 Or laugh it up, \u201cBWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! SO IT WAS ESSENTIALLY WORTHLESS!?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! It had plenty of worth!\u201d Don Tanner stated with his nose turned upwards. \u201cLike I said, I put my heart and soul into that work, and it actually turned out well! Man, this is going to cost me another trip to the YMCA\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaitwaitwaitwait!\u201d Ali shouted, getting everyone\u2019s attentions. \u201cSo\u2026 We\u2019ve been working all this time over something that wasn\u2019t worth all the work we\u2019ve done!?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Essentially, yeah,\u201d Don Tanner replied, throwing his arms behind his head. \u201cI mean, I told the staff that the vase was worth a lot, because I put a lot of effort into it so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBIFF!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cURK!\u201d Don Tanner gagged as he fell over, three new bruises covering his face, all courtesy of Ali, Midnight and Fontina at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera just blinked a few times in surprise as the three original heroines, Kyrie and Atlus quickly left the room, leaving the dazed Don Tanner and the head maid in the room alone. For a few moments, Shera just stood there, her face red from her embarrassment on the matter. She made all four of those girls working for something that was broken that had no monetary worth! \u201c\u2026 Oh, this is terrible\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, is this my fault?\u201d Don Tanner questioned, keeping his eyes closed (he didn\u2019t want to get smacked upside the head if Shera thought he was peeking up her uniform).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera sighed loudly\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Porcelain plates clinked against the fine silverware. Chubby fingers gripped around their forks with the grip reminiscent of an Arbok's Wrap, coming down onto the ornate platters at full force, regardless of their fragility. They emerged with finely cooked morsels dangling from their pikes, thick with flavor and steam, before they were shoved into an awaiting maw who sucked the sustenance of it's metal teat and dove back in for another helping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no conversation in a majority of the room, not for a lack of trying. In celebration of the Master's return to the household, everyone had been allowed to shirk off their individual duties for the night and come have a nice wholesome meal with eachother. This meant the Night Staff; Horus, seated to the left of Don Tanner's head of the table across from Shera, Ivan, sitting across from (and getting a very nice view of) Claire and her ginormous boobies, and Ethel, who had been disdainfully seated at the end of the table (or the \"Kid's Table\" as it was referred to) along with Ember, Kyrie and Atlus filling in as both roles of \"adult\" and \"child\" due to their shrunken appearances; Wester, who had been graciously allowed the privilege of simply placing the food on the table rather than serving everyone individually (at the cost of sitting at the opposite head of the table with the \"children\"); and even Walker, who despite her injured leg still managed to come down on her own for tonight's proceedings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per norm, Ali and Fontina sat beside each other with Midnight directly across from her bulging blue-haired friend in almost the direct center of the table. And as predicted, none of the women exactly felt like talking, so the level of angst and depression emanating from that section of the table was thick enough to slice. Sitting beside Midnight was Claire, who didn't seem to notice the shrinking amount of space between their (mostly Midnight's) tubby shapes nor the lusty glances Ivan kept flashing towards her highbeams. What she, along with Shera, Horus, Ivan, and even Wester all the way down there on the Kid's Table noticed was the sudden revival of dinnertime at the hands of their master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was loud, he was boisterous, and he didn't open his mouth if there wasn't something entertaining coming out of it. He told jokes, amusing rantings about his current travels, and even did impersonations (dead on, by the way) of the strange inhabitants of the Sinnoh region he had met along the way in his journey. The whole half of the table, even the seemingly levelheaded Horus, let out howls of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where the first half of the table was filled with sunshine and good will, the latter half was, as stated above, filled with a feeling that could only be defined as malice. With Walker giving off her normal amount of angst, plus a broken leg <i>and</i> sitting next to Midnight, and the mutual shame that Ali Fontina and the overstuffed pooch herself hanging over their heads, it was no surprise when Kyrie seemed upset. And when Kyrie was upset, Atlus seemed a little more hardy than usual, which in turn attracted Ember to wrap him into her flabby expanse, thus depressing the little bugger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahahaha!!\" Ivan let out a loud howl, his eyes watering with the tears of his joy, \"Oh, Zir, you can really tell ze jokes!!\"  he wiped his squinted eyeballs with the back of his index finger, \"Ah, Walker, could you -eh, pass ze wine down to the 'Adult Section' please?\" he chuckled, amused at his own wit, \"Aha, you see vat I did zere; I-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Walker reached over and palmed the wine bottle; chucking it at Ivan's head. It resounded with a loud 'BONK', falling gracefully into Don Tanner's outstretched hands after rebounding off of the Golbat Moemon's skull. \"Ouchie.\" he whimpered meekly. \"Woah Walker, what's up with you?\" Don Tanner asked, not exactly convincing in his plea for peace -seeing as how he was balancing a plate on his nose to imitate the Flying Spheal Circus act he and his friends had seen in Hoenn- Walker, ever starved for conflict, struggled to her feet and glared at her master with the utmost disdain. \"Nothing.\" she said indignantly, her nostrils flared and white eyebrows creased, \"I'm going back to my room to eat, where I can get some peace and quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grumpy Absol moemon grunted as she straddled herself to get her crutch, balancing her plate in one hand as she placed the crutch underneath her armpit, and hobbled off out of the kitchen and presumably towards the stairs; leaving Don Tanner just as confused as ever around here. \"Shouldn't someone go there?\" he asked, sincerely concerned for his genderly ambiguous butler, \"I mean, you know, to make Sure Walker gets there safely?\" Horus let out a deep sigh, closing his eyes in deep thought as he took another swig of his coffee. \"You how Walker is, Sir, always looking for trouble but always willing to back up any talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonair moemon's response was half sigh and half laughter as he placed the platter back onto the table. \"Yeah, I remember, Walker may be a taller and meaner, but I'll always remember the skittish little kid who wouldn't say a word unless it was to you~\" Horus blushed somewhat before smiling, \"Yeah, me too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight looked back, struggling past her own girthed neck to watch Walker hobble out of the dining room. Even though he was a jerk, he just looked so sad. Walker had always done everything by himself by his way, in the rough-and-tumble \"I-don't-care-who-I-offend\" manner he had carried himself with since she had known him. And now that his leg was broken, he couldn't do much of anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll, uh, go help him up the stairs...\" Midnight said politely, and even a little quietly. No one was shocked in particular, moreso at the connotation of her sentence than what she actually said. Don Tanner shrugged his shoulders slightly before letting out a satisfied, \"Sure, go ahead~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight pushed back her chair, incredible bulk keeping it nearly indented into the floor. She lunged forward like she always does, but to no avail, tonight's dinner must have pushed her over the edge (actually, she was far passed that edge and couldn't see the shoreline, but I digress) Her boobs, sitting atop the great mountainous belly and wedged between two puffy wads of armfat, squished together as she attempted to rise, causing pressure and strain on her windpipe, and thus forcing her to retreat back into her chair. \"Ugh... can someone -&gt;huff&lt;- help me up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlus rolled his eyes, sprung up from his seat and grabbed the Mightyena moemon's chubby, using his still superior strength to nearly toss her out into the hallway. He laughed as he observed Midnight struggle to keep her balance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait a sec, did she just say 'he'?\" Don Tanner uttered a mere two minutes after Midnight's ousting, \"I'm pretty sure she said 'he'.\" Horus mulled, \"Probably just a slip of the tongue.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come off it!!\" Ali shouted, finally having enough of this ridiculous conversation of circuses, butlers, children, and boobies. She shot from her seat, belly creased by the table as it protruded outwards stuffed by meals present and past. \"Are we just gonna ignore what happened just an hour ago?!\" she shouted, eyes growing fiery, \"About how my friends and I just wasted <i>MONTHS</i> of our lives for no pay at all?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie flinched at the word \"wasted\", seeing as how her first memorable friendships had been product of their servitude. She shrunk into her seat and snivelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had it! Since I don't need to be here anymore, I can safely say two words that I've longed to say since I started here:\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled towards the exit, following Midnight's example and aiming for the stairs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. QUIT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd waddled off...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLousy jackass,\u201d Ali growled as she jumped onto the couch, a large box of doughnuts bouncing next to her. After stomping off from the dining hall, and not wanting to really deal with anyone else headed to one of the few places that would more than likely be completely bare of Moemon in this mansion during dinner\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 The break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet. There was a lock on the door. Plus, there were plenty of things to eat, after all, she was skipping dinner and didn\u2019t get a lot to eat. And after all the crap that she had to deal with today (all caused by that perverted Dragonair \u2013 Don Tanner), something sweet would be enough to calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing open the box she had, Ali looked at all of the jam packed pastries inside (and some of them were packed with jam too, lol) and sniffed them. She had to admit they were quite tantalizing and oh so tempting. Heck, even after considering all the free work she and the others did over the last few months, Ali reasoned that it would\u2019ve just been fair to enjoy as much free food as they wanted. Or even more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one of the Swinub Sweets pastries, Ali sunk her teeth into the sweet treat and immediately swallowed it down her gullet. And quickly she stuffed the rest of the pastry into her mouth and chewed quickly, the sweet food filling her cheeks as she reached for a second one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know, ya shouldn\u2019t stuff yourself silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli gagged loudly as she began to choke on the sweets she was eating at the moment, Don Tanner suddenly appearing next to her! Although she had questions in her head, she was more concerned with the fact she was choking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons,\u201d Don Tanner chuckled with a wag of his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne glass of water later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli was breathing loudly as she kept a hand on her chest, trying to catch her breath, but keeping her glare set on Don Tanner who was seated in a chair in front of her. On the Dragonair moemon\u2019s face was a large smirk, \u201cSo, those gray skies of yours cleared up yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes my glare answer that?\u201d Ali replied turning her head away from Don Tanner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t be like that,\u201d Don Tanner chuckled sheepishly as he removed his hat, allowing his long hair to fall from its containment. \u201cA cute little gal like you shouldn\u2019t have a face like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small blush appeared on Ali\u2019s face, but she still kept up her strong front, \u201cWe wasted so much time here! I mean sure, meeting Kyrie was a great thing, but still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon Tanner sighed loudly, \u201cLook, little disco inferno.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ali questioned with a look of disbelief on her face. \u201cWhat\u2019d you call me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to say this,\u201d Don Tanner continued, ignoring Ali\u2019s question. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what happen, if I did, then I would\u2019ve just let you and your friends leave whenever you wanted to. Frankly, what happened to you and your friends was a great injustice and frankly if anyone owes anyone, I owe you and your friends a lot. I get that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli turned back to Don Tanner, her look softening slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know first hand that time is a precious thing that can never be replaced,\u201d Don Tanner sighed lowering his head. \u201cI know that the hard way, but in any case, I want to make it up to you and your friends in any way that I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you even care?\u201d Ali growled turning her attention down at Don Tanner, her glare starting to regain some of its fire. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a whimsical paradise here? With your perverted fantasies walking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Do you know why I was gone for a long time?\u201d Don Tanner questioned putting his hat back on his head. And without waiting for an answer, the Dragonair Moemon smiled brightly. \u201cI was traveling, its almost every young moemon\u2019s dream to be able to leave home to establish a name for him or herself in the world. Sometimes its in business, other times it\u2019s with a team to conquer the Moemon League\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if I\u2019m mistaken, that\u2019s what you and your two friends were doing before you got caught up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli turned away from the Dragonair, Don Tanner shaking his head, \u201cI actually know how you and your friends probably feel, being kept from your dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ali growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see this mansion?\u201d Don Tanner replied holding his hands up. \u201cAs you can probably guess, a guy my age can\u2019t get this thing through the business world. I inherited it from my old man, as well as his duties, and he passed away when I was real young, so I couldn\u2019t really leave here and go on a journey. When I was still just a little Dratini Moemon, I would always hear tales of some of the greatest Moemon who went out on their journeys and became legends, like Lance the Dragonite, or Steven the Agrron, those guys went out and created names for themselves through constant battles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I was trapped with my father\u2019s duties at this mansion, trapped like a little Pidgey in a birdcage. It wasn\u2019t until a few years ago that Shera and Horus actually decided to help me with my workload to allow me to go out and journey with some others here at the mansion, and I felt a great freedom be allowed to me. But, I still have to come back here every so often and take on some of the workload like now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess what I\u2019m saying is, sure, I don\u2019t know exactly what you and your friends were going through working here, but I can relate at the very least, and I don\u2019t want anyone else to be chained to this mansion. I\u2019d sell the place or tear it down, but I still loved my old man and I don\u2019t want to lose the very thing he left for me in his memory\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli blinked a few times as Don Tanner poured out that story, something you would hear from a very deep person, and one who wasn\u2019t a pervert. It sounded sincere. And maybe he was very sorry for creating a very great inconvenience for her and her friends\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking for forgiveness,\u201d Don Tanner continued. \u201cI\u2019m not even asking for you to like me. All I\u2019m asking is that you at least let me try to make it up to ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli was a little bit torn\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Ali started\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I...\" Ali stopped, turning from Don Tanner as if to stall for time. The words were simple enough, at least what she had in mind, but for some reason they seemed inexpressible. Surely Don Tanner's great sacrifice for his youthful ambitions was honorable, a tenfold version of what she and her friends had given up in order to work here. In a way, Ali was torn between a slowly fading rage and a strange urge to forgive. The look in his brown eyes was one of sincerity, somehow lacking the maliciousness to lie now, if at all. She was touched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the moment was put on pause when a tiny knocking came at the door. Ali turned to the door quickly without leaving the couch, almost as if frightened to be seen alone with a character such as her ex-master. \"B-But how'd you get in?\" Ali asked sharply, craning her neck to glance at the Dragonair moemon. \"This is <i>my</i> house, 'member?\" he lifted a skeleton key from his pocket, \"I got keys.\" Ali rolled her eyes as she composed herself; brushing off debris from her meal and straightening her tightening uniform. \"J-Just a second!\" she said in an elevated tone, relinquishing her position on the couch as she lifted her heavy form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" a familiar meek tone answered from behind the door, almost inaudible from behind the heavy wood. The Quilava moemon instantly recognized the innocent little squeaking coming from outside as Kyrie, no doubt coming up to check on her. But was she really so transparent that <i>everyone</i> knew that she would come to the break room? Ali took a deep breath as she placed her chubby hand on the doorknob, twisting it and pulling until the legendary moemon had been revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kyrie.\" she said in a tone that clearly reflected her moral dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi...\" Kyrie said quietly, staring down at the floor from the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were silent between both girls and the onlooking Don Tanner. Kyrie kept her eyes off of Ali in any means possible, while Ali tried her best to seem as unintimidating as possible so as to refrain from frightening the skittish deity. \"You didn't have to come all the way up here, you know.\" Ali finally said, lifting a chubby arm to scratch the back of her head, \"I'm fine, really.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie's lower lip quivered as she continued avoiding her friend's gaze, tears forming in those beautiful golden eyes of hers. \"I was... worried about you...\" she managed through her slight sobbing. Slowly, the tears fell from their ducts and rolled down Kyrie's somewhat rounded cheeks. \"I-I know I didn't have to come... but...\" she paused, as if the words were like bites of food too big to chew, \"I-I just thought you could... use a friend...\" as the final words fell from her mouth, the gentle sniveling soon became tears that only a water god could produce. They were thick, yet perfectly clear; almost seeming too big for the tiny moemon to have produced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyrie, d-don't-\" Ali started, but she found herself unable to finish her sentence as her godly companion continued blubbering. \"A-An-And you said-\" Kyrie continued talking, reaching into her apron for a handkerchief to dab her eyes and nose with, \"Th-That you and your friends' time here had been... a waste...\" she calmed down slightly, though not enough to cork the waterworks falling from her eyes, \"B-But h-here is where I met you, and Fontina... and... and... please don't quit!\" she bawled, looking up at Ali like a lost puppy does at a new master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli couldn't resist. She waddled over to her friend and pulled Kyrie as close to her doughy shape as it would allow. At this the blubbering sea goddess' wails only grew louder as she buried herself in Ali's engorged bosom; the soft tissue of her breast muffling her anguished cries of concern. With one hand Ali wrapped around Kyrie's chubby form and pulled her closer, and with the other she held her head down into her chest in a very motherly fashion. \"Shh.... it's okay...\" Ali said quietly, \"I wouldn't ever think of our time together as anything but awesome.\" she smiled, though no one could see it unless they were outside the door, \"Let's get you into bed, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on it, Ali had experienced a very similar conversation before. One where a little girl was crying over a trusted friend leaving, afraid that they might lose the person most important to them forever. The night remained clear in her mind, right outside her house in New Bark Town. The conversation, a near word for word copy of the one experienced today, was significant as well. For those were the last words she'd heard from her brother, Ten. Maybe it was this that led her to being so accepting with Kyrie's skittish and downright tear-potent behavior...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" Kyrie said, still buried deep in Ali's valley of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli almost seemed to forget Don Tanner's presence in the break room, who's last words of the night were \"So can I take that as a yes?\" Ali stopped, turned her head, and smiled at the enigmatic Don Tanner without saying a word before heading out the door with Kyrie in arms...</span></div></div>",

The bootyluscious Mightyena girl, or the boobylicious Vaporeon? I wager that neither of them would be interested in talking to me\u2026 But maybe I should go for the safer bet\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">TTTTTT</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina sighed loudly as she kept a few books close to her expansive paunch as she walked through the maze that was this library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rather upset, and now even more so given that she had just hit the man who was probably about to let them go free. Perhaps Ali and Midnight were just wearing off on her. Or perhaps tensions were just too high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese moemon had moved automatically, and rather quickly for her size, back to her number one comfort zone, the library. It hadn't hit her until now how much exertion she had placed on her squidgy body today. She waddled up to a seat, fitting snugly into a comfy chair that she once could have stretched out on. Her weight, having slowly grown so familiar to her she had nearly forgotten, was now something she felt in full force. The water moemon was blue in every sense of the word right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know what to do...she wanted to be happy about the chance they'd be leaving this mansion, but what awaited them? They couldn't walk from town to town like they used to. Maybe getting out on the road again would be good for them in that respect, but Fontina somehow doubted they'd make any progress anytime soon, and in the intermediate time that meant scrounging up a lot of bus or cab fare. Furthermore, after so much wandering, Fontina had to admit she had grown used to the mansion and the many luxuries that it afforded even its servants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina let out a large sigh and for a while just relaxed in the chair, trying to catch her breast. Unfettered, her bosom heaved and wobbled. Fontina was not a vain girl, not at all. But even she couldn't help but see the silver lining of all this weight. Maybe if she was lucky, even after losing all this weight (whenever that happened) she'd stay a bit curvier. She had to hold out hope that something good would come of all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to open her first book up, the glasses wearing Moemon caught something out of the corner of her eye, seeing that there was a book laying the middle of the floor she just walked over. \u2018It must\u2019ve just slipped out of my arms and I didn\u2019t notice\u2026 Oh well, I can always get it when\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Fontina stopped when she realized that the book in question was the first book that had caught her eye when she entered the library \u2013 A first edition, writer\u2019s cut of a rare, out of print book that went under the name of \u201cThe Unova Quartet \u2013 Tale of the Tao Trio\u201d. Now, part of Fontina wanted to just get up out of that seat and pick up that book, but her massive behind was practically wedged in that seat, and after spending quite a bit of time and effort trying to find all the books she wanted, she was tired from walking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if she just left it there, then it would just be a waste of effort on her part! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh!\u201d Fontina wined as she tried to lean forward in an attempt to reach the book without actually having to get off her large ass. Of course, with the melons that she was smuggling in her shirt squishing up against her bulbous gut and meaty knees, that was easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of trying, Fontina was about to give up when all of a sudden a pair of blue and white sneakers attached to a pair of white jeans walked up over the book. Slowly, the pants knelt down to reveal the familiar smirking face of one Don Tanner, \u201cHere, let me get that for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 T-Thanks,\u201d Fontina mumbled, still a little annoyed with this dragonair Moemon, but a little embarrassed at the thought of wondering how long he had been around to see her try to reach out for the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon Tanner lifted the book up in his hands and slowly walked towards Fontina, \u201cHmm, this is a good book, one of the few that my father read to me when I was a little guy. It\u2019s got a great story!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Dragonair Moemon handed the book to Fontina, the overly voluptuous Vaporeon Moemon turned her glasses covered eyes away from the sleek Don Tanner. She didn\u2019t say a word to him as she held the book close to her meaty chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when she realized that Don Tanner was still standing in front of her, she had no choice but to speak. \u201cUm, is there s-something I can help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yes,\u201d Don Tanner sighed as he removed his hand (revealing his long luxurious locks of white hair) and rubbed the back of his head. \u201cI came here to apologize\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor stealing my bra?\u201d Fontina pointed out with a flat look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha?\u201d Don Tanner gasped slightly as he jumped a foot backwards. \u201cNo! Well, maybe, but I wanted to apologize for the big stuff first, ya know, having you and your two friends being kept here to work off a non-realistic debt. No one should have to go through that, especially when they\u2019re so young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApologies are nice,\u201d Fontina sighed as she turned away from Don Tanner. \u201cBut they can\u2019t undo the damages for the acts that warranted those apologies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Don Tanner muttered with his hand to his mouth. \u201cWell\u2026 I know that a lot of time of yours was wasted and all but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that!\u201d Fontina spurted out, immediately drawing her hands to her mouth. She had a lot of stress in her and it was finally seeping out, of course, letting that go in a library was never a proper way to channel stress in a loud manner. \u201cI\u2026 I mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon Tanner noticed the flushed cheeks that were adorning the glasses wearing beauty, and sighed as he quickly sat down on the floor with his legs crossed and kept his gaze at Fontina. Needless to say, Fontina was a little drawn back at what the Dragonair Moemon was doing, \u201cW-What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I wanna try to fix whatever problems I caused you girls,\u201d Don Tanner replied with his arms crossed. \u201cI don\u2019t expect forgiveness, I don\u2019t expect you girls to even like me \u2013 All I want to do is make amends for what I did to you guys, so, tell me whatever troubles that have been plaguing you ever since you came to this mansion. At the very least, you\u2019ll have a good pair of ears to listen to your troubles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, t-thanks b-but,\u201d Fontina muttered with her eyes turning away from Don Tanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Don Tanner interrupted with his gaze transfixed on Fontina\u2019s face (and noticeable rack, but then again, from where he was seated, you couldn\u2019t help but look at those generous sweaterpuppies while looking at Fontina\u2019s face). \u201cNow, you can either let old Don Tanner try his hand at helping your problems, or you can leave, but I gotta tell you, I am tenacious, and I won\u2019t let this go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina sighed loudly, in a sense, Don Tanner was trying to make things right\u2026 And technically it wasn\u2019t Don Tanner\u2019s fault all this stuff happened. The least Fontina could do was chew Don Tanner\u2019s ears off\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see, my biggest concern,\u201d Fontina started, gesturing towards her mountainous, if not highly voluptuous figure. \u201cIs this. Ever since we came to this mansion, I\u2019ve been gaining weight like crazy, I\u2019m like three\u2026 Maybe four times bigger than when I first came here and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, mostly, as he was also paying close attention from his angle to the volupuous vaporeon girls gigantic breasts. Said pillowy breasts absorbed most of Don's attention, so he was paying only peripheral attention to the conversation. Even so, the pace of the gain from his guests described appearance was naggingly familiar, even Wester didn't make <i>that</i> much food... just imagining the idea caused his gaze to find it's way to the water moemon's soft tummy, which looked so large and soft he felt almost compelled to reach out and touch it.However, it was then that Don was dragged back to reality by a rather pointed question <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you even listening?\" Fontina demanded, sounding somewhat hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon moemon snapped his eyes back to those of the girl that he was seated at the feet of. \"Hunh? Yeah, of course. You know, Wester simply doesn't make enough food to make you gain that fast. Well,\" The master of the mansion amended \"Unless they didn't excercise at all.\" He placed his hand on his chin in a classic thinkers pose, which sadly didn't work because he was trying to keep part of his vision on Fontinas amazing sweater puppies. \"Y'know, this all sounds like something I've heard of somewhere, but I can't put my finger on it.\" And that was frustrating, since it was literally an inch from his thoughts. Snarling slightly, he dismissed it \"It'll come to me someday. Anyway, I'm not so sure what's happening is really bad.\" He said, suddenly clear of all outwardly negative emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad?\" The obese moemon cries incredulously rising quickly to her feet; giving Don a free view of her extremely hefty thighs and strained panties,jiggling as she did. In the process the chair she was sitting on pulled up a little before gravity overrides the friction her wide hips placed on the armrests. He noticed how her face had turned a slight pink, and quailed as she seemed enraged. \"I'm huge, lazy, I can't find clothes that fit anymore and if I'll be made fun of if I...I,\" she didn't finish as then her entire form started jiggling with sobs as tears began to gather in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, HEY!\" Don said, standing to her side and wrapping one of his arms around the water moemons back while the other went in to knead the girls soft stomach. \"Look, I can <i>find</i> clothes that fit you, even ones several sizes up for you to grow into, I'll even go with you.\" The dragon moemon mentally slapped himself for that remark,even though it caused his guest to stare at him with gratitude. \"From what I've heard from the others you've been by far the most helpful of your friends and on you being huge, so what? I'm not complaining and I'm fairly sure nobody who's the least bit nice will care either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited for the sobbing to subside then produced a handkerchief, wiping the porky vaporeon moemons rounded cheeks clean, relishing every second as he pressed somewhat further than was neccessary to get all the moisture, he then ran the kerchief below her second chin, likewise feeling it's softness before raising it to the obese girls nose and nodding for her to blow it. Once done the dragonair gently guided her back to her chair and sat her down, running his hand down the length of one of her soft,un-toned arms as she sank back onto the cushioned furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'll look into your problem and I'm sorry about your being forced to stay here in the first place, but can you stay until I do?\" He asked \"I can't solve the problem if I don't know what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina giggled, causing her enormous tits to bounce hypnotically. \"And the clothes shopping?\" She asked in a manner highly reminiscent of a young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigh \"Yeah, I'll take you out shopping. My treat!\" <i>Shut up mouth,</i> Don shouted mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudgy moemon placed a fighter on her double chin \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

She was trying to help, but it was hard when everything you said made the poor little mystery moemon cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Ember returned, balancing several boxes on her free arm. \u201cHey! You girls ready for a snack?\u201d Ember asked, speaking surprisingly well with a mouthful of food. \u201cI brought some more food!\u201d Then, she noticed Kyrie, again hiding behind Ali, with tears in her eyes. \u201cOh! Your crying! That\u2019s so sad!

When the small girl didn\u2019t take the treat, Ember took the liberty of taking Kyrie's her hand, wrapping it around the donut, and putting it near her mouth for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie was still scared silly of this fatty, obnoxious woman, but had to admit she was a little hungry. (Despite snacking on cookies earlier.) And besides, she wasn\u2019t about to say \u2018no\u2019 to someone as demanding as Ember!

She finished it, and Ember supplied her with a new one. Then the blubbery moemon turned to Ali, who had hoped for a second that she would be allowed to digest her full stomach in peace. No such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you too! Get up onto the couch! You\u2019ll never feel better if you stop eating!\u201d With surprising strength, Ember lifted Ali straight off the ground, and plopped her next to Kyrie, who let out another startled \u201cEep!\u201d Before finishing up her donut. \u201cOk, girlies, we\u2019ve got some eating to do!\u201d Said Ember happily, supplying both of them with a sweet treat to eat\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

FUUUUUUUU!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmber? Eeeeeembeeeer! Where are, you, ya fat lard? Come on! I need your help! EMBER!!!!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, at the sound of somebody calling, three heads shot up at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was Ember. The others were Ali and Kyrie. One of said heads shot up in guilt. The other two, with relief. I\u2019ll let you guess which ones were which. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmmm\u2026. COMEING!\u201d Ember shouted. She quickly looked around, seeing 5 additional empty donut boxes on the floor, adding to the 3 that were their before. She quickly stood up, releasing two very stuffed young moemon\u2018s legs. Not that they were in much of a position to move, anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmber? Are you in the staff room again? I thought I TOLD you, NO SNACKING ON THE JOB!\u201d The voice sounded closer now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, uh\u2026. NO! I\u2019M JUST UP HERE\u2026. UH\u2026 DUSTING!\u201d Ember shouted desperately. She turned to the two girls laying on the couch. \u201cFriends, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve got to go! I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can! Remember, keep eating!\u201d With that, she hurried her large mass out the doorframe, and slammed the door. Almost immediately, a pair of moans filled the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cA-A-A-Ali?\u201d</font>  Kyrie said, so quiet, it was barley a whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhg\u2026.. Yea Kyrie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cMy belly hurts.\u201d </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine too, Kyrie, mine too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy, did they! Ember had completely had her way with the poor duo of girls over the past few hours, taking full advantage of Kyries shyness and Ali\u2019s already stuffed state to get as much \u2018healing food\u2019 down into their stomachs as possible. Which meant for Kyrie, three and a half dozens of donuts, and one and a half more for Ali, adding on top of the three she\u2019d already eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them moved for another fifteen minutes, other than letting out the occasional groan or burp. But after that amount of time, Ali became afraid that Ember may soon be able to wriggle her way out of working again to pay a visit. And so with much difficulty, she heaved herself and her hugely bloated belly off the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then worked on getting poor little Kyrie off the couch. With great effort, she managed to get her standing. Looking at her, Ali was amazed how much food she had eaten. Her scrawny, wraith-like figure was accented by an enormously stuffed belly, bulging out unnaturally. Of course, Ali knew she probably looked the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another 20 minutes of struggling around the mostly deserted corridors of the huge mansion, The stuffed pair finally made it to Ali\u2019s room. After going in and shutting the door, (quietly, as not to alert Ember if she was anywhere nearby) the two short moemon lay on the single bed together, trying to calm their aching stomachs. Ali had something on her mind, and she knew It was the prefect time to bring it up. But she wasn\u2019t really sure how mysterious Kyrie would react\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 Kyrie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\u201cY-y-yes?\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was thinking\u2026 Well, I just wanted to know if\u2026 Um\u2026\u201d Ali didn\u2019t know where to begin. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to ask is, do you remember anything at all from your life before we found you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie thought hard for a moment. Really hard. She had been doing that a lot lately, trying to remember something, anything. But all she got was her name. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\u201cN-N-No. N-Nothing. \u201c</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was just wondering.. What will you do if you can\u2019t ever remember where you came from? Where you live?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie had never thought about this. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\u201cI-I don\u2019t k-know\u2026\u201d</font> The poor girl looked so lost, it made Ali\u2019s heart ache!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was wondering\u2026. If we ever get out of this place\u2026 Well,  If you\u2019d like to join Midnight, Fontina, and me. Traveling around and such.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie just stared at her with those big eyes of hers, mouth open. Ali felt awkward. She had just made a fairly major offer\u2026 She had expected some sort of response. But weather that response would be joy or tears, she had no idea. She never did with this strange girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when the silence was getting long, Kyrie turned her gaze to the ground. When she looked up again, Ali saw tears in her eyes. Again. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2026 You r-r-really m-m-mean it?\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course I do!\u201d Ali said cheerfully. \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for, right? So what do you say?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie just stared at her, amazed that someone would make her that kind of offer. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\u201c\u2026 Y-y-yes\u2026.\u201d</font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a certain book of curses, hidden under a pile of its fellow paper brethren in the library, glowed purple for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now that that\u2019s settled, I\u2019m gonna take a nap\u2026 Sleep all this food off\u2026\u201d Ali said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cOk\u2026 S-s-sweet dreams\u2026 F-friend\u2026\u201d</font>  But Ali was already asleep, hands resting on her stuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie just sighed and leaned back onto the headboard of the bed, rubbing her own large tummy. Trying to remember something. Anything. Put her past remained a black hole in her brain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd slowly, sleep overtook the mysterious moemon, until she too, fell unconscious, leaving her belly to digest her \u2018midmorning snack.\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And of course, she was currently waging war on Westers recently finished batch of chocolate chip cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUg! WHY *munch* WON\u2019T *chomp* HE *stuff* LIKE ME!?!?!?\u201d She yelled, accenting each heated word with a large bite of cookie. She continued to munch and rage and munch some more, cursing that idiot Walker, with his idiotic good looks and his idiotic temper and his idiotic personality\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anger died out as soon as it had flared up when she reached for another cookie, only to find that she had eaten the entire batch. She felt a blush in rise to her cheeks. \u201cOh\u2026 Guess I overdid it a little there\u2026\u201d She looked down at her full pot-belly, not quite grasping the fact that It wasn\u2019t just the cookies that made it bulge out like that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan\u2026 I better get out of here before Wester comes back\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before the full moemon could abandon the scene of the crime, She heard footsteps outside the door. \u201cCrap!\u201d Midnight said, maybe a little too loudly. She dove down behind one of the rows of cupboards, hoping it wasn\u2019t Wester\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidnight? Are you there?\u201d Oh! It was just Fontina! Midnight popped up from her hiding spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey Fontina.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYA!\u201d Fontina yelped in surprise. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I was just\u2026 Uh\u2026 scrubbing the floor!\u201d The dark moemon improvised. \u201cYah, that\u2019s it. Scrubbing the floor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 Ok\u2026\u201d The aqua moemon sweat dropped.  Whatever\u2026 She had more important things to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways\u2026 Uh\u2026 I needed to talk to you about something\u2026\u201d Fontina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea? What is it?\u201d Midnight said, while searching the cupboards for something sweet. Wester always kept something good in them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was kinda wondering.. About yesterday.\u201d Fontina said shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Apparently, Midnight had forgotten all about her almost-confrontation with Fontina just yesterday.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know\u2026 You said something about me and Walker\u2026 And then\u2026 You know\u2026\u201d Fontina trailed off, unwilling to speak of the humiliation of what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH\u2026. Yea\u2026\u201d Midnight realized what she was talking about. \u201cYea\u2026 That\u2026 Well, it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore\u2026\u201d She said sadly, pulling out a large chunk of fudge she had found hidden behind the pots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, even so, I kinda want to know what it was about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Midnight hesitated, not wanting to reveal that she had eavesdropped on Fontina on her journey into Walkers strangely feminine room. (Or not strangely, depends on how in-the-know you are\u2026)  But she saw no other choice. \u201cUh\u2026 I was kinda walking down the hall yesterday and IoverheardyoutalkingtoWalkerinhisroomandIrushedtoconclusions.\u201d Midnight spat out in record time, accenting her innocence with a big smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026. Wait, THAT\u2019S what this is about?\u201d Flontina asked, rolling her eyes. \u201cMidnight, I\u2019m really sorry, but you can be a dramatic little bitch sometimes.\u201d (Which, if you think about veeeeeery carefully, is true! :P ) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidnight just laughed off her friends naughty (If not occasionally true) language. \u201cFontina! That was a bad word! Ha. Didn\u2019t know you had It in you!\u201d She said, giving her friend a playful punch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026. Why were you in his room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this Fontina looked down and blushed. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnights jaw dropped. \u201cNo. Way. Was I\u2026 right? Ehem, not that I give a crap, anyways\u2026\u201d Midnight looked at her friend with a fake shocked look. \u201cFontina, I\u2018m shocked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No no no no! Not that at all\u2026 Its just\u2026\u201d she looked uncomfortably around to make sure nobody else was listening. \u201cwell, ever since we\u2019ve gotten here, I\u2019ve been putting on a couple of pounds, and, well, Walker Is really the only thin one around here so I was kinda\u2026 Asking for some advice\u2026\u201d She admitted, like it was a horrible crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 That\u2019s all? Really? Well, I personally am relived. Wouldn\u2019t want our perfect Fontina losing her innocence to STUPID Walker now would we?\u201d She said teasingly, making the blue haired moemon blush. \u201cNah, I\u2019m just messing with ya. And besides. You really haven\u2019t gained that much\u2026\u201d Which wasn\u2019t exactly a lie. Well, maybe just a little. Fontinas new uniform covered her growing form pretty well, though still showing off a bit more cleavage than Fontina would have liked. Her belly too, was making its presence known in the soft curve of the fabric around her middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Midnight never had felt bad about lying, now, has she??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think so?\u201d The book-smart moemon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Just a little baby fat. You\u2019ll be able to lose it on the road again in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Mid.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Now, leave me to my comfort food!\u201d Midnight said, as she began digging into the slab of fudge, forgetting all about the cookies before it. Or that Fontina had no idea why she was comfort eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Ok\u2026 See ya.\u201d Fontina said uncertainly, closing the door as she exited the room, leaving Midnight alone with her fudge.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She yawned, and made to roll over out of bed, nearly crushing a sleeping Kyrie in the process. Just barley able to stop herself in time, she flopped onto her back again, and got out of the bed from the non-occupied side. She gently tip-toed to the bathroom, looking back at Kyrie as she went. She looked so peaceful sleeping. Her long blue-green hair flowed neatly down her back. Her belly was still a little pooched out from the huge meal earlier, as was Ali\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli stepped out of the bathroom to find Kyrie just waking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sleepyhead.\u201d Ali said as Kyrie yawned and rubbed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey.\u201d Kyrie said quietly. Always so quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyrie, you really need to speak up more. I swear, your quieter than a Weedle. (Are Weedles quiet? I don\u2019t really know.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-ok.\u201d She said, just as softly. Ali laughed. \u201cSilly goose. So, do you feel like heading down to dinner?\u201d Ali already knew the answer, but it was polite to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-well, I guess we could..\u201d Kyrie said, looking dubiously at her still-full stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli smirked. If someone told her to go jump off a bridge, she\u2019d probably do it. Not that anyone would ever want to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t really feel like it either.\u201d Kyrie looked relieved. \u201cSo, Kyrie, This has been bugging me.. Why were you so upset when you came to me in the staff lounge? Was Midnight mean to you?\u201d A look of anger appeared on Ali\u2019s face. \u201cCause if she did, I\u2019ll- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! You don\u2019t have too.. I mean, it wasn\u2019t her\u2026\u201d Kyrie said evasively. \u201cWell, n-not really..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThan what was it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie took a deep breath, and in a quick, quiet whisper, began recalling the events that had terrified her so much to Ali. Working in the kitchen. Being dragged off by Midnight. And seeing that lady butler and the large man fight\u2026 exchange blows, kicks! Hurting each other! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli put a hand on Kyries shoulder. She stopped and looked up from the ground into Ali\u2019s face. Kyrie\u2019s eyes were wet, and she was shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, Kyrie. It's ok.\u201d  Ali said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I\u2019m s-s-s-sorry\u2026.\u201d Kyrie said, sounding miserable.  \u201cI-I-I\u2019m o-o-ok..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyrie, its ok. I get it.\u201d Ali did get it, though it was quite rare for a moemon to fear violence. It was almost an integrated part of life. Of course, It was possible that this fear of fighting was simply because of  Kyries amnesia. Who knows? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It its ok, now, right, Kyrie? No more crying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie sniffled. \u201cO-o-ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for a few moments. Then Ali realized something. \u201cHey, Kyrie. How did you figure out that Walker was a girl? She practically had to undress in front of me for me to figure it out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie smiled a bit and shrugged. \u201cShe just looks like a girl.\u201d This made Ali laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie began exploring the room, which was full of Ali and Fontinas various possessions and knick knacks. Kyrie asked for permission to look at this thing or that so often, Ali nearly burst. \u201cKyrie! You can look at whatever you\u2019d like! Would it kill you to be a little less polite?\u201d <br>\r\nWhich had made the small moemon look so sad, Ali ended up apologizing herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Kyrie was standing at the rooms desk, looking at Ali\u2019s small pocket-sized calendar. She flipped through the months slowly, looking at each picture of beautiful places from other regions, and studying the special occasions Ali had marked such as \u2018Mom &amp; Dads anniversary!\u2019 and \u2018Christmas!!!!!\u2019 Kyrie didn\u2019t even know what Christmas was, or if she ever had known what it was. But she made a mental note to find out in that wonderful library they had here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli had started to doze off again when Kyrie came across a certain date. It was in August. Actually, it about nine days away. It read, \u2018MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!\u2019 in huge letters. While Kyrie was studying the letters, something odd happened. She felt something. Like an itch that she couldn\u2019t scratch. Suddenly, everything around her seemed to have a strange, too-bright quality about it, and every sound intensified. Her own breathing was deafening in her ears. What was happening? What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried calling out, but nothing happened. Her muscles seemed to weaken, then give out entirely, causing her to crash to the floor. Her vision started to go white around the edges, and the white slowly moved inwards, blocking her vision. The last thing she heard was Ali\u2019s voice. \u201cKyrie?\" A pause. \"Kyrie, what\u2019s up?\" Pause. \"Kyrie? Kyrie?!? Oh, no, no, no! Kyrie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA/N. I'm seriously gonna file a complaint to writing.com and tell them to make the character cap bigger. No, not a complaint.

She was getting nervous. She sat up in her bed. \u201cKyrie?\u201d She didn\u2019t see anything. Until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyrie?!?\u201d she saw her. Her small form, collapsed on the floor, by the rooms small desk. \u201cOh, no, no, no!  Kyrie!\u201d She was practically screaming now. She flew off the bed and knelt by Kyries slight figure. She was lying on her side, eyes pointed under the bed. Her hands were twitching a little, her hair splayed messily over the floor. \u201cKyrie! Oh, come on Kyrie!\u201d she took the girls face in her hands. She gasped. Her mouth was moving quickly, like she was talking. But no sound came. Her eyes were wide open, and staring blankly. Ali could hear her breathing. It was shallow and rough, but she was breathing. That was good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli had no idea what to do. Should she call someone? Wait it out? She had no idea. For someone who was going on adventure as of a few days ago, she had very little first aid know-how. All she could think of was to keep her head elevated to help her breathing. At least, she thought that was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she kept Kyries head in her lap. And began calling. \u201cSomeone! Someone! COME HERE! SOMTHINGS WRONG WITH KYRIE!\u201d But nobody came. It was hardly half a minute cense Kyrie had collapsed, but it felt like an hour. Ali just looked into the young girls face. She felt like she was going to cry. But suddenly, she felt strange. Sounds got louder. Her vision became blurry. Kyrie\u2019s wide eyes seemed to be sucking her in. \u201cOh great. Now who\u2019s gonna save ME?\u201d Was Ali\u2019s last thought as she too, collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ali came to, she was in a room she\u2019d never seen before. It was green, with a forest painted on the walls. From what she could see, it had a small girls toys on the floor. But her vision was focused on a calendar that was sitting on her (or whoever this was) lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli realized that she wasn\u2019t really awake. It couldn\u2019t be, because she couldn\u2019t move her head. Like she was watching a movie. This was some sort of dream or something. But\u2026 Was Kyrie collapsing also a dream? Was that real? She had no clue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Ali head a door open. Her head-or not- turned quickly. There in the doorway was a heavy-set man in a suit and tie. But something wasn\u2019t right. His features were blurred out, like this was an edited piece of film. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, darling. What\u2019re you doing?\u201d The man asked in a deep baritone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d Came the reply. It was high-pitched and clear, like a ringing bell. It had come from the person who\u2019s perspective Ali seemed to be seeing. By the sound of it, She guessed it was the little girl who\u2019s room this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou excited for your birthday?\u201d The man said, spying the calendar on the girls lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea.\u201d Ali could feel the girl smile, feel her excitement. It was like she was inside this small girls mind. When the girl looked back at the calendar, Ali studied it a bit more closely. It was dated back seven years ago, and coincidentally, It was only two days behind the current date. Several days ahead of the place where the X\u2019s stopped, Ali saw a circled date, exclaiming \u2018MY BIRTHDAY!\u2019 She was shocked to see that date coincided with her own birthday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girl looked back up at what Ali supposed was her father. \u201cSo, do I get a cake this year?\u201d She asked in her sweetest voice. Ali felt the hope in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled. \u201cNot this year, sweet pea. But don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll have the biggest party yet!\u201d He gave her a beaming smile. \u201cBalloons everywhere, Mr. Mimes, all your friends, and so many presents it\u2019ll take you days to open them!\u201d He exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d Said the bell-voice. But Ali felt her disappointment. \u2018Another year, no cake\u2026\u2019 thought the girl. Poor thing. Dad must be a health freak or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sad, honey.\u201d The man said, sensing the girls thinly hidden disappointment. One of these years, you can have one. \u2018Yea right\u2026\u2019 thought the girl. Ali didn\u2019t know why he wouldn\u2019t get the poor girl  a birthday cake! It certainly looked like they could afford one. The room had countless dolls, toys, play sets, and even a queen-sized bed. And when the girl looked out of her window, the ground seemed floors below them, and she could see a huge, well-manicured lawn and garden. In fact, they looked filthy rich!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d She said disappointedly. The man just came up, gave her a hug, and walked out of the room, shutting the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl got up from her bedside seat. Sure enough, She was very short, like a small child. She picked up a doll from the floor. \u201cIn a few days, I\u2019m gonna be seven.\u201d she said to the doll. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have a fun party, and presents.\u201d She didn\u2019t say it with too much excitement. \u201cBut still. No. Cake.\u201d She sighed, and walked over to the corner of the room, where there was a full-body mirror. She looked into it, and Ali got to see just who\u2019s mind she had been examining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the mirror was small, even for her age, and thin as a twig. Her hair was a light green color, down to her mid-back, framing a almost doll-like face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli gave a mental gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kyrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ali's view started to fade around the edges, until she was plunged into darkness once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA/N.

Back in the mansion. She breathed a sigh of relief. What had just happened? She thought she had a pretty good idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard a moan beneath her, and realized she was crushing Kyrie with her growing girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d She said, rolling off the mysterious moemon. \u201cSorry! Sorry!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I-I-I-It\u2019s f-fine\u2026\u201d Kyrie said weakly. \u201cA-A-Ali\u2026 I t-t-think I just\u2026 r-r-remembered something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, Kyrie. I think you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie looked confused. \u201cH-How would you know?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, Kyrie. I saw it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, dinner was just finishing up for the rest of the occupants of the mansion, and it was full stomachs all around. Fontina sighed and rubbed her bloated stomach. How was she supposed to lose weight with all this amazing food? It seemed that when ever anything was placed in front of her, she had no choice but eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from Fontina, Midnight was looking a little green around the gills. No surprise their. After her cookies, she finished off a whole block of fudge, and on top of that, forced down five large servings of the six cheese lasagna that had just been eaten. Her stomach felt ready to burst at any moment, and she made sure that fact was known throught the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026.. Way to much\u2026 Groaaan\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Fontina was about to remind Midnight of her table manners, a door burst open loudly. Through it rushed Ali, her growing belly and bust bouncing with every step. She sprinted straight for Shera. After a few seconds of gasping for air, she whispered something into the tubby moemons ear. The rest of the table strained to hear what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d Shera said, looking worried. More whispers. \u201cRight now?\u201d Angry whispers. \u201cOk. Lets go.\u201d Shera grunted as she got up, her own full belly making it a bit hard to move. Nevertheless, She managed a slow jog behind Ali as the vertically challenged moemon ran through the open doorway. Shera slammed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room looked confused. What had just happened? A murmur broke out among the remaining diners. Fontina leaned over to Midnight, but she couldn\u2019t get any kind of conversation out of her but, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t care what\u2019s got that stupid pipsqueak all upset! My stomach hurrrrts!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina was worried. Neither Ali or Kyrie had been seen all day, and something might have happened! What if Kyrie was hurt or something?  Fontina couldn\u2019t just sit there wondering. So, with a grunt, she too, rose from her seat. Ignoring the complaints of her overly-filled stomach, she waddled as quickly as she could through the doorway through witch Ali and Shera had gone, ignoring the stares of the others seated around the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. So, I just wanted to say that I happen to believe you\u201d Shera started, after the pair of young moemon struggled to explain what had just happened. Even to Ali, it had sounded ridicules. Like some sort of stupid B-grade movie. So it was with relief that Shera had accepted it so easily.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut also, I have some questions.\u201d Shera continued. \u201cLike, why did both of you see the same thing? Does either of you have any physic type in you? Because something like this definitely suggests some strong physic genes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d Ali replied confidently. \u201cMy family\u2019s fire types, through and through! Well, accept my great-uncle Herbert. He\u2019s a Gravler. But that doesn\u2019t count, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. And I guess we still have no idea what Kyrie is\u2026. Do we?\u201d Shera looked over questioningly at Kyrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-N-No.\u201d She said in her typical whisper-quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea. That memory was kind of useless.\u201d Ali commented. \u201cIt really didn\u2019t help us learn anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera nodded in agreement, and opened her mouth to respond. But before she could, she was interrupted by a quiet voice.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-E-Excuse m-me, I-I think I d-did learn something.\u201d Kyrie mumbled. She blushed when she realized that Shera had been about to speak. \u201cOh, I-I\u2019m s-s-sorry\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no! Go ahead! What did you remember?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie blushed again. \u201cW-well, I j-just noticed, that m-my birthday is soon.\u201d She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli suddenly remembered examining the calendar in the memory. \u201cOh yah! I remember that! Kyrie, did you know that your birthday is the same day as mine? <br>\r\nThe 17th, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera beamed. \u201cKyrie, that\u2019s great! Your starting to remember things! This is a good sign. Can you remember how old your turning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that question threw her. No matter how hard she thought, she couldn\u2019t remember her age. It was even hard to guess. Physically, her small breasts suggested early teens, though her manner was one normally found in younger kids. Of course, nothing seemed quite normal about Kyrie\u2026  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Kyrie shook her head no, sad to have disappointed Ms. Shera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s ok, Kyrie. It\u2019ll all come back to you, I promise.\u201d Shera said comfortingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut for now, I better be heading back to inform everyone that nobody\u2019s died or something.\u201d Looking at Kyrie, she asked, \u201cDo you want me to tell them what happened?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli cut in here. \u201cI think you should. Just not\u2026 Ya know. The weird parts.\u201d Ahe said, referring to the whole \u2019both having the same flashback\u2019 thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera laughed. \u201cWell, I mind as well just keep the whole thing a secret then, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d after suppressing her chuckling, she added, \u201cYah, I get it. Well, I\u2019ll be off then. If either of you feel ill, just find me!\u201d Then she took her leave, closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust seconds after the door was shut, a snarling growl ripped through the still air of the room, making both girls jump. Ali\u2019s mind jumped to wild beasts, monsters, that creepy shadow in her room that had haunted her younger selves dreams. But no. It was Kyries stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing, more so at Kyries expression of absolute, the-world-is-ending horror and embarrassment at her empty belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Oh gosh! Oh, Kyrie! I\u2019m so sorry! It\u2019s just.. Oh man\u2026\u201d She struggled out, fighting tears. Kyrie\u2019s face was redder than a tomato. \u201cOh, man, sorry, sorry\u2026 Lets go get us some dinner\u2026\u201d She said, fighting giggles the whole time. She grabbed the suddenly hungry moemons hand, and lead her out of the room in search of food\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA/N: Really don't like this one. Probably because NOTHING HAPPENS.  *facepalm* <br>\r\nWell, we learn of a shared birthday some days away... And I finally set it up for some eating... Guess that counts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ali had her laughter quite under control by the time she and Kyrie entered into the now-deserted dining room. The two hungry girls had hoped to find some dinner left, but no such luck. So Ali decided to make for the kitchen, where there was sure to be some cookies or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were. A new batch, just out of the oven, in fact. But there was also Midnight, apparently in some sort of food induced half-coma, telling Wester her life story. To his credit, he was nodding in all the right places.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and that stupid BITCH Hannah was making out with him in the back hall! Can you *urp* BELIEVE it?\u201d Midnight lamented to Wester, who was just placing another tray of cookies onto the counter. Midnight took one of the warm treats and stuffed it in her mouth. The portly chef just sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Wester noticed Ali and Kyrie standing in the doorway. He looked at them with eyes practically screaming, \u2018save me.\u2019 Ali just nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry to interrupt your interesting story, Midnight, but I must, uh, use the restroom.\u201d The kind chef said hastily, practically running out of the kitchen. On his way out, he whispered a subtle \u2018thanks\u2019 to Ali before dashing off to nowhere in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli rolled her eyes. Obviously, the poor chef had not been prepared for one of Midnight\u2019s world famous pity parties. And by the looks of it, this one was the sweet 16 of them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight was lying on the countertop, and by the looks of her hugely bloated belly, she had started snacking after dinner. She had chocolate smeared all over her face, and was flying in the sky on a sugar-buzz high. (Lol that rhymed :3) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a buzz, in fact, that she didn\u2019t seem to remember her painfully full stomach. Ali and Kyrie could only watch in amazement as the curvy moemon munched on cookies, forcing them into her huge orb of a belly. Well, that is, until Midnight noticed the pair staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d She yelled, wincing slightly as she quickly hopped off her perch on the counter and onto the floor. \u201cWhat the HELL are you two *urp* doing here?!?!?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL, we had just come down to get something to eat, but all we found was your fat ass eating all the cookies!\u201d Ali said in a hostile tone, egging Midnight on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you little..!\u201d Midnight growled menacingly, trying as hard as possible to ignore her painful belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing probably (Ok, ok, definitely.) would have turned into a fight if Kyrie hadn\u2019t been there. But she was. So, for her sake, Ali stopped the taunting just in time. (But made sure to full advantage of Midnights vulnerable circumstances, none the less.) <br>\r\nIn the end, all that came out of it was Midnight storming out of the kitchen, rubbing her stuffed orb gently, grumbling something about stupid gnomes. Just as she turned into a different hallway, Wester appeared in a flash, apparently waiting for the dark moemon to leave his kitchen the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you, thank you!\u201d He said to Ali and Kyrie. \u201cMidnight is a nice girl, but can be a bit\u2026 Well\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnobbish? Selfish? Bitchy? Bratty?\u201d Ali offered helpfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you could put it that way.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn return for saving the rest of his fresh cookies from the mouth of Midnight, (Who surely would have regretted them anyways) the chef started reheating the leftovers from the nights dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, there never seems to be as many leftovers these days.\u201d He said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. We just want a little something to hold us over.\u201d Said Ali, who helped herself to a cookie. What she really wanted right now was a feast, but apparently, that would have to wait\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*After a (rather enormous) makeshift dinner* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out the pair didn\u2019t have to wait after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 Walter, how many leftovers did you used to have? Cause\u2019 if this is less than your used to, I\u2019m scared to think of what you usually have\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli and Kyrie both lay down on the countertop, just as Midnight had done not to long ago. Also like Midnight, both were nursing large, food-stuffed bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I stretched the truth just a bit on that one. Leftovers don\u2019t usually get eaten around here anyways, so I didn\u2019t want to have this sitting in the fridge to go bad\u2026\u201d The chef replied. \u201cPlus, you probably would be just fine if you hadn\u2019t ate the rest of my cookies.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli rolled her eyes. \u201cWalter, your so funny sometimes.\u201d With a huff, Ali pulled herself into a sitting position on the countertop, her bloated stomach jutting out a bit. \u201cWell, I guess me and Kyrie here should sleep this off. Whacha say, Kyrie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhg... Uh, I-I-I mean, s-sure.\u201d The girl said with a blush. Her own belly was bloated outward in a way that looked almost unnatural on her otherwise wraith-like figure. With a struggle, she got herself to her feet, and the stuffed pair headed off to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Fontina was having some food problems of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had checked everywhere for Kyrie and Ali, hoping to see if they were alright. Everywhere! At first, she checked the infirmary. Nope. The trio\u2018s room. Notta. Kyries room. Zilch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she came to the Staff room, where she found someone. Just not Ali or Kyrie. She found Ember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had politely taken a donut from her, just to get her out of her hair. But no. She offered another. And another! Fontinas still full belly didn\u2019t approve one bit. But when Ember had started crying that Ali and Kyrie, her \u2019eating friends\u2019 had left her, and how she needed a new friend to play with, Fontina got suspicious and tried to take her leave. No such luck for our growing beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber had trapped her under her impressive girth just as she had Ali earlier in the day, and started feeding Fontana\u2019s already stuffed gut a steady stream of fatty pastries. Fontina was powerless against this huge girl, and accepted her fate. Death by pastry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a full hour, about the time when Ali and Kyrie were finishing up there own huge meals, Ember finally said, \u201cThere. That should hold you over for the night.\u201d And left her groaning companion to her pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina just couldn\u2019t find the strength or willpower to move herself from that couch. After such a large dinner, then this, her stomach truly hated her right now. It moaned at groaned at every movement, bulging out to proportions that Fontina would have thought impossible for an average stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, it was in this state of pain that Fontina drifted into a state of half sleep, half food-coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA/N. Finally, some eating! Becha thought that this was turning into some novel, right? :P <br>\r\nActual not to pleased with this, spent too much time on what didn't matter, then barley spent any time on the actual part we all know and love. :-q<br>\r\nAh, well.

Lets look back on them, shall we? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, everybody has been happy. Settled into a routine. Wake, breakfast, work, snack, work, lunch, work, snack, work, dinner. Then another snack. Maybe another? Sure, why not. One more? Ug, no, can\u2019t, too full. Fine then. Just one more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut beneath the outer cover, life was a little stressful. The first reason is directly derived from the admittedly food heavy routine above. The girls weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just couldn\u2019t seem to get there eating under control. They always happened upon the kitchen or break room a few times a day, and when they did, they just couldn\u2019t resist a bite or two\u2026 Or three. And so their weights continued to rise. Ali\u2019s \u2018assets\u2019 increased in size, though unfortunately they were outpaced by her slowly growing belly. Fontina was stressed, as her own curves continued to be blown up by another 10 lbs. It was Midnight who was suffering the worst, however, thanks to her nightly self-pity binges. She was already well on her way to growing out of her uniform, much to Sheras chagrin. <br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s growing out of those things faster than I can sew them\u2026\u201d She had said, shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven petit little Kyrie had put on some weight. Not a shocking amount, but enough that others were noticing the difference. Her wasp-waist had grown to, well, normal proportions, while her tiny breast had grown slightly. Her flat belly had grown softer, and there a bit of a bulge in her tight dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that brings us to another reason for stress: Kyrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Kyrie was a problem. On the contrary, everybody loved her, even Midnight. It was just impossible to resist the charm of the small, shy moemon. No, Kyrie wasn\u2019t a problem, but her past was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough out the week, Kyrie continued to have her strange little \u2018flashbacks.\u2019 Several times a day, she would collapse on the floor, bringing everyone with her into a strange past world. (This was quite a shock at dinner, when half of the tables occupants had suddenly collapsed. Took quite a bit of \u2018splainin to get that worked out.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough these strange glimpses into the past, a picture was slowly revealed. But what it was turning out to be wasn\u2019t too pretty. From what they could tell, the mansion of her past was huge, five stories high, and much more elegant then the one they were in. It was home to dozens of moemon of all ages, from young children to elderly seniors. They couldn\u2019t figure it out. Not an orphanage, not a rest home. What was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got weirder when they discovered some sort of ranking system. In conversations, people always mentioned how \u2018I\u2019m just a D\u2019 or \u2018She got moved up to B.\u2019 They realized that each floor had a designated letter, A being the highest. And that\u2019s what Kyrie was. everybody treated her with respect and envy, even fellow \u201cA\u2019s\u201d But that was basely the extent of their knowledge. But all of them felt sure that whatever was going on in Kyrie\u2019s past wasn\u2019t very good\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that rushed description of the past week, we catch up with reality\u2026<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Celia felt was the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOuch! Wow, that was bad\u2026\u201d The girl said, getting up from the ground, rubbing her tender bottom.  \u201cWell, at least I made it ok\u2026 I think.\u201d She mumbled, looking herself over, making sure there were no deformities, no missing limbs. Looking at her medium breasts and partially-developed hips, she determined that she was about the right age\u2026 Maybe a bit older. But nothing too bad. It definitely could have been worse, with the rush she had been in. Kyrie should still be able to recognize her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie! She suddenly remembered why she was here, the reason for her hastened escape. What the hell was that girl doing? Hadn\u2019t she given her detailed instructions? Made it ABSOLUTELY clear that said instructions were freakin\u2019  IMPORTANT?!?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, she had arrived back to where she had come from to find everything all wrong. She had fallen right into that beasts grasp, and had hardly gotten out of there alive. What the hell was that girl thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuming, the green-haired moemon marched through the woods, trying to find an opening in the canvas of green above her. She couldn\u2019t keep angry for long in her beloved forest, though, and soon began to think clearly. What could have happened? Had Kyrie just gotten sidetracked? Or something bad, like hurt or captured by that freak again? She began to worry. That wouldn\u2019t do at all\u2026 And how was she supposed to find Kyrie anyway? It had been what, a week? That\u2019s what she had been aiming for, but she didn\u2019t know exactly. Well, expecting it had been a week sense she left, Kyrie could be miles and miles ahead by now\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that question was answered the minute she stumbled onto a small clearing in the canopy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, man, Kyrie. What did I tell you about controlling your powers?\u201d She mumbled to herself. Then she took off at unnatural speed toward the towering storm cloud just a mile away\u2026   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA/N: Ah, finally. A chapter I kinda like. I'm not to sure about the first part, but the second part, the part none of you understand, I like that part. No, I didn't forget to write something. Your supposed to be confused. :P<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, I wanted to say that hopefully, I'll be adding more consistently now.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u2018This has got to be it.\u2019 Celia thought to herself, standing in the heavy rain outside of the building. She had located the very center of the storm, which happened to be right on top of this place. But she had to be sure. Kneeling down and closing her eyes, she concentrated, searching, psychologically feeling the mansion for the presence of sentient minds. It was hard, what with the heavy rain pounding around her, interrupting her concentration, but she quickly found what she was looking for. There were twelve moemon, twelve pinpricks of light in her consciousness. (I think there are twelve characters\u2026 Don\u2019t quote me on it though.) Three were asleep, their lights dimmer, and one of them, the brightest, blue one, was Kyrie. It had to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She opened her eyes and stood up. How to do this? It all depended. Was Kyrie being held captive? Or was she just staying for the night? Only the fist option made cense to Celia. Kyrie should be miles away by now. But she wasn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she wasn\u2019t going to go breaking into private property without knowing for sure what was up. So she decided to go the old fashioned way, also known as the doorbell. If the place happened to be crawling with evil devils or something of the sort, she was sure she could take care of herself. If it wasn\u2019t, well, all the better for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, It was that time of day again. The time between work and dinner. That annoying 30 minutes at the mansion when you had nothing to do, and you were hungry. But you can\u2019t eat, right? Dinners just around the corner. So you just sit there and suffer. Or, ya know. Go to the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, coincidentally, is where we find our growing girls at the present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, Kyrie. That\u2019s like, your fourth one! Save some room for dinner!\u201d Ali, ever the hypocrite, said, her own mouth full with the last bite of her own fifth donut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, it was Kyries fifth too. But she didn\u2019t mention that, she just set the donut down gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAli, you\u2019ve had what? Like, twenty? Kyrie, pick that donut back up. You need some meat on you, anyway!\u201d Midnight shot challengingly, caring more about peeving Ali than about  whether Kyries BMI was healthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie, of course, obediently picked the pastry back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli looked back at Midnight, sensing her challenge. \u201cI\u2019ve had two, for your information, and Kyrie is perfectly healthy. Kyrie, calories kill. You don\u2019t want anything to do with them. Put the donut down.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrie glanced hungrily at the treat, but promptly complied.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCmon, stop it. Or you\u2019re gonna give Kyrie a heart attack.\u201d Fontina said, annoyed at her friends. Not that they even acknowledged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Midnight could unleash her snappy comeback to Ali (Something along the lines of, \u2018carbs are your friends\u2019) There was an obnoxiously loud series of dings and dongs, elaborately interweaved into a half minute song. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Ali blurted  \u201c\u2026 What the heck was THAT?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer her question, Shera poked her head to the room. \u201cHey girls, dinners ready. You should come downstairs. Oh, and if your wondering, that was the doorbell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. What kind of doorbell is that?\u201d Ali asked. Midnight just shrugged, unable to thing of a reason for such an obnoxious doorbell. The three got up, and Midnight and Ali left the room behind Shera. Kyrie lagged behind a bit. Looking around fugitively, she quickly stuffed that last donut into her mouth before following her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four some worked their way through the mansion like pros, as they had finally gotten the feel for the confusing hallways. They reached the first floor just in time to see Shera letting the person who had rung the doorbell into the house. Despite their rush to get food, they stopped to see whoever it was. It was a girl, first off. She appeared to be a young traveler, like themselves, seeking shelter from this freak storm. She had long, light green hair that almost reached her waist, moderate sized breasts, and was of average height. She wore a short sleeved shirt, which started out green at her shoulders and faded to white at the bottom, and a pair of blue jeans. She had a round face and toned muscles you could see beneath her soaking-wet shirt. But what really stood out about her was her piercing light blue eyes, which were currently shifting from side to side, as if looking for something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Shera noticed the girls standing there. \u201cOh, girls! I\u2019d like you to meet Celia. She got trapped in this weather too, so she\u2019ll be staying till\u2019 it passes by. Celia, this is Ali, Fontina, Midnight, and-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYRIE!\u201d Celia shouted. Much to everyone\u2019s shock, she ran up to the young moemon and gave her a joyful hug. \u201cKyrie! Gosh, dang it, I was so frikkin worried!\u201d Celia said, letting her go. \u201cWhat have you been doing? I thought I told you\u2026 Hey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimid little Kyrie had not been able to handle this treatment, and was currently hiding behind Fontina, her head just peeking out to look at this weird newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelia was confused. What was wrong with Kyrie? Did she not recognize her? No, that couldn\u2019t be it. But then why\u2026? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by a hand on her shoulder. Whipping her head around, she saw it was Shera. \u201cCilia\u2026 Do you know Kyrie?\u201d Cilia hesitated, then nodded. These people seemed nice enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThan I think we need to have a little discussion.\u201d Turning to the girls, she said, \u201cHey, you girls go to dinner. We\u2019ll meet you there in a few minutes.\u201d The girls, stunned from whatever had just happened, nodded and walked off. Turning to Celia, Shera sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you know Kyrie, whether you\u2019re her friend, or her cousin, or what. But I\u2019m praying you\u2019ve got some answers, cause things are getting weirder by the second with that girl.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can tell me everything. I\u2019ll guarantee I\u2019ve seen weirder from her.\u201d Celia responded.  And then Shera told her tale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Kyrie knows nothing.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept her name and what she knows from her flashbacks, no. Nothing at all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose flashbacks\u2026 There strange. She\u2019s not a phycic type.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what type she is?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Are you going to tell me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShera sighed. She had told this girl everything that had happened with Kyrie, everything she knew, anyways. Yet every time Shera asked something of Celia, the answer was \u2018Not now.\u2019 This girl with the piercing eyes was nearly as much of a mystery as Kyrie was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo. Are you going to tell me anything about her past? You seem to know a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I know a lot. Almost everything, I would think. But you don\u2019t need to know anything yet. Not now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelia had to admit, Shera was kind, Kyries friends were trustworthy, and she had been told the truth. But her knowing of Kyries past could do only harm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShera. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t tell you anything, and I\u2019m sorry if I sound disrespectful. I mean, I\u2019m only 17. (at least, that was her best estimation. She really had no clue.) But I\u2019m going to stick around her for a while. This whole thing has thrown a wrench in my plans\u2026 I\u2019m going to have to keep Kyrie here until she recovers some. Would you be willing to let me do that?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can, dear. Be our guest. I understand if you don\u2019t feel at the liberty to tell anything.\u201d 17? Shera was thinking. The girl carries herself like an adult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Shera. Now, did you say something about dinner\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, she hadn\u2019t, but whatever. \u201cYa. We better get there before its gone! C\u2019mon, I\u2019ll show you the way!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the pair headed toward the dining room. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA/N: Ok, these authors notes have got to stop. Riiiiiiight.... Now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She glared at the butterball moemon, who was conveniently not looking at her. Ali got the picture. Shut up or be stuffed. She didn't like it, but she didn't have a choice. She'd get back at the vulpix girl later....she just had to grin and bear it. Still pinning Ali's legs, Ember shifted back enough that she could reach down to Ali's now nearly spherical belly. It was quite a sight to see her try to reach in like that, as her fat arms mashed against her breasts, and her belly wouldn't let her bend too far. Still, she managed. Ali closed her eyes tight, trying to prepare herself for the incoming pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pain never came. Ali waited, but no, nothing. In fact, she was starting to feel less sore. One eye peeked open. There Ember sat, totally fixated on Ali's belly. Ali glanced down at herself. Yes, those were Ember's fingers on her belly. She watched them knead her taut flesh. But it seemed unreal. That should've hurt, Ali told herself. So why the hell did it feel....nice?! Yes, it was actually a good feeling. It was like Ember was helping her belly digest her food. Kneading it, packing it down, taking the work off of Ali's overtaxed muscles. And the feeling on her skin. Ali hadn't noticed it at first, but a kind of ticklish sensation emanated from wherever Ember touched. Only, instead of making her want to squirm like an actual tickle would, this was a pleasant, almost numbing sensation that sent waves of pleasure through the (mostly) small girl. Before she knew it, Ember was totally relaxed, almost dazed, and despite herself let out a pleased sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a lot to get a belly ready for a super-duper Ember special massage.\" Ember said with a giggle and a grin. Ali blushed, immediately hating herself for taking pleasure in anything having to do with this perverted fattie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The skin has to be stretched just right, and it's easier on little bellies.\" Ember said, sounding both like a bimbo and an expert. Ali could only wonder. Ember must have fat down to an art form. That would explain this, as well as how her weight never seemed to bother herself. Ali relaxed again. She couldn't help herself. If she closed her eyes, she could imagine it was a hunky charizard moemon or such massaging her. Except when Ember giggled occasionally. Ali learned to ignore those, or pretend it was the sultry masseuse-assistant to her hunky pleasurer. Ali ended up almost asleep, blissful and stuffed. <i>This is the life....</i> ran through her head, without her being aware of just what she had thought.</span></div></div>",

They would have to clean the entire mansion every day, all day in back breaking labor from top to bottom until they had enough money to pay off breaking the jewel encrusted vase that the master of the mansion adored. Midnight and Ali felt utterly guilty for what they had gotten themselves into, as well as Fontina who woed over something she didn't even cause. Getting closer to the kitchen, the three continued to ponder the thoughts in their heads of what their lives were going to turn into. They would no longer have their normal everyday lives as the girls they used to be. Judging by the priceless and uncalculable amount of money the vase cost, they would probably be permanent working maids and continue to clean for the rest of their lives, being dressed in uniform and never going out for anything but cleaning supplies and clothes every day as well. Fontina worried for an extra reason, she wondered if her stay at this mansion would add to her current gain, which didn't seem to be under control since she arrived at the mansion. She poked a finger into her now softer stomach, which seemed to sink into her pudgier middle a bit more, showing a bit of a inward pull through her shirt as she poked it. Her belly peeked slightly in between her pants and shirt but it was nothing too noticable. all of a sudden a ravenous hunger hit Fontina as she clutched her stomach and squeezed her middle. \"I can't still be hungry after that binge, can I \" said the water Moemon as she continued down the halls, energized by her newfound hunger to move a bit faster now. It wasn't just Fontina that was overcome by this feeling but Midnight and Ali also felt the strange sense of emptiness as well.Both held their stomachs in question and hunger. \"What the!!!\" I could've sworn I just ate. My belly's got the plush to show it\" said Midnight, squeezing her slight pudge. Ali's reaction was the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Throughout the ages, many ancient stories floated around the Sinnoh region \u2013 The mysterious trio of the lakes, the titan who could move continents with ease, and even the quarreling siblings of time and space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were rumors of lost civilizations who\u2019s remains were hidden amongst the lands of Sinnoh\u2026 Including the northeastern island, which now-a-days was a tropical hotspot for travelers known to many teams as the Battle Zone, which, like the name suggest, was a battling team\u2019s paradise if they wished to train themselves. But the island itself was home to more than just battle hungry moemon, rather there were also several other locations that would entice visitors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch as the Resort Area which was a small oasis that acted as a tropical paradise for moemon to go relax and enjoy themselves. There was also Stark Mountain, an active volcano that seems to have several active parts to it, as well as home to a number of mysteries\u2026 One such mystery was of that of an ancient tribe of moemon that once thrived on the island before modernization took over and made them disappear \u2013 taking all of the culture, history and treasures they were said to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019re climbing this steaming rock!\u201d Midnight laughed as she closed the book she held and immediately tossed it over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight yelp echoed through the air followed by a slightly loud thump, however, the attractive, mocha skinned Mightyena girl only had eyes for the large mountain that was in front of her. After a week of preparation, she and her team were ready for this task \u2013 The task to find that tribe\u2019s ancient treasure and make it big and rich!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Midnight definitely showed that she was ready, she was dressed in her usual clothes \u2013 A silver tanktop and bluejean shorts that showed off her dynamite figure (which definitely caught the attention of a few cute moemon guys while the girls were on their way to mountain base), but she was also dressed in a black leather vest, climbing boots and had a sensibly sized backpack strapped over her shoulders, which had her long dark hair resting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mutt! Watch where you\u2019re throwing books!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight\u2019s look of determination faded into anger as she spun around to leer at the owner of that comment \u2013 One little Quilava moemon named Alison: A.K.A. Ali. Compared to Midnight, Ali looked like a kid (Which was sad since she was actually only about one year younger than the Mightyena girl), with short height, a petite (if not trim) body figure, fiery red hair with several streaks of yellow in it and sun-kissed creamy skin that made her look even cuter. Like Midnight, Ali was dressed for the trip up the mountain (although, it was under protest).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike her exuberant teammate, Ali had opted to dress in a red vest that she zipped up all the way that was adorned with black material on the back and a pair of black shorts that went down to her knees. She also had a sidebag that was slung around her slim torso, \u201cYou could\u2019ve hit Fonty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe caught it, so what\u2019s your beef, ya little ember?\u201d Midnight growled back as she placed her hands on her toned hips \u2013 One thing about Midnight when it concerned with the younger Quilava girl was that the Mightyena moemon loved to rub her curves in Ali\u2019s face (not literally of course, well, save for that one time they were sleeping in a tent when it was raining, but that was an incident that wouldn\u2019t leave the tent at all). And every time that Midnight did, it only made the younger moemon even more hot under the collar than she usually was \u2013 And since she was a fire type, that was made even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy beef?\u201d Ali hissed back as the hairs on the back of her head began to stand on end. \u201cMy beef is that we were on vacation! We all agreed to go to the resort area for a couple of weeks, and not even two days after we get there, you drag us on this stupid little excursion of yours for a treasure that not might exist! I knew seeing you with a book in your hands was only a recipe for disaster! The only book I see you with was one that had a naked Houndoom guy on it and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlah, blah, blah,\u201d Midnight spat back as she placed a finger on Ali\u2019s forehead and pushed the smaller moemon back slightly. \u201cYou using smokescreen there runt? Cause all I see is smoke pouring outta your flapping lips!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Stop it! Please, we\u2019re all friends here, r-right?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat yelp garnered the attention of the two quarreling moemon to the right to see the third member of their team \u2013 The creamy skin, curvy and beautiful Vaporeon girl known to the world as Fontina, with her dark blue hair glistening with sweat, it clung to the back of her neck and shoulders and her face was flushed underneath her glasses. Like her friends, she too was dressed for the weather and for the hike (much to her chagrin) \u2013 Wearing a blue sleeveless shirt that hugged the melons that she was smuggling underneath it and slipped up her body to reveal a small line of creamy white flesh that popped out of her dark blue shorts (that cut off about mid-thigh, something she wasn\u2019t proud of since it showed off her shapely legs and behind). In her hands was the very same book that Midnight had tossed over her shoulder nary a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I-I think this is a f-fun idea,\u201d Fontina admitted with a meek smile on her face. \u201cAll we\u2019ve been doing s-since we got here was lounging about, a-and this would be good to have a little exercise to our regiment. B-Besides, its only one day A-Ali, and w-when we get back to the resort, how about we get some of those Rage Candy Bars that vendor was selling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli puffed out her cheeks as she crossed her arms\u2026 \u201c<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">I want six of them\u2026\u201d</font></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a problem with that,\u201d Fontina replied with a smile on her face as she placed the book she had in the backpack she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful there runt, you don\u2019t wanna cram too many of those bars in your mouth,\u201d Midnight snickered loudly. \u201cOtherwise you might just get one single curve instead of two\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou flea ridden mongrel!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlat kindle rat!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina sighed loudly as she walked past her two quarreling friends, placing her hand on her stomach \u2013 This was supposed to be just a nice jog to make sure that she wouldn\u2019t gain too much weight while on this vacation. She had already grown out of most of her bras for the two mounds that she tightly clad in the bra she was wearing right now, and even her panties were starting to pinch into her soft thigh flesh\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut\u2026 Fontina shook her head and looked ahead at Stark Mountain \u2013 she\u2019d definitely be able to melt off any pounds while on a hike on this <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n///////</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there a few options that need to be explained \u2013 And they\u2019re too detailed to put in the option boxes, so here we go\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Option 1)</span> After a long hike, the trio come across a large hot spring, and decide to chill there for a little while to relax before they head back down. However, when they get there, they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re trespassing on sacred ground \u2013 And a tribal, yet chubby, Marrill girl knocks them out by singing and drags them to an ancient, subterranean village that\u2019s filled with several chubby water-type moemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">Option 2)</span> While trekking through the more forested side of the mountain, one of the group falls through a hole in the ground, followed by the other two because the ground gives way. While knocked out, the three are found by a kindly, tribal Bellossom moemon who brings them to her subterranean village to nurse them back to health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Option 3)</span> Feel free to come up with something yourself. Heck, you can go with a lost tribe of fire moemon.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After hours of climbing up the treacherous mountainside it was to be expected that, even though our team of heroines was nothing if not persistent, Midnight, Ali, and poor Fontina were beyond exhausted; barely cognitive. In fact, to keep their minds busy, Midnight and Ali spent the latter half of their trek upwards coming up with a new word just to express how tired they were. So far after three hours of climbing, bickering, and complaining, the best they had come up with was \"tirexhaustified\"; but that could have been the sleep deprivation getting to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in all actuality, they had long mentally abandoned their bodies and simply passed through with the motions that were handed to them, relying on instinct entirely. It had gotten them far enough, until one of them bothered to question just why it was they were climbing anymore. Then a long period of depression ensued as well as homicidal thoughts towards the wellbeing of their self-proclaimed leader- climbing this stupid rock being her idea in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Midnight hadn't exactly bargained for just how hot things were going to get or just how that would affect their team. Sure, she'd been through victory road with Ali and the Fontster before (it got kinda steamy in there) but at least there was a nice underground lake. Here was just elevation and multiple climaxes of heat. Had she known that she would be leading her team to a death-pit of... death... then she probably wouldn't have even bothered climbing this stupid volcano. Probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPossibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoint being, it was hot and nobody was having any fun anymore. Not that there was much fun to have been having at the start, but they were having a lot less fun now that they were all dehydrated and sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight...\" Ali wheezed as she coughed up some flem mixed with the heavy soot in the air, \"I want you to know... that I hate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Midnight barked from too far ahead, having headed up as a sort of scout to make sure the footing was okay for the vertically challenged Ali and the generously deep dimensions of Fontina. Couldn't have the fiesty little Quilava moemon unable to reach <i>or</i> the dangerously busty Vaporeon bouncing off the mountain, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that I hate you!!\" Ali yelled louder over the high winds, \"I wish I'd never met you, because then we wouldn't be trapped on this stupid mountain- we're gonna die up here if we don't find a way down!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison, you don't mean that!\" Fontina yelled from underneath the smaller girl, clinging desperately to a ledge so as not to be blown away, \"If something happens up here then--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean it, Fonty!!\" Ali barked back, \"She needs to hear it, how I finally feel!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good couple of yards above Ali in altitude, the exchange between her two team mates went entirely ignored by her. The high winds and even higher temperatures had made things unbearable enough. In the distance, she could faintly hear the sounds of the Earth churning magma from the few active parts of the Volcano. She squinted her dark eyes in pain, her own sweat dripping from the tip of her dark chocolate brow and rolling right into her eyes. Oh what she'd give to be on a beach right now, surrounded by chocolate and money...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut dreaming wasn't going to get any closer to the top of this mountain. She persevered. If she was weak then she would fall, never getting any closer to her dreams of wealth and glory. She would never be able to rub it into her stupid family's face that she wasn't just another girl- someone special! And if she looked weak here, how would the other girls carry on without her...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mightyena girl gave a mighty grunt as she heaved her weight upwards and grabbed at a piece of rock. Her nails, sharp and chiseled resembling claws, dug into the surface. She grinned to herself; as soon as she got her friends to a safe place with enough room to spread out, they would all take a break and call it a day. She could relax and take a nap, of course that would only come after--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>KACHICK!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight!!\" Ali hollered at the top of her lungs as the Mightyena woman clutched blindly to the piece of rock in her hands, \"I want you to know that I hate you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the dark moemon slowly peeled from the side of the mountain like an old sticker. Her body leaned backwards at a fourty-five, then ninety degree angle before coming off of the surface completely, falling head first to the bottom of Stark Mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight!!\" Fontina shouted as she herself began to lean over, searching desperately for her companion, who was slowly falling out of sight beneath the heavy soot. \"Ali, you've got to do something!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Ohmigod...\" Ali shook, feeling her fingers tremble beneath her own weight as she watched Midnight fall to her imminent death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ali!!\" Fontina shouted again, \"We're in a volcano, shouldn't you be able to do <i>something</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... I-I can't!\" Ali whimpered beneath the sound of ruptured geysers, \"Oh God... Oh God...the last thing I told her was... was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFontina began her descent downwards, stepping down the many rocks she had climbed today in hopes of reaching her fallen friend. \"W-We've got to get down there!\" Fontina stammered, \"Sh-She'll hit that alcove we passed pretty hard, but she might still make it! A-Ali, we've got to--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CLI-CHICK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her footing was lost and Fontina slipped, saved only by her fearfully tight grasp on the mountainside. Her big blue eyes shrank down to mere dots in her fear, sweaty azure hair seeming to weigh a thousand pounds by itself. She flexed her pitiful muscles, only further atrophied by her relaxing week at the Resort Area. She had lost her footing, and had no way of pulling herself back up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ali!!\" she squeaked, \"Y-You've got to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Quilava moemon's head slunk downwards, only to see one of her very best friends hanging on to an inch of her life by, literally, an inch of skin. Her will shriveled and died as she lifted out a feeble hand, nursing onto the mountainside like a small child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I've got you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Fontina's weight was too much for the younger girl- as soon as she grabbed hold of Ali's sweaty hand, the voluptuous girl sent herself as well as her friend tumbling down towards Midnight. They hollered and screamed, fearful of what fate await them in the chilly grip of death...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it was cold.</span></div></div>",

She felt light, as if there was nothing to weigh her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this death? Was there nothing to it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Ali was a little bit disappointed \u2013 She half expected to see a bunch of clouds and maybe a few rare moemon that would lead her into her eternal paradise\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, there was something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was burning\u2026 Ali could smell it, she would know that smell a mile away (she was a fire type after all). There was also a smell that would be comparable to that of hot coals. So, if this wasn\u2019t heaven, and there was fire and the smell of burning rocks lofting around. \u2018Oh crap\u2026 Am I r-really down there? I-I know I said I hated Midnight, and I know I got in fights with her, b-b-but, I shouldn\u2019t have been sent to hell! That\u2019s just not fair!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli shifted, gulping loudly at the realization of her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 y! She\u2019s\u2026 ng\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli heard a voice \u2013 It was unfamiliar, but it was a warm and childish voice, but it certainly didn\u2019t seem to belong to a devil that would torture her for life. Ali tried to think, she tried to figure out what was going on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that something cold was laid atop of her forehead, making her eyes widen and she yelped out. \u201cCOLD!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Ali\u2019s eyes closed up again, the light was almost so blinding and her brow was soaking wet with what she assumed was cold water. After a few seconds, Ali reopened her eyes to see her situation \u2013 Wherever she was, it certainly wasn\u2019t any sort of building she was accustomed to. The walls were made of some sort of dried clay and rocks that had torches attached to the wall that was used to light the room. Ali realized she was resting atop of what appeared to be a number of soft leaves and a pelt of some sort of pokemon hide that was incredibly soft to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne other thing that she noticed about herself was that save for a few bandages and rainbow colored feathers wrapped around her body, the young Quilava girl was practically only in her birthday suit. Immediately, Ali\u2019s face went red when she realized this little fact and she brought up her arms to wrap around her almost exposed chest \u2013 Only to flinch at the pain that erupted around her ribs. \u201cURK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! N-No! D-Don\u2019t do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli blinked a few times when a pair of petite hands wrapped around her arms and gently pulled them away from her chest \u2013 Ali followed the arms to see that they belonged to a young (roughly around her age, give or take a year) girl with bronze colored skin and short black hair that had the tops of her hair held up with a makeshift clip to make a pair of big strands stick up from her head (they kinda resembled animal ears). The girl herself was roughly around Ali\u2019s height, and was dressed in a black animal skin bikini top and matching furred skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that Ali noted was the girl was rather chubby \u2013 nothing too major, but she had a noticeable pudge to her waist, her thighs were thick, her bulging breasts were straining the bikini top she had, and her face had a cute curve to it. She also had yellow and black face paint on her cherubic face, adding an additional level of cuteness to it \u2013 If Ali had to guess, this was a Tepig Moemon, which was weird since she was sure that Tepig girls were native only to the Unnova region\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf y-you move t-too m-m-much,\u201d The Tepig girl struggled to say (her English could use some work). \u201cY-Your wounds w-will get w-w-worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the Tepig girl began to push Ali back down to the bed, trying to get the Quilava girl to rest. Ali had so many questions \u2013 Who was this girl? Where was she? What happened to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli\u2019s eyes nearly bugged out of her skull. That\u2019s right! Where was Fontina and Midnight?!? Ali\u2019s breathing began to grow rapid as she tried to process what happened in her head, but she calmed down slightly when the Tepig girl griped her hand, \u201cD-Don\u2019t worry! Y-You\u2019re safe\u2026 A-And so are your f-f-friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tepig girl shifted to the left slightly and Ali turned her head to see that there were a couple of other makeshift beds in the room with her \u2013 And resting on the beds was none other than her friends! Albeit, they were in the same condition that Ali was in \u2013 Knocked out but breathing, alive, but nearly naked (save for the weird rainbow colored feathers and bandages which made Ali\u2019s face grow even redder). Her two friends seemed to just snore lightly as Ali breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-We treated y-your wounds a-a-as soon as p-possible,\u201d The Tepig girl stated, which garnered Ali\u2019s attention once more. \u201cW-With some r-r-rest, you three s-s-should be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Ali breathed a sigh of relief and smiled \u2013 But then that smile slowly melted away as many questions appeared in her head and she finally spoke. \u201cWhere\u2026 What\u2026 Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tepig girl\u2019s face blushed slightly as she bowed her head towards Ali, \u201cAh-Ah! I\u2019m s-s-sorry! I\u2026 I f-f-f-forgot to introduce m-myself! I\u2026 I am Lin-Hua of the Stark Tribe! I\u2026 I\u2026 I was the one to f-find y-you and y-your f-friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Lin-Hua turned away from Ali with her hands on her cheeks and gushed out, \u201cO-Oh! T-T-That was s-s-so embarrassing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018\u2026 How was that embarrassing?</i>\u2019 Ali thought as she was about to open up her mouth to say something\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be interrupted by a loud growling sound, and her face turned as red as a tomato \u2013 It was her stomach. It felt as if Ali was starving \u2013 She didn\u2019t know how long she was out, but she was definitely hungry\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 I-I have some f-f-food here,\u201d Lin-Hua stated as she spun around to reveal a wooden tray that had been loaded down with fruits, veggies, and even some meat on the bone. \u201cI\u2026 I wasn\u2019t s-s-sure when y-you three would w-w-wake up, s-so I\u2019ve been bringing a l-lot of food to g-g-give you all when y-you all woke up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a lot of food\u2026 But considering how hungry she was\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The foreign language of tongues Ali couldn't quite comprehend passed over her in waves as the newest occupant of the room continued barking at her savior. She sighed weakly as her vision began to blur, catching herself with an outstretched arm to the ground. The Quilava girl tottered slightly as she balanced, using her fingers as base, her frail body swinging to and 'fro as she managed to keep herself from blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Lin Hua!&gt;\" it shouted again, now a tan blob in Ali's eyes as she struggled to keep visual composure, \"&lt;Are you even listening to me?!&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Yes! I mean, yes I am Priestess...&gt;\" came the blur that was Ali's handmaiden, \"&lt;B-But you see, one of the girls that we rescued is waking up, and I think she's having a little difficulty staying awake.&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the shapes moved closer, encompassing Ali's entire field of vision. As her sight unblurred, the vaguely humanoid shape began to reveal itself. Facial features slowly started to emerge from the golden bronze blur, such as large brown eyes and a pointed yet distinguished nose. The static above the brown slowly unfurled into long luscious locks of platinum blonde hair, two long strands falling down to the newly revealed face. Eyebrows stiffened and a stern look painted across her face, this new woman seemed to be intently studying Ali...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Yes, this one is definitely still a little shaken.&gt;\" more gobblty-gook coming from this older woman's mouth as Ali struggled to distinguish what she was saying from the Common Language as the priestess turned to face the chubbier girl, \"&lt;I will need smelling salts, go grab them from my chest Hua.&gt;\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli could feel callused hands touching her cheek, rough against her young skin yet warm to the touch. Her eyes half-open, Ali watched as the woman slowly became clearer and clearer before her very eyes. Ali could now see that she was a rather young woman, little more than Midnight's age, yet seemed more... worldly somehow. Two long braids fell from atop her shoulders and joined each other to dance across Ali's bound chest as the long white fur from her robes suffocated the rest of her. She seemed discerning, as if she was trying to solve a puzzle or a tough riddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Foreigner girl, I am High Priestess Xiao-Ming.\" her accent was atrocious, not to mention how choppy her sentences seemed, \"You have had little-bitty accident on top of Stark Mountain, but not to worry. Lower Priestesses, Whelp, and I have saved lives of you and companions.\" she smiled proudly at this, \"As you can tell probably, my knowledge of Common Language is much better than that of too-too-young Lin Hua, if you have any questions please ask myself directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli blinked slowly, drinking in the strange words of the woman hovering above her. Her mouth opened, yet no words seemed to come out. Only the faint sound of breath escaping her body. Her eyes seemed to dance within their sockets, her field of vision still quite unsound as she fought of slumber. The woman above her seemed to notice this, as she quickly and visibly lost enthusiasm in discussing with Ali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is as I feared.\" sighed the Priestess, \"Girl is potato.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poh-tay-toe?\" Lin Hua curiously parroted her mentor's lament<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Means she is now unresponsive. Like sleep, but much much worse.\" one hand seemed to disappear from Ali's line of sight, only to reemerge with a large crudely-formed cleaver, \"Must put child out of misery and let do what must do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No stop!!\" Ali suddenly cried out as Xiao-Ming's wild swing stopped just above her nose, \"I'm not potato, I'm not potato!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, is good!\" the woman cried out joyously as she stroked Ali's hair, \"Xiao thought for second there that little girl would lose nostril. Good to know you're still alive and function fully.\" she smiled as a loud 'CLANG' resounded through the cave, \"You are strong, like good all fire-types should be; blood of Entei runs strong in you, not like water companion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Water companion?\" Ali mumbled, \"B-Blood of- just what is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to explain again?\" Xiao answered wryly as she inched towards the cleaver again, \"You sure you're not potato?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a potato!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, is good. Just making sure. You took pretty hard blow to head there, is miracle you are not potato. Companions and I saved you and friends before too much damage. Take you back here for three days or so, you have been sleeping as magical Ho-oh feathers heal.\" she picked up Ali's head and rested it in her lap, \"Everyone says Foreigner Girl and her friends not make it, but little Lin Hua there asked that we save you three. You have lots of thanks to give for little Whelp. But for now, you rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer touch, while rough, was rather soothing to the distressed Ali. She found her rough calluses calming, in a strange way, and felt safe knowing that she was in strong hands. \"But where... where am I?\" she asked weakly as she looked upwards at the bronzed goddess, \"How did... how did we survive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is not important right now.\" Xiao-Ming said in a soothing voice, \"What is important is that you are in good hands. Best hands. Best hands in whole tribe now, little Ember.\" she cooed as she stroked Ali's hair lovingly, \"Do you think you can eat? Yes? No? Either way, you build up strength.\" On command Lin Hua brought the wooden plate teeming with food to the priestess, who took it upon herself to bring the food to Ali's somewhat reluctant mouth. \"We will deal with Chief later- for now we make sure that littlest flicker of all survives... and her companions too. Possibly, Xiao is not so sure about the fat one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Priestess!&gt;\" Lin Hua called in her native tongue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. Fat one lives too.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a few hours since Ali had woken up in the weird tribal hospital with the chubby Tepig girl Lin Hua and the buxom Ninetails priestess Xiao-Ming. And needless to say, Ali was still slightly out of it throughout all of that time. Since the two other fire type moemon had left earlier, the entire room was dead quiet \u2013 Save for the rhythmic breathing of her two knocked out friends\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still so many questions that floated in Ali\u2019s head, of course, with no one conscious around, the young Quilava girl was all alone \u2013 With only the sounds of the flickering fire and the echoing voices outside kept her company. Well, that and the growls of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli\u2019s mouth watered slightly as she looked at the large plate of fruits and veggies that both of tribal moemon had left for her hours ago. They had suggested that she regain her strength by eating \u2013 But with one of those women trying to get her with a cleaver, she was a little wary of trusting them \u2013 But it was food, as long as she just got enough, then there wouldn\u2019t be a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking an apple from the tray, Ali quickly bit into the fruit allowing the juice and meat of the apple to go into her mouth \u2013 And instantly, the young Quilava\u2019s eyes widened \u2013 It was extremely tasty! She had have apples before, but for some reason this one tasted like it was a natural sugary food. It was the best tasting fruit she ever bit into!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately she munched down on the rest of the apple until minutes later \u2013 Only the core of the apple remained. With her tongue, Ali greedily licked up the sweet juice that had gotten on her face \u2013 She just wanted more of tasty fruit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026 &lt;You act like you haven\u2019t eaten in ages.&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli blinked a few times as the familiar native tongue was spoken and turn to the side to see Lin Hua standing a few feet away from her with a bowl of water in her hands. A few question marks appeared over Ali\u2019s head as she tilted it slightly, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby Tepig girl yelped slightly when she realized what she did, \u201cS-Sorry, s-speaking your l-l-language is\u2026 Hard. I try best to speak with you. But, is hard\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Ali replied as she subconsciously lifted her arms up to cover up her slightly exposed chest\u2026 Only to realize something. \u201cHuh? It\u2026 It doesn\u2019t hurt anymore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin Hua smiled brightly as she placed the bowl of water near the food and quickly turned back to Ali. Almost immediately, Lin Hua began to remove the colorful feathers from Ali\u2019s bandages, \u201cPriestess explained earlier \u2013 Ho-oh feathers heal. Even slight pain be gone now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lin Hua had removed all of the feathers \u2013 And there were a lot more than what Ali had seen before, there were at least seven feathers in Lin-Hua\u2019s chubby hands. Curiously, Ali turned towards her knocked out friends \u2013 Midnight had at least three of them visible, but Fontina only had a couple of them in her bandages. \u201cUh, why did I have more of those on me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin-Hua struggled for a second, trying to come up with the right words, her already reddened face grew a bit redder until she stuttered out, \u201cT-Tribe no trust o-outsiders easily. Lin-Hua had begged to save three, but still\u2026 Still tribe wary. Help child of Entei readily, even help d-daughter of darkness slightly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But, child of Suicune \u2013 S-She seen threat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThreat? Fonty?\u201d Ali questioned with her eyes narrowed. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin-Hua flinched greatly and spun around with her hands on top of her head, \u201cM-M-May so, b-but, Stark T-T-Tribe no t-trust daughter of Suicune \u2013 Natural enemy of children of Entei! S-So, while w-we help, t-tribe no want t-t-trouble from d-d-daughter of Suicune\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen\u2026 Then what\u2019s going to happen to her when she gets better?\u201d Ali asked shifting slightly in the bed she was in. \u201cAnd what about Midnight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Who?\u201d Lin-Hua asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was right, Ali didn\u2019t introduce herself or her friends to Lin-Hua or Xiao \u2013 That made the young Quilava girl blush slightly as she rubbed the back of her head, \u201cUh, I-I mean my friends, what\u2019s going to happen to them when they get better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well,\u201d Lin-Hua sniffled slightly as she turned back to Ali. \u201cYou, as little ember, be welcomed with open arms \u2013 Daughter of Suicune  and daughter of Darkness however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey most be put in prison \u2013 They be held as invader from opposing tribe, maybe for life. May be put to hard labor\u2026 As slave\u2026 Or worse\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli\u2019s eyes narrowed when she heard that, and her eyes glowed a slight red \u2013 She wasn\u2019t going to let anyone do that to one of her friends! If it was Midnight, even though Midnight was a pain in the ass, Ali still wouldn\u2019t let anyone make the Mightyena girl become a slave. The rage that Ali was feeling deep inside her was welling up, and she could feel the natural flames of her fire-type attributes burning brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the young Quilava girl didn\u2019t realize that as she was getting angrier and angrier, the flames in the room were growing brighter and fiercer. Lin-Hua certainly noticed though and shook slightly at the display of power that the wounded moemon displayed in front of her. \u201c&lt;T-This is\u2026!&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLin-Hua, right?\u201d Ali stated as she pulled the blankets away from her and slowly stood up from the bed. \u201cCan you take me to the guy in charge? I need to talk to him about my friends\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-The Chief?\u201d Lin-Hua gulped, remembering that she had just met with the head honcho of the tribe earlier. \u201cW-Well\u2026 Lin-Hua asked to bring little ember to Chief when you able to walk\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen that\u2019s perfect,\u201d Ali stated before she looked down and immediately the fire that was in her calmed down and was replaced with a flame of embarrassment. \u201cB-But before that\u2026 Lin-Hua, w-where are my clothes and underwear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Under\u2026w-w-wear?\u201d Lin-Hua questioned, blinking a few times at the weird word that Ali just stated \u2013 She had never hear of such a word before\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The red clay the made up the walls of Xiao-Ming's infirmary were the prime material in the construction of the Throne Room. Their surface, baked hard and dry over millennium of exposure to the relentless heat of the volcano, seemed to convey a certain hearty warmth. One could rub their palms across certain areas of the wall and swear to not feel a thing, other than the humbling heartbeat of heat that drummed within the mountains of the Stark Tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the Throne Room were not as welcoming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTall shadows of distorted figures danced across the miserable maroon canvas. Literally, they danced and hooted and hollered with vicious pride over their latest kill. The smell of meat dripped from the air as screams and cheers blended in a cacophonous symphony of blood-lust as moemon, male and female alike but all dressed in the same simplistic style of garb consisting of furs and bones, celebrated their recent acquirement of uncooked grub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorches lined the room in symmetrical fashion as their hearths shone valiantly with their own spells of fire and gallantry as they fought off the darkness. Four lit the corners of the room, tucked away behind a large wall of carved brimstone where most of the madness occurred. But in the center, where no moemon stood, lead a line of eight torches with a walkway big enough for several people to tread at once. It was of a different style than the rest of the room, clean and polished, and led up to a large circle of the same material. Beyond that, a staircase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd beyond that: a king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntimidating as he seemed strong, the leader of these animals was a large Infernape moemon who sat in stony silence. His skin, where it was visible, had been burnt a burgundy shade of brown, and the rest hidden in his collection of white hair. Visible were his legs, wide and trunk-like as they bulged with muscle, though the sheets of white fur that grew from them made him seem much more simian in appearance. His feet were naked, untouched by fur but ripe with calluses. Clothed only in the necessities, his loincloth was made from some sort of pelt. It looked rare. His crown? Only the gold band that separated his skin from his flaming red head of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King sat as if in a daze, his hairy arm propped up on one of the rests of his throne as it supported his scarred cheek. He seemed unconcerned with the madness about his presence, focused only on his own shadow and the mysteries that the Darkness contained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen something caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shape, a small shape but a shape still, became present in the hall. One foreign to his mighty rule. It grew closer without trepidation. It roared in it's tiny voice, \"Yo, you the king?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed... confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLithe, slender, yet without a hint of fear present within her movements. Despite their size differences, the smaller of the two seemed confident that she could break free of any scuffle should one occur. The larger one, the King, stifled a haughty scoff at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli took a mighty step forward, delicate brow furrowed in anger as she sized up the leader of these barbarians. Her own proportions, while not as firm and strong as his, had their own advantages. She could dodge and weave better than this muscle-head any day, she'd be willing to bet. Being dressed in bandages had its advantages too; less fluttering around. Less to get caught on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli knew what she was doing. But by the piercing look in his powerful eyes, so did their Chief. He had been roused, interest peaked at this child's audaciousness. His head, along with his eyebrows, raised to show that he was unsatisfied with the forthright of such a young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her pattered the footsteps of Lin-Hua. She wasn't really \"into\" watching the girl she had just pulled so many favors to save die at the hands of her King. The chubby Tepig girl was obviously on edge, having no earthly idea what to do in a situation like this. She reached Alli in the middle of the circle that laid before the King and began tugging on her arm. \"&lt;Excuse her, chieftain,&gt;\" she squeaked upwards to the muscular man in the throne, \"&lt;she is only just now starting to get better from her injuries. I think she may have hit her head a little harder than expected...&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no hesitation in the King's voice as he roared in his native tongue, something obviously scary enough to make the admittedly skittish Lin-Hua look like she just wet herself. Alli's gaze never drifted from the \"King\", despite all of the cheering and madness trying to coerce her otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to talk to you about me and my friends!\" Alli shouted after the King calmed down a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simian man's face twisted into a smarmy grin before he chuckled out something in the language that flowed in abundance here. Alli turned to Lin-Hua for a translation, \"Y-You think I would waste time w-w-with puny la-language?\" Lin struggled to say, \"I have r-royal tongue of Entei to speak with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli rolled her eyes, \"Look asshole it's obvious you can understand me, so let's just get this straight,\" she said in her best commanding voice, \"I appreciate everything your medic team's done for me and my friends. But that doesn't give you the right to decide where we spend the rest of our lives, and it <i>really</i> doesn't give you the right to be such a prick!\" she hollered, \"So I'd really appreciate it if you would just let me and my friends go back to the Resort and get on with our lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence in the hall as the King processed the message. His scowl grew deeper and his brows more creased. For the first time he rose from his seat, revealing to Alli just quite how tall he really was. He began to sneer at the smaller girl before his lips began to move. \"Since is just this once, I'd much rather not have Whelp send message for me. Stuttering is terrible.\" his voice was deep and gravelly, \"I am King. I who, what, when, and where everyone to do. As King, I declare that Daughter of Darkness with five feathers in bandages be sold into slavery and left to the hands of my men. You are feisty Little Ember, I sell you to adviser as wife. And Daughter of Suicune with three of <i>my</i> feathers in bandages? She dies by my hand as soon as she is healed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli winced, recoiling slightly, \"Y-You can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can. Wu-Kong is king. Little Ember and her comrades are on Wu-Kong's territory. Means yes, yes I can do that.\" the Infernape man said with a grin before bursting out into a fit of howling laughter, the rest of the courtroom following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad laugh track in the background faded away from Alli's hearing, as did Lin-Hua's futile attempts at tugging her away from the Throne. All she could hear was the sound of her own heartbeat as her vision slowly merged. Without warning Alli broke from Lin-Hua's grasp and charged up the stairs, grabbing Wu-Kong by the chest hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Look</i>.\" she said curtly as she brought her face to his, \"I am Allison Elm of New Bark Town in the Johto region. My friends and I, Midnight and Fontina, all have dreams to follow just like I'm sure you used to before becoming this high-and-mighty piece of muscle. We have families we need to see and people we'd like to see. And I'll be damned if some buffed up lunatic who really needs to find a razor is gonna keep us from it!\" she snarled, \"So remember this, if you keep us here, that means I'll <i>be</i> here. And you've got to sleep sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alli!\" Lin-Hua squeaked in the courtroom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" she turned around, not releasing the ivory hairs that sprouted from Wu-Kong's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that, in her unbridled rage, Alli's field of vision and hearing had shrunk a bit or she would have noticed the changes. For once, there was no screaming. No laughter, no animalistic cries of joy and hunger. There was only silence as the tamed group of feral moemon stared at the <i>second</i> and much more dramatic change in events. That being that the eight symmetrically placed torches in the room had suddenly become lava lamps. Not only had the fire been replaced by magma, but it was flowing skyward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What the...\" Alli mumbled as her grip loosened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You were speaking our language!\" Lin-Hua piped up once more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, threats and violence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I mean... y-you were speaking like us. Y-You use words of our tongue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't know I-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWu-Kong's stony countenance broke into a smile. \"You are Allison Elm of Johto, yes?\" he grinned, \"Johto is holy ground where Lord Entei was resurrected along with his kin by Ho-oh.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh, man,\" Midnight moaned, \"what hit me?\" <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nEverything was confused in her head.  She remembered climbing a mountain... no, it was a volcano... and they were looking for something... and she had fallen, and Ali was shrieking her head off about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli!  The little pipsqueak must have distracted her while she was climbing.   She was going to have words with a certain undersized Quilava, for sure.  Or had Ali been screaming because she'd fallen off the mountain?   <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nIt was a little hard to think the morning after hitting a mountain headfirst.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nCome to think of it, she wasn't sure it was even morning.  She wasn't even sure where she was, for that matter.  It looked like an infirmary, but the decor was straight out of Better Caves and Jungles.  Fontina lay in the pile of furs next to her, looking like she'd been through a mangler.  Did Midnight look like that?  She certainly felt like it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd where <i>was</i> Ali?  Midnight looked around, worried.  Sure, she was a shrimp, but she wasn't so small that she could be hiding in here.  She was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight stood up woozily and stepped towards the door, only to find her way blocked by a pair of surly, burly guards.  The surlier of the two barked something at her in a language she didn't recognize, while the burlier one prodded her still-sore breastbone and forced her back into the room.  She felt a growl rumbling in her throat.  Fine, if they didn't want to let her through--she'd just have to take out the trash.  It was too early for Burly and Surly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could lunge, though, a chubby girl with a painted face forced her way between the two guards, babbling something in the same gibberish.  They backed off, looking confused and chastened.  Then the girl turned to Midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daughter of Darkness!\" she said.  \"Please, d-don't fight.  You're honored guests now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight raised an eyebrow.  \"Now?  What were we before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were... sort of... p-prisoners,\" the little Tepig stammered nervously, looking at Midnight's impressive biceps, \"b-but not anymore, of course.  The God-Queen has issued a full pardon, and commands an audience in the throne room at your earliest convenience.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this God-Queen?  And what have you done with Ali?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, it's hard to explain... please, just come along.  We shouldn't keep her Infernal Magnificence waiting!  I-it's rude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.  Once I make sure Fontina's okay,\" Midnight said, bending over the Vaporeon's bed.   \"Then I'm gonna have a few words with this 'God-Queen' of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you've got to be freaking kidding me,\" Midnight said when she saw exactly who it was who bore the title of God-Queen, and who was currently perched on the throne of the fire tribe, dressed in raiment of gold and rubies and surrounded by guys who were hot in every sense of the word.   One of the lithe, scantily loinclothed boys massaged Ali's shoulders, while a second rubbed her feet and a third offered her goodies from a tray laden with fresh, ripe fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?   I just came in here, said a few things, blah blah blah, I'm a god.  Hold on.\"  Ali held up one finger as one of the sultry hunks dangled a bunch of grapes in front of her face.  She chomped down on half the bunch, they drew back, ripping them off of the stems.   \"It's unbelievable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I don't believe it. What's the deal, they fattening you up as a human sacrifice, or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I'm the real God-Queen.  I made some torches go nuts and everything. It was a sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, right, how do they pick their leader?  Is it like drawing straws and the shortest wins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and--and stop calling me short!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n One of the hotties popped a fig in Ali's mouth, and she chewed angrily.  A tough-looking guy by her side asked something in the mystery language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-he asks if you would like the brawny one executed for her insolence, God-Queen,\" Lin Hua asked.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Don't execute anybody!  Especially not my friends!\"  Ali said.  \"Don't do anything to them unless I tell you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly <i>are</i> you planning to tell them?\" Midnight snapped.  \"Since when are you allowed to boss me around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I became God-Queen,\" Ali retorted.  \"And they were gonna do some pretty awful things to you until I showed up, so if I was you, I'd be a little nicer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a threat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Fontina said, voice quivering.  \"Let's all just go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go home if you want.  Me, I'm gonna stay a while,  Who needs some crappy mystery treasure when you've got a whole tribe at your beck and call.  Hey, you!  Melon me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the serving boys rummaged through his pile of fruit and came up with a good-sized cantaloupe, which he presented to Ali in thick wedges. She snarfed it down happily, juice dribbling down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.  This is the life!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She consistently wears long sundresses a titch oversized. Her large blue eyes tend to have a glazed look.<br>\r\nPersonality: She's a Southern Belle, exceedingly polite and demure. This doesn't prevent her from flirting with pretty much anyone, though. Fiercly protective of the younger girls she travels with.<br>\r\nExtra: Since her recent evolution from Gloom, her skin has begun performing photosynthesis, bringing in a constant influx of calories. This has begun recently, so the effects are not apparent. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Loupi<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPokemon Based off of: Psyduck<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nDescription: A short, plump little dough ball, she can generally be found wearing a raincoat over her t-shirt, shorts, and rubber boots. An oversized baseball cap sits atop her short black hair completing the ensemble. Most of her weight is contained in her hips, ensuring that if things don't change she'll end up waddling like her patron Pokemon.<br>\r\nPersonality: Liable to go off on tangents or deliver a non sequiter in the middle of an on going conversation, Loupi is aptly named. Despite her bizarre behavior, she's very affectionate and liable to latch onto people she likes. Operates as the group chef.<br>\r\nExtra: Aside from marginal psychic prowess, there are hints to darker urges, especially around mealtimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Shelli<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPokemon Based off of: Wartortle<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nDescription: Tall, thin, and lithe, her wardrobe consists of tank tops and swim trunks. She has no curves to speak of, much to her consternation, and is as flat as a stack of pancakes. Has long, silver-white hair and light green eyes.<br>\r\nPersonality: She's loud, boisterous, and opinionated. Filled with energy, she runs around, involving herself with any and all activities in the world around her. Is very much a tomboy, without much truck for romance or other 'girly' things.<br>\r\nExtra: Despite her personality, she writes beautiful romantic poetry and keeps it locked away in her diary. If anyone were to find out, she'd be mortified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice One: Horrible Headaches. Much like many Psyduck girls, Loupi occasionally comes down with horrible migraines. Not only is she in great pain, but she subconsciously manipulates her environment with her latent psychic abilities. Enough is enough so the group sets out to find a cure. Their travels take them to Mt. Eatamanjaro which is rumored to have a certain plant that cures even the worse head pains. Unfortunately, (fattening) danger lurks upon it's lush peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Two: Cowabunga! Shelli's entered a surf contest while passing through a small seafront town. Easily convincing the other two to stay, she's sure to sweep the competition... if she can keep in shape, that is. What mortals can know what horrors may lay atop the sand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Three: Sweet Home Pokebama. Forced by her parents to visit home, Lilith drags her two companions along with her. Can they resist Lilith's mothers southern style home cooking? Or will they become yet another victim of the dreaded deep fried anything stratagem? </span></div></div>",

Her tank top and swim trunks clung tightly to her surprisingly flat frame and if it wasn\u2019t for her long hair, people would\u2019ve assumed she was a guy. \u201cAh, that just hits the spot! Nothing like just jumping into the sea to on a hot day! HEY! COME ON IN! THE WATER\u2019S FINE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was shouting out from the water towards where her and her team had set up their beach site. Although, from where she was standing, the Wartortle Moemon could only see one member of her group just sitting underneath the large umbrella. \u201cWhat the?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning from the water, the young woman ran up to the sight just to see one of her friends \u2013 A voluptuous, beautiful young woman with long black/blue hair simply relaxing in one of the few lounge chairs that was already set up on the beach, her long sundress clinging to her lovely figure. \u201cHey Lilith! Ain\u2019t ya going to come into the water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly older, Vileplume Moemon yawned slightly as she reclined into the chair, allowing some of the sunlight to fall onto her feet and the top of her hair, \u201cAh would, Shelli.

Frying fish, fresh board wax... even the fragrant aroma of the requisite fifty-something shirtless beach bums was familiar and comforting.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThey say life began in the ocean</i>, Shelli reflected.  <i>Or from an asteroid or somethin'.  But that asteroid probably landed in the ocean, right?</i>   No wonder it felt like home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a crowd around Meg G. Karp's Seafood Shack, but it wasn't hard for the lanky surfer chick to see over them and catch a glimpse of what was going on.  It looked like some kind of eating contest, with several competitors chowing down on plates laden with crisp crustaceans and heavily-breaded molluscs.   She was only mildly interested, and was about to turn away, until she spotted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loupi?\"   Shelli raised her voice.  \"<i>Hey!

Looks like you're actually doin' pretty good.  That big Sharpedo guy's way ahead of you, though.  Like, by eight plates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that doesn't mean anything,\" Loupi said.  \"We didn't start all at once.

I dare you to look me in the eye and say four times five isn't twenty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelli grinned.  \"Tell you what, Loop.

And in some cases, yes this is very true. But to Lilith, the volumptuous Vileplume moemon, it meant something else. It meant home. For this is where she grew up; with hot summers and cold winters, with plenty of friendly people, grits and hushpuppies, and the big ol' fields she used to play in. Since then, she has blossomed from a spoiled Oddish moemon into a beautiful, mature... if not somewhat dainty Vileplume woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, Lilith is more than excited to see these wide open fields again as she romps through them with her friends. One, Shelli, a wild and untamed surfer chick from the more hustle-and-bustle areas of Kanto, and the other, Loupi, an awkward little girl from the rurals. She loved them both dearly, especially after how long they've been travelling together. However, while the love was more than mutual, both of them weren't quite as willing to spread it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M STARVED.\" Shelli, a young Wartortle moemon, crossed her arms over a non-existant bustline. She was certainly pretty enough, but had it not been for the long stream of cloudy silver hair, most of the young gentleman around town would have mistaken her for one of themselves. \"Lilith, you said we'd be there in two days. It's been a WEEK.\" she growled at her older companion, \"We wasted all of our food money on those stupid tickets in Saffron so we could get here, and that was when I was under the <i>impression</i> that we would only spend a day or two out in the forest.\" Shelli narrowed her eyes, \"Either we get there <b>today</b>, or I'm heading back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what she said.\" the smaller Psyduck moemon, Loupi, agreed with her gravelly voice. She, while cute in her own right, was far from actually attracting a crowd like her two older prettier friends. For one, she was plump. Not fat, but her rearend was almost as big around as her belly. Two was her fashion sense; Lilith had lectured her countless times that \"raincoats don't go with everything, hun\", but to no avail. Lastly, she was just immature in general; she liked guys and everyhing, but... \"So either we get some food, or I'm outie.\" Well, you get the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but you promised!\" Lilith wailed, \"You two said that you would accompany me back home to the ranch so you could meet my family!\" Perhaps the most obvious hint to Lilith's heritage was her very thick, very \"Southern Belle\" accent. Rather than the rough drawl that most southerners had, Lilith's was smooth and lovely. In fact, it was just as smooth and lovely as she was, with her elegant curves and beautiful face all wrapped up in a dark blue sunday dress that just barely touched the tall grass of her family plantation's field. \"Look, girls, I really do appreciate all this, and I do believe that you'll both have a wonderful time back at my ol' ranch, so please... just a li'l bit further?\" she tilted up her red bonnet to reveal quivering pale eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Shelli huffed, letting down her tough act slightly with a wavering smile, \"I'll meet your parents and whoever else is at this family reunion, but can we just pick up the pace a little?\" she rubbed her washboard abs (revealed by a tube top, in leiu of a tank top which was removed due to the head), \"I mean, we haven't eaten in a few days, I think we could very well die out here if we're not careful.\" Loupi panted, sweating profusely, \"Yeah... die...\" (she had <i>not</i> removed her raincoat.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith chuckled cutely, \"Oh don't worry 'bout dyin', the strappin' young Tauros moemon who work for Daddy are always out here in the fields.\" Shelli and Loupi wavered, \"Wait, so your dad has...\" they gulped in unison, for fear of upsetting Lilith's provenly violdent temper, \"...slaves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the vileplume moemon laughed again, suprisingly brushing off yet another southern stereotype she had come to endure from her friends, \"Oh no no, they just work for 'im... slaves, you girls are so silly.\" Shelli and Loui simply looked at eachother in a confused fashion, usually a quip like that would have sent the usually sweet and demure Lilith into a frenzy... \"Wow, she must really like being home a lot, you didn't get slapped or yelled at or nuthin'!\" Loupi pointed at Shelli, who was just as equally amazed. \"Yeah... you'd figure after not eating for three days she'd be ready to punch me through a barn <i>already</i>...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all comin'?\" Lilith chimed, standing on a hilltop majestically. She looked lovely. Long black hair looked almost blue as the sun reflected her locks from afar, and the wind casually blew the bottom of her sundress. She looked ravishing... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you girls caught a titch of the vapors?\"<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"Pant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Loupi cut that out now!\" Lilith scolded her diminiative little awkward, \"Mommy'll be at the door to greet me any minute!\" the Psyduck moemon ducked down, \"Yes ma'am.\" she quacked, shrinking slightly into her raincoat fearing Lilith's belated rage from earlier. \"So, aren't you gonna ring the doorbell, Lilith?\" Shelli asked, noticing that in her hurry to look good, her southern companion had neglected to push the pale white button on the plantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, was huge. When Lilith said \"ranch\", Loupi and Shelli just assumed that it was a farm out somewhere in Hicksville. But this, this old mill house was absolutely gigantic. Obviously added on at the topmost floors (due to Daddy's large fortune no doubt) with the finest wood available, all painted white. Acres upon acres of land spread out wide, as the three of them learned earlier, into an adjoining yard full of crops. It was a Down Home Delight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need, Shelli.\" Lilith explained, \"We Vileplume can detect eachother's pollen, I'm sure- oh, here's Mommy now!\" she said excitedly, apparantly smelling her mother through airborn pollen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the door opened to reveal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a moment, it seemed as if Lilith was exaggerating about detecting another Vileplume, and Shelli was about to bring it up until the ground seemed to quake, making Shelli and Loupi shake slightly. Lilith on the other hand was smiling so bright it would rival that of a Lunatone\u2019s shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIS THAT MY LITTLE LILITH!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Shelli\u2019s and Loupi\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of what emerged from the large door from the door. Lilith seemed unfazed by the fact that a slightly taller, older and exceedingly wider version of herself emerged from the house. There was quite a difference between the two Vileplume Moemon, the fact that while Lilith had long blue-black hair, this one had short curled hair of the same color that curved around her slightly rounded face. And while she was wearing a fancier and frillier dress than Lilith, this woman\u2019s seemed to hug her impressive curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLILITH!\u201d the older and larger Vileplume Moemon screamed in joy lifted her arms up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOMMA!\u201d Lilith cried back as she leapt into the embrace of her apparent mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Shelli and Loupi stared in amazement and somewhat surprise as their voluptuous friend was almost completely engulfed into the curves of the larger Moemon. After a rather heartwarming and slightly awkward moment, the larger Vileplume Moemon noticed the two water type Moemon on her porch. \u201cOh my! Little Lily, are these the dears you\u2019ve been tellin\u2019 me about? Shelli and Loupi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing released by her mother\u2019s impressive hug, Lilith smiled brightly at her two companions, \u201cYep! Momma, this is my team, Shelli and Loupi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a bunch of cute little kids!\u201d The larger Vileplume mother cooed as she smiled at the two. \u201cWelcome to our humble homes, dears! You can call me Momma Morgan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, it\u2019s nice to meet you?\u201d Loupi questioned as she tilted her head slightly to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, likewise,\u201d Shelli chuckled slightly as she held up her hand towards Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, that\u2019s not how we greet friends of the family!\u201d Morgan replied as she stepped forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Shelli and Loupi could react, they were immediately engulfed in a massive bear hug that was actually starting to turn the two water Moemons blue in the face. Lilith on the other hand was more concerned with something else, \u2018Momma seems different for some reason. I wonder if she\u2019s let herself go a little bit\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Can\u2019t\u2026 Breathe!\u201d Shelli wheezed out, which unfortunately fell on deaf ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe\u2026 Too\u2026\u201d Loupi added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t the two moemons\u2019 cries for oxygen that finally freed them, it was the loud growls of their (and Lilith\u2019s stomach) that actually managed to grant them their freedom from the death hug! \u201cMy! Where are my manners! You three must\u2019ve been walking all day! Come in! Come in! I\u2019ll fix you all a snack before dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost blissfully unaware of the damage her hug caused, Morgan waddled back into the house, leaving the door open. All the while, Shelli and Loupi were trying to gather her breaths while Lilith was still in her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLilith\u2026 Ya didn\u2019t tell us that your ma was so\u2026\u201d Shelli wheezed loudly as she stood up first. \u201c\u2026 Friendly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith snapped out of her trance and smiled brightly at her two friends, \u201cOh, come on you two. My family\u2019s one of the friendliest around! Wasn\u2019t my attitude any indication what my family would be like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelli chuckled slightly as she rubbed the back of her head of hair while Loupi sighed loudly and began to walk into the house. \u201cI\u2019m going to get something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoupi\u2019s direct statement reminded both of her companions that they haven\u2019t eaten in the same length as well. So without a word, the two followed their Psyduck Moemon into Lilith\u2019s home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, two of them were; Loupi was plowing her way through a tub of ice cream, ostensibly to \"cool me down\". Busy sating their long endured hunger pains, none of the girls paid any heed to the creaking of stairs or the sound of boots quickly approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeell, tan mah hide an' call me a leather jacket! Lookit what tha Meowth dragged in! Long time no see, cuz! Yer lookin' fine, as always. An' who're these lil' fillies you done brought with ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounding like a Southern Fried Stereotype, the young Ivysaur moemon had barged into the room, catching the otherwise occupied girls unawares. Dressed in a kerchief, ten gallon hat, boots, jeans, and plaid shirt, he looked the spitting image of the Hollywood cowboy. Loupi and Shelli stared at the boy, spoon and sandwich sliding out of their grasp. Lilith merely glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shoot, ain't ya gonna introduce us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock off the act, 'Tex', before I knock it off for you. I swear, you're always tryin' your hardest to embarrass me in front of my friends. Loupi, Shelli, this here is my cousin, Raymond. His ma is my daddy's sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. You're no fun.\" Ray muttered, returning his cousin's glare. He quickly turned to the two young girls comprising the rest of his audience and turned charm to 'stun' \"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. You can just call me Ray, everyone does.\" He extended his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Shelli. Nice to meet you.\" Shelli took his hand tentatively and shook. \"This is Loupi and... erm... she's a little busy at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoupi had returned to her ice cream moments after Ray's outburst and seemed to be in a world of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, that's just fine. I'll get to know her later, never you fret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay sat down and helped himself to sandwich, never taking his eyes off the Psyduck moemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hot as blazes out there. You guys wanna go fer a swim or somethin'? There's this pretty lil' swimmin' hole out yonder. We could go for a dip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs group leader, it was supposedly up to her to decide. On the one hand, a refreshing dip sounded delightful. On the other, her cousin was quite the pervert and she wasn't exactly sure she'd like to run the risk of one of them mysteriously 'losing' an article of clothing while in the water. Plus, she was still hungry and most of the sandwiches were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a decision.</span></div></div>",

Her bangs sweep left, and always have since she was a Poliwag. She tends to dress in cutoff jeans and sleeveless tops tied at the shoulders<br>\r\nPersonality: For what she lacks in intuition and general common sense, she makes up for in optimism and passion. No matter what she does, she always gives 100% and never backs down from a challenge. She's the group's self-appointed leader.<br>\r\nExtra: She wears a King's Rock as a bracelet, fashioning it as a lucky charm, completely unaware that it could divert her from her desired evolution: Poliwrath<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Lynn<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPokemon Based off of: Bayleef<br>\r\nAge: 22<br>\r\nDescription: A tall moemon with an increduous bust, her outfits usually consist of name brand halter tops and sarong skirts. She keeps her bangs short, framing her pretty face, and wears the rest of her long, viridian locks in a low bun at the back of her neck. She wears a leaf themed choker around her neck.<br>\r\nPersonality: Despite being born into a wealthy family Lynn is incredibly down to earth, if not a little naive and unsuspecting. She's kind hearted hopeless romantic and has been friends with Perry since she was a Chikorita moemon. On a side note, she's the only one of her friends with any cooking talent.<br>\r\nExtra: She's prone to culture shock, usually flipping out over some of the strange foods or customs in a new town.

She wears a small purple hoodie with a shared white pocket over a tank top and skinny jeans that conceal a rather fit and agile figure<br>\r\nPersonality: To completely contrast her outwardly innocent appearance, her true personality is devilish and caniving. Often seen with a sneaky twinkle in her eye and something that isn't hers in her hands, she has gotten her friends in more than their share of trouble. But despite that the bond between them is strong and she is always willing to go without so that one of her friends might feel better.<br>\r\nExtra: Her appetite is huge, especially for sweets. Fortunately for her, an active lifestyle of climbing trees and running from agitated plunderees has granted her a lightning-fast metabolism. But now that she's on the straight and narrow, what will become of her teensy-weensy waistline?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlot 1: Ancient Offerings: Upon exiting Ecruteak City, the trio gets lost in the forested mountain area, and soon night begins to fall over the three. However, just as the three are about to quit April accidentally stumbles across an ancient village filled with several Moemon dressed in old Japanese fashions. Apparently, this culture has been hidden for hundreds of years, but the three are desperate and come to the village\u2026 Which makes the villagers think that by the way they dress, the three are avatars of their goddess (which happens to be the goddess of nature and life). The three are showered with gifts of food (which might just affect those little waistlines of theirs) by the villagers during their stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlot 2: Apidose in Olivine! The crew successfully makes it to Olivine City just in time for the Annual Lighthouse Festival which promises food, laughs, and good times! Initially skeptical of the strange festivity, Lynn finds herself having a ball! However, the party soon ends, and a few days later April and Perry start to worry when their usually reserved friend becomes all too familiar with Olivine customs, especially the world-famous restaraunt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlot 3: Super Sizing Trip aboard the SS Aqua! If they don't want to swim to Cainwood, then our heroines have to scrounge up enough money for three tickets aboard the SS Aqua! Easier said than done, considering they have no cash. Even worse yet, there's no <i>direct</i> route to Cainwood aboard this ferry, meaning that they have to take the extra-long scenic route! While troubling, surely the pampering facilities aboard will make up for the long wait?</span></div></div>",

Truth be told, it had been a while since the elegant Bayleef moemon could just sit bak and enjoy a meal to herself, having to cook for Perry and April was a really stressful job and didn't provide much thanks. So why not indulge a little for once, she never got to do anything really for herself! And as the young Scyther moemon pointed out earlier, there was always the possibility that one of her friends wandered into the House of Kamakiri in hopes of something to eat. However, putting that all aside, Lynn's rumbling tummy seemed to guide her to the strange oriental smells coming from the east.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small booth was crudely erected in front of a small rentable station, not really much to look at but a smorgasborg to smell for. The familiar smells of rice, fish, shrimp sauce and mushrooms filled the air and wafted into Lynn's nostrils. They were all things that Lynn had cooked for her friends at some point and thusly smells that were fairly familiar to her in all aspects, only combined in entirely new ways! As politely as possible, the timid though buxom young moemon nudged her way through the roaring crowds to get a closer look, noticing that she had lost Eiji's trail sometime while navigating through the mosh pit of eager eaters. Finally, she had made it to the front of the mosh... and her big brown eyes nearly bulged out of their pretty little sockets when she saw just how loaded that fille of fish was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not just the fille; kalkarash dipped in teriyaki, something that resembled Huntail pie with barbecue sauce, some sort of exotic fish cut open to reveal a flowing inside of rice sauce and possibly vinegar, down to the simplest meals like hamburgers hot dogs and ruben sandwiches! The spread was compelling, and like she said before Lynn was trying to do something for herself for once... she felt her hands shake as she reached out for a sample when a hand grabs her by the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey there!\" Eiji's sharp voice startled the unsuspecting moemon. \"O-Oh my!!\" she yelped, spinning around to face the wiry man, \"Y-You startled me, Eiji!\" Lynn giggled as she put a hand over her breast. Somehow, Eiji managed to avert his eyes from Lynn's hooters long enough to avoid suspicion (of course, Lynn was never the finger-pointing type anyway) \"So my fair lady, I can assume you'll be sampling our wares today?\" he weasled his way into it, Eiji had obviously been doing this for a while and knew his way around a customer. Lynn smiled and turned her attention back to the stand, once again mobbed with greedy hands, \"Oh yes, but I think I might just start off with a sandwich.\" she said politely, \"I-I'm not too sure I could even pronounce some of the other items.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Eiji said, closing his eyes with that wide grin of his, \"That's how all our regulars start off, Hoenn items are very popular here- but really tricky to say.\" his thin hands wrapped around her wrist, \"You see over there, I think that's called googlemesh and eh, I'm not even sure... oh yeah, that's Huntail Kidney pie, big around this time of year actually... not so much with the jellyfish crowd we get this time of year though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was Eiji's idea of a tour; pretty much him talking and talking non-stop about what food was being served, a little bit about himself and the resteraunt, it was all a little awkward for the sheltered Lynn. Normally people were never so forward with her, going to far as to just grab her hand without taking consideration, slowly leading her back to the main House of Kamakiri and away from the stand- still bursting to the brim with crazed partiers. However, it seemed that Eiji was pretty dead-on about getting her that sandwhich, almost like he was mad for a sale! Like he would do anything just to get her to eat there! That was almost as scary as the crowd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn gulped, her golden leaf choker catching her throat slightly. Maybe spoiling herself a little wasn't the right idea after all...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>True to his word, Eiji had brought Lynn over to the House of Kamakiri \u2013 And at the sight of it, the nervous feeling she had in her mind had disappeared. Like the rest of Jhoto, the restaurant itself was styled in a Japanese style, designed to resemble that of a large, yet cozy Japanese teahouse. The restaurant even went so far as to have the waitresses dress up in several cute and colorful kimonos (although, all of them were colored in several different shades of green).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the wondrous smells that hit Lynn\u2019s nose, instantly making her mouth water\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d Eiji announced, snapping Lynn out of her daze, realizing that he was standing in front of an emptied table (how there was an emptied table in the almost jam packed restaurant). \u201cI\u2019d like to serve ya, Lynn, but I gotta get back to the kitchen. So, I\u2019ll get one of the waitresses to get your orders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t a little relieved by Eiji leaving her to the table, but still, the smells that lofted through the air were messing with the busty Bayleef moemon\u2019s head. Slowly, she sat down, enjoying the smells and obvious atmosphere of the House of Kamakiri\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn blinked a few times when she realized that a small glass of water was set in front of her. She turned to her right to see that one of the waitresses standing right next to her table. The waitress had a cute, cherubic face that was topped with curly white hair that flowed over her bright skin (her skin could be on par with porcelain with color wise) and she had rosy cheeks. Lynn wondered when this waitress appeared next to her, mainly because it was kinda hard to miss this waitress however, with a large green kimono stretched over her heavy set frame, hugging her curvy body. Aside from the bulging belly, thunderous thighs and slightly ponderous breasts (although they weren\u2019t as big as Lynn\u2019s), Lynn guessed that she was a Flaaffy Moemon, albeit a bit bigger than the usual ones that Lynn saw on her travels. \u201cWelcome to the House of Kamakiri, I\u2019m Clover and I\u2019ll be waiting on you today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello,\u201d Lynn replied with a slightly nervous smile. This waitress seemed to have energy that could rival Eiji\u2019s energy, but at least she seemed to be a bit more in control of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what you want to order?\u201d Clover asked holding up a pad of paper and pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, well,\u201d Lynn was about to say that she didn\u2019t even get a menu to look at\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d Clover chuckled as she smiled brightly at Lynn. \u201cEiji told me a few seconds ago that you\u2019d be interested in trying some exotic foods. Let me tell ya, I used to be a regular customer here, everything is excellent!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Clover\u2019s face was enough to make the nervousness that was welling up in Lynn\u2019s stomach melt away into what it originally was \u2013 Hunger and curiosity. \u201cAlright, well, then how about you bring me something that you thought was the best dish here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne special coming right up!\u201d Clover announced brightly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clover smiled brightly one last time before turning away from her new viridian haired customer, as she did so Lynn's eyes couldn't help but travel to the enormous lumps that jutted out from underneath her kimono, making up her backside. Lynn giggled, trying her best to avoid staring and hold her tounge. She was always good at that, being polite and reserved. If Perry or April were here they might have said something to upset that poor waitress. <i>\"In the long run,\"</i> Lynn said to herself, <i>\"It's probably good that I got to do this for myself!\"</i> she said warilly, picking up the glass of chilled water that Clover had delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she sat there for a while, just taking in the sights and smells that the House of Kamakiri had to offer. Just like Eiji had promised, almost everything there looked foreign. From the simplistic dishes of Kanto- mostly hamburgers, hot dogs, and things of the like- to the crazy concoctions that hailed from Hoenn; things like Mieliepap and Dakar. Of course it would be ridiculous to claim that Lynn even knew about those latter dishes, being the somewhat sheltered and naive girl that she was, all she knew was that the food here was exotic and new. Something that, in a way, frightened her. What if she was allergic to the recipies that Eiji used? What if she caught one of those diseases she heard about on the news that foreigners caught in Hoenn? Like her face swelling up to the size of a basketball?! That'd be terrible!! <i>\"Okay, okay, just c-calm down Lynn.\"</i> she said to herself, trying as hard as she could to keep her hand steady around the sweating glass, <i>\"E-Eiji seems like he knows what he's doing, so you should be fine... oh no, but what if he's not the one cooking?!\"</i> Lynn inadvertantly started to panic, millions of terrible thoughts swarming into her head all at once. All of which ended with her leaving with some sort of strange disease or mutation about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so enravelled in her own paranoia that she didn't notice the strange looks that her fellow customers had started giving her. She was jittery and drinking a lot of that water, struggling to remain mannerful in her hysteria and choke down those awful thoughts. Suddenly, she heard a loud 'CLACK', causing her to jump up and let out a small yelp. The Bayleef moemon was pretty embarrassed when she saw that it was only Clover, who had come to deliver her food in a timely manner. \"O-Oh, I'm so so sorry!\" Lynn gushed, turning an intense red, \"I-I guess I just... a-are you sure this food is safe?\" she squeaked, lowering her head in shame of asking such a personal and offensive question. The cotton-haired moemon raised an eyebrow, a concerned look on her face, \"Sweetie, the food's just fine here- we have excellent Health Inspection reports.\" she said just as quietly, patting Lynn on her tiny shoulder, \"Now eat up, I think you'll really like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Clover had brought her, while foreign and strange, looked very delectable. The main course, a somewhat comforting sight, was some sort of meat stew. In the large bowl, Lynn could clearly see two uncut, ripe tomatoes on the sides being marinated by the oily stew and the meat floating inside. To the side of her bowl, there were some fried Pecha Berries (a delicacy in Hoenn that never seemed to travel to the KanJohto continent). And lastly, possibly the side item, was a simple familiar dish of fried rice; something that Lynn had cooked many a time for herself, April, and Perry. All in all, this food wasn't actually too unfamiliar to her- like before, it was just cooked in a different way. {i<i>\"Maybe I shouldn't get so worked up...\"</i> Lynn said to herself, stirring the soup slowly with her spoon, <i>\"I mean, they use the same ingredients I do... so why not give it a little try?\"</i> Her eyes travelled over to the dimpled smile of her Flaafy waitress, awaiting her customer to take her first spoonful of Moamb\u00e9. Deciding to be grown-up and mature about this whole 'culture-shock' thing, Lynn decided to hold her nose and give it a try...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold spoon...<br>\r\nIn the soup...<br>\r\nLift...<br>\r\nWrapping her soft lips around it...<br>\r\nSwallow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...silence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, after maybe only five seconds after swallowing her confection, Lynn's eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets from the intense spicyness that travelled back up her throat and settled on her tongue. She let out a raspy gasp for air, chugging what was left of her water and still stumbling around the table to find something else. While Lynn struggled, closing her eyes in the intense pain, Clover only giggled, \"Yep, that was my response too, it must be the Tomato Berries Eiji uses.\" she said cheerfully. However, she stopped laughing once Lynn stuffed her mouth full of rice to absorb the spices, choking down the lumpy side dish. \"There, feel better now?\" Clover asked innocently, \"I take it you don't like the spicy stuff too much, I'll just take it back and get you ano-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Lynn said ecstatically, spooning more and more Moamb\u00e9 stew down her throat, \"I love this!\" Clover laughed, she had never quite growing accustomed to the spicyness herself and therefore just a little bit surprised. \"Well alright then!\" she said merrilly, \"I'm glad you like it, if you need anything else, be sure to call me, we're pretty busy today so I've gotta apologize in advance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn wasn't paying any attention to the needless ramblings of her waitress. This food was <i>AWESOME</i>, so new, so different; the only food she'd ever eaten that made her throat hurt! It was all just so new to her... and even better with rice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... can I have some more... please?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nA few hours since Lynn\u2019s first order\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the House of Kamakiri, two particular girls stood outside the restaurant \u2013 One was an average figured girl with short blue hair that swept the left side of her face with a sleeveless top and cutoff jeans that showed her average figure. At the moment she was tapping her foot against the pavement a few times while looking down at her companion, \u201cApril, sometimes I wonder if you can even control that devilish mind of yours\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl that stood outside the restaurant could almost be mistaken for a tween girl, mostly thanks to the large brown eyes, a baby face, and looked to be as flat as an ironing board. Over that skinny body of hers was a small purple and white colored hoodie that had the hood covering her light purple colored hair and had skinny jeans that showed off her petite and skinny figure. And as she was addressed, the young girl known as April shook her head with a sneaky smirk, \u201cDon\u2019t act like it\u2019s my fault Perry. You were the one who had to look at those King\u2019s Rock charms\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was only for comparison!\u201d Perry defended as she lifted her right wrist up, revealing a crown shaped rock that was around her wrist. \u201cBesides, my King\u2019s Rock is always going to be the best! And don\u2019t change the subject, we gotta find Lynn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I look like?\u201d April questioned with a roll of her eyes. \u201cLynn\u2019s keeper? She\u2019s older than me, I think she could take care of herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we can just leave her behind,\u201d Perry retorted with her arms crossed. \u201cWe\u2019re a team and a team doesn\u2019t leave anyone behind! Besides, as the leader, I have a responsibility to know where each member of the team is and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t give me this speech again,\u201d April sighed as she walked near the opened entrance of the House of Kamakiri. \u201cLook, I\u2019m starving, can we at least get something to eat before we find her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just asking for the same speech again,\u201d Perry huffed. \u201cUntil we find Lynn, we can\u2019t eat. So, as soon as we find Lynn, we can eat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFound her,\u201d April replied as she pointed towards the inside of the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry peered into the restaurant, and with her eyes widening, indeed inside the restaurant was their Bayleef Moemon friend \u2013 Lynn, seated at one of the tables that had several empty plates and bowls stacked up on the table. And there was Lynn herself, with a pair of chopsticks in her hand as she slurped up a large amount of noodles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Holy hell, did Lynn eat all of that?\u201d April questioned as she stepped into the restaurant\u2026 Only to have Perry run in front of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Lynn! There you are!\u201d Perry laughed as she ran up to Lynn\u2019s side, unaware that Lynn was more preoccupied with her current dish. \u201cI see you\u2019re sampling the cuisine with gusto!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018More like with gluttony,\u2019 April thought to herself as she eyed all of the empty plates and bowls, and watched as the latest one was placed on the top of them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Perry, April,\u201d Lynn groaned as she lowered her arms to her stomach (which was now pooching out from under her halter and over her skirt, bulging out greatly). \u201cG-Great to see you\u2026 You have to try the food here. I-I haven\u2019t even gotten past the first page of the menu\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything is\u2026 AWESOME\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Aipom moemon could only grumble, usually these roles were reversed- she didn't quite appreciate the irony of the situation. \"Look you big-tittied freak, we can't keep paying for stuff like this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lynn was too far gone; lost in the sights, smells, sounds, and mostly tastes of the Glitter Lighthouse Festival! Unaffected, the buxom moemon went from booth to booth participating in whatever they had to offer no matter what it may be. From the Steel Yakuza group who ran the wind up Goldeen catching competition, where a large number of buff muscle men let Lynn partake in many many free tries due to her wonderful \"personality\" (if a CC cup size counted as a personality) to the booth of highschool kids who were trying to raise money for their school with a bake sale, pretty pointless when all the guys gave Lynn free donut holes (again, wonderful wonderful personality) and all stops inbetween. She won a stuffed Urasing in the bottle tossing competition, a free ticket to the Stardust bakery run by a nice little family of Clefairy evolutions, an inflatable katana, and a shirt that said something vulgar. She was having a blast, and it was only the first row! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay I think I'll give it a shot!\" Lynn said eagerly, handing a slick-looking Beedrill moemon a few crumbled up bills from the bottom of her purse. He agreed eagerly and handed over two of the largest order of shishkabob on his menu. \"Enjoy little lady!\" he said eagerly, \"How's that folks, two of my biggest orders gone, all to that pretty lady over there- can't keep this up all day, come get it while it's hot!\" Immediately, Lynn started to tear off little bits of meat and mushroom from her stick with fervor, \"Mmm, dish ish rully good!\" she said, cheeks swelling with masticated meat mush. \"What <i>hasn't</i> been very good today Lynn?\" April asked sarcastically. Never one to quite understand sarcasm, the Bayleef moemon actually took a second to consider the question. \"Huh, it's all been pretty tasty!\" she said in a rather airheaded fashion, \"Ooh- skiball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril groaned, having long given up hope of snapping Lynn out of this unfamiliar party animal state. \"You could at least buy <i>me</i> something if you're not gonna let me take anything!\" she grumbled. Lynn cooed, \"Aww... here, you can have my extra share of shishkabob!\" she said sweetly, handing over the spear and all of its contents to her simian-based compadre. \"Thaaanks.\" April said, grimmacing at the grease dripping off of the dish, \"Maybe something that won't kill me next time?\" However, as predicted, Lynn had surrendered to her ambitions yet again and had stepped over to the skiball booth. \"Why does no one listen to the short girl?!\" April lamented, trudging along disdainfully while taking a bite from her 'reward'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as April got closer to the booth, now that the crowd was dying down a bit, she heard something that sounded particularly promising towards getting Lynn home; \"Oh I'm so sorry Mister, I-I seem to have spent all my money...\" she said apologetically. 'YES!!!' April pumped her fist triumphantly, letting the shishkabob fall to the ground in light of going home. \"Well that's alright, come back again some time- I'll be here all week!\" the forgiving Remoraid moemon said, sending a shiver down April's spine and a twinkle into Lynn's eyes. \"All week?!\" they both said simultaniously, one with much less enthusiasm than the other. \"Yes ma'am, the Glitter Lighthouse Festival is a week-long event! You must be tourists!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that things started to cool down a bit. Now that Lynn didn't have any money to blow, she only partook in the free events, which were scarce. But that didn't stop her from watching with the same anxious look in her eyes. But still, now that she had simmered down, Lynn's freakishly distended stomach was starting to get to her. \"Ooh...\" she cried an hour or two after her money puddle had shrivelled up, \"I'm so tired...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME!!\" April shouted, \"LET'S FIND PERRY AND GET OUTTA HERE!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need!\" Perry's familiar voice called from behind the two, \"Have fun while I was gone?\" Lynn smiled widely despite the pain in her over taut gullet, \"Perry!\" she said enthusiastically, \"Did you have fun at the festival?\" April however was less than pleased with her tomboyish partner, \"YOU LEFT ME ALONE WITH HER FOR <b>FOUR HOURS</b>!!\" she shouted, \"I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO SELL ME FOR A ROUND OF DARTS!!\" Perry seemed to ignore April's cries in lieu of Lynn's condition, \"Partied out Lynn?\" she asked, \"Jeez, probably a good thing too, by the looks of you if you'd kept this up you'd be as big as a house!\" she chuckled, patting Lynn's distended stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... not funny Perry...\" Lynn moaned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on Kid, let's get you back to the Moemon Center.\"</span></div></div>",

Even the local shops wouldn\u2019t open for a few more hours in celebration to the festival\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!\u201d April hissed as she stuck her hands in her hood\u2019s pockets out of frustration. \u201cIf I had known that these things weren\u2019t open, I would\u2019ve just gone to the beach for a few hours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it was a rather quiet morning (save for the crashing waves and the sounds of pounding hammers and other noises), which was dull\u2026 Which in April\u2019s opinion was one of the worst things to deal with (it was just below with dealing with her teammates\u2019 shenanigans and getting caught for some petty crimes). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should\u2019ve just continued to the next town,\u201d April growled as she continued her trek. \u201cThe Gym Leader isn\u2019t even here right now, so we\u2019re just dealing with this and\u2026 Wait, that stand! It\u2019s open!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething to end the boring morning, and April quickly dashed over to the stand, which seemed to be an old fashioned balloon popping stand with a single young man working it. But it wasn\u2019t the type of game that had attracted her, it was the fact that all the prizes seemed to be novelty sizes of various sugary sweets. A tinkle appeared in her eyes when April skidded to a halt in front of the booth, licking her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn\u2019t go unnoticed by the booth\u2019s worker, blinking his dark eyes at the Aipom Moemon \u2013 And although April didn\u2019t really pay attention towards him, she would\u2019ve noticed the fact that he was actually quite handsome with finely combed back black hair that was pulled back into two long tails that had yellow rings holding them back. His slim figure was covered with a black vest, a white short sleeved shirt and black jeans and they did a good job of showing his physique. The Umbreon Moemon smiled at the sight of April, \u201cAh, my first customer of the day! And how are you today miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! Just give me the darts!\u201d April asked holding up some cash towards the Umbreon Moemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man merely shook his head, \u201cNo need to pay, little miss, since you\u2019re my first customer, I\u2019m giving you a free round.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man lifted up three darts and held them up to April who quickly snatched them up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Three popped balloons later\u2026-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWinner!\u201d The Umbreon Moemon announced as April jumped a few times in victory. \u201cChoose your\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe jumbo bag of cotton candy!\u201d April quickly selected as the Umbreon Moemon quickly pulled the selected prize down from the post. \u201cYes! Sweets!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Umbreon chuckled as he crossed his arms, \u201cHeh, you remind me of my little sis \u2013 Kay, she\u2019s always full of energy and loves sweets. Care for a second round?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment though, April was already tearing into the bag of cotton candy \u2013 Nothing like blue, artificial sugar as an excellent breakfast to provide energy for the rest of the day. And it wasn\u2019t until she emptied the contents that the bag that she realized that the Umbreon Moemon was waving towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Miss?\u201d The Umbreon Moemon questioned blinking a few times. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small cough, April recomposed herself, although there was a small twinge of red on her face, \u201cUh, yeah, I just like sweets is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon could only chuckle again, \u201cAnd that reminds me of my sister Fontina. Anyway, care for a second round, miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop calling me miss,\u201d April sighed as she held up some of the currency of Jhoto. \u201cI have a name and it\u2019s April.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018And there\u2019s Pamela\u2019s personality,\u2019</i> The Umbreon thought to himself as he took the money. \u201cVery well, April, feel free to call me Noir, after all, that\u2019s the name written on my name tag here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoir pointed towards the silver tag clipped on his vest, a large smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it supposed to be upside down?\u201d April questioned as she began to take aim at the balloons.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>POP! POP! POP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there goes three more balloons, making it an even seventeen rounds Tough Guy!\" April cheered through her namesake's grin. Noir, far less amused with this than he had been when it all started, could only sigh, \"April... seventeen's an odd number.\" he lamented, holding his head up with a gloved hand. He pushed his hair back, blocking the vision of his tiny financial undertaker with the underside of his forearm as he leaned on the counter depressingly. \"Whatever, just gimme my candy.\" the tiny hustler said as he held out a sticky palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor nearly two hours now, April had reduced more and more of Noir's balloons to tatters as she worked her way down the board in a linear fashion. First she popped the first three, then the next, all while keeping a perfectly straight line and not missing a single shot. The prize rack, once riddled with sugar and artificial flavoring, had only a few more clear bags of cotton candy; the Jumbo sizes being the first to go. Of course by this time the fair crowd was starting to emerge from their hotel rooms and shuffle out for another day of partying, but that didn't really seem to matter much to either of them. April was just getting started...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating, that is. Seventeen rounds of cotton candy had left her with enough sugar to feed the average family of four. But anyone who knew April well enough could tell you that she was definitely not average, and if there were three other moemon around to grab at her candy they wouldn't get a single hair. She plopped the biggest of her remaining bags onto the sandy ground and unwound twist tie at the top, rolling up her sleeve with her now-free throwing arm and shoved her designated shovelling arm into the bag, emerging with an entire fist full of green sugary ambrosia. \"YUM.\" she said in a husky voice before opening her mouth and emptying the entirity into her gaping maw. Her cheeks bulged with the high-sugar delicacy, their swelling dying down as it melted and dripped down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Noir, as well as any other onlookers who may have glanced over at the sharp popping noises, was shocked to see such a small girl put away all that sugar in such a timely and inefficient manner. But of course, \"at first\" was about two hours ago. Now he was only wishing that she would either miss at least one balloon and lose eligibility to choose the jumbo prizes, or at least not devour the cotton candy he had put his sweat blood and tears into making in front of him like an animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should you really be eating all that sugar?\" Noir said coldly, \"It can't be good for your metabolism... it might even stunt your growth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril, too jacked up on glucose to think straight (and who wasn't too fond of short jokes to begin with), smiled wickedly at the Balloon Stall Guy. \"Oh and what's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?\" she said sharply, releasing the mutilated bag of sugar and letting it fall over dead to the ground, \"Maybe if you worked a little harder at your job, actually getting out of your booth every now and then, you wouldn't be so PALE, you could get a DATE, have a GIRLFRIEND, eventually get a LIFE!!\" the simian moemon growled as she grew closer and closer to the still barely composed Noir. \"Are you saying I'm unattractive?\" Noir asked as he glared down at the loudmouthed moemon before him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What self respecting moemon lets herself get picked up by some pale guy AT THE BEACH?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!!\" Noir raised his voice, shooting up like a bullet and declaring his rage with balled fists on the counter, \"I AM TOO ATTRACTIVE!!\" he shouted, April not shaken in the least by his outburst. \"Nuh-uh!\" she refuted childishly, \"You're pale, lanky, and awkward, and you know what?\" she reached back for her recently mauled bag of sweets, \"Your cotton candy ishn't eben dat GOOD!\" she spat through sugar. \"THEN STOP EATING IT AND TAKING ALL MY BUSINESS!!\" he hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noir?\" a foreign voice interrupted the childish feuding between the two, \"What's going on?\" It belonged to an Espeon moemon off to the right. She was dressed in a pink sun dress, the sort of thing that was meant for the more conservative way to visit a beach, and had her pink hair let down to her back. But above all, the thing that stood out most about this moemon was her weight. For such an elegant, lithe subspecies that the Espeons seemed to be, this one seemed almost -dare we say- too fat to live up to that connotation. While certainly pretty-faced, she was by and large (emphasis on large) one of the biggest moemon April had ever seen... except for maybe that waitress at that restaurant Lynn yammered on and on about. Her swelled forward from underneath her plain lavender sun dress, making a dome of purple that bounced and wobbled along with the rest of her as she slowly made her way over to the balloon stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>know</i> this jagoff?\" April asked venomously, \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's my sister!!\" Noir bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes I am... now, back to my question, what's going on here?\" she was of course referring to the fighting, and why a large majority of cotton candy had been given to the smallest customer ever. \"Noir, is there some kind of problem?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jet-black moemon groaned, \"No... no problem, Pamela...\" he said defeatedly. There was no way he was going to admit that he had lost his head over a silly little insult to his dear sweet sister. \"Everything's cool, April was just whooping our little balloon stand's figurative tail.\" The hyperactive munchkin's flat chest swelled with pride. \"You bet, haven't missed a single one yet!\" she grabbed at her cotton candy prizes gleefully, \"<b>And</b> I made off with a good portion of your stash too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela let out a squeak. \"Y-You what?!\" she turned to Noir, \"NO ONE'S GOING TO COME TO A STAND WITH NO JUMBO PRIZES, HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO PAY OFF MY STUDENT LOANS WITH NO CUSTOMERS!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, not my problem~\" April said nefariously as she swung a string of her cotton candy bounty of her shoulder, munching on a handful as she walked away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictorious... it just made the sugar high seem so much sweeter.</span></div></div>",

Almost always wears long skirts and turtle-neck sweaters. Keeps her hair in a short and neat fashion, with the bangs flowing towards her left eye.<br>\r\nPersonality: As the oldest member of the team, she often acts as a motherly figure towards the other two, Suzanna in particular(whom she has to watch constantly if they go near a pastry shop), and often times butts head with Megan(particularly when they go to a big town, where Megan would more than love to spend all of their funds on clothes). A tad bashful about her figure.<br>\r\nExtra: Used to be real chubby as a Ralts and Kirila, and still has the sweet tooth that led to her childhood plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Suzanna(Suzie)<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPokemon Based off of: Clefairy<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nDescription: A slightly pudgy Clefairy girl, loves to wear bright colourful dresses with lots of frills, has an irresistibly adorable fave, which she uses to her favor most of the time. Her frilly dresses tend to hide the fact that she has wide hips, chubby thighs, and a big rump. Has slightly curly pink hair that surrounds her head like a fluffy cloud. She holds herself up with plenty of grace, given that even with her pampered family life, she was taught to hold herself properly by her mother who used to be a famous model before settling down.<br>\r\nPersonality: Pretty childish, some what spoiled(her parents were rich and doted on her as a little child), and hates almost all physical activities. Tends to get shy if she has to wear something more revealing than a dress(partially from her self-consciousness about the size of her posterior)<br>\r\nExtra: Has little to no physical stamina from her sheltered childhood, and has a large appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Megan<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPokemon Based off of: Lopunny<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nDescription: A slim(almost-curveless) lopunny girl, with the features of a model, and the fashion sense to match. Wears her long sandy-blonde hair in two waist-length pigtails.<br>\r\nPersonality: She can be a bit of a deva, argues with Gretal quite frequently, and she mocks Suzie's pudgy rear end almost constantly. Loves to shop, and constantly tries to chat up guys while she does so, this has gotten the trio into quite a lot of financial problems in the past.<br>\r\nExtra: Has a very competitive personality, and is very fashion conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlot 1: Casino capers! After Megan goes on a shopping spree in Celadon city's massive department store, the trio is pretty much penniless and must find some jobs. Fortunately the Game Center is hiring, unfortunately for Gretal and Suzie, the positions are for show-girls(cue some embarrassingly sexy/adorable outfits for the girl, with Gretal and Megan done up in bunny-suits[err... bunnery/Lopunny-suits?], and Suzie is put to work in the buffet area), good thing that the employee perks are good and they don't have to spend most of their paychecks on food, bad thing is that buffet food can be quite addictive, especially with six dessert carts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlot 2: Fashion Hooplah! The trio find themselves in front of a famous fashion mogul's mansion(on the insistence of Megan), applying to be models for her new clothes line, little does the trio know that the fashion world is about to be blown out of the water by the new fall fashions and the figures that go with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlot 3: Holidaze! The trio are spending the winter holidays with Suzie's family at their mansion, little do Gretal and Megan know that the family's traditions resolve around serving the fairer sex hand-and-foot during the holidays. This leads to the trio getting absorbed by the lazy lifestyles of a pampered princess, along side Suzie's rather portly mother.</span></div></div>",

Truly it was a calming city where anyone who just wanted to relax could sit back, enjoy a nice warm day, and not have any worries or problems\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU SPENT ALL OF OUR MONEY?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Scratch that last statement please\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding outside the local hotel was a trio of Moemon, one of whom was yelling her brains out one of the others. \u201cMegan! That was all of our money! And you just spent it on clothes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who was yelling was an elegant and rather curvaceous young Moemon with creamy white skin with forest green hair that was combed down the left side of her beautiful face. In an attempt to cover her curvy body, this Gardevoir Moemon wore a green turtle-neck sweater with a long flowing white skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Moemon she was scolding was a young slim woman (who had almost no curves to her body) with a face that could rival a top model\u2019s wearing a beautiful black blouse, a pair of fancy cut off jean shorts and a matching jacket. She had long sandy-blonde hair that was tied into two long tails that ran past her trim waste, \u201cNo need to blow a gasket Greta, its not like I spent all of the money on my self, I was considerate enough to get Suzie a few snacks\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s another thing!\u201d Greta groaned with a slap to her forehead. \u201cWe can\u2019t spend our precious money on candy either!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Suzie that the two were discussing was sitting on a nearby bench, merely munching on some of the candy that Megan had purchased her. Suzie (her real name was Suzanna, but she preferred Suzie to that any day) was a slightly pudgy Clefairy Moemon, with cute face that would garner anyone\u2019s attention way from her chubby, pear shaped frame that was covered with a frilly bright pink dress that matched her pink fluffy, yet curly locks of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re acting like we can\u2019t just get any more money,\u201d Megan sighed with a wave of her arm, which had several clothing store bags, evidence from her shopping spree. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ve got another way for us to get some cash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of the bag, Megan fished out what appeared to be a small flier that had three \u20187\u2019s on it. \u201cThe Game Corner\u2019s hiring! They pay well and the tips alone by working there ought to be enough to pay for those expenses you\u2019re always griping on about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta sighed loudly, \u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to work at a place like that. We can find other jobs in a city this big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the Game Corner\u2019s head office, a familiar trio sat in the lobby, waiting\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we couldn\u2019t find any other jobs in this city,\u201d Greta moaned loudly as she hung her head in defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw quit complaining,\u201d Megan replied. \u201cYou said we needed to work, and this is the best way for us to get some green fast. They even have positions for people who are over fifteen years old, so that means that Suzie can actually help out with the team for once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuzie doesn\u2019t wanna work!\u201d Suzie huffed with her cheeks puffed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all have to work,\u201d Greta scolded with a dull look on her face. \u201cAnd sometimes, doing work means that you have to do things you don\u2019t want to do. And thanks to you two, we all have to work just to be able to live and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d a soft voice stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway to the main office was rather mousy looking woman with short purple hair, large rimmed glasses and dressed in a violet business suit, in her hands was a clipboard. It was easy to see that this woman was a Ratatta Moemon, mainly because when she spoke, she showed off the small buck teeth she had in her mouth. That didn\u2019t derail the fact that she had a cute face. \u201cMister Sunny will see you three now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, remember you two,\u201d Greta reminded as the three Moemon stood up from their seats. \u201cWe need these jobs, so please be courteous and nice to the guy. We want to be hired so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, with my looks, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get a job,\u201d Megan answered as she entered the head office first, followed by a slightly annoyed Greta and a pouting Suzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all three entered the office, they all saw the mysterious Mister Sunny sitting behind his desk, his bright red suit immediately drawing their attention to his sleek body frame. His face was rather rugged with dark blonde peach fuzz on his face and bright blonde hair that was styled back, he was a Ninetails Moemon, \u201cMy, my, my, Roxanne was right. We finally have our employees that we needed, and exact numbers too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping from his desk, Mr. Sunny ran up to Greta first and began shaking her hand, \u201cGreta if I\u2019m correct? It is a pleasure to meet ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes, you too?\u201d Greta muttered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Mr. Sunny turned his attention towards Megan and bowed slightly, \u201cAnd if I read the paperwork correctly, you must be Megan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, and a gal could get used to that,\u201d Megan replied before Mr. Sunny knelt down slightly so he could look Suzie in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re Suzanne?\u201d Mr. Sunny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuzie likes to be called Suzie!\u201d Suzie corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair!\u201d Mr. Sunny laughed as he spun around and began to walk to his desk. When he reached his desk, Mr. Sunny spun around and sat on it. \u201cSo, nice to meet you all, I\u2019m Kit Sunny, but you can call me Mr. Sunny or Sunny, of boss, or handsome, or whatever compliments you can think of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s a little over the top,\u201d Megan muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s cut to the chase,\u201d Sunny sighed with a look of worry on his face. \u201cWe need some people to help out at our casino, and frankly we don\u2019t have a lot of time. The jobs we\u2019ve got open are basically just acting as waitresses and some one just to look over the buffet area. I\u2019ve read the applications you all filled out, and from what I can read, Megan, Greta, you\u2019re old enough to qualify for our waitress positions and little Suzie (that\u2019s a cute name by the way) can work the buffet area with one of senior staff members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll learn as you work, the jobs aren\u2019t that tough, the pay\u2019s good, you get to keep whatever tips you make, and you can get free access to the buffet. There are a few more perks, but your supervisors will tell you them in your orientation. Like I said, we\u2019re somewhat short staffed and we need someone to fill the three positions, so, you three interested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d Megan answered back with a hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat Megan meant to say was yes, and thank you for the jobs!\u201d Greta replied as Suzie turned her entire body to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d Sunny laughed as he smiled brightly. \u201cWell then, I\u2019ll have Roxanne lead you three to where you\u2019ll be working, if you have any troubles or concerns, feel free to visit me! My door\u2019s always open!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Greta thought it was all Megan's fault for spending all the money. Megan thought it was Greta's fault for not telling her not to spend it. They forgot about this for a moment as they turned a corner into the waitress' changing rooms. Naturally, the girls met their tutor-- but were shocked at her appearance. They had expected a slim girl with very little, if any curves to speak of. What they saw was a curvaceous woman whose figure put Greta's to shame and made Megan look like a pencil. She had nice D cup breasts, a large waist and hips, and a round butt, all seemingly forced into a purple tanktop and shorts. \"Hello,\" the Nidoqueen moemon said with a voice not much deeper than Greta's. \"My name is Narcissa. I believe you are Greta and Megan, it is lovely to meet you.\" She shook both girls' hands so hard that Megan thought her arm would come off and the movement sent little ripples through Greta's curvy form. \"Hmm...\" Narcissa continued, eyeing Greta's shape and Megan's petiteness, \"We'll have to give you some curves, Megan. And Greta, you could use a couple added pounds to that bust of yours. Whether we plump you two up or not, however, has no effect on the fact that I need you to put these on.\" Narcissa held up a brown tanktop and shorts for Megan to emphasize her Lopunny frame and a green set for Greta's larger Gardevoir body. Still reeling in shock from an almost COMPLETE stranger telling her to get fatter, Megan took her waitress uniform and stumbled out of the room. Greta took her uniform, headed into an adjacent room, and put it on. She was almost instantly ashamed of herself as she looked in the mirror. The V-neck tanktop showed off her cleavage and belly, stretching tight across her chest. Her shorts were tight as well, showing how big her butt was and the belt only showed off her large waist. The legs of her shorts were filled and looked ready to tear. All in all, she looked sexy to any appreciative moemon, but personally hated the outfit. \"I'm too fat to wear this!\" Greta complained as she returned to Narcissa. \"Oh honey,\" Narcissa said, \"You aren't fat. You're just...\" she searched for the right word, but couldn't find it. \"Oh, alright. You are a little heavy, but who can't like that beautiful figure of yours?\" \"You really think I'm not fat?\" Greta asked. The conversation was almost beginning to sound like one between mother and daughter. A few minutes later...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly a feel of intense pleasure washed over her entire body as if the candy was the best thing she had ever tasted, then immediately followed by a lack so intense she moved to grab more and stuffed her face with a heap of them, then another and another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo So Many... Many Extra Long Hours Later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretal picked up a huge cake with her now extremely fat hand, that she had yet to notice in her monsterous rampage of a feast, and stuffed it into her mouth and ate it. \u201cAhhhhhh, so delicious\u201d she would exclaim as the pleasure spread. Then as it faded, she looked for more... more... more... but saw nothing but the waste of her feast that littered the room, and so she moved to the door and attempted to open it with the intent to find more to eat. Little did she notice that her clothes had long since burst to shreds, lying on the floor, covered in the wastes of the feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door did open and so Gretal attempted to exit, only to not be able to... she was stuck. \u201cWhat in the absolute hell\u201d she would exclaim as she tried to jostle her way out of it, still not noticing her now extremely fat form, but she did escape it, only to turn to a mirror and see herself reflected, and her face turned to one of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Curvy figure was gone, what was once only a small bit of flab now a huge extended belly with two rolls of flab, still shaking from her steps.

Oh, you mean only slightly anthro....okay, let's take a crack at this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Keslie Armad<br>\r\nPokemon Equivalent: Ninetales<br>\r\nAge: Twenty-seven<br>\r\nPhysical Description: A slightly tanned girl standing at 5'11'', with locks of pure gold she keeps in an intricate braid that has, you guessed it, nine interlacing strands. The hair reaches down nearly to her butt, leading many to wonder how long it'd be if she ever undid it! We'll get back to that butt. She tends to wear strapless tops, showing off enough cleavage to let people know she's interested, but not too much. Long, loose skirts are often found below that top, and between them a bellybutton peaks out. Keslie has enough cleavage to make it worth looking at, but she's fairly modestly built, naturally slender. The only exception to that is she's got an unexpectedly plump rear end for a girl her weight. Now, it's not out of place or anything, but she's got some extra padding that blows off the whole fashion-model image she nearly has. She's got the longest, shapliest legs a girl can have<br>\r\nPersonality: Keslie's a woman not easily troubled. She's been with her friends through thick and thin, and it always seems to work out. As a result of her quiet optimism and calmness, Keslie's the go-to girl for all sorts of advice, and even strangers find her easy to trust. She never reacts too quickly, thinking out nearly everything she does first. She's a stalwart friend, who'd never abandon another, and is always willing to help out. However, there's one thing that will break Keslie's resolve like a twig. Ice cream. She loses all rationality around the stuff. She has a knack for seeking it out too, so sometimes her friends find she's disappeared off and comes back with sticky lips and a full belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Bridgette Kanol<br>\r\nPokemon Equivalent: Absol<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nPhysical description:5'3'', Her figure's hard to discern beneath the giant sweaters she wears. She seems to have one of every color. Getting past that, however, one finds a dark skinned girl with black eyes and a round face. Raven black hair peeks out of the hood, frayed and frazzled She has slightly pouchy cheeks, but a sweet smile. Her entire figure is 'pouchy' - she had just enough of a pot belly to pooch, and a bit of a flabby butt at that, which is why she wears sweatpants as well. <br>\r\nPersonality: Bridgette is the gang's go-to girl when they can't figure anything out. She's not a traditional kind of smart. Self taught, at least mostly, so she has little factual knowledge but is a brilliant problem solver. Not that she'd admit it. She's got zero self esteem, partially centering around her figure. What kills her more is that she doesn't feel any need to be skinny, making her feel even more of a freak. She sticks by Keslie the most because of these issues, and is privy to Keslie's secret weakness. She herself loves fast food, especially pizza. The greasier the better.<br>\r\nExtra: She was homeless when the gang found her, and won't talk about what happened, but has passed all tests to be an emancipated minor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Mary Haven<br>\r\nPokemon Equivalent: Raichu<br>\r\nAge: 23<br>\r\nPhysical description: 6' . Lithe, with long limbs. She likes to call a sports bra a top, but if forced into some semblence of deceny, will often be found wearing form-fitting tees with some obscure band name on them. She's got the best rack of the group, a pair of D cups that some think could be fake. Truthfully, she comes from a line of top-heavy women. She likes to wear cargo shorts, which barely fit around such a slender waist, and the pockets of which are stuffed with all sorts of odds and ends. Her hair starts blond and goes smoothly black, and her ears have a bit of an odd curve to them.<br>\r\nPersonality: A big kid. She doesn't go anywhere withoout running around, clambering on something she shouldn't, and inevitably breaking something. Despite that, she's lovable for her upbeat personality, and she's not so childish that she's irresponsible. She knows she should behave, she just doesn't care. She gets the group into the most trouble, but tends to weasel her way out as well. One thing is that she doesn't care at all about her figure. Her boobs seem to constantly surprise her. She shovels down candy like it's nothing, and has only remained slender so far due to her metabolism, and habit of having the weight pile on on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Harely Iteran<br>\r\nPokemon Equivalent: Abra<br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nPhysical description: 5'8''. She has eyes that look like slits, almost always closed, and a pixie cut of brown hair. Her wardrobe is weird. A pink skirt one day, blue jeans the next. The only constant for her tops is long sleeves, but sometimes they're low cut, sometimes not, sometimes showing belly or not. Her socks never match. She doesn't seem to care about showing off her figure, and she's got a damn good figure. All curves. Round little belly, full bosom, a padded rear and thick limbs. She has a small tattoo of a celtic knot on one ankle.<br>\r\nPersonality: She's an oddball. Likes comedy, but never tells jokes (or almost never), just likes to laugh. She reads a lot, but nothing serious. In fact, half the time it's some trashy romance novel, and she doesn't care who knows. She's not an energetic individual, in fact is just short of narcoleptic, but at the same time takes great interest in those around her. She's also the kind of person who's comfortable with silence, and makes a great listener. She is also big on contact, to Mary's delight and Bridgette's chargrin. Harley will also eat anything put in front of her, but will gobble cherries pit and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese four girls take any old odd job, but specialize in private investigations. With their tracker Mary, brains Bridgette, Harley's immense \"luck\" at finding clues, and Keslie's orginization, they do pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScenario 1: Pretty young girls have been going missing, so the all-girl group goes undercover into a strange fetish ring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScenario 2: Taking a break from it all, the group goes to a beach town for bathing suits and sun. Will the relaxation drive them mad (and plump) or does this town have a mystery?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScenario 3: A mysterious letter comes and sends Bridgette into tears. Her mother's coming for her....so what's the BIG deal?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a story that has riddled the local papers in the recent days \u2013 Cute, young girls have gone missing. There wasn\u2019t any real connection between the girls \u2013 Each of them were different types of Moemon, came from different backgrounds and were each a different age (although, all of them seemed to be younger than thirty).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, recently a new girl was kidnapped \u2013 Which is the reason why our four heroines were standing in an office waiting for the one who called them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, waiting, waiting, waiting,\u201d one of the girls pouted loudly as she kicked her legs over the desk she was sitting on. With a lithe body (save for a certain aspect) and long limbs this girl\u2019s tan body was dressed with a simple black t-shirt that had the crown logo stretched tight over the melons she called her chest with a pair of baggy and slightly bulky cargo shorts that were wrapped with an extra tight belt around her tiny waist. Her hair was pulled back with blonde roots that smoothly turned black with her ears poking out at the side with a slight curve on them. \u201cWhy are we waiting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, M-Mary, w-we\u2019re here for a j-job,\u201d one of the other girls in the room answered. Unlike her Raichu Moemon friend, this girl had dark skin and had raven black hair that seemed to act almost like a hood for her chubby face. It was easy to see that she was the shortest of the group, but it was hard to see what her figure was since she was wearing a giant white sweater and black sweatpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBridgette\u2019s right, Mary,\u201d The third girl answered, who was leaning up against one of the walls with one of her golden locks of hair in her hands that she was playing with. Like Mary, this Moemon was dressed in a strapless red top that showed off a good, healthy amount of cleavage with a yellow skirt that showed off her trim belly (although, the skirt seemed to flair out from behind a little bit). Her golden hair was braided back with nine long tails that seemed to reach past her plump rump and shapely legs. \u201cYou need to learn to relax sometimes. Take a page out of Harely\u2019s book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older girl pointed towards the ground next to her, showing the fourth girl who was sleeping on the ground with a book laying on her thick thighs that were covered with some patched up jeans that had several types of fabric sewed into them with a light brown long sleeved top that showed her bulging cleavage and bulbous belly and her pixie cut of brown hair showed her sleeping chubby face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, h-how long as H-Harely been out, Keslie?\u201d Bridgette asked blinking a few times at her sleeping companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeslie, the Ninetails Moemon only shrugged back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she did answer, the door to the office opened up, instantly allowing a new person to enter the room and get all the eyes drawn to him. He was a tall, older man with a short brown hair and a gruff beard, and despite his large and muscular frame, he was dressed in a brown suit with a moon like symbol on his chest. \u201cAfternoon, ladies. Thank you for coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large man stomped across the floor (obviously not on purpose), and yet, his deep voice and booming footsteps didn\u2019t even manage to wake up Harely. As the tall man walked behind the desk, Mary jumped off of it as the large Ursaring Moemon sat behind the desk with his large hands crossed over his chest, \u201cOnce again, thank you for coming on short notice. I\u2019ve heard good things about this team, and thought that you would be the best for this situation. You may address me as Mr. Lupine, and I\u2019ll get right to the point of the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all have heard of these mysterious disappearances, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of the conscious girls nodded in reply to Lupine\u2019s question, \u201cThen that\u2019ll save me some time. My daughter, Alison has disappeared a week ago, however, the police have been unable to locate her, therefore, I\u2019ve decided to take this matter into my own hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupine slid a single photo over the desk, allowing Mary to take up the photograph and show it to the other two awake members of the team \u2013 The photo depicted a smiling Mr. Lupine with a young beautiful lass with long blue hair dressed in a beautiful yellow sundress that covered her petite figure. \u201cMy request is simple. I\u2019d like you to find her and bring her back, if you\u2019re successful, I\u2019ll pay your fees along with an additional twenty-five percent bonus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you can find the other girls who have disappeared, I\u2019ll make sure to it that you\u2019ll be able to get compensated as well. So, do you accept?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, Mr. Mayor,\u201d Keslie answered with a smirk, while the other two members nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d Lupine sighed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, how do they get this job started?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wind streaked back her blond-then-black hair, revealing curved ears. The girl had a grin wider than the horizon. Then, a small black bug flew straight into her gaping maw, causing her to hack and cough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, would you get back in here!\" another girl asked tiredly, yanking at the thick belt keeping a pair of khaki shorts around the moemon's nearly nonexistant waist. Mary plopped back into her seat, sending her bosom jiggling in the guitar-emblazoned belly shirt she wore. The girl who had yanked her into the vehicle took a moment to rub her brow, then put the hand back on the wheel. Keslie was usually a patient woman, in fact she was known for it, but she was worried that Mary would have her head taken off by the next road sign they passed. Her eyes looked almost red, and gave Mary an annoyed flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid it have to be the beach...?\" a girl in the back mumbled. She seemed to be hiding her face in her hair, which formed a deep black mane around her, only a few shades darker than her skin. Despite the heat, and relatively light (i.e. revealing) clothing the rest of the group was wearing, this girl wore a light blue sweater that draped over her frame. The girl shifted, trying to get the fourth passenger off of her. A slightly taller, definitely heavier moemon with pixie brown hair and a patchwork set of clothes rested against her, sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley.\" the dark girl whispered, prodding the napper. It did nothing, just as it hadn't the last dozen times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bridgette, I know it's not your favorite, but it was Mary's turn to decide our vacation spot. Besides, you might enjoy it if you let yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Park there, park there!\" Mary said, bouncing on her seat and shooting a finger across Keslie's line of sight. Keslie sighed and beared right. Soon enough they were parked right at the edge of a sandy expanse that went on lengthwise as far as they could follow. It was a winding coast, with plenty of inlets and shallow water. It was no surprise that it was a busy beach. Not packed, but tons of other moemons, many college age or thereabouts, went about on the sand or dipped their feet in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can check out our bungalow later.\" Keslie rationalized allowed. \"Mary, get back here!\" she had to shout, as the Raichu moemon was already a dozen strides into the sand. She turned around like a child getting caught stealing sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your bathing suit?\" Keslie asked, picking up a duffelbag from the back. Mary grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Keslie. You gonna join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeslie glanced back. Bridgette had gotten out of the vehicle, but it looked like only enough so that Harley wouldn't be sleeping on her anymore. Keslie gave Mary an apologetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll catch up. Once we're all ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay.\" Mary said, already half turned away. Keslie walked over to Bridgette and put a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go check out the boardwalk? The beach isn't going anywhere.\" she said. Bridgette nodded. She had managed to blush red through her dark complexion looking at the scantily clad beachgoers. There was a decent line of shops and stands only a few paces away. No one really thought twice about leaving Harley behind. This happened enough that they knew the Abra moemon would somehow find them without any trouble.</span></div></div>",

She raced towards them, already fumbling at her top. Her grin made her almost look frenzied. Nonetheless, she caught the eyes of a couple rather beefy male moemon exiting the men's changing rooms. One whistled at her. Mary didn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, there were lockers and booths for changing, and Mary wasn't having any of either. She threw her swimsuit down right inside the door. She tore off her top and flung it down besides her swimsuit. That left only a minimalist yellow bra cupping her breasts. Firm and perky, they were quite an impressive sight. They fit the D-cup bra snugly, not an inch to spare. Mary got more than a few startled and/or interested stares from other beachgoers as she stripped. Next came the pants and belt. Mary's undwear was white with a little lightning-bolt print. They looked almost like a child's pair, especially given her slender waist. Almost. A few of the other moemon girls exchanged glances. She wasn't going to....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, and a series of stunned moemon girls exited the changing rooms. One made cupping motions with her hands, looking like she was weighing something imaginary. A few shook their heads. Then, Mary exited exuberantly. She was only barely decent in a skimpy sunny-yellow bikini. It covered no more than her underwear, which was to say very little. Mary skipped along, carrying her clothes back to the jeep. She didn't notice someone had followed her out of the changing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Harley?\" Mary asked, looking around the jeep. It was empty. Mary shrugged, and then on a limb, began pulling herself up the side of the vehicle. It was quite easy for her to clamber up so she was standing on the top of the doorframe. Her bust wobbled ridiculously, and it was only by the grace of this story's content rating that nothing popped out. Behind her, someone cursed and hid behind a car as Mary turned a full circle, trying to spot someone she knew. No luck. So Mary shrugged, hopped off the car, and popped her clothes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imma make a sandcaaaaaaaaastle.\" she yelled, racing towards the sand, bouncing all the way.</span></div></div>",

Don't move your knight, I'll take that pawn you need later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw that.\" the woman said, tapping her chin with a bony finger. \"Vacation? You from the college then?\" she tentatively moved a knight in the way of one of Harley's bishops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Harley said, ignoring the knight and moving a pawn so that her opponent now had free access to her king. \"We do, well, odd jobs. Heh heh. Detective work, mostly. Except sometimes....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Detective work?\" the woman asked, surprised. She had seen through the ruse and was capturing one of Harley's knights. \"How odd. I worked as an assistant to a P.I. for many years. I was something of a detective myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky that.\" Harley said. \"Check. So what's the big mystery here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said anything about a mystery here?\" the woman asked, studying the board and trying to figure out how she had missed one of Harley's bishops pinning her king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not from this town. And you're gathering clues.\" Harley nodded in the direction of the woman's lap. Despite not being able to see it, she seemed sure. The woman sighed and put a small notepad on the table that she had been sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you're clever, don't you. Yes, well, it's the oddest thing. The businesses here used to be dead. The beach was mostly a local treasure. Good, but not on route to anything. Now, suddenly, it's the place to be, and the businesses are booming....especially all the food stands. Check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Probably got featured in a paper or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. There's something more. My intuition never steered me wrong. And I know a kindred spirit when I see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Harley chuckled. \"Maybe. Checkmate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice talking to you, Ms. Adeline.\" Harley said. \"I'll see you around.\" she got up and walked away at quite the leisurely pace. The old woman looked at the board in confusion. Sure enough, there was her king, pinned. She sighed, placed one finger on its crown, and began to topple it. She paused though, leaving it titled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the hell did I tell her my name?\"</span></div></div>",

His black hair was styled back with a single long tail that was braided back and his eyes were covered with a pair of red shades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the most prominent feature on the young moemon\u2019s body were the almost countless tattoos that ran along his tanned skin. Bridgette looked a little too long before she turned to the side with her face getting redder by the second. \u201cSorry for eavesdropping, but I couldn\u2019t help but listen in on your conversation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Moemon pushed himself from the rack of clothes and pushed his sunglasses up, \u201cFrom the looksssss of you two ladiesssss, itsssss a given that you\u2019re touristsssss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Keslie asked, knowing that the guy was probably here because he saw her and was probably trying to pick up a couple of \u2018chicks\u2019, but you can\u2019t just judge a person on a few past experiences.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just a wandering soul walking on the sandssssss of thisssss beach,\u201d the young Moemon hissed back with a smirk on his face. \u201cI\u2019m also an employee of thisssss shop you\u2019re standing in. People simply call me Griff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo illustrate his point, Griff pointed towards a nametag that was clipped to his opened shirt that had his name written on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it supposed to be upside down?\u201d Bridgette asked with her head tilted slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriff looked down at the tag and spun around to obviously fix the messed up tag. A second later, Griff spun back around with the tag now gone, \u201cThat thing\u2019sssss nothing but a pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, any reason why you interrupted our conversation?\u201d Keslie asked with a dull look in her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo particular reason,\u201d Griff chuckled pushing the shades up to his forehead. \u201cI just know touristsssss when I see them, after all, most people like to spend time on the beach\u2026 Unlesssssssss, you\u2019re new touristsssss. Besidesssss, I figured that you\u2019d come up to the counter a few minutes into the future asking about some attractionsssss here, the beach isn\u2019t the only attraction here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, then what would you suggest then, Griff?\u201d Keslie questioned, crossing her arms over her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019sssss an arcade not too far from here,\u201d Griff answered rather quickly with a yawn. \u201cItsssss part of a small restaurant called Seaside Shoresssss that servesssss some delectable treats, such as a seafood pizza and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks for the information, Griff,\u201d Keslie thanked before she and Bridgette stepped out of the shop, leaving Griff to just stand there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seviper Moemon merely shrugged his shoulders as he lowered his shades, \u201cAsssss much asssss I enjoy the sightsssss, I prefer the quiet anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the shop and into the sweltering sun, Bridgette was already drenched in sweat once more, pulling the collar of her sweater a few times trying to air out her body. \u201cSo, what\u2019s where to next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBridgette, I\u2019m serious, you should really change into a bathing suit,\u201d Keslie interrupted, making Bridgette gulp slightly. \u201cI know you\u2019re shy, but if you keep hiding underneath that sweater, you\u2019re going to get heatstroke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well,\u201d Bridgette stammered, considering the suggestion that Griff had decided, besides, she was a little intrigued with that seafood pizza that he mentioned.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She simply slumped, letting her weight give Keslie a hard time. Still, she got dragged to the changing rooms. She pretty much closed her eyes before they entered. Then, they came to a stop.

There had to be a mirror. Bridgette began to undress. The baggy sweater first. Dark flesh was revealed, and plenty of it. Bridgette, despite her youth, had slightly saggy breasts, quite a weighty bosom, if nothing impressive. Her stomach was more noticable. A smooth dome of dark chocolate. It was actually slightly cut into by her pants, which went next. Bridgette groaned. She looked fatter every time she saw herself.

And while the beach was busy, it was rather weird to see that the restaurant was almost completely empty\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Not that Bridgette would complain about that little fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends entered the wooden restaurant, and immediately both of them stopped \u2013 A wondrous smell was lofting around the cool restaurant (there were several fans around, so it kept the place breezy at the very least) \u2013 Various cheeses, seafood and spices filled the air, and made the two gulp slightly with the smell filling their senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Finally, customers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drew their attention before them, and standing before them was a slim young with bright skin and spiky blonde hair that was combed out of her sharp (yet oddly cute face). Her slim petite figure was covered with a pair of white shorts and a black tube top that showed her almost curve-less figure. With the electrified smile on her face, it was easy to see that she was a Jolteon Moemon. \u201cWelcome to the Seaside Shores, the name\u2019s Kay and I guess I\u2019ll be your waiter for as long as you two are here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like that enthusiasm,\u201d Keslie chuckled as she followed Kay to one of the multiple emptied tables in the restaurant, Bridgette following soon after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were already menus on the table that allowed the two girls to look over them while Kay got them some glasses of water. And it didn\u2019t take long for the energized Moemon to return with the icy cold drinks, \u201cSo, what can I get ya gals?

Keslie rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as nothing comes of it I suppose. Would you like to join us for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary glanced back outside, winced, and nodded. \"That'd be safe- I mean, that'd be great. Whatcha having?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza.\" Keslie replied. \"Hmm, probably should have gotten a large now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get ya two mediums, if you'd like?\" Kay replied, having sidled up to them as Mary joined them. She was behind Bridgette, making the pudgy girl jump in her seat. \"You want something to drink, sugar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugar!\" Mary said, grinning widely. \"What'cha got for soda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I can do you one better. So, two mediums?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\" Keslie replied. Kay scampered off. Bridgette sighed. Mary wasn't going to eat a whole pizza by herself, but one would have been too little. That meant there'd be more pizza to go around now....lucky she had skipped breakfast, because she knew that she wasn't going to be rationing herself if this pizza was any good. Besides, she hated wasting food. She didn't like to even think of her past, but the one thing she couldn't help but think of was her anger at others wasting food while she skipped another meal....it was no wonder she had ballooned once she got the support of this eccentric group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.\" Mary said. Kay had returned with a glass of pink lemonade nearly so large to be called a pitcher. It was rimmed with frosted sugar and had a whole strawberry wedged in the side. Mary took a fingerfull of sugar, and then sipped the drink. Her eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liquid candy.\" she said, downing a gulp of the glass. Kay giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try to stay healthy - not easy working here, trust me - but this is my weakspot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'll run it off in ten minutes.\" Mary replied. \"Pizza in another ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really will.\" Bridgette said, exasperated with her friend's behavior. Two peppy electric moemon was too much for her. Those two would probably hit it off so we- was that an actual sparkle in Kay's eye as she looked at Mary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really....okay sweetstuff, I'll go see if those pizzas are ready.\" Kay said, walking off after letting her eyes linger a moment longer. Mary was her normal oblivious self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love the friendliness here. We definitely picked right.\" Keslie replied. Bridgette just shook her head. The sooner she could down her worries in grease and cheese, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the pizzas did come in another ten. \"Seafood\" pizza wasn't entirely accurate, because Bridgette was pretty sure pepperoni didn't come from the sea. The pizzas were a smattering of toppings, most going with the beachy theme - such as pineapple, some anchovies (which Bridgette didn't actually mind). So, everyone could eat their favorite. Kay was attentive and friendly, which made sense since they were the only customers currently. Still, she seemed just a bit too eager at times, almost hovering around them, Mary in particular. Maybe it was Bridgette's imagination. In any case, the pizza was really good. She downed one slice before she knew it, and immediately had a second in her hands. Her friends ate with similar gusto. Bridgette realized (or rationalized) that that old rule, about waiting an hour after she ate to swim, could buy her loads of time away from the beach. All she had to do was eat her fill. So down went a third, and fourth slice, with enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" Kay asked, clearing off empty plates. The pizzas had been cleared out. Keslie looked a little upset, rubbing an overstuffed belly. Mary, well, she was Mary - she was probably full, but that didn't slow her down. Bridgette was handling it a little better, but she had cleared out nearly half the pizzas by herself, and could feel her belly filled nearly to capacity. </span></div></div>",

We don't treat ourselves often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\" Bridgette's objections vanished as her mouth filled with saliva. That had been very good pizza. She could squeeze in a few more slices. Besides, that'd give her an excuse not to swim for even longer. She nodded her agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more medium should do it.\" Keslie said to Kay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what. How about I make it a large and join ya'? It's my lunch break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette frowned over this stranger inviting herself into their group, but Keslie just gave a good-natured smile. \"Sure. I'm sure the girls have no objections.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, come sit with us!\" Mary said, gesturing at a seat. They turned to her. Bridgette's resolve collapsed under their expectations, and she just muttered her agreement, wishing she had her sweater on to hide in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's shy.\" Keslie said. Kay giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Second course, coming up.\" she said. She left them alone, for the first time in a while, and the trio were free to discuss amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is good food.\" Keslie said. \"I'm very impressed, for such a little establishment. I wonder why so few people frequent here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because there are so many choices.\" Mary said. \"I ran past like four different restaurants on my way here, and cotton candy vendors, ice cream places...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should take a tour afterward.\" Keslie said. Bridgette lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's.\" she said. Keslie gave her a sly smile, letting Bridgette know that she had seen that response coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Assuming we're not too stuffed to move after this.\" she said. Bridgette sighed and poked her tummy. It was soft, and it was threatening to touch her healthy-sized thighs right now. She said nothing though. She wasn't jealous of her friends' bodies. She wouldn't stoop so low. She just wished she could feel more comfortable in her own skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order up! Hee hee.\" Kay said with a laugh, putting a steaming hot pizza down on the table. She pulled up a chair and wedged herself between Bridgette and Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what brings you all to this little corner of the world?\" Kay asked, taking her first bite of pizza. Bridgette focused on the food, but overheard the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, vacationing. We run - we are, basicallly, a little private investigation firm most of the time.\" Keslie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, cool! Crimefighters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, on occasion. Mostly it's just lost items, background checks, the occasional unfaithful spouse, so on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome.\" Forget rose-tinted glasses, apparently Kay was wearing rose earmuffs as well, hearing only what she wanted. \"That sounds awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty cool.\" Mary said. She let out a wide grin, \"I'm basically zuBatman. Woman. Y'know.\" she and Kay shared a laugh. Bridgette rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you, Kay?\" Keslie asked. Kay was taken aback momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, me? Not much to say. One of seven kids, yea. I kinda wasn't sure what to do after school. I mean, yea, I like to stay in shape, but I didn't want to work in a gym my whole life or anything. So, I went wandering...wound up with this job, guess I kinda missed Blaize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually pretty interesting.\" Keslie said. \"Blaize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My biggest sister. Literally.\" Kay made a gesture like she was hugging a barrel. \"Big girl, but she was like a second mother - our mom was great, but when you've got seven....anyway, she was the best cook in the world. Obviously enjoyed her own too. We still got along, she was, heh, larger than life. After I started wandering, I kinda missed having homecooked meals, being able to hang out in the kitchen on a rainy day...this was the next best thing.\" As she talked, Kay and the rest of the group chowed down on the pizza. Bridgette could feel her stomach getting distended, but she figured she could make it to the end. Fortunately, Kay hadn't eaten yet, and dug in voraciously now. She liked to keep herself in shape, eh? Bridgette could only imagine what a month of working here would do to the Jolteon moemon. Then again, the gang was staying nearly that long on vacation, so maybe she should be worried....not now, though. Now was just a slightly (more than slightly, really) heavier meal among friends.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harley was up to something, that was for sure. She was up to about forty feet, holding calmly onto the railing in front of her seat. The ferris wheel she had found was one of only a few rides on the beach, like a theme park in its infancy, but it was a decent ride nonetheless. Harley's mouth was sticky with the remnants of cotton candy, and she hummed happily to herself as she crested the peak of her revolution. For a few brief moments, she got the boardwalk and beach all in view, picture perfect. The boardwalk was rather extensive, but nothing legendary. Packed tight with gimmicky shops, but nearly a third of it was propery sit-in eateries, and nearly half of them sold food of some description. Not too odd, especially as there seemed to be plenty of people to fill every shop and eatery. A good mix of tourists and locals, Harley guessed by the way many frantically went from stall to stall to stall (tourists making the most of their day) to calmer-moving individuals with a clear purpose in mind and who maneuvered the crowds expertly (the locals).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley hadn't actually yet changed into her bathing suit, but here, lifted up closer to the naked sun, she was wishing she had. The heat flustered her a little, and she began to look for somewhere cool to go once the ride was over. Unfortunately, there didn't appear to be that many places that would offer her a quiet respite - oh sure, plenty of places had air conditioning, but they were also packed, and Harley would be prodded mercilessly to buy something while she was in there. She decided the quickest and surest course of action would be to get herself an ice cream. Once she got off this ride!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was off, Harley was sweating. She usually had a calm, some would say mysterious, demeanor, but it was broken by her need to combat the heat. There were enough ice cream vendors around that she only had a short line to wait through. It was soft serve, even! She got a simple cone full of vanilla - she just needed to cool off, after all. However, it was gone in a flash, the cold tasting better than the actual flavor. And it didn't change a thing. Harley went sweating into a shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, excuse me.\" she asked, spying a name tag. \"Where you got around here that's cool? That I can sit down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darned Tourissssstssssss.....\" said a familiar (for us) face. \"There'sssssss covesssss on the beach jussst north if you can walk it. If not, try the movie theater. Are you going to buy ssssssomething, or jussst sssssstand there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley blinked at him. \"You talk funny.\" she said with a laugh. \"Thanks. Oh, I mean thankssssss.\" she laughed and exited the store, apparently oblivious to the twin beams of hate directed at her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worssssse every time I talk to them.\"</span></div></div>",

At the very least, she would\u2019ve been able to soak her feet in the waters hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the Abra Moemon to find the cove, and much to her prior thoughts, there wasn\u2019t a soul in sight in the beautiful scenery. The circular costal recess was surrounded by several rocks that were dulled down from countless years of erosion with a rather large pool of sea water that had a large rock seated in the middle of the pool of water, almost acting as a small island in the water. Taking off her shoes and socks (which was more difficult since they were knee socks), Harley sat down on one of the smooth rocks and dipped her feet into the water, \u201cAhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cool ocean breeze being captured in the rocky surroundings, Harley had to admit that the Seviper moemon was right with this location. There was a good mix of shade and sun, a cool breeze, and the salty water that flowed around her feet \u2013 This was almost the best place to spend a hot day\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 but that brought up a good question. \u2018<i>Why aren\u2019t there any other people here? If this is such a good place to kill a hot day\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Harley immediately shrugged off and threw her arms behind her head, yawning loudly. If there was no one around, then it would be a perfect time to take a nap and get away from any noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad that just as Harley was about to close her eyes, a loud splash echoed through the air, making her look down at the pool of water to see someone standing up from the pool of water, just in time to see\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He had just emerged from the water, apparently, still dripping wet and looking more like a swamp thing in swim shorts than a man. He had a sharp nose and a prominent jaw, and clearly at home in the water, looking so natural even half in it. A water moemon of some sort, and Harley just guessed (randomly, of course) that he was a totodile. He had a large sack over his shoulder, and eyed Harley with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touring the beaches.\" Harley said calmly, stifling a yawn. \"Is this off limits to tourists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yur a tourist?\" the man asked, shifting the bag slightly. It was something bulky and awkward, whatever it was. Harley nodded with a disarming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to the beaches.\" the man said gruffly. \"It's not safe for tourists 'round here.\" he turned around and exited the cage. Harley shrugged and followed him out. The man whipped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You following me?\" he growled. Harley cocked her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you say I should leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, right. Yeah, good then.\" he said. He kept cocking his head back at her, but started heading for another cove, of which there were nearly a dozen. Harley stopped to watch him. He had stopped looking back. He entered the fourth one down from Harley. Harley shrugged and headed back to her cove. She seated herself back down and yawned. No sense following that up while the burly man was around. Harley closed her eyes and listened to the waves until she promptly and quietly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Harley awoke, the sky was orange. It wasn't sunset, but she could see the sun heading for the horizon. Harley got up and scratched her head. She usually didn't sleep that long. She exited the cove, and took a moment to stretch. As she did so, something in the sand caught her eye. A fresh set of footprints, not yet washed away, leading past her cave and into the sea a little bit later. Looked like some sort of swimmer had just left the way he came. What fortuitous timing. Harley shrugged to herself, and decided to see what made that cove over there so special.</span></div></div>",

She winced as she patted her stomach, it was rare that the group actually pigged out like that (it was super rare actually), but considering that they\u2019d be here for the week and with all the exercise that was bound to hit them, binging out on pizza, soda and lemonade for one day would be too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, considering that the meal had lasted a couple of hours, that wasn\u2019t a good sign at all. But if you asked Bridgette, actually able to avoid going out on the beach and show off her paunchy body, anything was an alternative, and considering how much pizza she ate, she\u2019d have that \u2018no swimming after you eat\u2019 excuse to last her until night time (which wasn\u2019t too far off from now). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, these thoughts were in her head before she had eaten herself into a small food coma, with her snoozing on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary on the other hand, well, after downing all those sugary drinks and more than her fair share of seafood pizza, she was literally bouncing her seat (along with the large mounds that were confined in her tight swimsuit). \u201cWhatnextwhatnextwhatnextwhatnext?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI think you need to tone it down,\u201d Keslie sighed, it was getting a bit difficult to talk and breathe since she had to wince every time due to the amount she had in her stomach. \u201cWe gotta find Harley and find a hotel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarley one of your friends?\u201d Kay asked as she trotted back over to the table. Kay did spend a good portion of the time with the girls and helped them chow down on some of their food (and even decided to help pay off some of it, of course), but since she was still an employee she had to go back to the kitchen to do some work. However, the odd thing was, only the three Moemon girls were still the only customers in the restaurant, but they paid it no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Keslie answered with a slightly pained smile. \u201cKnowing her, she\u2019s probably just snoozing somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my shift\u2019s almost up, if ya want, I could help find her,\u201d Kay offered with a bright smile on her electrified face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! Yeah! And you can show us around too!\u201d Mary added, having taken a shine to the other electric Moemon in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have time for a tour either,\u201d Keslie sighed as she stood up from the table, mainly to make sure that she wasn\u2019t melded to her seat. \u201cLike I said we have to find a motel too before they get booked\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can solve that for ya!\u201d Kay announced with her smile growing even brighter. \u201cI live at a beach house not too far from here, I\u2019ve got two roommates, but the place is really big, got enough bedrooms to have a handful of guests join us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeslie raised an eyebrow at the invitation, sure, the Jolteon Moemon did hit it off well with the group, but still, to offer residence after just spending a couple of hours together? Either Kay was incredibly generous and kind or she didn\u2019t really care if someone stole something from her. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to impose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d Kay replied, placing her hands on her trim hips. \u201cSides, around this time, the hotels are usually packed up tighter with tourists and get so loud because of kids and such, you should take up my offer, we\u2019ve got a great view of the beach and one of my roommates is going to grill out later tonight! You haven\u2019t lived till you tasted one of Jaws\u2019 burgers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I told ya not to call me by that name,\u201d A loud groan echoed through the nearly deserted restaurant, garnering the attention of Kay, Keslie and even Mary (who was trying to lick the glasses clean of whatever lemonade she might\u2019ve missed) towards the front entrance, just in time to see the same Totodile Moemon that Harley had bumped into at the coves (not that anyone here would\u2019ve known that). He even still had the same sack that Harely saw him with earlier, albeit it seemed a bit smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Perfect timing Jaws!\u201d Kay cheered as she ran over to the sighing Totodile Moemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I just say?\u201d \u2018Jaws\u2019 sighed with a shake of his head. \u201cDo I look like a Sharpedo? And how hard is it to remember Simmons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but Jaws sounds so much cooler!\u201d Kay explained, expecting that her answer would be acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Jaws is awesome!\u201d Mary added, getting Jaws\u2019 attention drawn to the curvaceous Raichu Moemon for a few moments before he sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW\u2019ever,\u201d Jaws groaned as he shifted the bag over his shoulder. \u201cAnd what do you mean by perfect timing Kay? I always come here to finish my rounds of deliveries\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m glad you came at this moment!\u201d Kay replied holding her hand up towards the group at the table. \u201cThese girls need a place to stay for a while, think you\u2019ve got room in that beach house and heart of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaws sighed again as he smiled, \u201cKay, ya know I yer bro \u2013 Noir and I used to be teammates a while back, and if I can handle ya and yer sister Miyu staying at my place, then a few more guests ain\u2019t gonna kill me. Although, I wish ya tell me ahead of time if ya wanna invite someone over instead of putting me on the spot like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s settled!\u201d Kay laughed as she spun on her heel and jumped back to the table group. \u201cJaws says its okay, so what do ya say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! He said it was okay!\u201d Mary echoed her fellow electric Moemon, and looked at Keslie with pleading eyes. \u201cSo come on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeslie sighed loudly as she rubbed the side of her hair, \u201cWell, I guess if we won\u2019t be a bother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYAY!\u201d Both Kay and Mary cheered at the same time, waking up Bridgette from her food coma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What just happened? What I miss?\u201d Bridgette questioned, her mind still half asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well if she wanted to sleep, I don't think we'll find her here!\" Kay said with a laugh. Mary laughed back heartier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said as she began a peppy walk down the boardwalk, \"we find her asleep in weird places. Once, she was hanging from a jungle gym, upside down as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cha. Kids were poking her with sticks. That was a sweet jungle gym.\" Mary said, making Kay laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Hey, let's head down to the beaches, maybe she's on a bench or something.\" Kay offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Race ya!\" Mary said, taking off through the crowd. Surprised, it took a minute for Kay to start. Mary was ahead of her, and Kay got to see Mary's pert little bottom wiggle in front of her as they dashed through the crowds, an action Mary was an expert at. She found nooks and gaps between people Kay hadn't even seen, much less she thought she could get to. Mary was also calling out a chorus of ' 'scuse me's like it was a battle cry. By the time Kay got onto the sand, Mary was already waiting for her, chest heaving from the run. It caught quite a few eyes, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.\" Kay said. \"You're pretty fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what I do.\" Mary said, scratching her head. \"That and climb things. Hey, gotta live life to the fullest, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay's heart wasn't just thumping from the run on a full stomach. She nodded and tried to smile casually. Oblivious to this, Mary had turned around to scan for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not seeing anything.\" she complained. Kay sidled up to her, confirming that no one looking like an oddly-dressed abra was to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, maybe....no, that's a lump of seaweed.\" Mary said, pouting. Kay giggled at Mary's protruding lower lip. She reached up and quickly darted a hand through Mary's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, we'll keep looking.\" she said, jogging across the sand, diagonally towards the surf. Mary paused, a bit confused by the intimate touch. Maybe she had found someone as big on contact as her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...lost one friend, found another!\" Mary said, going after the electric moemon with glee.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun that shined over the wondrous beach gave the entire ocean a look that it was almost on fire, the reflection in the water waving about. Several young couples were seated on the sandy beach as they watched the sun slowly disappear over the water\u2019s horizon, with good reason, there seemed to be a certain something in the air that would bring couples closer together \u2013 Both physically and romantically (although, depending on the couple, the two could be the one in the same). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was one thing that could shatter that very romantic aura between couples\u2026 Two big things actually\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHARLEY! WHERE\u2019D YA GO?!\u201d Mary yelled through the air as she walked on the cooling off warm sand, Kay walking alongside her as the two graced the beach in front of many of the couples. Unknowingly, the two bouncing mounds that were Mary\u2019s breasts that struggled to escape from her confining bikini top as well as the toned bods of both electric Moemon had caught the attention of a good number of half of the couples on the beach\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that every time the two passed in front of a couple, when there was a loud slapping sound that echoed through the air behind them. Of course, this continuous event was falling on deaf ears of both Mary and Kay as they continued their search for the missing Abra Moemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph,\u201d Mary sighed loudly as she slouched forward, giving Kay a good view of the curved behind. \u201cWhere\u2019d Harley go to?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said she usually sleeps in weird places,\u201d Kay pointed out, remembering that story that Mary had told her earlier. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s someplace like that jungle gym or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Yeah!\u201d Mary cheerfully replied as she jumped back, giving her chest a healthy bounce. \u201cYa know anywhere like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I dunno,\u201d Kay answered with her shoulders lifted up and a cute, if not confused look on her face. \u201cI\u2019ve been mostly working since I got here\u2026 But I know someone who would know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay grasped Mary\u2019s hand and began pulling the curvaceous Raichu Moemon across the beach. At first Mary struggled at the sudden contact, but immediately managed to keep up with Kay\u2019s pace. \u201cC\u2019mon! He should be off work \u2018bout now! We might just be able to catch him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! Hide n\u2019 seek and tag?\u201d Mary gleefully stated with a large grin on her face. \u201cThis day just keeps getting funner and funner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">TTTTTTT</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boardwalk, while still busy with the night crowd, did have a few shops closed up for the night, which for one certain tattoo covered, Seviper Moemon meant only one thing. \u201cAnother day, another sssssssssssmoke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, leaning against the side of the shop he worked at was none other than the Seviper \u2013 Griff, a lit cigarette in his mouth to help burn away his stress that he had gotten from the day\u2019s gaggle of annoying customers. Of course, there were a few that didn\u2019t annoy him, like those two girls that were his first visitors, they only had a few questions (and that Ninetails Moemon did at least provide Griff with a decent wake up call with a beautiful \u2018view\u2019). Another was that weirdly dressed Abra Moemon, once again, no sale, but still, he had to answer questions, not too bad, just a mild annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real trouble was roughly about when the lunch hour had occurred, a mob of Moemon had rushed into his shop, trying to find some \u2018curvy party crasher\u2019 that had apparently ruined a volleyball tournament that was organized by a whole bunch of college students. When Griff had told them that he didn\u2019t see any \u2018curvy party crasher\u2019 (whatever that meant), a small number of the mob had marched out of the store to continue their search\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a majority of the mob had seemed to have caught sight of a few interesting trinkets, shirts or whatever crap that was stocked in Griff\u2019s shop. So, for the next two hours, Grif had to continuously ring up purchases, answer questions (some about the curvy party crasher) or even had to do the unthinkable \u2013 Act courteous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only good thing about that experience was that Griff was able to fill up his quota for the day and then some, which had allowed the Seviper Moemon close up shop earlier than usual (the boss really did care for profits, but was otherwise very lax when it came to opening and closing). And here he was, enjoying his before dinner-time smoke, the sound of beachgoers in the background, but was drowned out by Griff\u2019s head as he focused only on the tobacco\u2019s burning taste and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGRIFFY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriff\u2019s eyes nearly bugged out from behind his shades, making him drop his cigarette from his mouth and onto the ground, \u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are Griffy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head to the side, Griff saw that standing only a few feet away was a certain slim, Jolteon Moemon that he had the misfortune of knowing for the last couple of weeks or so \u2013 Kay. She always seemed to have a knack for catching the Seviper and surprising him whenever he had just taken his first puff of a cigarette and somehow managed to ruin it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriff\u2019s thoughts of anger quickly melted away to confusion and curiosity when he noticed that Kay\u2019s hand was grasping onto another person\u2019s hand \u2013 his eyes traveled up the arm and then focused onto a pair of the largest, bikini-clad mountains that he had seen in his time working on the beach (and that was saying something!), at least on a Moemon that had a figure that was as slim as Kay\u2019s (save for the precious curves of this young lass\u2019s hips and the small dome of a belly). Not wanting to get annoyed to death, Griff closed his eyes at the Raichu Moemon he was leering at and returned to his angered demeanor, \u201cOh, itssssssss you\u2026 Kay, what do I owe this interruption to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you know that I\u2019m saving your life whenever I interrupt you!\u201d Kay giggled as Mary lifted her hands up to her nose to block the smell of tobacco smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww\u2026 That\u2019s smelly!\u201d Mary complained with her other hand waved in front of her face a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClassy,\u201d Griff mumbled, using his sandal covered to crush and put out his cigarette. \u201cWho\u2019ssssss thisssssssss sssssssupposed to be? Amazon of the ssssssssummer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kay could say anything, a stifled snicker echoed through the air, making both Kay and Griff turn to the curvaceous Raichu Moemon who had just erupted into a loud explosion of laughter with her hand held up towards Griff. \u201cHehehahahaha! He t-talks so hohoho weird!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay smiled brightly as well and joined in the laughter, making the Seviper Moemon develop a large bead of sweat that rolled down the side of his head. \u2018<i>That was my last cigarette, and I\u2019m ssssso tempted to pick it up from the ground to ssssssssmoke it\u2026 There\u2019ssssss two of them now!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is why Mariah's shirts are usually designed and made of flexible steel. Her curves are located mainly in her lower body, explaining her soft thighs, which is where most of her fat is directed to. This gives Mariah a pear shaped body, something she loves, so she accentuates it by often wearing steel gray jeans and her flexible steel shirts, which mold to her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlace-17<br>\r\n5'6\" 108.7 lbs.<br>\r\nNearly twice as heavy as a nornal Glaceon, Glace can make all the air around her drop to a temperature as low as -20 degrees Farenheit, and she can summon blizzards at will. Her usual outfit is light sky blue T shirt and sky blue jeans, which accentuate her small butt and breasts. She often wears a blue belt to further show off her skinny body, set on minimum length to make a tight waistband tighter. She cannot get cold, so she can wear anything at any time to keep herself relatively cool.</span></div></div>",

This has lead to multiple mishaps with people thinking she is topless or not wearing pants, most of which end up with the rude starers getting bitten or tackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVane-17 (Vaporeon)<br>\r\n115.1 lbs 5'6\"<br>\r\nVane is one of the older girls in the group and has the attacks listed:<br>\r\n-Rain Dance<br>\r\n-Hydro Pump<br>\r\n-Aqua Ring<br>\r\n-Aurora Beam<br>\r\nVane's weight is almost completely centered around her waist, giving her a dramatic pear shape. Her waist circumference is roughly 35 inches, but Vane doesn't care about her body. As long as she can move, she's OK with it. Her skin is a light blueish color, not really exaggerated, but noticeable if you look closely. She also blushes blue (weird, huh?) and usually wears dark blue clothing, often showing off her blue hair (weirder, huh?) and blue eyes (not as weird).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlare-16 (Flareon)<br>\r\n112.8 lbs 5'5\"<br>\r\nFlare is in the middle of the group when it comes to age, and knows these attcks:<br>\r\n-Sunny Day<br>\r\n-Flamethrower<br>\r\n-Fire Blast<br>\r\n-SolarBeam<br>\r\nFlare's skin always looks sunburnt, but it's really just a red skin pigment that she got after coming into contact with a Fire Stone. Flare has an extremely athletic body and almost no fat anywhere. [We can fix that too &gt;:)] She often wears bright red clothes to bring out the red in her skin and hair, as well as her eyes. She has quite a temper if angered and will throw anything from fireballs to rocks to Eve at anyone who upsets her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane-16 (Jolteon)<br>\r\n108.2 lbs 5'5\"<br>\r\nJane knows:<br>\r\n-Thunder Wave<br>\r\n-Thunderbolt<br>\r\n-Double Kick<br>\r\n-Agility<br>\r\nJane's skin and eyes are yellow, making her hard to look at in bright light. Her blond hair is accentuated by her bright yellow clothes, which oddly glow in the dark, making her a living lightbulb when needed. Being fast, Jane doesn't weigh much, but she does have above average sized breasts that attract any male moemon in the area. Jane desn't tire easily and often uses Agility even when out of battle to outdistance her slower friends. When she does get tired, she does what most people think is the most retarded thing ever--she sticks her finger in an electrical socket. This charges her up, actually making her more powerful (she dared Vane to do it once and got tackled by her after the fact).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspi-17 (Espeon)<br>\r\n131.8 lbs 5'6\"<br>\r\nEspi's atacks are:<br>\r\n-Psychic<br>\r\n-Future Sight<br>\r\n-Morning Sun<br>\r\n-Swift<br>\r\nEspi is normally the optimist of the group, but usually loses her happy attitude when she actually looks at her overweight body. Her breasts are above-average, but other than that, her overweight body does nothing to please her. Her stomach shows from under her purple shirts and forces her legs apart when she sits, and her butt and thighs put a lot of strain on every pair of purple pants she wears. She doesn't like this much purplish-pink skin showing, and has tried and failed numerous times to stop her quickening weight gain, often with tears in her purple eyes and tugging on her purple hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbi-18 (Umbreon)<br>\r\n119.1 lbs 5'8\"<br>\r\nUmbi is Espi's sister and knows:<br>\r\n-Dark Pulse<br>\r\n-Moonlight<br>\r\n-Faint Attack<br>\r\n-Mean Look<br>\r\nUmbi is the pessimist and leader of the group and constantly reminds Espi and Vane of their overweight-ness. Her skin is solid black, the same shade as her hair, eyes, and clothes. She herself is just slightly overweight, all of it going to her stomach and butt. She currently has a perfectly circular waist with the soft stomach to boot, bt she is still the perfect nighttime assassin if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to make your own scenarios!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bright sun beamed down making the large blue waters and golden sands sparkle beautifully. A cool breeze swept through the area and brought the scent of saltwater with it. A group consisting of four female Moemon and two guys rode a boat across the large ocean. The girls: Milly the Miltank, Tina the Medicham, Oceana the Dewgong and Lady the Machoke all looked excitedly out. For this moment their competition for love was set aside for this neutral joy of the trip. Ranger the Lucario was looking quite happy himself seeing them getting along for the first time in so long. They were going on a vacation to an island called Colostic Island which though recently opened up was highly ranked for their glorious beach, five-star hotel and their wonderful food. Who won\u2019t be happy about going to a place like that for free? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to that was the sixth member of the team. He sat in the shaded area of the boat and didn\u2019t even look a bit ecstatic. It looked like he annoyed even thinking about the days to come\u2026but even if he didn\u2019t show it he was a little happy. It was his first time being invited on a trip with a friend; he just hated beach, the sun and most of all the company of the people he would be stuck with. But it made Ranger happy so he decided to suffer though four painful weeks. Someone had to stop the love craving animals from smothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boat docked the group of them gathered their stuff before taking a nice little bus ride. Arriving at the hotel, which really was walking distance from where they got off. Even Greg was impressive at the hotel in front of them. It had to be like hundred floors tall and like four hundred floor if you turned it to its side. The door was unbelievably large and as it opened cool refreshing air blew over them. The lobby was shiny and so clean it look like you could slide across with no problem. Topical plants and flowers decorated the area giving it a vivid and lively aura. All of the female Moemon was entranced by their surrounding but everyone one thought this would be the perfect place to bond with their beloved Ranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2018t this place wonderful,\u201d Milly made to first advancement toward him getting real close in touching range of him. She might have grabbed onto his arm but Greg put himself between them stopping her advancement in its place. She growled under her breath, her blue eyes glaring at him and the Male Gardevoir pretended to not notice her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, really great I\u2018m sure it\u2018ll be really fun.\u201d Ranger responded as a way to calm her fury. Hearing his voice definitely did the trick. Greg couldn\u2019t up but groaned in sickened disgust, he saw the look in the other girls eyes\u2026 so it was about to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 These plants are\u2026 real great don\u2018t you think so Ranger?\u201d Lady tried to make small talk with him. Her eyes looked ready to receive an answer from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah great, this is a paradise for hay fever people.\u201d Greg barked a reply to her. Lady glared at him, she was least interest in the stupid flowers and plants than he was but she wasn\u2019t talking to him. She clenched her fist tightly, though she restrained herself clocking for Ranger's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall tanned Hitmonlee worker walked by, Oceana threw him one of her famous winks and he sure seem to like that his eyes staying on the Dewgong until he left the room. She looked back at the other girls who had witness this act with a cocky smirk. It was her way of showing how easily she could get another guy is wanted. She was also hoping to make Ranger a little jealous but unfortunately he was as indifferences as ever\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ranger, let's see if the room's vibe is better over here\u2026 <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><i>away from these people.</i></font>\u201d It was Tina turn to try get him away from her competition. But like everyone else directly went for him she got backlash from annoying green haired source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow fun it is to check out \u2018vibes\u2019 in different parts of the room miss hippie, I get this feeling we check in before we enjoy the wonderful scenery.\u201d All four them were glaring at him they knew as long as he was around, no one would have a good conversation with Ranger; they knew if they wanted to any chance with their Lucario love, they would have to get him out of the picture. \u201cYes keep glaring at me; everything will be accomplished by doing that.\u201d With that line the girls turned and headed for the front desk\u2026 it seemed they also get along when they all had neutral hatred of the same person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, Greg? You seem more\u2026 agitated than usual.\u201d The blue hair Lucario rather concernly asked his paled skinned friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeachy just peachy, what can be more fun than spending four week with three, I mean four lovely ladies?\u201d His tone of voice was very sarcastic with that line and Ranger looked rather discontent\u2026 He felt this would be a very long four week vacation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Milly was in pure shock this morning as her blue eyes stared down. In her disbelief she could do nothing but continue to look in horror. The most terrible thing to have ever happen\u2026 she had gained 11 pounds. It was kind of obvious since earlier her pants were uncomfortable tight and she was struggling to get them close. But to have gain that much was just unbelievable to her, after she worked so hard to keep it down. She continued to gape at the result long after it had vanished from the scale; her mind was in panic as her body remained in a frozen state. She was finally snapped out of it by pounding on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry it up already, other people need the bathroom!\u201d The furious voice cut through the room as if it wasn\u2019t a door blocking it. That was her brother \u2018Bull\u2019 a Tauros though is real name is William which their parent annoyingly shorten to Billy. Billy and Milly\u2026 their parents were so corny. The Miltank stun-locked mind was freed by his voice and she quickly began to do what she needed in the bathroom. \u201cDon\u2019t make me break down this door!\u201d He threatened after waiting about a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, hold your dang Ponyta! I\u2019m hurrying!\u201d She barked back at him as she tried to quicken her pace a bit. After couple of minutes more of listening to her brother moaning and complaining she burst out of the bathroom and went straight to her room. She was mostly upset about her weight gain but also incredibly peeved by her brother's annoyance while she was in the bathroom. Once in her room she closed and locked it. She walked in from of her full size mirror which was more than tall enough with her short self. She began to examine herself more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight flush skin, a nicely curvy body with a generously large bust and nice wide hips gave her a hourglass figure effect. Her body would be great if wasn\u2019t for that fat belly of hers. Grabbing and shaking it her whole body jiggled a bit. As she squeezed it in her hands she definitely thought she could feel those extra pounds of forming there. Milly turned and to get a side image and her belly was definitely sticking out more. A frown appeared on her face and she put on her traditional pink blouse and bellbottom pants on. Normally loose they were snug on her body now which only upset her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like I\u2019m going to have to cut down some more,\u201d the girl told herself with much dismay. With someone with a huge appetite and sweet-tooth such as her dieting was such a pain. But it had to be done if she wanted to stand a chance to win the love of her life. With a sigh Milly left her room and went downstairs to the kitchen. She got herself an apple and a tiny bowl of plain Cheerios. She got out the skim milk that no one else in her family would dear touch and put a small amount of it in. And that was her breakfast. It was three times smaller than it usually was. As she began to eat her mother walked in and concernedly eyed her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMilly, that\u2019s a little small for just breakfast.\u201d Her mom pointed out. Her body swayed as she entered; Milly\u2019s mom was a heavy set woman with gorgeous curves and large size gut to match it. It wasn\u2019t too bad as she had a couple of inches on her daughter; the fifteen year old girl was a near splitting image of her mom thus she could tell exactly how she\u2019d look with a lot more weight. That would be too much for her to be comfortable with and it was probably the same for Ranger. \u201cDon\u2019t you normally eat a little more than this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m lowering my calorie intake\u2026\u201d The teen told her mom has she slowly chewed her food. After swallowing a bite she continued. \u201cEven though my intake hasn\u2019t change I\u2019ve started to gain weight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 I see. Milly give me some of you milk.\u201d She suddenly asked which made the girl stop and look directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, why?!\u201d The blue-eyed girl questioned her parent with a look of utter confusion. It was just a random thing for her mother to say all of the sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do it, Mildred.\u201d The older lady ordered sternly, Dad and Bull were really starting to rub off on her. Milly did what she was told and filled up a bottle\u2026 she actually had more milk than usual which was quite odd. After giving it to her mom, she took a small sip of it. \u201cHmm\u2026 I see. Have you been spending time around babies or young kids, Sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, my new part-time job at the daycare. What\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d Milly had started the job close to two weeks ago. It was fairly good pay in afternoon on weekdays and early morning on weekends for only a couple of hours. But the relevance of that to what they were talking about just didn\u2019t click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe richest of your milk. Like all Miltanks you produce milk. But when Miltanks are in the presence of babies and young children their body produces much more nutritious milk and a whole lot of it. The weight you gained is certainly because of that.\u201d The girl\u2019s mom explained and that definitely made sense she was heavier because of an extra supply of milk in her body; the inconvenience of having Miltank genes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, who would have thought this would a result of trying to get some extra money...\u201d She murmured as she looked down at her gut it looked bloated despite letting out some milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good milk it too bad we couldn\u2019t sell it.\u201d Mom just suddenly stated as put a top on the bottle and set it on the table. Her statement peak her daughter\u2019s interest once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Milly asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell other than the fact I think you\u2019re too young to get in the Milk Business, the nutrition of the milk is much too high to give to anyone. It\u2019s perfect for young kids and babies that need it to help their growth but for older people it\u2019ll be too much nourishment which will cause their body to store the excess amount.\u201d She clarified her statement in detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that this milk will make non-children gain weight?\u201d Milly asked just make sure she understood exactly what her mother was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly it.\u201d She mused at her daughter for putting together what she had told her. Her small smile turned back into a concerned look for the girl. \u201cOh Milly, I suggest you give your milk to the kids at the daycare; it'll be good for them and it will also help with your current gain. So don\u2019t push yourself too hard with the dieting, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Mom, thanks for the info. I will make good use of it.\u201d Mom walked over to the cabinet and began to get out ingredients. As her mother did that a plan appeared in her head. If this milk would make people gain weight she could even the score of her competition by getting them to drink a lot of it and gain a whole lot of weight. Other than Lady who religiously works out hard, Tina and Oceana had terrible eating and exercising habits making them a perfect target. All she needed was an excuse to give it to them often and watch the pounds pile on. But it another thought came to mind was just how effective would be? As she finished the last bite of her apple she began to ponder on her next course of action.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Purin has, poofy pink color haired that's medium length and wavy, however she has a curly bang that's located at the center of her forehead. The pink bunny ears found on all Wigglytuff jut from the top of her head. Her attire consists of a pink turtle necked sweater with fushia dress. Often wears slippers that are also of the pink color, but will wear red pumps when ever she leaves the house. <br>\r\nPersonality: Despite her somewhat odd (and childish) name, Purin is something of a 'Team Mom'; although in this sense she's a bit of an...eccentric team mom. Purin's personality is rather odd and erratic, not easily readable by many and yet admired by some for it grants her unfailing cheerfulness towards most situations even if it's a dangerous one. However, despite her odd personality, her maternal traits shine through nonetheless, doing well to take care of the younger members of her team, Hayami and Ritsu, although this doesn't stop her from trying to baby Kumada, much to his embarassment... <br>\r\nExtra: Rumor has it that Purin's youth was filled with her being a troublemaker unlike any other, she rarely confirms this but doesn't say it's untrue either. Despite her pink and fluffy exterior, Purin's increadibly strong in the physical department, she may very well be equal to (or might even surpass) Kumada in terms of physical prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Hayami Yuta<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\n- Pichu<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nDescription: Short, being only around 4'4\", with a slightly tanned complexion. Dons, short bright yellow hair with the large ears of his species on top of his head. Wears a yellow, sleeveless vest and a black scarf of sorts, below are his black shorts that seem to go well white and yellow sneakers. Wears BlackGlasses atop his head...probably as a way to make him look Cool/Tough.<br>\r\nPersonality: Hayami is much like any excitable youth his age, being driven by impulse and whatever else that brings him an adrenaline rush. Being the youngest of the group, Hayami does have a childish streak that's just as strong as his impulsive and rash nature. This being said, Hayami believes in himself to a large degree and feels that he can take on anything he wants so long as he has the willpower coursing through his body to propel him forward through whatever has challenged him. Of course, this doesn't always work out and, for the times it doesn't, he's often in a rut trying to figure out just how he failed or why. Also seems to be simple minded and can cause a lot of trouble because of his actions...<br>\r\nExtra: Like all Pichu, he can't control his electric powers and thus shocks himself on occasions. However, he is noted for having unusually powerful electrical powers for his age. Has a crush on Ritsu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ritsu Akimori<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\n- Emolga<br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nDescription: Second shortest next to Hayami, being around 5'4\" and has a fair complexion. Ritsu's hair is black and fashioned in a bob cut, her rounded Emolga ears near the side of her head. Has a white shirt and a yellow, plaid skirt with black loafers. Wears a black capelet with a yellow underside. Her 'Emolga tail' pokes out from over her dress, instead of under. Ritsu has a somewhat slender figure, one that's easily dwarfed by Purin's zaftig figure. Although, as far as this goes, Ritsu has 'wide hips'...which could easily hint on where most of her fat could end up provided she gains anything.<br>\r\nPersonality: Ritsu is a rather skittish girl and easily startled, alongside this is her huge weakness for embarrassment. It doesn't take much to get this Emolga blushing, even talking about her childhood will get her to cover her ears in embarrassment. Around others, she's fairly quiet and doesn't go out of her way to speak unless spoken to, however if given a chance to open up she can be friendly and kind. Ritsu hates being treated differently because of her gender, having grown up in a home that consisted of, mostly male individuals, she feels she can do just as good as any boy so long as she's given the chance to excel.<br>\r\nExtra: Is a bit of a nerd and has a liking towards computers. Is a big eater, claiming her voracious appetite is due to her 'lightning fast' metabolism, something that's actually not uncommon among Emolga or other rodent type pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Kumada Maehata<br>\r\nGender:Male<br>\r\n- Ursaring<br>\r\nAge: 35<br>\r\nDescription: Has an appearance very fitting for his species; large, burly, and generally intimidating with a combined appearance of both muscled and chubby. Kumada is essentially the tallest of the group, being around 6'11\" with short brown hair and small bear-like ears on his head, has a rather gruff facial appearance with a stubble of facial hair along his chin. Wears a brown, short-sleeved button up shirt with a tan ring located on the back of said shirt. Dark green trousers and dark brown boots.<br>\r\nPersonality: A hardened and rather imposing individual who's mere visage instills fear in anyone around him. In truth, he's not as bad as he looks and has a rather gentle personality, Purin telling of how he can be 'one big ol' teddy bear'...much to his embarrassment. Having experienced many battles in his youth and even more so after his evolution, Kumada is an expert on fighting and uses this experience to protect his team and better himself as a fighter. As the oldest, he sees it as his duty to make sure the 'youngins' don't get into too much trouble and tries to keep them safe if a powerful foe arises. Also seems to have had a past relationship with Purin, but rarely speaks of it in greater detail beyond 'we were young then'...<br>\r\nExtra: Sleeps a lot, living up to the 'Hibernation' part of his species. Has an innate fear for Poison Moemon and taught himself 'Earthquake' as a counter measure of dealing with them. Beware if his 'Guts' ability awakens...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The four of them live in a small town and take various missions that come in the mail. Although they have no specific type of mission they'll accept, it's been known that they excel at exploration and rescue missions. They can also be divided into separate teams to expand the fields of missions they can go into, Hayami and Ritsu are great with scouting missions, while Kumada and Purin work well in catching fugitive Moemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= Scenerios =<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- My Enormous Emolga: Ritsu, frustrated that she was unable to catch a Fugitive Moemon who was much bigger than her, seeks to make her self stonger any way she can so she can give the mission another go. Of course, Purin being the motherly figure she is knows of one way she can help the power hungry Emolga...by making her pudgy of course. Although, given how things tend to go...could Purin and other Moemon also be sucked into this little plot as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Michi no Boushoku ~ Desires Connected to Enlightenment: The Team gets a strange request from a gourmet moemon to help escort her to the Pagoda of Feasts located at the peak of the Yama no Tengoku (Mountain of Heaven). Word has it that all the best competitive eaters, chefs and conisuerrs head there for all sorts of knowledge on food, dishes and recipes. Their client seeks to find and taste the elusive <b>Holy Pie of Gautama</b> and learn of it's secret taste. It's going to be a rough journey up the mountain, but Purin's packed lots of food for the trip and there's rumor that the mountain itself is fertile with all sorts of berries and fruits to indulge upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- ???: You decided how the story goes. It's a free write adventure, basically.</span></div></div>",

He loves all his friends, but his best friend is Honey. He has a brutal and violent nature; he loves to fight.<br>\r\nExtra: He and Honey have known each other since they were born, and considering that they were born at the same second, that's a long time. When their mothers were taking them home from the hospital, they looked at each other in their mother's arms they started cooing and reaching out for each other. Their mothers noticed this and set them down on the ground. As soon as they were on the ground, they crawled over to each other and started hugging(Awwwwww... Cute...) and when their moms picked them up and seperated them, they started crying. Their parents didn't want their babies crying all the time so they bought a house they could all live in. As a result, they did everything together: eat, sleep bathe, (yes they took baths together. So what?!) you name it. Logan loves Honey like a sister, and is overprotective of her. Logan also has a love for fat girls, and is proud of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney<br>\r\nLopunny morph<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nAppearance: As tall as Logan, long brown hair that matches her beautiful, silky fur, slim frame,<br>\r\nPersonality: She's a real sultry sweetheart. She loves to show off her sexy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber<br>\r\nGrowlithe morph<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nAppearance: Chubby and cute.<br>\r\nPersonality: Shy, but sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choose what scenario they undertake</span></div></div>",

She usually wears a black sleeveless top and a white skirt. Despite her appearance being like that of a little girl, she has breasts, albeit small ones.<br>\r\nPersonality: She has a conceited and snide attitude towards most people she meets, and loves making quips when she feels she needs to.She's the self designated leader, and considers her team hopeless without her. She does have a soft spot, however.<br>\r\nExtra:She's a former idol that left the bustling city in pursuit of her finding fame and fortune outside of her career.

To call it a big city would be an understatement; Anita\u2019s hometown was practically dwarfed by this giant, and that was just another reason why she wanted to go there. The town had everything: fancy restaurants, beach resorts, fighting tournaments, casinos, motels, theater, you name it. And at least one of these appealed to the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, things weren't going quite as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe we had to pay a toll!\"  Anita stomped her foot and pouted. Her face that was posted on numerous billboards in her earlier career, was red from fatigue and stress. Being an ex-idol from Saffron City, Anita wasn't exactly \"cut\" for physical labor; that's why she had Kaya around to be her muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you two, we're taking a break.\" And before her friends could even respond, the jigglypuff moemon plopped uselessly to the ground, her pink hair bopping slightly as she did so. Anita noticed her small paunch slightly pressing against her black top. Anita had to admit, at least this was good exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kaya shook her head at Anita. The busty, blonde combusken moemon, wearing her usual red training outfit, was more than used to long walks and was a little more than annoyed by Anita\u2019s constant complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright you lightweight, but make it quick. Things aren\u2019t going to be easy since you got the bright idea to rip our map apart. It\u2019s been a couple of hours now and I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya sat down next to Anita and looked into her empty gourd. Not even a single drop. She shouldn't have drank it all before they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree with Kaya, Anita, you\u2019re too soft. Not only do you have a short temper but you have such low stamina!\u201d The mismagius moemon, who was looming over the two, was definitely an odd sort. With her purple dress flowing wherever she floated about, and her absurdly large witch\u2019s hat, she got the most looks from passerby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnita looked up at Magena. If Kaya didn\u2019t know any better, she could\u2019ve sworn she saw steam shooting out of Anita\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh-shut up! I was frustrated with having to pay over half of our money and being with two dimwits doesn't help matters any!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnita looked at Kaya and glared at her. Kaya could only roll her eyes, it was moments like this that made her want to have a giant swig of whatever spirit she fancied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaya! You could've easily kicked their asses, but you just stood there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anita, as much as I would've liked to fight them I don't want us being chased as criminals. Besides, I dislike fighting sober. And speaking of being sober, you're really giving me a headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnita ignored Kaya, and directed her attention towards Magena. Magena stared back, her golden, drowsy eyes trying to stay open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Maggie! You just had to be so willing to give our money to them. That's the last time I trust my money with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they asked so nicely! I even decided to even give them a tip. Good fortune will smile upon us for having such generous hearts. We'll get our reward soon, Anita, don't you worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, Anita looked to the ground. They had to pay almost half of the money they had with them, they had no idea where they were going, and they were probably going to starve to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya got up and dusted herself off. \"Hey, drama queen, just sitting there moping around isn't going to get us anywhere. We should at least find some nearby settlement, to get some food and rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagena suddenly perked up to that idea. \"Oh! Oh! Let me lead the way! I have a very good sense of direction. We'll be at Celadon before you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya crossed her arms and chuckled. She had to admit, at least Maggie kept things interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Maggie, we'll be wandering around aimlessly until we find a town anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has a small, but round potbelly which is accompanied by rather small, but perky breasts and a slightly plush butt. Patsy wears a cream tank-top which matches her pale skin rather well and also reveals both her breasts and belly to be larger than normal. Her long, brown, almost feathery hair lightly falls upon her shoulders and stops near the middle of her back.<br>\r\nPersonality: Although Patsy's figure implies she is a glutton, she actuall is a rather dainty eater, generally seeming to peck at her food. She has always been a bit pudgier than a normal Pidgy is. Patsy is very shy, but those who know her know that she can be kinda flighty, but is really sweet and always tries to keep promises. Patsy is rarely seen very far away from her best friend and eternal traveling companiom, Remi. They both grew up in the same town and have been friends since kindergarden. Since they turned 10 however, Patsy and Remi have been traveling across Kanto, sometimes as tourists and sometimes as battlers. Recently this pair joined up with Elli and Layla, two mysterious Moemon from a region far from Kanto.<br>\r\nName: Remi<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nMoemon: Rattata<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nDescription: Remi is a fairly normal Rattata Moemon. She is rather short, but that is normal for her species. Her favorite color is purple, which is reflected in her clothing which consists of a purple jacket, ussually left unzipped in the front to show off her pale t-shirt. Her clothes, which do look slighlty girly, seem to further accentuate her flat, boyish figure. She wants to grow breasts and is entirely fine with adding weight to other areas to further this goal. Her haircut also leads to misidentification as a boy by others.<br>\r\nPersonality: Remi is generally a very brave individual, which, along with her overwhelming stubborness, can lead this pair into dangerous or infuriating situations, which must be resolved by the much calmer Patsy. However, even through all the trouble she causes, Remi is still a good Influence and best friend to Patsy. Remi often convinces Patsy to speak up for what she believes and to try new things.</span></div></div>",

She has chubby cheeks, two D-cup breasts, a large belly that jiggles every time she takes a step, and a round butt that seems to love to embarrass Katy, as evidenced by several pairs of ripped pants in the past. Her big blue eyes can stare into your very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty is the type of girl who likes to sit alone in the corner. She keeps to herself a lot and she almost never talks, but when she does, she always seems to know what to say. She is very smart and can think her way out of any situation (besides her weight, she's still working on that one), making her a great leader. Her favorite food is burritos, but you'll rarely see her pass up a donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman<br>\r\nMale<br>\r\n21<br>\r\nRaichu<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman is 100% muscle, with hardly an ounce of fat on him. From his head to his toes, every inch of him is toned. Apparently, he thinks this gives him the right to be a total asshole to everyone. The only reason Katy hasn't kicked his perfectly sculpted butt to the curb is because of his godlike strength. He never calls anyone by their actual name, but instead uses nicknames that he comes up with himself. For example, he refers to Katy as \"fatty\" and \"Our Glorious Larder.\" He likes to hit on girls, and never seems to run out of cheesy punch lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing<br>\r\nFemale<br>\r\n16<br>\r\nEevee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing's appearance, if not cute, is nothing short of beautiful. Her crimson eyes sparkle like rubies, and her figure, while modest, is very attractive. However, almost no one ever sees her beauty, because she is almost always hiding it. Ling is incredibly timid. In fact, the only people she ever talks to are her loving parents and Katy. She claims that Truman intimidates her, leading Truman to nickname her \"scaredy-cat.\" She is very good with technology and can crack most any code. She is also fluent in several languages, both current and obsolete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScenario 1: Team Destiny stumble across a cave jam-packed with surprises! What kind of surprises?

Unfortunately for our 3 heroes, they didn't have that option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Destiny was on a quest: a quest for treasure. Their quest, however, was being slowed down considerably as both Katy and Truman were sweating like dogs and moving at a snail's pace. Ling, on the other hand, was far ahead of both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ling, please slow down!\" Katy yelled at her physical polar opposite. \"Yes, ma'am!\" Ling shouted back, as she ran back towards her teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ling, you're not the only one here. Are you familiar with the saying, 'All for one, one for all'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, m-ma'am,\" Ling replied, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know what it means, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... uh... um...\" Ling was too embarrassed to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means you should never leave a man behind.

He then began to run towards the aforementioned cave. \"Hey, what did I just say?\" Katy shouted as she ran after Truman, Ling following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance of the cave was absolutely dazzling. Its icy walls sparkled like diamond. \"Cave!\" Truman boasted, proud of his discovery. Katy and Ling cocked their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a good chance of us finding treasure in this cave; plus, if we get in here, we'll be out of this heat!\" Truman explained, in a rare moment of cleverness. \"Hmm... can't argue with that logic,\" Katy pointed out. \"Yes! As usual, I'm right!\" Truman claimed, back to his usual self. Katy gave him her trademark glare as they all entered the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 200 feet in, the cave split into two branches. \"What now, Katy?\" Ling inquired of her heavyset superior. Katy rubbed her chin thoughtfully.</span></div></div>",

Katy and Truman turned to see that Ling had fallen on her butt. There were a few seconds of silence before Ling joked, \"Careful, guys. The ice is slippery.\" They all laughed as Katy helped Ling up.

She shot up and yelled, \"TRUMAN, WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped herself when she saw that it wasn't the jerky Raichu that had given her a rude awakening, but instead, a plump young Dewgong woman that was now cowering in fear at the Makuhita's sudden outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't h-hurt m-me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty stood up and put her hand on the Dewgong's shoulder. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you. I thought you were someone else.\" She outstretched her hand (causing the Dewgong to jump slightly) and continued, \"Hi, I'm Katy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?... Oh!\" The Dewgong firmly grasped Katy's hand and shook it wildly, causing her entire body to jiggle. \"Glad to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty pulled her hand back. \"Glad to be met,\" she said in a raspy voice as she tried to nurse her crushed hand back to health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dewgong erupted into uproarious laughter. \"My name's Valerie!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she wasn't cowering, Katy could get a good look at her. She was about the same height as Katy, but if she had to guess, she was about 75 pounds heavier - this girl was huge! She had round cheeks, a pronounced double chin, large breasts, a gigantic belly that jiggled if she made the slightest move, and a humongous ass to boot (no pun intended)! She was wearing a T-shirt with a strange symbol (the shirt, by the way, was far too small) and a pair of comfy-looking Pajama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie pointed to Truman and Ling. \"Are these your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty shrugged. \"Technically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie laughed again and waddled over to Truman. \"Wake up, big fella,\" she cooed as she shook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... five more minutes, Mommy...\" he grumbled. Katy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I didn't want to have to do this, but you give me no choice.\" Valerie picked up a bucket of ice water and dumped the contents on Truman's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine the loudest, most high pitched scream you can. That was the sound that echoed through the entire cave as Truman was jolted (again, no pun intended) awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped up and raised a fist to Valerie's face, causing her to cower again. \"Hey, butterball, are you hungry? 'Cause I'm about to give you A KNUCKLE SANDWICH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\" Katy protested. \"The last thing we need is a fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" added Ling. She had been awoken by Truman's girlish scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are your names?\" Valerie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman replied, \"Call me what you want, fat-ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Valerie giggled, \"...Screamo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman gave her a nasty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Valerie, where do you come from?\" asked Katy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?

The gleaming walls fanned out to create an opening that extended for several square miles and was hundreds of feet high. At the entrance of the opening was a small city/large town type of settlement, with shops, homes, parks, and restaurants. It was very well off for a place that never saw the light of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was something about the residents, something that Truman will probably blurt out mindlessly in a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is everyone so fat?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, I knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie sighed loudly. \"You know how I said the cave has provided for my people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" they all replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant it REALLY provides for my people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It also helps to have insulation from the cave's harsh cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud growl came from the trio's stomachs. Katy and Truman clenched their wailing tummies, while Ling's face turned a bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie smacked the side of her head. \"Oh, where are my manners! You all are probably starved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty replied, \"Yeah, we haven't eaten in days, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhp!\" The tubby Dewgong held up her index finger. \"Say no more.

At one table sat a middle-aged Vaporeon man reading a newspaper while polishing off a box of donuts. At another was an Emboar father struggling to keep his two rowdy Tepig children under control, while a third child, a teenage Pignite boy, was quietly tending to his video game. At yet another table, there sat a literal butterball of a Vulpix girl who was as wide as she was tall. Katy chuckled at the sight. She was willing to bet the Vulpix was bubbly and had a sweet tooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie led the team to the counter, where they all took a seat. \"Oh, honey~\" she sang. A tubby Glaceon poked his head out of the kitchen. \"Is that my favorite customer I hear?\" he sang back. He waddled up to the counter and gave Valerie a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie's apparent love interest was actually about half a foot taller than her (maybe she was into that?) but was just as heavyset. In fact, he was fatter than Valerie! He was wearing his work clothes, a blue Polo and khaki shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends,\" Valerie said as she pulled away from the warm (cold?) embrace of her boyfriend, \"this is Toby. Toby, this is Katy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Truman...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and Ling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Ling retreated into her hoodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a lively bunch,\" Toby laughed. He turned to Katy. \"And so beautiful, too.\" Katy blushed and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man, that's gay,\" Truman remarked, assuming that Toby was referring to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I'm sure you're all absolutely famished,\" Toby said. \"So, what'll it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty was about to speak, but Valerie chimed in, \"We'll take four specials, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty, Truman, and Ling all had a worried look. \"What's the special?\" they said simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby just grinned. \"Trust me, you will not be disappointed!\" he laughed as he headed back into the kitchen. Ten minutes later, he returned with four of the biggest bowls of chili any of our three heroes had ever seen! The bowl was six inches tall and a foot in diameter. The chili was composed of chili beans, ground beef, diced tomatoes, and various hot peppers. The whole thing was smothered with cheese and topped with a crust of crushed taco shells. He placed the bowls in front of them and said, \"Bon appetit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that, Spanish?\" Truman grumbled. Toby just laughed as he wobbled back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty was the first to take a bite of her chili. The instant she did, her mouth was filled with a wonderful combination of flavors. She loved it! She turned to her shy Eevee teammate and noticed she hadn't touched her chili. \"Ling, why haven't you eaten your chili?\" Katy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't think I would like it...\" Ling responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Katy picked up a spoonful of chili and shoved it in Ling's mouth. Unfortunately, Ling's experience of the first bite wasn't quite like Katy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WATER!!\" she yelped as she jumped out of her seat and started running around the restaurant frantically searching for something to drink, attracting the attention of everyone in the restaurant. Katy chuckled nervously. She had forgotten that Ling's nature was Timid, giving her a strong repulsion to spicy food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Toby burst out of the kitchen door, moving surprisingly fast for someone his size. He was carrying a large pitcher of milk. He managed to figure out the circuit that Ling was running, and he planted his large, blubbery body in the middle of it to stop her. Sure enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing was laying on the floor after literally running into Toby. \"Need... water...\" she groaned. She got up, snatched up the pitcher of milk that Toby had managed to hold on to this whole time, and started to chug it. Everyone in the restaurant watched in awe as Ling drank the entire pitcher in not even 30 seconds, stopping halfway through to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... Toby...\" she said between breaths, placing the glass container back in Toby's meaty hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you're welcome,\" Toby replied. \"If you want, I can bring you something less spicy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd... like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, they had all finished their chili (and Ling had finished her 2 pound bacon cheeseburger) and they were absolutely stuffed. Well, except for Valerie, she was used to eating this much in one sitting, but she was pretty full. Toby came out of the kitchen and beamed, \"How did you like your meals?\" All he got was a trio of groans. Valerie giggled and responded, \"We liked our meals very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie helped her new friends up and out of the restaurant. When they were outside, Valerie asked, \"Well, where do you want to go now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The walls of the living room were painted a lovely shade of pink and covered with beautiful landscape paintings. The couch was a deep red with notably wide seats and the coffee table was made of wood covered with ornate designs. Across from the couch, there was an old TV that looked to have been previously discarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice house!\" Katy noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very pretty,\" murmured Ling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, could be better,\" Truman admitted. All three of them took a seat on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you need anything?\" Valerie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could use a change of clothes,\" Katy replied, and she was right. Katy wore a skintight orange tank top that showed off her curves very nicely and a pair of perfectly fitting blue jeans. Truman just wore a pair of green sweatpants, leaving his ripped upper half exposed. Ling wore a grey hoodie and blue jeans, both of which were three sizes too big (she held her pants up with a belt, but even the belt was a bit too big). However, their clothes were dirty and torn from weeks of roughing it. They definitely needed a wardrobe change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have plenty of clothes!\" Valerie said. \"I'll be right back!\" And with that, she shuffled into the next room. A minute or so later, she returned with three sets of clothes, one for each of them. For Katy, a baby blue T-shirt and denim shorts. For Truman, a heather grey T-shirt and matching sweatpants. For Ling, a white tank top with a symbol on the front (which translated to \"sugar,\" meaning \"sweet\") and a black mini-skirt. All good outfits, but there was one problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are these clothes so big?\" asked Katy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll grow into them,\" Valerie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman got up. \"Well, this has been great and all, but we gotta go,\" he said, heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Valerie's usually sweet and bubbly mood suddenly became very solemn. \"There's something I need to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Katy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid it won't be possible for you to leave the cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" all 3 of them shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's very upsetting, I know. Our people have tried many times, but no one has made it alive.\" Her usual mood returned as quickly as it had left. \"Look at it this way, though - we can hang out all the time now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, that last sentence didn't cheer them up.</span></div></div>",

You're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where are we gonna live?\" Ling pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty rubbed her chin. \"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can live with me!\" Valerie chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty, Truman, and Ling all gave Valerie a puzzled look, then looked at each other, then back to Valerie. \"I'm afraid we're gonna have to decline your offer,\" Katy responded. \"We like you, but we don't like you that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Valerie sighed as the trio were about to walk out the door. \"I guess I'll just spend another boring evening by myself in this big house...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Katy stopped in her tracks. She was a sucker for sweet old ladies who needed company (actually, Valerie wasn't that old - in fact, she was only 26! - but she was sweet and needed company), and, combined with her good-natured personality, she was physically incapable of saying no. She turned around and said, \"You know what? Sure we'll move in with you!\" Ling was thrilled with the concept, Truman not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yay!\" Valerie rejoiced. She waddled up to Katy and gave her a big hug. Katy hugged her back. Valerie then went to give Truman a hug, but Truman just pushed her away. \"I don't do hugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Valerie went to give Ling a hug. She outstretched her thick arms, but Ling just stood there. She wasn't too big on hugs either, but she wasn't about to tell Valerie that. Noticing that she wasn't being hugged back, Valerie laughed, \"What are you waiting for?\" She then pulled the 5'3\", 125 pound Eevee into a full embrace with her 5'9\", 350 pound frame, comically suffocating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the way that Valerie was literally squeezing the life out of poor Ling, Katy yelled, \"Valerie! Let go! You're smothering her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh!\" Valerie loosened her grip on Ling. Ling just stood up and started to wobble and stumble. \"Oh, my goodness, I didn't hurt you, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more for me thanks, I'm driving,\" Ling replied before collapsing on the couch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Valerie's kitchen was nothing short of incredible. It was filled with all sorts of cooking utensils and appliances, some of which our 3 heroes had never even heard of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dining room, on the other hand, was quite ordinary. The walls were painted forest green and the floors were made of hardwood. The floors were a precursor to the dining table, which was also made of wood and surrounded by six metal chairs, one at either end and two on either side. Katy was sitting at one of the end chairs, Ling was sitting at her right, and Truman to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie came out of the kitchen with five large plates of food. The meal she had prepared was country fried steak with mashed potatoes (both smothered in gravy) and biscuits with whole milk to drink. The steak was about an inch and a half thick, the mashed potatoes was two heaping spoonfuls per plate, and everyone got two huge biscuits. She placed a plate in front of each of the team members, then one at the end of the table, where she sat down, and the last plate in front of the seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Valerie?\" Katy asked. \"Why do you have two plates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this isn't for me,\" Valerie responded, pointing to the plate next to her. She then placed her hand next to her mouth as if to amplify her voice and hollered, \"Kenta, suppertime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, a chubby, but adorable, Zangoose boy came into the room. He was about 5'5\" and was wearing baby blue pajamas that clung to his somewhat hefty frame. \"Who are these guys?\" he asked. His voice was notably prepubescent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends,\" Valerie began, \"this is Kenta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" the addressed Zangoose yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenta,\" she continued, \"this is Katy, Truman, and Ling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman perked up. \"Wait, how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"14,\" Kenta replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how old is Valerie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"26.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman gasped in horror. \"S-so that means--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm adopted, idiot,\" Kenta replied, rather annoyed at what Truman was implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman slumped in his seat as he breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found Kenta at the bottom of the slide when he was just a little baby, and I took him in and took care of him,\" Valerie chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took care of him, alright,\" Truman chuckled, earning him a punch in the arm from Kenta. \"Ow! Little bugger's strong, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Katy said. \"You said you lived here all by yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie sighed. \"I know, but Kenta here spends so much time in his room, I might as well be living here alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta crossed his arms. \"I only spend so much time in my room because you never let me do anything,\" he whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down, Kenta,\" Valerie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta sat down and everyone began eating. That is, everyone except Truman, who was poking his steak listlessly. Valerie stopped for a moment when she noticed that Truman wasn't eating and asked, \"Truman, honey, why aren't you eating your food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I dunno,\" the Raichu replied without looking up. \"I guess I'm just trying to watch my weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie gave him a puzzled look. \"You're already the image of fitness. Why are you watching your weight? A few extra pounds won't kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman shrugged. \"It's weird... I feel like there's some sort of rule that prevents me from gaining weight...\" He pushed his plate away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta looked at Truman's plate. \"Hey, uh, Truman?\" he said awkwardly. \"Are you gonna, you know, um--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and take it,\" Truman replied. Kenta grinned as he used his fork to scrape the contents of Truman's plate onto his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, dinner was over and everyone was full (except Truman, of course, but then again, he was still digesting that chili from earlier).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where are we gonna sleep tonight?\" Katy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh!\" Valerie said. \"The rooms are upstairs!\" She then led Katy, Truman, Ling, and Kenta up the stairs and to a hallway with 4 doors. She waddled up to the door on the far right. \"This is the guest bedroom. Ling and Truman will sleep here.\" Ling and Truman seemed fairly satisfied with that. Valerie then moved on to the second door from the right. \"This is Kenta's room. Katy, you will be sleeping with Kenta.\" Katy and Kenta were happy with that, but Kenta seemed to be a little more than happy. Valerie moved along to the next door down. \"This is the bathroom. No one will be sleeping here.\" She giggled. \"That is, if no one breaks into the wine cellar.\" They all laughed at Valerie's joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that room?\" Katy asked, pointing at the door at the end of the hallway. \"Oh, that's my room,\" Valerie answered. \"Be sure to knock first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lesson I learned the hard way,\" Kenta shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie opened the door to her room and stood in the doorway. \"Okay, off to bed with you! I'll see you in the morning!\" she said as she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing and Truman went into their room, and Kenta started to head toward his own room, but Katy stopped next to the bathroom. Kenta turned around. \"You okay, Katy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I, uh, have to use it,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll just wait for you out here then,\" he said, leaning on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay.\" Katy headed into the bathroom. When she was inside, she started to search for a bathroom scale. She found one under the toilet, pulled it out, and stepped on it. The dial spun around and stopped on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"273,\" Katy sighed. The last time she weighed herself, she was 268 pounds. Had she really gained 5 pounds in one day? No, the last time she weighed herself was about three months ago, before she had started on her and her team's quest for treasure. She had probably just gained the weight over the 3 month period. But then again, on her quest, she rarely ate and did a lot of walking. Maybe she had lost weight during her quest. Maybe it was more than 5 pounds! Katy decided to drop the subject as she stepped down from the scale and pushed it back under the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she left the bathroom, Kenta was still outside the bathroom, occupying himself by picking at a loose thread on his pajamas. \"Oh, you're done!\" he said, looking up. \"I didn't hear a flush though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know what they say,\" Katy chuckled nervously. \"If it's yellow, let it mellow.\" Kenta stuck his tongue out in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta's room looked to be quite big, but that was because it was mostly empty. There was a walk-in closet on the far side of the room. The bed was a queen-size bed and was right in the middle of the room, and in one corner, there was a computer on a desk. Katy caught a glimpse of the computer screen - it had been left on a website full of pictures of Pokemon women of about Katy's size and shape. She couldn't get a good enough look at it before Kenta hastily closed out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\" Kenta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice,\" Katy replied. She then began to slip out of her clothes, starting with her shoes and socks, then her blue jeans, and finally taking off her shirt, ending up in her underwear. She then turned to Kenta, who was turning a shade of scarlet. \"Oh, man, I forgot, this isn't my room.\" She giggled, causing Kenta to blush even brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you always s-sleep like th-this?\" Kenta stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not since I left home,\" Katy replied. \"I just feel more comfortable undressed.\" Kenta was as red as a tomato at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the awkward moment subsided, Katy and Kenta crawled into bed and turned out the light. Katy was about to drift off to sleep when...</span></div></div>",

He was blushing, both from arousal and embarrassment. \"You took my only pillow... and besides...\" He began to stare at Katy's paunch. \"...your tummy looks so warm and inviting...\" He grabbed her belly and jiggled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty had had enough. \"You little pervert!\" She pushed him away again, only for him to roll back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" he whined. \"Let me show you something...\" Before Katy could respond, Kenta put his hands on her belly and started to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you... you... you.. y-you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Doesn't that feel good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty couldn't deny it - Kenta's belly rub felt great! Before she knew it, she was asleep with a big smile on her face. Katy knew Kenta was using her belly as a pillow, but she didn't mind for some reason. Maybe it was the fact that he was so adorable, maybe it was the fact that he did a mean belly rub, but for whatever reason, Katy was happy.</span></div></div>",

She giggled. \"Come on, Kenta, wake up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... what time is it...\" Kenta moaned as he got off of Katy's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7:40,\" Katy answered, looking at the alarm clock next to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta jumped up. \"What?! Oh, man, we're gonna be late for school!\" He ran over to his closet, threw off his pajamas, and began frantically searching for something to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty cocked her head. \"School? We?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"17.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, yes, we!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my gosh!\" She jumped up and quickly slipped on her clothes. By this time, Kenta had found something to wear and put it on. He had chosen a snug red T-shirt with a white paw print on it and a pair of black jeans (like blue jeans but black, they exist) that was tight around his butt, showing off his plump rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty caught herself staring at Kenta's ass as he was walking out the door. The way it bounced in his form-fitting pants was hypnotic. Knowing Katy was checking him out, he turned around and giggled. \"Are we gonna go to school, or are you just gonna stare at my butt all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty snapped out of it. \"Oh, y-yeah, let's go.\" Kenta grabbed his backpack and left out of his room, Katy following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they passed by Truman and Ling's room, Truman was sitting in the hall just outside the room, looking like he didn't get a second of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, what happened?\" Kenta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you don't want to know,\" Truman answered. \"But whatever you do, don't grab Ling's butt. Please, for the love of Mew, don't grab her butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Katy and Kenta to put 2 and 2 together. \"You grabbed her butt, didn't you?\" Katy smirked. Truman just burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta opened up Ling's door. \"Ling, wake up!\" He walked in. Ling was nowhere to be found. <br>\r\n\"Ling? Are you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAHH!!\" Suddenly, Kenta found himself pinned to the ground by a girl half his size. It was a little humiliating, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\" Kenta barked, pushing Ling off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I-I'm sorry,\" Ling mumbled. \"I thought y-you were someone else. You see--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know what happened.\" He got up, dusted himself off, and helped Ling up. \"It's good to see you're already dressed. We gotta get to school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-school?\" Ling quavered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, school. Come on, let's go.\" Kenta pulled on Ling's arm, but she wouldn't budge. She was just staring into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Ling, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm n-not a sh-shrimp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What are--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop... STOP! STOP! LEAVE ME ALONE!!\" She was crying at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to the door. \"Katy, Ling's being weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT WEIRD!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty rushed in and hugged Ling. \"Don't worry, Ling,\" she cooed. \"They're just trying to make you mad. Don't listen to them.\" Ling pulled away and wiped a tear away from her cheek. Katy smiled. \"Do you feel better now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing sniffled. \"Yeah...\" She returned the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty and Ling walked out of the room, Kenta following. Kenta had been watching the whole thing with a very puzzled look. \"What... just happened?\" he said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty heard him and sighed. \"It's a loooong story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to school, Katy asked Kenta, \"So, how long do you have to go to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You start when you're 5, and you graduate when you're 20,\" Kenta replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes! So you go to school for 15 years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta chuckled and put his hands behind his head. \"Yeah, but it's real lax. You only have to go 6 hours a day, 4 days a week - Tuesday to Friday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. What's today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuesday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they arrived at school. It was 7:55. \"Alright!\" Kenta said. \"We have just enough time to get you all registered!\" They hustled to the office, where a busty Wartortle lady was at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" she said. She looked up to see Kenta. \"Oh, yes, Mr. Paxton. The principal's office is down that hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, Ms. Wadsworth. I'm here to register my friends,\" Kenta replied. Katy and Ling smiled and waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Ms. Wadsworth said. She walked into a room in the back of the office, motioning for Katy and Ling to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room was a desk with a computer, one office chair for the desk, and two normal chairs (normal being a comparative term, the chairs were actually rather wide). The room itself was a bit small. Katy and Ling sat in the chairs while Ms. Wadsworth sat at the computer. \"Names?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katy Rhodes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ling Greene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ages?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"17.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"16.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legal guardians?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty and Ling huddled. After a few minutes, they turned back to Ms. Wadsworth. \"Valerie Paxton,\" Katy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" It was going to take a lot to convince Ms. Wadsworth that Katy and Ling weren't troublemakers like Kenta. \"Address?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"240 Freshwater Avenue,\" Ling responded. She had a keen eye and had noticed Valerie's address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you're all set,\" Ms. Wadsworth said. She handed them each a sheet of paper. \"Here are your schedules.\" Just then, the bell rang. \"Well, off you go!\" Katy and Ling got up and were just about to get out the door. \"Oh, and one more thing,\" she added. Katy and Ling turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of trouble, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty and Ling met Kenta outside the room. \"Oh, my gosh!\" he gushed. \"Are you okay? She didn't hurt you, did she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty giggled. \"Yes, we're okay. Sheesh, why are you acting so weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Wadsworth is brutal,\" he replied. \"I heard she once suspended a kid because he looked at her boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That IS brutal,\" Ling remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta changed the subject. \"So, what classes do you have for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty read her schedule. \"Gym, art, math, history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing followed suit. \"Science, reading, math, free period.\" She held her schedule to her average-sized chest. \"Wow, I've never had a free period!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, my schedule is gym, science, math, art!\" Kenta beamed. \"That means me and Katy have first block together, and we all have third block together! This is gonna be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty and Ling smiled. You just couldn't help but smile when Kenta was happy like that.</span></div></div>",

There's early elementary, ages 5 to 6; late elementary, 7 to 10; intermediate, 11 to 13; junior, 14 to 17; and senior, 18 to 20. Fun fact: elementary used to be 5 to 10, but then they split it up when they realized how drastically different 5-year-olds are from 10-year-olds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty giggled. She now had the thought in her mind of a 10-year-old playing with alphabet blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're here!\" Kenta outstretched his arms as if to present the gym to Katy. \"Let's go in, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym was your ordinary run-of-the-mill high school gym. It was filled with teenagers of all body types. There were two circuits of children running around the gym. The ones on the inner circuit were jogging at a leisurely pace as a slender but healthy Quilava lady looked on. As Katy watched the kids led by the Quilava coach, a tubby Leafeon boy that had been running waddled up to the coach. He was panting heavily and sweat was dripping from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... coach...\" he said between pants. \"Can I... take... a breather...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach patted him on the back and gave him a look that showed she took pity on him. \"Sure you can, David. You need to rest.\" The Leafeon plopped his mighty rear on the floor of the gym and got into a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Ms. Fulton,\" Kenta told Katy, pointing to the Quilava coach. \"She's real sweet, and she never pushes her students too hard.\" He pointed to the out-of-shape Leafeon sitting next to her. \"That's David Ratliff. He always gets winded during the warm-ups and has to sit out the rest of gym class. He's a real nice kid, though. He's always smuggling some sort of snack food into the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach Harris, on the other hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty and Kenta turned to face a rotund Venusaur man that looked to be about 6'6\" and had thick muscly arms. He had a huge gut that hung down a few inches and showed under his shirt. He had a whistle dangling around his neck and the most sour look on his face you could imagine. A familiar Pignite was running the outer circuit, the circuit Coach Harris was in charge of. It was the Pignite from Toby's restaurant. While he wasn't exactly the image of fitness, he wasn't too chubby either, but he looked to be as winded as David Ratliff was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, right in front of everyone, the Pignite collapsed! A few kids (including Katy and Kenta) stared in shock. Even Ms. Fulton seemed to be a little shocked. A few kids on the outer circuit whimpered. Coach Harris just waddled over to the Pignite boy, kicked him, and yelled, \"Quit lazing around, maggot! You've still got another 4 minutes to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty whistled. \"Wow, I'd hate to have to be Coach Harris' student! That must suck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta cleared his throat. Katy turned to him, a look of shock in her cobalt eyes. \"Oh, no, don't tell me--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm one of his students,\" Kenta whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor thing!\" Katy gave Kenta a pity hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta pulled away. \"You should check your schedule to see who you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Katy said. She looked at her schedule and, under the word \"Gym,\" she saw, in italicized letters...</span></div></div>",

She was about to run off when Kenta stopped her. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta outstretched his arms. \"Can I have a hug?\" Katy giggled as she gave Kenta a quick hug and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty took her seat next to David Ratliff, who was still panting and sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Fulton announced, \"Okay, today's first activity will be...\"</span></div></div>",

A few hands, including Katy's, shot up. \"You're gonna have to sit this one out,\" she continued. There were a few groans as Katy, a Combusken, another Makuhita, and a Heracross all got up and sat on the bleachers. Katy turned to look at her fellow fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Combusken was a girl with a curvy figure, but starting to get a small belly. Maybe she used to be heavier but lost weight? She was about 5'7\" and was wearing a white T-shirt with a black paw-print (same design as Kenta's shirt that day) and black gym shorts that showed off her perky rump. Katy smiled at her and she smiled back. She seemed nice enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Makuhita was a bulky guy who had noticeable muscles, but was undeniably chubby. He was about 5'11\" and wore a green and gold jersey and green sweatpants, both of which were far too tight on his chunky frame. Katy looked at him, he looked back and quavered, \"D-don't look at me!\" He pulled up his jersey to hide his face, but only ended up showing off more of his potbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heracross was a heavy girl, somewhere between Katy's size and Valerie's size. She was about 5'8\" and had a cute, round face. She was wearing sunglasses, a white shirt with a green jacket, and blue jeans. Katy, however wasn't the first to make a move, as when she saw Katy looking at her, she got up and sat next to Katy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled brightly. \"Hi, my name's Shayla. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Katy,\" Katy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, what a pretty name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty giggled nervously. \"Thanks...\" She had the weird feeling that Shayla was coming on to her. Her suspicions were confirmed when Shayla scooted a little closer to Katy and asked, \"So... are you doing anything tomorrow night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty pushed Shayla away. \"I'm sorry, but... I'm not really... into that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Shayla hung her head low, but it only took a few seconds for her to perk up again. \"Wanna be friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty shrugged. \"Sure. But don't go around telling anyone I'm your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShayla giggled. \"I promise~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPUNCH! \"And he's out cold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty and Shayla whipped their heads around to see a scrawny looking Bayleef boy standing over a hefty Buizel guy that was about 3 times his size - and had been knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty and Shayla giggled.</span></div></div>",

Being surrounded by other Pokemorphs was very uncomfortable for the poor timid Eevee. She reluctantly started toward her first class, being very careful not to bump into anyone. Of course, it was impossible not to bump into anyone in the crowded hallway, and sure enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ling found herself lying on the floor, facing the morph she had just run into. Her eyes were closed, but she heard a masculine voice say, \"Why don't you watch where you're going, you... you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes to see a lithe Arcanine morph standing over her. He had noticeable muscles, but wasn't ripped. He had big brown eyes and was wearing a black sleeveless shirt and black corduroy pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you're... kinda cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing blushed. \"Y-you think I'm cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think I'm a sh-shrimp? You d-don't think I'm weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"Of course not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing blushed even brighter. \"No one ever called me cute before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Arcanine helped Ling to her feet, Ling realized that he wasn't much taller. No wonder he didn't think Ling was a shrimp; he was a shrimp himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Freddy,\" the Arcanine beamed, holding out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freddy...\" Ling murmured as she shook Freddy's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy leaned in. \"So, is your name as beautiful as your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing was as red as a tomato. \"M-my name's L-Ling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ling?\" Freddy repeated. Ling retreated into her tank top. She was shaking like an electric toothbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy frowned and put his hand on Ling's shoulder, causing her to jump. \"Oh, don't worry, Ling,\" he cooed. \"I'm not gonna hurt you. I wouldn't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing looked up. \"Everyone j-just wants t-to hurt m-me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't say that. Here, let me show you something.\" Freddy then pulled Ling towards him and gave her a gentle hug. \"See how I'm not hurting you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing was starting to calm down. Freddy being a fire type, the hug was nice and warm. Ling pulled away and smiled brightly. Freddy returned the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what class do you have now?\" Freddy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm heading for science in room 103,\" Ling replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know! ...We should get going. The bell rings in 2 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wanna walk together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy took Ling's hand. \"Way ahead of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they walked towards science class, holding hands. They made it to the classroom with a few seconds to spare. Ling was curious about what kind of science class she had. She walked in to see that she was in...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't like any face Katy had ever seen before - this was a human face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human seemed to be in his mid-teens. He had curly dark brown hair that was thick, but not necessarily long - his bangs were long though. The overgrown bangs led to two big blue-green eyes with sacks under them. Obviously, this human didn't get enough sleep. His nose was a normal human nose with a cute little mole on the right side. His lips were curled into a gentle smile, but even the slightest smirk accentuated his chubby, rosy cheeks. There was a white glow surrounding him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he spoke in a soft whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Katy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty was absolutely awestruck. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your creator, Katy.

God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"I suppose you could call me that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long period of silence. Katy tried to talk, but nothing came out of her mouth. Suddenly, there was a low rumbling that slowly got louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, Katy,\" the human said as the rumbling was starting to get very loud. \"Now wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumbling got so loud it was almost deafening. \"Wake up, Katy! Wake up!\" the human urged, his voice somehow louder than the rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAKE UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty shot up. She was breathing heavily and sweating profusely. She looked at the alarm clock next to the bed. It was 1:00 pm. Had she really slept for 16 hours?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was racing, and her heart was tagging along.

Why don't you snack on some chips? They're in that cupboard.\" Valerie pointed a chubby finger towards a cupboard on the far side of the kitchen. \"At least I think they're in there. I keep moving them around to hide them from Kenta.\" Katy giggled as she walked towards the cupboard and took a bag of sour cream and onion flavored potato chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, my favorite,\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty sat down on the couch in the living room, opened the bag of chips, and started eating. She had eaten about 1/10 of the chips when Kenta came down the stairs, still in his pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are those sour cream and onion?\" Kenta asked as walked over to Katy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty jerked the bag in the opposite direction of Kenta. \"Valerie said these are off-limits for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Valerie, can I have some chips?\" he yelled into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Kenta,\" Valerie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta smirked and plopped his plump rear end on the seat next to Katy. \"She might hide them from me, but she doesn't forbid me from eating them.\" He took a handful of chips and shoved them in his mouth all at once in a series of loud slurping and chomping sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One at a time, Kenta!\" Valerie nagged. Kenta muttered something through a mouthful of chips and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty went to eat another chip, but she noticed something strange about the chip she had picked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt vaguely resembled the face of the human. Sure enough, the voice said, \"So you have found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty, sick of the omnipresent human's bullcrap, quickly scarfed down the chip in one bite, thinking that she would be rid of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't have done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the roof of the house flew off, causing everyone to look up in horror. A howling wind blew through the house, chilling everyone to the bone. The wind ceased to reveal the figure of a chubby teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the human.</span></div></div>",

Being a fighting type, she had quite a bit of muscle, but it just wasn't enough. \"Hey, Truman, help me out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman rolled over, opened his eyes slowly, and groaned, \"What do you want, fatty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having a bit of trouble with this wall--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably since you're such a weakling,\" Truman chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, guys...\" Ling chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Ling!\" Katy said, motioning for the timid Eevee to hush. \"Now, like I was saying, I need you to help me push on this wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell are you pushing on a wall?\" Truman moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an order, Truman! Get up now!\" Katy barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ling, shut up!\" Katy shouted, causing Ling to jump a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, great, she's getting in one of her moods, thought Ling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruman got up. \"That was a legitimate question, Katy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just push the damn wall!!\" Katy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Katy and Truman were both pushing on the wall as hard as they could. They were starting to get red in the face... then purple... then blue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GUYS, STOP!!\" Ling yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty and Truman both stopped. They didn't stop because Ling told them to. They stopped because Ling actually yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...\" She pointed to some symbols on the wall. \"This says you have to say 'hot plate' three times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Katy said. \"Hot plate, hot plate, hot plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, we all have to say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Katy and Truman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot plate, hot plate, hot plate.\" Suddenly, the wall retreated into the floor, revealing a room that looked almost exactly like the one they were just in... only in this room, the writings on the walls were noticeably different, and, right in the middle of the room, there was a pedestal, and on top, a plate of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cookies!\" Katy and Truman beamed. Ling's eyes, however, were drawn to red text that stood out from the rest of the symbols. She walked over to the text and began to read to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I don't think you should eat those cookies.\" She read the text aloud. \"'She who partakes of the forbidden fruit shall gain a heavy burden to bear. He who partakes in the forbidden fruit shall become one with his feminine side.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words, unfortunately, were too late, as when she turned around, she saw...</span></div></div>",

Her ass and thighs grew as well, causing her blue jeans to creak loudly. Her cheeks puffed up a little bit and her neck puffed out to make a second chin. Finally, her clothes gave up all together. Her tank top ripped up her back. Her bra flew off her quickly growing breasts, causing her to blush profusely (Truman's wolf whistle didn't help). There was a very loud tearing sound as her blue jeans literally exploded off of her. Then, as quickly as it had begun, Katy's mysterious gain ended, leaving her a huge, wobbly, practically naked butterball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God!\" was all Ling could think to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I thought you were fat before, but daaaamn!\" Truman laughed, earning him a hard kick in the shin from Ling. \"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing ran up to her bloated best friend. \"Katy, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...

She has barely an ounce of fat on her body, thanks to rigid dietary discipline... which doesn't mean she doesn't have the usual Snorlax appetite, kept deeply buried in a safe filled with concrete at the bottommost trench of her subconscious.   She claims her favorite meal is a protein bar and a glass of water, but experts have their doubts.  Despite how huge and frightening she looks, she's a friendly and soft-spoken \"big sis\" sort of girl.   Usually wears sweats or jeans and a tight tank top that shows you exactly which way it is to the gun show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzanne (Type: Roselia):<br>\r\nHow's a shrimpy, frail Moemon who's not even a fighting type rack up title after title?  Simple: she cheats!   Suzanne (\"but call me Zuzu!\") puts on a show of being sweetness personified, but she's actually a nasty little brat who'd jab her thorns into a whole roomful of sweet old ladies and puppies if it would help her get ahead.  Zuzu uses her poison both in and out of the ring to gain any underhanded advantage she can get... and so far she's been clever enough not to get caught.  She favors designer clothes and hopes to someday weasel her way onto Unova's Next Top Moemodel.   Her love of expensive sweets and fine chocolates may throw a monkey wrench into those plans... especially since she's too selfish to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy (Type: Mankey): Peppy and energetic, Mandy just loves to have fun.  She has short white-blond hair, big ears, and wears her emotions on her sleeves--in the form of a big, goofy grin, as often as not.   Mandy loves Hawaiian shirts, usually wearing them open over a tube top, and favors brightly-colored capris or denim cutoffs over leggings.  Besides boxing, her favorite activities are bungee jumping, kicking ass in a mosh pit, and ballroom dancing.    She's also got a major-league love of fruit and fruit-flavored things, and will cheerfully gorge herself if she gets the chance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, some story options!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1:  This Gym's Not Big Enough For The Two Of You<br>\r\nSuzanne is tired of having to compete against the others, and wants to be top dog (\"Uh, excuse me? Top <i>flower.</i>\") in the gym.  Even if it means sabotaging the others by playing off their weaknesses.  Will she be able to knock Lora and Mandy off of their high horses with a few well-placed caloric punches, or will they get wise to her wiles and turn the tables?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Sum-Oops!<br>\r\nOur three pulchritudinous pugilist protagonists head to a sister gym overseas for a little study abroad.   But they get more broadening then they bargained for when it turns out that their special training will come courtesy of, not a boxing gym, but a sumo stable!  And before they can master the moves, they're going to have to get into shape in a whole new way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Welcome to Team Quintessential, going old-school with the most pretentious sounding of names because gosh are there almost no good words for the letter Q! Without further delay however, I present our would-be protagonists!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAideen  the Charmander Moemon:<br>\r\nOne might mistake Aideen for a kid way too young to think about any kind of competition, much less something like the Moemon Fighting League. They'd be immediately surprised to learn though that this scrawny little kid of a Moemon is actually Nineteen years of age. The definition of a twerp, Aideen is a waif of a girl and stands at a paltry height of four feet and eight inches, Managing to look lost even in that, Aideen's outfit of choice is a pair of shorts, sneakers, and a baggy t-shirt that looks like a tent on her. She has a tan, reddish skin tone and her fire-truck red hair is in a constantly discheveled approximation of a pixie cut thanks to frequent fire-related mishaps. Certainly not physically imposing and rarely treated as an adult, she invests a lot of energy and effort into proving herself. She is eager and brash and often clashes with others due to misunderstandings. Almost painfully predictably, the little fire type likes her food hot; The hotter, the better. She particularly likes spicy candy and chocolates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeadow the Bulbasaur Moemon:<br>\r\nWhile she certainly looks her age, one might find Meadow to be just as unlikely a combatant in the Moemon Fighting League as her younger one-year-older companion. Despite being only eighteen, she looks far more like an adult than Aideen. Meadow is every part as calm and sweet as Aideen is excitable, and her relaxed and well-groomed demeanor only serves to highlight how strange it is that she'd be a willing participant. Slightly pear shaped and small in bust, she stands at five feet and five inches, a perfectly average figure that manages to look voluptuous compared to her fire-type companion. She wears a loose sundress, with a matching wide-brimmed hat that she is almost never seen without. Her skin is a dark woody brown with a very faint tinge of forest green, and her hair is a tenderly cared for bob-cut of nearly-black dark green locks. Sweet and reserved, Meadow is more determined to support her teammates than to prove her own strength. She often has a hard time sticking up for herself on her own, but will do whatever she feels she can to help a friend. She holds a cliche and extremely passionate love for vegetables and fruit, especially when there is a variety of heaping handfuls of it to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCascade the Squirtle Moemon<br>\r\nThe eldest at twenty years of age and the only one of the trio who even remotely looks the part of a Moemon Fighting League participant. Cascade maintains a carefully cultivated attitude that is centered around at all times being as radical as possible. Athletic and lean, she none the less has a subtle hourglass figure that is given away buy the flair to her hips and the heft of her bust, and is far taller than her friends at five feet and nine inches. Cascade's clothing of choice looks like it belongs to a biker gang from the eighties, complete with a ridiculous pair of triangular shades that could probably be classified as a deadly weapon.  Her skin is pale with a tinge of light baby blue to it, and her hair is a bright white that has but the barest hint of blue in it and falls about her shoulders chaotically. Cascade's main priority is to be as completely awesome of a person as physically possible, especially when competing against someone, and rolling with it when it happens to backfire. She doesn't believe in letting worry or hesitation bog you down and that you should just keep on going. Her favorite food happens to be smoothies and similar drinks. In particular she likes milkshakes, making her lean figure something of an amazement consider her lack of concern for something as lame as 'diets'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's our trio of first-gen Moemon gals! From here there's two options!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: To Be The Very Best!<br>\r\nA first-gen inspired tale of traveling around the world, trying to rise through the ranks of the Moemon Fighting League in an attempt to prove themselves as the best team ever formed. Unfortunately, the road to greatness is fraught with peril and the team will face ever-growing challenges! I plan on writing a single path for this, but I welcome anyone to make their own branching story at any point they wish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: Do It Yourself Journey!<br>\r\nThats right, come up with your own thing! If you don't find Option A to be any good, then get cracking on your own option!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is often said that the first step to any goal is the hardest. The part people forget to mention is that this is the case because the starting line is actually a mile of red tape and paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you already, I'm Nineteen! N-I-N-E-T-E-E-N!\" A loud speck of red objected, waving a small plastic card in exaggerated annoyance in the face of the skeptical clerk behind the desk. The clerk, a Chansy Moemon, raised a pink eyebrow before snatching up the card and examining it with a critical eye. The pink eyebrow managed to raise itself a little more before the woman's features smoothed out and she handed the card back, giving a pleasant smile as she smacked a heavy stamp down on a form and passed it over her desk as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the mistake, miss. You are now a  fully-registered member of the Moemon Fighting League.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistake shmistake.\" The red speck grumbled, turning and hurrying away from the desk and out of the building. It'd taken a long time just to get people to stop trying to shoo her out of the MFL's Registration Building, much less to actually believe she wasn't showing them some kind of fake license. By the time she'd actually gotten her form filled out and up to the final desk - She had no idea why there even was more than one desk if they were going to make you see all of them just to get a simple thing done - she was ready ready to burn the entire building down.  As she gave the building one last annoyed look, contemplating on if she SHOULD burn it down or not, she shook her head before turning her thoughts forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken a bit of work, but she'd gotten herself registered with the MFL and was officially allowed to participate in their competitions. She already knew who she wanted to work with as teammates, too, since it was generally accepted as a team sport and trying to go it alone would just get her laughed off even more than she already would be. A sharp-toothed grin broke out on the tan-red face, and she immediately cast her gaze along the winding path that led back to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, did you take a nap or something?\" A leather-clad and shades-wearing squirtle moemon greeted on making eye contact with her. \"Poor Meadow here is practically taking root we were waiting so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the long white haired relic of cool-kids past, the demure looking bulbasaur moemon gave her a friendly wave and smile, chirping up. \"I'm sure Aideen was just caught in a long line or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or something.\" Aideen echoed with a scowl, but shook her head as she motioned for her friends to begin the small trek back to town. One of the other things that made this place burn-down-to-ashes worthy was that it was built in the middle of nowhere for basically no good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were supposed to be zoomin' out to Cobble Gym already, y'know.\" The Squirtle woman noted, peeking down at the much shorter girl over the top of her shades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well unlike you I got the third-degree from every single person in the entire building, Cascade.\" Aideen growled, small whisps of fire crackling briefly before dying out. She really, really would like nothing more than to just wipe that place out. It had to be some form of evil, turning a two-second process into a three hour... Whatever that even was. She was sure there was a word for it, but for the life of her she didn't know one that precisely conveyed the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was wondering if she should go in there and give you a hand once we'd been waiting for awhile.\" Meadow offered placatingly, eliciting a small from her white-blue-haired friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snitching? Are you five?\" Cascade complained with a shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless she was going to flood the place, I doubt it'd have helped.\" Aideen gave a small smirk, somewhat encouraged by the two's support. Even if Cascade was an aloof dork about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it for cobble.\" Cascade shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small, simultaneous growl from all three interrupted any further conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should grab lunch before we go?\" Meadow suggested, eliciting another shake of her head from Cascade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The plans already way out of whack, so we might as well.\"</span></div></div>",

Xen was founded by the other two members without a clue to her past except her name. She wears a white tanktop and short shorts to contrast her colors. She is pretty blunt about things at times, and other times she says outright lies, making her confusing to pin down.

Her Black hair is cut short with two pigtails coming out of both sides. She is shy, being caused by how she thinks she looks to other people and the fact that she usually smelled someway. Her favorite foods all have beans in them some how. She wears a blue skirt and green top to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami The Yvertail Moemon:<br>\r\nPresumed oldest due to Xen's age unknown to them, Yami Is intimidating due to her size alone, being 7 feet tall with an hourglass figure.
