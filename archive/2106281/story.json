The ruler of your kingdom, King William, is a tyrant, who only cares for his power, and not the people; the only reason he began his reign of power was because of the previous king, his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a child, your hometown was always disturbed by evil monsters such as werewolves, vampires, witches, and other things. This might seem strange, but the area you grew up in had always had a long history of being attacked by monsters, no one ever really knew why. Due to this fact, you grew up in a life of fear... and your hatred grew for monsters more and more everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany years later, in your adulthood, your anger towards these evil beings had never stopped growing, and you've decided to take up monster hunting as a job. Armed with only a crossbow and a dagger sheathed in your dark leather attire, you've left your home to look for jobs in the main city. You take your horse to the immense city known as Lorenburg...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way their...</span></div></div>",

Two kids, a boy and a girl, no more then 7 at least, were laughing hysterically as a catgirl tickled them playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a \"You got to be kidding me\" look as you saw the situation. \"Aw, you two are so cute and ticklish. Maybe here and here.\" The feline said as the drove the kids mad. Seeing enough, you jump down and confront the playful feline. She seemed human from a glance but the ears and tail would give her away. Your earlier surprise turned into anger as you eyes the monster with pure hatred. \"Another toy. You can join them and we can all have fun Nyaa\" The catgirl held a smile that was both playful and devious. The feline charges and catches you off guard with her surprising speed. She pins you to the ground and as you prepare for the worst, you feel her fingers gliding all over your ribs and belly. You start laughing as the catgirl tickles you. 'Hahahaha Whahahat Hahaha stahahahap\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrash and laugh but are unable to get her off you. You try punching her but to your shock, it does nothing. Growing desperate and running low on energy from laughing so much, you tickle the catgirl's belly. \"Hahahahaha thahaht tihihihckles\" She laughs and lets go clutching her stomach, trying to keep her laughter under control. You get up and catch your breath and look surprised. You end up realizing if you want to beat her, you'll have to play by their rules. While she's still trying to calm down, you tackle her and tickle her belly again. \"Hahahahahahahahahaha-Hahahahahahaha tihihihihihis is fuhuhuhuhun\" Despite her dilemma, she seemed to be enjoying it.

You also see a picture of a fairy with dark crimson red wings, and a black dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to ease through your first case, you head out to the local forest. Upon leaving the city gates, you are welcomed to the land's cold and windy weather. After about 10 minutes of travel, you dismount your horse, and approach the forest that is supposedly infested with evil fairies. You observe the the trees, covered in snow, and notice it's pretty crowded in there for someone your size, but you'll manage. Worst case scenario, you trip up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady to enter, you dive right in, beginning to look for certain clues that would suggest a fairy is near. You look closer at some of the snow-covered leaves and see small footprints...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah-ha! They must be close, these seem recent.</i> You think, a little excited this is going so well. As you follow the same direction you were going, you trip over the root of a tree, hidden under the snow. You hit your head on the rock, leaving a mark on your forehead, and leaving you slightly dazed. Just then, you hear some giggling in the distance, and you also feel the the branches and roots of the trees begin to wrap around your ankles and wrists, until you were immobile. The branches continued wrapping around you until you were lifted from the ground and hanging from your wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giggles become louder you hear the flutters of wings around you. Trying to turn your neck to see what's happening you turn to the small face of one of the fairies similar to the picture from the bounty board. She must have used her magic to control the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have we here, an adventurer, explorer, or perhaps a lost traveler?\" She says, giggling, as more fairies appear from behind the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to hunt you down and banish your kind from these lands!\" You growl out. Seeing the look on her face, you probably provoked her. You realize this may have been a foolish idea, considering you're defenseless at the moment, so you keep yourself silent, to keep things from getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You're not in much of a position to say such things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we punish him for coming with such bad intentions?\" One of the other fairies interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we know just what to do. Ladies! After you...\" She says trying to keep a few uncontrollable laughs down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror they approach you. <i>What could they possibly be planning?!?</i> You think to yourself, and in a split second you feel them all rush towards you--there must be a dozen of them! They begin to unbutton the front of your leather armor and you feel them jump right into your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to laugh uncontrollably, you feel some of them exploring the area, fluttering their wings all over. While some of the others begin to use their own 'techniques'; a few wiggle their tiny fingers over your naked skin, while others take a more savage approach. You feel the warm tongues of a few fairies painting your whole tummy with saliva. The combined feeling of their soft wings fluttering, tiny fingers wiggling, and slimy tongues licking causes you to explode with even more laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHHAHAHHAAAAAA STOP PLEASEEEE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Your smooth skin is just too delicious!\" You hear one of their muffled voices say underneath your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this continues, something happens...</span></div></div>",

They are each wearing tight black dresses secured by leather straps, and black lipstick accompanied by black nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also look down to notice the majority of your clothing has been removed. As you observe the surroundings, it seems you are in some sort of dungeon; there are shackles all around, accompanied by other contraptions and torches illuminating the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this! Why am I tied down?\" You say in your best intimidating tone, showing no fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now is that any way to treat the people who have just saved your life?\" One of the vampires says, appearing unaffected by your toughness act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silence yourself, not wanting to show them any respect, although you were grateful they had gotten you out of the mess you were in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I don't know about you girls...\" One of them says, \"but I think we deserve a reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of that sentence they all give you an evil smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared they might kill you where you stand... or lay, you begin to stutter out some words. \"W-woah I can give you some gold, please don't hurt me, I've done nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't want your petty gold, cutie...\" One of them says as they position themselves around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to hear you laugh with fear.\" The other one says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, you begin to feel their dark nails skitter and scatter all over your vulnerable body; one of the vampires at your soft soles, and the other two at your upper-body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEHEHEHEHHAHAHAHWHATTHEHELLHAHAHEHEH\" You burst out, as the ticklish sensations begin. You knew you were ticklish, but not this ticklish. After only a few minutes under their skillful fingers you feel them spread out a little more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire at your feet left them and moved up to your thighs, and began to squeeze, poke, and prod them, forcing more giggles and laughs out of you. Then the other vampires at your mid-section split up--one towards your smooth armpits, spidering inside them. The other one, who had stayed, decided to hop onto your stomach, and lightly stroke her nails all over your ribs and sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to tire out and break a sweat, something happens...</span></div></div>",

As you glance toward your feet, you see one of them beginning to glide her tongue up and down the soles of your feet, leaving you a giggling mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHHEHHHEHE-WHAT THE HE-HAHAHA HELL ARE YOU DOIN-HAHA\" You burst out, as the other vampires follow the other her lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on top of you, sitting on your legs, lowered her head down to your belly and began licking around your naval, eventually prodding into it, and repeating. While the other, at your armpits, dove head-first right into your deep, smooth armpits, while using her other hand to tickle your other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GAHAHAH *GASP*\" You say, already tiring out in mere seconds \"NO PLEAHHAHAHAH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, your tummy is so <b>delicious</b>, I could just lick it all day.\" She says, as she kisses all over your upper-body, leaving black lip-stick marks everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we give him/her a break, huh?\" The one at your foot says to the girls, as she also begins kissing your feet. Followed by the one, who had just soaked your armpits, beginning to kiss from your neck, to your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how to act in this situation--you were still feeling the occasional fingernail poking your naked skin, but you felt their lips tease you all over. Soon, you were covered in black lip-stick marks, all over, ranging from your neck and cheeks, to the soles of your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you were too exhausted to try and plead with them. As they continued, you lost track of time. It could have been minutes, or even an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, something happens...</span></div></div>",

In a matter of minutes--although it felt like hours, you were becoming exhausted as they continued tickling basically everwhere on your body.

This is my second tickle interactive, based around monster hunting, as you've probably seen in the title. Originally this was an idea that I was going to implement into World of Tickles, but I've seen more potential in it and decided to make it its own interactive! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: (Basically same as World of Tickles)<br>\r\n1) Try to have correct grammar. (A few small mistakes are fine.)<br>\r\n2) Avoid short chapters if possible.<br>\r\n3) I want this to be a tickling interactive, so stick with tickling please.<br>\r\n4) Sexual interactions are allowed, <i>and</i> encouraged, provided you fit them in well. Go wild! ;)<br>\r\n5) Write as if you're talking to the reader (I forgot what the word for that is); ex: \"You are tickled\" or \"She/he tickles you\".<br>\r\n6) Female ticklers preferred, but male ticklers are allowed.<br>\r\n7) Feel free to add chapters, and enjoy! :D<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have questions or want me to edit your chapter, email me, and I'll get back to you ASAP.</td>",
