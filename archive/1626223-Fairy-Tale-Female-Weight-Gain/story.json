This is how the real story went...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upon a time, there was an only child who lived with her family.  Her name was Gretel, she lived with her two parents in a small cottage in the middle of the forest.  Gretel was a very small child, no older than 11 years old.  As she grew up, she became more adventurous, despite her parents' warnings about going too deep into the forest.  One day, Gretel decided to go the extra mile and journey further into the woods than ever before.  After a few hours of exploring, she decided to go back home, the only problem was: where was home?  It was beginning to get dark and she was frantically searching through the woods to find an exit, but she soon passed out on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel woke up to the sweet smell of delicious pastries and many other goods.  Still being a bit groggy from her sleep, she didn't know what was in front of her for a bit.  The person in front of her was indeed the witch.  As she awoke, the witch said: \"My, my! You're finally awake!  I was beginning to worry after you collapsed on the forest floor like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel finally completely awoke and said: \"Huh? Where am I? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I'm just a kindly old woman and welcome to my humble abode.\" said the witch in a kindly voice.  \"I found you collapsed on the forest floor and thought you looked like you were about to die from not enough well-nourishment, so I took you home.\" she explained.  All the words the witch had said seemed to go in one ear and out the other, seeing that Gretel had already eyed the captivating amounts of food in front of her.  \"You look hungry, deary, dig in, eat as much as you want.\" And with that, Gretel started eating like she had never eaten before.  She normally didn't eat fattening things such as these, but something about them just made her forget all that and want to eat every thing in that room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours had passed and Gretel was still chowing down, but a little slower.  As another hour passed, Gretel passed out in the middle of eating a triple-decker chocolate cake.  Using her magic, the witch levitated Gretel to her bed where she rested for the night...</span></div></div>",

Did you have a good sleep?\" The witch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch looked at Gretel. Gretel had a bigger belly that pressed against her shirt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slept good. The bed was really comfortable.\" Gretel said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Do you feel any different?\" The witch asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Gretel asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, dear. How about some breakfast?\" The witch cooed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the witch had asked Gretel if she felt different, it was to see if Gretel noticed her new bigger belly. The witch pointed to the table, and a big feast was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that there before?\" Gretel asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course dear.\" The witch explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel looked at the food. It looked good, but she knew she couldn't eat it all. She sat down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try the waffles.\" Gretel said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel bit into a waffle. It was the best thing she had ever tasted. She finished up all 12 of the waffles and moved onto the pancakes. Then the sausages. Then the bacon. Then the french toast! In a matter of 40 minutes, Gretel had finished up enough food for 8 kids her age. She laid back in her chair. Her belly had grown signifigantly. She felt tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yawn, I'm tired again.\" Gretel explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay dear, you can use the guest room upstairs. Go get some sleep. I'm going out to pick some berries.\" The witch explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on her sunhat and went outside. Gretel walked slowly up the stairs.

After that one piece of pie, Gretel began to leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long after she had left, maybe 10-15 minutes, she had gotten hungry for that delicious food again.  She had gone back to the house now, greeted by the witch, who welcomed her happily.  It seemed as soon as she got back, there was a completely new feast waiting for her, only this time it was bigger than the last one. Gretel, being addicted to the food, started to dig in to the many fattening foods scattered around the table. </span></div></div>",

A wonderful taste spread in her mouth, it was truly divine, so good that she couldn't stop herself from stuffing the rest of the treat in her mouth.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut while the taste was divine her enchanted-hunger demanded more. Much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel began soon, to scoop up all kinds of fattening sweets only to push them as quickly as possible in her mouth, gulping them down as swiftly as she could to have all that food right in her stomach. Her belly began to grow bigger and rounder, assuming once again a spherical shape, and still she kept eating, forced to get more food in her constantly hungry stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn almost an hour, Gretel felt stuffed full.

The room seemed just as the guest room from which she had tried to escape. She saw her favorite toys and books and all adventurous decorations that she had always dreamed of. But she was still quite sleepy so, with some helping from the old woman she got out of her stained and ripped  clothes and got in some nice, soft, large, pajamas.  The witch then, before tucking Gretel in the bed, gave her a tall glass of milk and some deliciously looking chocolate chip cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Child. Eat these, they will help you with your sleep\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, even though she felt still quite full, accepted almost drowsily the milk and cookies and drank and ate with a passion that she didn't thought to have still. The milk was so fresh and the cookies so good she had to have some more.<br>\r\nAfter her fourth plate of cookies and her second tall glass of milk, she simply felt herself grow weary and murmured some thanks as she felt the old woman tuck her under the covers of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Gretel opened slowly her eyes, trying to understand where she was. She looked around with bleary eyes, rubbing the sleep out of them with her hands. Only then she realized what had seemed so strange. She stared at her hands which had become a little chubby themselves, along with the rest of her, and suddenly she remembered the past few days and, more importantly, where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Woman's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully placed her feet on the floorboard, ready to be shocked into awakening by the cold floor, only to remain pleasantly surprised. Her naked feet were now placed on the soft, cookie-like floor, and she realized that it wasn't nor too cold, nor too hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised from the bed, scratching idly her large belly, moving around the room until she felt awake enough to brave the bathroom. Slowly slowly, she neared the door out of her room and, as if she felt someone steer her, she reached the bathroom at the end of the corridor. Once in there she opened the tap and began wash her face, before realizing that there was something out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she stared at her reflection in the mirror, realizing that she had never seen the bathroom in this gingerbread house, so how did she found it so quickly? And, even more importantly, how did she became so big?<br>\r\nLooking at her reflection she noticed immediately that her belly had grown larger and softer, from the previous day. Anew she began to think to run away from that house before she grew too big to move. But, as she thought so her memory became fuzzy, it was as if she was forgetting about something...something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch was sitting on a comfortable chair in the cellar of the candy house, concentrating on the girl, helping her sleep and digest the full meal she had eaten the day before. She even helped her go to the bathroom, when she woke up, as if she was there in person to guide her through the corridor. When Gretel was washing herself, the witch was ready to broke contact and go to the kitchen to prepare some breakfast for her ' growing ' girl but, immediately she sensed her fears about that place and her desire to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crone had grown old and powerful, she had feasted many a times on kids who were just foolish enough to abandon themselves to her tantalizing and addictive sweets. Sometimes instead she had met other kids who were so wary of her to the point of seeming paranoid, but in the end, all of them broke under her spells. Gretel, she realized fascinated, could be as gullible as the formers and as paranoid as the latter. Still, she had many a spells in her sleeves that could be used to force the girl to stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually she preferred to fatten them up magically, without too much personal interference but, in this case, she decided to make an exception, clouding her recent memories and giving her some new ones. Done that, she chuckled a bit and began moving toward the kitchen, there still was a large breakfast to prepare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel Meanwhile was still in her pajamas, looking at herself trying to remember what she was thinking just now. While mulling it over, she began brushing her teeth while thinking 'Afterall, Granny always tell me to clean them as best as possible or I couldn't enjoy her treats...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just finished this thought that she stopped once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny?\" she whispered softly \"Am I the granddaughter of the old woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes seemed to be covered in a glaze while she tried to reach a decision...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I can't wait to see what my Granny has made me for breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel, conditioned by the witch spell, swiftly went downstairs, still in her pajamas, and walked quickly toward the kitchen where the witch was waiting her beside the gingerbread table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning, my sweet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning, Granny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're ready to become healthier for me, child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel didn't hesitate in answering back, while her hands began to rub her almost full grown gut, in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am, Granny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch cackled at this, looking at the would be tasty morsel in front of her with a flashy grin. '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe isn't stubborn anymore, is she? Eh eh eh...' the witch thought with emphasis as she pushed Gretel to sit at the table, bringing under her nose a stack of twelve pancakes, all covered in chocolate syrup with a nut of melting butter on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel, feeling the weight of the curse still active on her, didn't wait for nothing. Not even the feeling of her own belly, pushed against the table, squished in two big, fat rolls, did stop her from grabbing a fork and take a forkful of the deliciously, buttery, sweets. As the morsel passed between her lips, Gretel moaned from the divine taste alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe softness of the pancakes, the gooey pleasure of the chocolate syrup and the deliciousness of the melting butter fused together over her taste buds, sending her in a sensory overload. After she swallowed, she began to tore the pancakes as a wild animal. Taking off huge chunks out of the stacked pancakes and devouring them quickly. She had just taken the last forkful that the witch moved the empty plate away changing it with a new one. This one was a pyramid composed of twenty five rich hash brownies, with chocolate cream and sprinkled nuts on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor girl didn't even flinch as she stuffed her mouth and grabbed one of the brownie, practically shoveling it inside her mouth. Her gut began to expand, growing more and more full as the time passed and more and more food was swiftly consumed by Gretel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost one hour the witch was seating beside Gretel, helping the child stuffing herself. As the hunger enchantment was still active, Gretel had to keep eating, even if her poor belly had grown so much that she couldn't even sit anymore at the table. She was in fact slumped in one of the marshmallow couches, while the witch brought to her lips even more delectable morsels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel watched as her belly grew larger and larger, rounder and rounder, still she opened her mouth and gave a big bite at one of the eclair's her Granny was giving her. It was so good that she simply couldn't stop moaning from the taste. And between every morsels she could only watch gleefully ash belly tried to grow to even larger limits, while tightly confined by the pajama shirts she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even the resistant material had its limits. As the poor girl was still being feeded, the button shirt began to creak slightly, tightening under the constant expansion of a belly filled with magically enhanced food . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, Gretel was breathing deeply, her enchanted hunger exhausted, the witch slowly caressing her hair, while her balloon of a stomach pushed right at the limit of the button shirt pajamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso the witch had noticed that a few more pastries could help Gretel break out of the now constricting shirt, but she had to admit that the girl had eaten pretty much already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still the old crone loved watching the kids burst out of clothes that only hours before fitted them perfectly and Gretel was so close....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The crone had fed her much, much more than the previous days. Her belly had grown so big that not even the witch herself could hug all of Gretel at once. Still, she noticed with a glare, her pajama button shirt, while on the verge of exploding, hadn't yet done so. This made the crone so angry, for she really loved watching the kids grow out of their clothes, ripping through them as their magically stuffed flesh burst seams and ripped shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Gretel's pajamas seems to taunt the witch with their durability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How come it didn't burst yet? The kid's belly is as full as it can be. It should have exploded in a shower of buttons...and instead it still there, tightly tapered across this huge, rotund, full belly.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crone was irritated and Gretel, even though was mostly out of her mind, noticed her granny strange behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny...\" she huffed, taking quick, fast, intakes of air at almost each word, so full she felt.<br>\r\n\"Granny...did I...do...something...wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, child.\" The witch answered hurriedly, cursing herself for letting herself be caught angry by her future morsel\"It's nothing, deary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel was stuffed full, more asleep than awake, but she could tell right away that something had upset her Granny. But since the only thing they had done together was eating, she realized the it was herself that had failed her Granny somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny?...If you...tell...me...what's...wrong...maybe I....could...help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crone was going to let out a nasty retort when she realized that the foolish child was herself offering the perfect solution. She had only to explain it to her and apply some...persuasion to her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, child...The thing is...You want to become Healthy for Granny, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Granny...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, The first sign of a truly healthier child is when, after having eaten his( or her) share, he manage to burst out of his clothes, ripping them to shreds. B-But it's not your fault dear...Don't worry... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel realized what the problem was. She had thought that to be healthy all she had to do was to eat Granny's treats. But she saw now that that, was only part of being a healthy child. The most important part was to break her clothes without touching them. Gretel managed to place her chubby hands on the sides of her stuffed tummy, feeling it as it digested the breakfast prepared for her. But still the displeasure in her Granny's voice had brought her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No...' she told herself' I will be the Healthy child my granny wish of me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, child?\" The witch said in a false hopeless tone, for she was in Gretel mind and she knew what the child was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you...feed me...some..more? I'm...urp...\" a tiny burp escaped from her lips, as her chubby hands were rubbing her stuffed gut trying to make some more space<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm...Hungry...Granny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch flashed a toothy grin, then she bent and kissed Gretel's forehead, feeling the girl beam with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still hungry, Child? Oh, what a healthy granddaughter I've got...Her, sweetie, open up and I'll feed you only the nicest treats...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'it tooks only a little bit of persuasion and some touchy words, and this foolish girl is all bent to please me. And when She has reached her maximum weight...then, and only then, I'll place her in my oven!' The witch thought with glee as she bent toward the girl, moving around the beach ball like stomach she was sporting, to bring a big, fat, dark chocolate eclair toward Gretel's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel did her best to keep eating, even though she felt overly stuffed she wanted, no. She needed to show her granny how healthy she could be. So she kept on munching, and swallowing, whatever sweet treat the other woman brought to her lips. First a big eclaire, which she messily ate, covering her face in cream, while her belly seemed to gro a little bit more. Then a huge scone, easily three times as big as a normal one, came and went into her mouth, throat and stomach, stretching this last one for a few more centimeters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pajamas shirt, then, started creaking a little bit more, but still it resisted. Still remained in one piece. The crone grinned even more, looking at Gretel, while bringing near her bloated form, still parked on a marshmallow couch, a trolley with a big pitcher of fresh milk and a rich, chocolaty, pound cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, here come some more...\" said the witch, after having cut a slice from the cake, easily a fifth of the entire cake, bringing it almost on Gretel's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor girl felt truly full, but she still wanted to please her granny, and it made her feel bad not being able to eat anymore. She closed her eyes, desperately praying that the button shirt would simply cease to resist, but it didn't seem to be working for when she opened up her eyes, the shirt was still firmly closed and her granny was pushing a fat slice of cake to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her last available strengths, Gretel opened her mouth, accepting the morsel, taking then her good time to munching it, hoping that her churning and glorping stomach could make some more room, until she only had to swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slice of cake, slowly traveled down her throat, until arrived, tumbling heavily, in her over packed stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Gretel felt just as before, seeing that the jacket she had on still stayed there proudly until, with a sudden loud ripping sound, all the buttons that kept the huge gut in check, exploded out in a sudden burst. The sudden movement unbalanced Gretel which almost toppled down from the couch, while her gut began to finally sound less and less angry. With the sudden freedom of space it began absorbing more and more of the ingested food, growing larger and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel didn't see much of this, as soon as the buttons flew out and her belly surged forward she fell almost immediately asleep, while the whisper of her granny still rebounded around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You did really good, Gretel dear. You'll soon be the Healthiest child this house has ever seen'  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked around the bedroom, she remembered the witch and all the food, the amazing tasting food, but she didn't remember going to bed. She pulled off the covers and slid her legs over the side to sit up, stretching again. She felt cool air on the bottom of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down and saw her shirt had slit up a little on what looked like a softer, larger tummy. Maybe it's how she was sitting? Gretel stood up and looked back at her stomach, pulling the fabric of her shirt down. No, that wasn't it. Maybe she was bloated from all the food? She rubbed her stomach, it was softer then she remembered. No, that wasn't it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gained weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed a mirror in her room and walked over to it. She modeled in front of it for a moment, her stomach wasn't massive, but still a little larger. It had actually started to poke out from under her shirt again. Her butt had grown a little too, but not as much. Luckily that looked like it was all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel sighed, she knew she couldn't gain weight. She did want to eat like that again and again, forever really, but her family couldn't afford it. The cost of food wasn't just the problem, even though her family couldn't afford that either, but the clothes. They could barely keep her dressed now without going broke, let alone if she started growing faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her shirt down again, she wanted to stay, but she couldn't. Her parents were worried, and if she stayed, they wouldn't be able to pay for the new clothes she would need. She headed out of the guest bedroom and down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, dearie.\" The witch greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel's stomach growled at the sight of the table. It was covered in the most delicious food she had ever seen. Turkey, chicken, pie, fish, cobbler, pork, and cake. \"Morning.\" she said trying to ignore the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel any different this morning?\" asked the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Gretel said, subconsciously rubbing her new tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for  breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I really can't stay.\" Gretel sighed, \"I need to get going, my parents are probably worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist, dearie.\" The witch said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel started towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But at least have a glass of water, so you don't get thirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glass of water couldn't make her any bigger. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch poured out a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With every sip that she may take<br>\r\nMake her appetite more great<br>\r\nAnd magic forces keep her here 'til later<br>\r\nso that she, than now, may be even fatter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch said her spell so quietly that Gretel couldn't here it as she poured. The water glowed slightly for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch handed Gretel the drink and she poured it down her throat. She thanked the witch and started towards the door, but it suddenly seemed so far away. With each step she took she got even hungrier, every time she inhaled the food smelled better, before she got to the door she started to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the speed of a woman in her youth the witch caught the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, dearie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Gretel answered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't have known better. A growing girl needs her breakfast.\" the witch spoke softly pulling her to the table. Gretel had a second of thought about fighting, but it smelled too good, and she was too hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should eat your breakfast before you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel started to dig into the food, eating even faster than yesterday.</span></div></div>",

Cinderella was forbidden from looking into the pantry and was only allowed to eat what she was given. Even though her step family wasn't destitute they behaved so around Cinderella keeping her starving and dressed in rags, as if they were penniless. But Cinderella was about to see for herself how much food they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GASP! Look at all the sweets!\" Cinderella burst with joy at the sight of chocolates and candies. Cinderella stared in awe at the bounty before quickly snatching something and running away. Cinderella stared at the bag of chocolate \"Should I really do this. I've been told never to eat these and that I have to lose weight but but but I'm just so hungry and its not like anyone will notice sooo...Nomfph\" Cinderella scarfed down the whole bag of chocolates feeling an elation she hasn't felt for years. \"Oh my what a delicious sensation. I must have more!\" Cinderella said. She sneaked into the pantry again swiping some more chocolates. \"Who cares if I can't slim down, I always thought fat looked cute anyway.\" Cinderella said hiding her chocolates in her rag dress. But then a half eaten cake was just sitting on the table, tempting the girl. \"If I eat too much they'll notice but they won't notice slivers missing hehe.\" Cinderella said cutting off parts of the cake immediately consuming it. Cinderella was in heaven, finally tasting sweets, vowing never again to be without it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on Cinderella would sneak food from under her stepfamily's nose, eating tasty foods from meats to desserts. Fortunately her step family didn't notice her weight gain, they just grew jealous and dumped more chores on her. But as long as Cinderella was eating she didn't care. She also loved her growing appearance. She fondled her belly, loved her bulging breasts, adored her wobbly ass, savoured her arm flab as it smacked against her, and enjoyed her thighs rubbing together to her family's dismay. Cinderella's body was bulging through the tears in her rags which constantly covered less and less of her as time passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day... </span></div></div>",
