It's your 18th birthday as you head downstairs to greet your family you are surprised to find a folded note on the table written I'm your mother's handwriting it says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dan if you found this then we left before you woke up your father was chosen to represent his company at a very important conference in Sweden. I'm sorry we left before giving you your present but if this trip works out your father could be offered a very high level position. We will  be back at the end of the month. We left some money for you <br>\r\n-mom\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nunder the note  you find an envelope with 400$ and a small note form your father that says \"try not to have to much fun\".<br>\r\nYour moment of silence is broken by the sound of your doorbell. when you open it you see the mailman driving off down the street. As you turn to head back inside you spot a large brown box with a letter taped to the top. Curious as to what it could be you drag it inside and place it on the kitchen table you look at it and wonder what to do with it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You frown at the sight of the box, it's relatively plain. Large, bruised cardboard exterior with thin masking tape to seal the slits. <br>\r\n\"It's probably something cheap..\" you grumble, retrieving a knife from a drawer at your hip.<br>\r\nDriving the knife into the top of the box, the tape splits easily and you open the flaps, you're greeted by a small white box surrounded by foam and bubble wrap.<br>\r\nPicking up the box, you search through the wrap to find nothing else inside, and you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this, a wedding ring?\" You say as you open the white box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiny, blue sphere glimmers in the sunlight and sparkles at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this..?\" You say, picking it out of the box carefully, it's sticks to your fingers. \"Ugh, it's like a piece of candy..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting down the white box, you examine the blue object further. Licking your fingers to see if it really was candy, the raspberry taste confirms your suspicion.<br>\r\nIt's surprisingly good, a little spicy. You pop the thing in your mouth and suck on it. Suddenly, it slips down your throat and you double over, grabbing your neck.<br>\r\nLeaning against the counter, the white box clatters on the floor as you drop it. The blockage in your throat clears as quickly as it came, and you're left gasping for breath. Standing up straight, you stare at the letter with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better be damn good..\" You say, picking up the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touch the paper with your right hand and suddenly it shivers in between your fingers, then pops out of your grasps and floats in the air, blue light running through it's white material. Then, in an instant, the envelope shreds into nothingness, revealing a glowing blue square. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" You yell, startled, your hand is incredibly hot right now, and as you soon discover, glowing blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of blue light blinds you, and when it finally fades, you open your eyes to see a sort of.. hologram.. projected from the surface of the square. An old man stands in front of you, frowning, he seems to be examining you strangely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..? Where am I?\" He mutters, his voice raspy and aged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so confused right now.\" You're not even surprised anymore, simply sharing in the old man's disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up at you and something sparkles in his eye as he notices your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! You have the Seed! Good good, that's probably how all this came about.\" He says, clapping his hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The seed..? You mean that small blue piece of candy?\" You say, raising a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was no candy, son, it was an old and very powerful magical artefact used by dark practitioners. Say, what year is it?\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2014..\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet lord! By my count, 1132 years have passed since I died..\" He says, stroking his rather long beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply frown, now this is getting a little bit ridiculous. Your hand is still burning, you discover and when you look at it, you see a strange blue aura wisping  away from your skin, almost like a flame. The man looks at you as you examine your hand and chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you have the seed, you're probably a Vincent.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How did you know my last name?\" You reply, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.. well, son, that's probably because I'm one of the first Vincents. \" He says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..What? That means you're.. related to me.\" You say, shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, and it's my job to teach you what to do with your new power. You've got quite the responsibility.\" He says, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What new power? What are you talking about?\" You're intrigued, even though you appear irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The seed grants it's host the amazing powers. Like the seed, you will also become a parasite. You see, the seed lives off of your life energy, and thus, you must live off the life energy of others. The seed, of course, will give you the necessary tools to do so. In a few moments, you will probably feel incredibly hungry, but normal food will not suffice to feed you. It is grim, I know, but you must become.. a cannibal..? I suppose that's appropriate.\" He says, finishing with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate for a moment, your brain takes a minute to understand everything he just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK MAN!?\" You shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in the bathroom, looking at your now glowing blue eyes. The old man Vincent is hovering next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? The seed demands nutrition, and since you are recently dubbed it's host, you must satisfy it quickly.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. but, what do I- GAHH!\" You yell, clutching your chest, you double over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld man Vincent simply watches you, arms folded, as you tear off your shirt to reveal the seed embedded in your chest, strange crystal veins slowly crawl over your ribs. The pain is enormous, like you're being burned from the inside out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening to me!?\" You say, breathing heavily as you strain against the agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body is being re-composed to adapt to the seed's power. Don't worry, it'll be over in a second.\" He says, disturbingly confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds pass, and the pain subsides, but you're left with an aching headache. You get up slowly, holding onto the sink as you look into the mirror again. Your eyes no longer glow blue, but ARE blue. The small blue gem pulsates with energy in your chest, sending it's low glow through the veins it made around your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down! Everything's fine!\" Old man Vincent yells at you, \"All you need to do it find somebody to consume!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consume?! Do I look like fucking Hannibal Lector?!\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Hannibal Lector?\" He says, raising a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you storm out of the bathroom after you pull your shirt back on quickly. The doorbell rings.<br>\r\nYour head snaps towards the living room, who the hell could that be? You make your way out and walk to the door, looking through the peephole.<br>\r\nYour girlfriend sees you and waves eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Dan! Lemme' in already!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, a craving fills you, it's unlike anything you've ever felt before. You groan, slowly opening the door. Your girlfriend bursts through, before noticing your ailed expression. Old man Vincent's disappeared, figures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby? What's wrong?\" Your girlfriend says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, leave me alone.. please..!\" You beg her, trying to push her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! God, let me get you to bed..\" She feels your forehead and quickly pulls her hand away in shock, \"Ow! You're on fire.. literally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and turn away from her, she simply grabs your shoulders and pulls you along towards your room. As she moves infront of you, something urges you to do it. Your right hand's ablaze with power, something whispers to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>Feed me..</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncontrollably, you throw her long brown hair over her shoulder, revealing her pale neck, and you thrust your index finger right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da- AGH!\" She yells in pain as your fingers literally impales her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile wickedly, as if you're possessed. Ashley drops to the floor, writhing in pain, you see the blue flames from your hand have somehow transferred to her body, probably through the hole your finger made. She claws at your feet, looking up at you, tears stream down her face as her legs seem to dissolve. Her shoes fall off as she pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan! Help me, please! It hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her, watching as her body up to her neck has dissolved into nothing but a flattened out skin. Suddenly, you snap out of it. The first thing you notice is a long blue line between your chest and the back of Ashley's neck, the hungry feeling's gone, and so is your headache. Actually, you feel.. amazing..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan! What are you d-aghghg..\" She gargles as her throat dissolves, falling limp as she finally disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld man Vincent spontaneously materialises next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go boyo! Your first meal! How do you feel?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. I just killed my girlfriend.. But I don't really feel.. sad..?\" You're confused at the concept of being sad about killing people this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because the seed kind of controls your mind to keep you from refraining from it, it's like a killer instinct.\" He explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. Well that's cool, I guess. Kind of sick, though.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, guarding dangerous magical artefacts comes with a cost. Who knows? It could be used for far worse!\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward, you pick up your girlfriend's skin, her clothes hang loosely on her... body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do with this?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! And that's where the seed's special abilities come in. You see, almost as a reward for feeding it, the seed lets you wear the skins of your kills, and will give back the soul of the kill for you to use. In basic terminology, you wear the skin, you turn into the person, memories and everything.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.. well that's nice.. Anything else I should know about?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, well I think fireballs is next on the list of powers.. not sure really. Us Vincents never really used the Seed's magic to that extent.\" He says, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, examining Ashley's drooping, slack face, it's like she's made of rubber and skin fused together.  Her arms seem long and lanky as they hang from where you pinch her shoulders, her hair still feels the same, but she's got no insides, no mouth, no eyeballs.. nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it on, why don't ya?\" Old man Vincent says, before promptly evaporating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not..\" You mumble.</span></div></div>",

\"inside\" life, and the last thing your grandfather asked me before he died was that if i ever wanted to stop my life, i should transfer my \"natural gift\" with you, if you look in the box i sent you, you'll see a pill, it has a raspberry taste, eat it and you'll gain the powers i used during my life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which powers? you said in an irritated voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nas an answer to you, you discover on the back of the paper the following instructions, with a word on it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan, this power can slow down the processus of aging, i now have aproximatively 581 years, i discovered the raspberry pill after an explosion in my alchemist uncle's lab, the instructions of how to use the power are written by his hand, in grey, with my personnal observations in red, have a good time with the power, i just can't stand it anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, this stuff is definitely getting weirder... and cooler, you look at the instructions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"> i, hery of bourgogne, have discovered, during my experiments a witch's cave, in it, i found a human skin made of a strange matter</span> <span class=\"clred\">the matter is actually more like latex, cotton and human skin mixed together</span> <span class=\"clgrey\">however, there seemed to be a secret behind it, i used my knowledge in alchemy to concentrate its power in a pill, that i mixed wit a foreign plant, here are the effects intended</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">- the user of the power can turn everyone nto skins by touching them, they'll immediately deflate and turn in what seems to be a wearable costume</span> <span class=\"clred\">in fact, it's only by touching the back of the neck of someone with your right index, everywhere else, the deflation can't occur</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">-the pill may prevent aging, for both the wearer and weared</span> <span class=\"clred\">actually, the aging of the weare is slowed by 95% per suit, and the weared by 50%, but if you wear many suits, their aging will slow down even more, or, if you reach the 1000 (my collection) the first suit will get younger (1 month per minute)<br>\r\nif not weared, a suit won't age</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">-the power can't be stolen</span><span class=\"clred\"> true, it's only when you want it really hard that the raspberry pill will emerge from your body</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">-The suits can regain their original form by blowing air in the hole formed by your index when you poked it</span> <span class=\"clred\">More than it, the person will actually obey you for at least 1 month, however, some strong minded persons will only last ten minutes, but you can implant ideas in their mind, or memories, this power is not always reliable, but it's useful enough</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><br>\r\nPersonal notes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The suit is virtually expandable for miles and miles, but is not indestructible, it has a resistance equal to 4cm of plastic, and can be destroyed by fire quite easily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The time to deflate is 30 seconds for a normal person, but can vary for obese people<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You can enter a suit while wearing your clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-It is possible to wear only a part of the suit, then blow the others, the person and you will fuse until you turn them into a suit again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Once a person is deflated, it is possible to move the opening hole everywhere, for more possibilities due to the precedent power<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-It is possible to gain some memories of the suit, however, they only appear in real need<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-you can't turn yourself into a suit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You can't turn objects, animals and plants into suits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You can't die as long as you are wearing a suit, but when you'll take it off, the person will die when blowed up, no possible healing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Other peoples can wear the suits, but you can control them if you want, they'll remember the whole thing and you'll be the only one able to take their suit off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Skins turns back in their original form after 100 years<br>\r\nETHIC rules (there has to be some)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't \"kidnap\" people for more than a week without at least playing their roles or giving a call<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't sell skins<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't do things with kids, you know EXACTLY what i mean<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't use the skin to commit crimes or to humiliate peoples (the last time i did it clinton lost his credibility in front of the world)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't have more than 10000 skins<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't turn yourself into someone powerful (i already evoked the clinton chapter)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-DON'T TAKE OVER THE WORLD<br>\r\nthese rules are not obligations, however, i suggest you to use them the more you can, as a storyline or something of this kind</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted by the reading of these rules, you pick up the box, it's wrapped in a fancy paper, it has a strong raspberry smell, you gast as you put it in your mouth, it's like a candy, but you can feel it going trough your tongu, then to your arm, and ultimately to your index finger, you still don't believe any of that shit, knowing it could be one of your sister's prank, but it's worth a shot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are exactly 7 peoples you'd like to try it on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: jenny spielson<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\"

time and she was like a sister to you, unfortunately, you both started to drift away in high school, but the crush you had on her never disappeared, however, you knew she was going to come, for some reaso, she liked birthdays enough to do the craziest things, last year she sent fireworks in your room from her yard two blocks away from here, then came in your room wearing a clown mask and asking you to put on your pants, and even if the last part was unintended, you felt like this year was going to be crazier, anyway, you knew you'd better have a breakfast before anything weird happened, you were just going to take the newspaper outside, so you'll read it while eating you cheerio's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 seconds later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least you're wearing pants\"<br>\r\nAt the very moment you opened the door, the mentos fell into the twelwe bottles of diet coke and striked you with the force of a canoon, like you know, a big one, anyway, it was nothing compared to the glitter and glu applied by some kind of vicious pistol, then, wearing a costume that seemed out of the lion king's musical, jenny said the phrase reported right up here, causing you to feel shame and arousal, a bad combination of your most used feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up a little bit, both you and jenny were at the breakfast's table, she gave you your first gift out of five, a copy of the infamous death note, with a signature from justin bieber and nash grier, who would apparently die tonight in a big firework incident to celebrate my birthday, i actually wondered if she could do that to people, better not wonder too much tough, she then presented me the b plan for my birthday, due to being without my parents and my sister(she was trapped in a snow storm in finland, near the frontier (the finnish line they call it) it involved a rollercoaster, a pool, nash and justin's fireworks, paintball, a limo and stuff, jenny had no mney problems since she cracked the codes of the lottery 2 years ago, killing her parents in the process (you don't build a supercomputer with dynamite without accidents damnit!) since then, she lived on her own in a gigantic house with a pool, a lab, ect... she passes time by making huge birthday parties for everyone, and it was always great, as long as you had a washing machine<br>\r\nBut you couldn't read the part of the program you were supposed to do now<br>\r\n\"It's invisible ink, i mixed my inks up in the printer, you need to heat this thing up for now\"<br>\r\nYou went to the toaster, putted two slices of bread inside, and the paper on the top, you took a sip out of your coffee (mmmmmmmm bitter and tasteless at the same time, like your mom) then, the ink started to reveal itself.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">From 8pm to 8:20pm</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">tick</span><br>\r\nyou waited another minute, now, the message became clearer<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\">Tickling the shit out of</span> <span class=\"cgrey\">dan</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh damn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt jenny's hand on your armpits, then on your tummy, then on your neck, she was wearing weird gloves that tickled you more, it was atrocious, you bursted out of laughter, and you tried to escape her grip, and god, was that hard, you tried to ticle her too, but under the armpits would have provoked sexual tension because of the boob proxmity, you couldn't reach her tummy, so, you went for the neck, you did your best to control your moves while you tickled her, but the laughter on both sides was way too hard, you couldn't control yourself, nor could jenny, and while she bent, you went to tickle her in a higher place, and unfortunately<br>\r\n*pfffffff*<br>\r\n\"Wait dan, wait, there's something wrong\"<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you asked, without knowing what you did \"Did i hurt you?\"<br>\r\n\"With your patethic muscles, no chance said jenny, while she reached for the back of her neck, you couldn't possibly punch a bee, no, it's weird i...\"<br>\r\nJenny appeared horrified, as she tried to bring back her arm, but everything under her elbow looked deflated, and her tickling glove fell of, her other arm started to deflate too, you knew this was no joke, she tried to stand on her feet, but everything under her knee was disappearing, it was hard to watch, soon, her limbs were completely deflated<br>\r\n\"Ok, don't panic, i think i did this, calm down, everything will be fine, just wait a minute, everything will be perfect, i promise\"<br>\r\n\"You do?\" Only her upper torso and her head were left now, you wished you didn't screw up too much for it to be unfixable.<br>\r\n\"Yes, i promise, i can reverse it, give me a minute, and it'll be alright\"<br>\r\n\"Please...\" Only her head was left of her, unsure what to say now, you did this thing that rarely works anywhere else than in the romantic comedies: you kissed her. When you opened your eyes again, you were kissing what looked like a beautiful, deflated sex doll, you contained yourself, then, you turned her upside down, you could see it, in the middle of her neck, the hole, you stretched it a lttle bit, it felt like some kind of soft, warm material, you couldn't see what the inside was made of, You took a deep breath and you</span></div></div>",

You took a deep breath (again) and pulled the suit to you while you stretched the opening with both of your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went legs first, of course, the inside seemed bigger, and you couldn't precisely feel your legs, you knew where they were, but you felt them different, like they weren't legs but breasts, or a belly, but then, you slipped carefully in the legs, then, you didn't feel your legs at all, but jenny's, it was weird, they were so soft, you were smaller, but the booty made it didn't mattered tough, you grabbed it and rubbed it, but it didn't felt right, you slipped deeper in the suit, with your arms, next thing you knew, jenny's AA breasts were on your chest, your groin area felt weird, but you would explore your new body later, even if wiggling jenny's long fingernails made you happy for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up, you were now jenny from the neck to your (or rather her) feet, and you were wearing her attractive bodysuit, it was all pretty new but you already felt comfortable. Now was the big moment, you used jenny's index and went through the hole, then, you moved the hole slowly to the deflated base of jenny's neck, then, you bent your neck and blew in it, once, twice, thrice, fourice, fiveice, ice cream, etc... at first, the head moved only slowly, by pulses with your breath, soon, it rised, then<br>\r\n\"Can i exactly know what the hell you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you think about people to become your mind turns to Henriette. Henriette is a college student just like you. You're friends since sixth grade; Henriette is a tomboy and so you both have common interests. Video games and girls come to mind. Finding out that she was a lesbian came as a surprise to you. You never thought anything odd of Henriette. That was until a video was placed on the web in grade ten in which Henriette was confessing to a girl you both knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that things never were the same as before. Her family wasn't happy with her coming out; they were very strict and weren't happy with their daughters falling for women. The bond however between you and Henriette got stronger. Finding herself without any friends you took the responsibility to take care of her. In the beginning Henriette was scared, thinking you would react the same as the others. That changed though as you talked more and more. You even talked about your favorite kind of girls. Surprisingly Henriette liked the kind of girls with big breasts and even more surprising she had a crush on your sister. That was a shock to you, but Henriette promised she would never go for her. She was only interested in her body and since your sister didn't consider herself bisexual chances were slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here you were years later, both graduated high school and in college. Henriette wants to become a journalist, having a scholarship for journalism. You admired Henriette for it and were also a little jealous of her. The girls in her journalism classes were way hot and Henriette was hanging out with some of them. You wish you could hang out with girls like those. But with these powers you could do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile you leave your apartment and head for the girl's dorm. Inside the girl's dorm you are a bit careful. Guys are allowed inside here during the day, but some girls just see guys leave if  they would see that they were up to no good. In front of Henriette's room you knock, before you hear her to come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the room and see Henriette sitting at her desk working on her laptop. Her blond hair is short as always. She's wearing a simple white tank top with skinny jeans. \"Hey, Dan.\" She says surprised seeing you visit her. \"What's up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can't a guy visit one of his best friends.\" You tell her as you are about to give her a hug. You pull her in a deep hug and feel her arms hugging you back. At that moment you decide on executing your plan. \"Dan, listen, I have something important to tell you. It's...\" Before Henriette can say something more you pushed your right index finger into the back of her neck. The next moment your hold is gone. You stumble forward and hit the ground. \"Sorry Henriette, I\" You look down and immediately back away. Instead of Henriette you see some kind of suit that looks familiar to Henriette. Though her eyes were gone, the facial features do resemble Henriette. The clothes that Henriette wore are hanging around the skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked, the power worked! Henriette turned into a skinsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do with it?</span></div></div>",
