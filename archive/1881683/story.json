The Zeck have landed across the globe and started to wipe out anything man made from the face of the earth. While many have already died in this attack humanity is still near full strength. The counter attack begins now to attempt to push back these invaders no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The Aftermath<br>\r\nThe War is long over with the last true military force being wiped out over seventy years ago. Humanity now lives on the brink, surviving only in small groups or at the edges of the Zeck civilization. These are some who still try to resist, but many are more worried about simply surviving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Alternate Timeline  <br>\r\nWhat if the Zeck weren't so aggressive? The Earth is a big place maybe Humanity and the Zeck could learn to share? </span></div></div>",

All attempts to communicate with the Aliens have born no fruit. These titan like beings and their advanced tech made them nearly unstoppable, but not invincible. A few of the Zeck have been killed with a combination of low-yield nuclear war heads and conventional military forces. However, these victories have been limited and the losses that the Zeck have taken are easily absorbed. It simply isn't enough to kill one or two Zeck scouts, humanity needed to destroy the landing sites that were teleporting down supplies and soldiers to the planets surface.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The Soldier<br>\r\nThe largest war to ever take place on the planet is under way and you are part of the first wave. The combined might of nearly every military on earth have gathered their forces to attack Zeck beach heads all over the planet at the same time. This is all or nothing everything is committed, its time to show these aliens they picked the wrong planet to mess with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The Civilian<br>\r\nIts all over the news on every channel, life outside of Earth does exist and it isn't friendly. There have been reports of these aliens destroying everything in their wake as they move out from where they landed. One of these beach heads where the Aliens have landed hardly 60 miles outside of the city where you live. The city is already in a panic and you are caught up in the mix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: The Scientist<br>\r\nSome say your mission is suicidal, but to you its less so then attacking the Zeck head on. You are part of a small team attempting to study the invaders to find some kind of weakness. The problem is the only way to learn anything new there needs to be some very close up study of these subjects. So you head towards a location of known Zeck activity in order to get closer then anyone has before and hopefully learn something that could save the world. </span></div></div>",

The mission you and millions of others were currently on all around the world would be a suicide mission for most if not everyone involved.The mission briefing had been very clear about that, cutting off the supply lines of the enemy was the ultimate goal with the lives of those going in secondary which you were sure weren't even that important. What kind of course did anyone really have though, you and everyone else on earth were facing eradication and this was humanities only chance of pushing the threat back. You could hope though that somehow you'd make it through the battle and see the other side even if it was unlikely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see your tech looking over your squads Exo-suits doing some checks making sure their ammo is topped off. Though all you can do is look out the side door window at the ocean of black helicopters both transports and attack copters along with waves of jets flying above them. The sky you looked out into was thick with military aircraft. As your eyes drift down you spot a city below, you weren't sure if it would of been better to be down there with the civilians or not. While you found yourself going into a fight at least you had a way to put up some resistance, cities like that one wouldn't be able to put up any kind of fight if the military's gambit failed. You take a deep breath before moving up next to cockpit. \"How much further?\" You ask, \"Not to much.\" She said pointing out into the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out the front of the helicopter seeing a light purple glow as it slowly started to grow larger and taller as you moved closer. This was why this assault was happening, it hadn't taken the Zeck very long to figure out humanity's nukes were their only real weapon against them so they put up their dome. It was made of some kind of energy that neutralized anything radioactive turning a nuke into a normal bomb or missile making it nearly useless against them. So it was up to a combination of air and ground forces to find and disable the device so nukes could be launched and destroy the site. Once the shield was down all friendly forces would only have twenty minutes to evac the blast zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour palms grew sweaty as they gripped the back of the pilots seat. Just then a heavy hand fell on your shoulder. You looked back to find your Sargent looking back at you, \"Alright private its time to suit up. We will be in the drop zone in thirty.\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't as if anyone would have much time for field fittings during this operation. You heart was pounding, but you could at least find comfort that everything was going to plan. It seemed somebody higher up knew what they were doing and had kept this massive attack either off of the Zeck radar or knew the Zeck simply didn't care enough to look for one. Whatever the case at least it meant you would make it out of the sky and to the ground in one piece. You body felt the impact of the black hawk touching down your sergeant sliding the door open. \"Alright everyone this is our stop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou powered up your suit feeling the power of its mechanical muscles boosting your own. You then follow the rest of your squad as you file outside hitting the grass and out from under the blades of the copter as seconds later it lifted off now with a new mission to complete. You look around seeing thousands of other troops just like yourself being unloaded as well as armor and artillery a few drones even streak across the sky just above your head. This was only one of several dozen just like it all around the Zeck beach head which was now only five miles off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even with this distance Zeck were dominating the horizon in the distance. After all to humans it was miles off, but to the Zeck you were only several dozen steps away from their base. You didn't spot any Zeck at the moment, but you did see some of their equipment. It was hard to tell from this angle and scale what it was, but it seemed to be the back of some kind of console though being several thousand feet tall, it looked more like some kind of strange metal mountain. You weren't given long to admire the sites however, it was time to move before you found yourself looking up at Zeck solider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou along with the countless others started moving towards the Zeck beach head hoping stay under the radar allowing humanity a needed surprise attack on the Zeck.  </span></div></div>",

It seemed everything was going better then anyone could of ever expected with the Zeck seemly still unaware of the attack they were currently under. There were currently thousands of human's breaking into their base though there wasn't much in the way of true defensive measures at least that you could tell. You could see squad leaders calling in over their coms to report the situation and most likely telling air support to hold off since all they could do was alert the enemy that humanity had made their way into their base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow your squad as the larger groups of people started to break off each looking to find Zeck equipment to sabotage. It wasn't as if anyone really knew what this shield tech looked like so the plan was always to simply disable as much equipment as we could and hope for the best. The moment the light purple aura dropped command would call in the strikes and then it would be your job to get the hell out of there before this whole area was glassed with a dozen high yield thermo-nuclear bombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour squad reached the side of one of the strange towering metal consoles controlling who knows what. A few of your squad start to work on cutting a hole though the wall of metal so all of you could get inside to the workings inside to cause a mess. As they cut though the rest of the squad including you had to be on alert watching for any Zeck which strangely you haven't seen yet. While the beach head was nearly 100 miles across due to their size you were surprised none had come into sight yet. Whatever the reason there were none around you hoped they stayed away a bit longer.</span></div></div>",

Your squad cut into the side of the Zeck equipment and quickly got to work planting high explosives on anything and everything that even looked sorta important. Along with your squad hundreds of others were doing the same and from the sound of it over coms they hadn't run into the Zeck either. Everything went rather smooth as you along with the rest of your squad placed the charges and you evacuated the innards of the Zeck equipment. You took up defensive position as all the other squads finished up checking in over coms as they finished their task. Soon enough everyone was done and while not every bit of Zeck equipment had been set to blow they could only hope the right parts would be destroyed to shut down the shield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held your breath as the command was sent out to set off all charges and hope for the best. The blasts could be heard for miles as thousands of explosions range out muffled a bit, by the thick metal walls of the consoles most of them were inside of.

The flight back was filled with men and women high off of an impossible victory, we had taken a giant step in beating back the Zeck and hadn't lost a single person in the process. Even in your most wild of dreams could of you thought of such a thing happening, but you'd just lived that dream and so did thousands of others each just as surprised. When you got back to base however, it would seem that the dream was well and over as the reality of the situation was given to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zeck forces that would of been defending that beach head had left just hours before your division arrived. They had been called in to assist with fighting off an attack by a separate division on another of their beach heads. There had only been a small handful of Zeck left at the base which allowed your team to move in unnoticed and destroy the base killing the few Zeck left on guard duty. While this under estimation thinking only a few guards could defend the whole of their base had lead to an easy victory at your beach head attack, the division the rest of the Zeck had been set out to deal with was wiped out to the last man. In fact that was the far more common story around the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem out of all the attacks across the planet yours was the only one to have successes in destroying a beach head. The other divisions sent out failed and over half of them were wiped out utterly. It would seem your victory was only due to the over confidence of a single Zeck commander and good timing. A strategy that wouldn't be winning any wars.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armies of the world were demolished with only a fraction of their strength after the attempted counter attack. A counter attack that even with the full might of the worlds militaries had only dealt any kind of blow due to blind luck. Now with earth's forces only a shadow of its former self attacking the Zeck head on was off the table. What was left of the world governments forces decided it would be best to play the long game and pull inwards save who and what they could and hide until they could find a way to one day defeat the Zeck. You would be part of the lucky ones that would be spared the Zeck's wrath as they prepared the earth for colonization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the world was on its own, as Zeck forces were for the most part now unopposed as they started colonization with only small remnants of the military unwilling to give in continued to fight a losing war.</span></div></div>",

Your own city had fallen in the shadow of one of these beach heads as they were calling them only 60 miles north. However, luck had seemed to be on your side as none of the Zeck had come your way, at least not yet. This fact was not lost on many who had started to evacuate the city looting along the way. In fact as you watch things seemly only getting worse everyday with the military only able to claim small victories while trying to ignore the massive losses you started to think about evacuating yourself.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat in your living room you felt the floor starting to shake slightly making your face go pale. You looked out your window as the sun slowly seemed to vanish the world outside going dark. \"It can't be.\" You were barley able to speak as you went towards the window ready to see one of these massive aliens out the window. However, what you were met with instead was the heavy sounds of engines and cashing booms of jets. You look up out of your window to see the sky blackened by a seemly unending number of helicopters and jets stretching off in every direction. It would seem Operation Independence was in fact well under way and you were getting a live update on their progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time the last of the air power passed over head letting light pour back over the city.

Paul Jackson, not being able to help his intense feeling, turns his Tv on, to the channel 5 news. Paul hoped he was wrong, hoped that he was just being paranoid. Paul lived in the small city of RiverLilly for 10 years, and out of all that time nothing has ever happened. Even when this war between humanity and the Zecks began almost a year ago, still nothing happened in this quit town. Heck Paul haven\u2019t even seen a Zeck before, all he knew was that they were really tall or something, in truth Paul wasn\u2019t even entrusted in this war. But today was different, the war was supposedly at his door step, things had changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was Saturday, or in other words Paul\u2019s day off from work. Today was the day when Paul would stay at home and do nothing in his white t shirt and black boxers, as he watched TV all day, usually that is, but today Paul actually wore close. Paul wore a long sleeve brown shirt, and blue jeans with flip flops on his feet. The only thing that was the same was Paul\u2019s messy uncombed brown hair. Paul didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to the city, for all he knew, the city would be given the evacuation order and he would have to get a move on, therefore he wanted to be ready just in case. Paul glancing out his apartment window sees a myriad of cars filling the streets. It turned out that quite a few people had already decided to leave the city. Paul didn\u2019t know if they were over reacting, or if they were just being smart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul looking on the channel 5 news sees a dozen tanks, and a dozen soldiers armed with their weapons marching towards the enemy. The solders inspired confidence as they ,arched with stern looks on their faces, not even a little fear on their face. Paul admired them for that, he knew that he wouldn\u2019t be so brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[\u201cTo all the viewers watching this from the comfort of their homes, you can see behind me the brave solders who have been called in to fight the Zeck Menace that has been terrorizing hundreds of cities\u201d]. The news man says pointing towards the solder behind him. Soon the news man stops talking as he puts his hand up to the small device in his ear. Paul knew that the news man was receiving new information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[\u201cI have just gotten word that their seems to be only one Zeck, I repeat their seems to be only one Zeck solder attacking. Our men should have this raped up before lunch\u201d]. The news man says with a satisfactory smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground begins to rumble with great intensity as a large explosion echoes throughout everybody's ears. Pauls whole apartment begins to shake violently. The news man on the TV falls to the ground long with the soldiers behind him. The camera man must have fallen too because the image on the TV started to Shake out of control. The camera image is focused on the ground, Paul could see how the ground had deep cracks in it, and how it had been upheaved by some great force. The news was being broadcasted a few miles away from the city, so Paul knew that what ever this force was, was powerful enough to make the whole city of RiverLilly and the military feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother explosion vibrates the city, but this explosion was even stronger and louder. Paul\u2019s ceiling began to release dust, seemingly unable to withstand what ever was happening. Paul wasn't the only one who felt the power of these explosions, Paul looking on his TV sees very man broadcasted, fly a few feet into the air before plummeting to the ground a little hurt. The power of these explosions were able to lift them off the ground, only for a few seconds. Paul soon heard a screeching sound coming from outside. Paul carefully getting to his shaking feet walks walks over to his window to see a world in panic. Cars had ether been run off the road, or had crashed into a building or some other sturdy object, the powerful earthquakes preventing them from being able to remain in their lanes. Building where falling apart slowly, from the  rubble that was nocked loose from the powerful vibrations, these pieces of Stone fell to the ground with great force cracking the sidewalk or gravely hurting people. But what truly caught Paul\u2019s attention was the huge mountain that toward over the whole city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul knew that what he was looking at wasn\u2019t a mountain of course, it was as big as a mountain, but the last time Paul had checked, mountains didn\u2019t move. Paul could barley make out what stood before him, but he could tell he was looking at a body, a women\u2019s body miles and miles away from where he was at. Paul soon realized that he was looking at a Zeck. Paul knew that a Zeck was large compared to a ordinary human being but this was ridiculous. Large didn\u2019t give them enough credit. Paul could barely make ou the giants women\u2019s face as it was almost in the clouds. Paul could tell that the women had long blond hair that came down to the mid section of her back and white skin. The women was to tall, so Paul couldn't see her eyes that were hidden by her hair. The women wore some kind of advanced body armor, that looked like the kind of armor you would see in SYFY movies. On the women\u2019s waist which was 100s of feet above Paul\u2019s head, rested some kind of gun. Paul continued to look at the gigantic women and realized that she was 100s of miles to his prospective, but to her she was only a few inches away from the city that barley came up to his ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul soon remembers the military and the news, and camera man. Paul returning to the living room (not sitting down this time) stares at the TV. The military were busy firing their ammo at the giants right foot. The solders were firing their guns, while the tanks where blasting their cannons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[\u201cAs you viewers from home can see, the enemy has finally arrived, and the military is hard at work to Vanquish this threat\u201d]. The news man says. Paul didn\u2019t know if the man on the news was super brave or stupid, Paul feared the latter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera zooms in on the spot the military was attacking which once again was her right foot, the solders, the news man, and even Paul himself stared in disbelief of the sight before their eyes. The giant women\u2019s foot. Her shoes where completely unharmed. Paul was surprised, and then he wasn\u2019t, to this giantess, these men where nothing but dust, their attacks were nothing to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul\u2019s apartment begins to rumble as the sight of giggling rocks everyone who hears it to their core. Paul knew where this giggling came from. Their was only one place it could come from. The giant women. The power in the giantesses laugh simply astounded Paul. This women, no goddess could kill with nothing but her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?\u201d The women\u2019s voice shakes every window throughout the whole city<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSOME DUST PARTICLES, TRYING TO GET MY ATTENTION?\u201d The giant women says looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant women bends down enough for Paul to get a look at her mile long face. The women was pretty beautiful, and it amazed Paul as to how human she looked, but deep down he knew that she wasn\u2019t human, no she was something else. Paul takes notice of a strange device on the women\u2019s humongous face. The device surrounded her right eye with a green Lens. More advanced tech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL HUMANS YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION.\u201d The women says with a cold tone \ud83e\udd76 that shook everyone to their core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul didn\u2019t know what the women was going to do, but he knew he could stay here any longer. For some strange reason the evacuation order wasn\u2019t given to the city, but it didn\u2019t change anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to find a way out of the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There are far signs left of humanity mostly ruins that still stand deep in the now giant forests created by the Zeck Colonization teams. Humanity still holds on however, though only just. Due to the average humans small size the Zeck saw little need in hunting every single one down.

The Zeck's own world had been lost to war and these ships made up the last of their kind. The Earth was the only planet they could find that could support Zeck life and with supplies running short they are desperate. The Zeck are happy to share their technology with humanity as long as humanity allows the Zeck to stay. A deal was struck between the world governments and the Zeck allowing them to setup home on our world. That was the day Zeck and humans had to start learning to live together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The Early Days<br>\r\nWhen the Zeck landed, everything changed as most of Africa was given to the Zeck to create their own state. The tech the Zeck gave in return quickly improved peoples lives, but not everything was fine and dandy. Zecks and humans were just learning how to interact which was difficult when the Zeck could crush a person without even noticing. There were many things both species would need to learn making it an interesting time for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2:  One World Two Species<br>\r\nIts been over fifty years since the Zeck landed and while things were bumpy at the start things as always have settled down. Humanity and Zeck live in peace with each other the Zeck thankful for the new lease on life for their people and Humanity thankful for the technology pushing them several hundred years if not more into the future. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The invasion and colonization by the Zeck lead to a rather short, but brutal war between their Colonial fleet and humanity. The Zeck along with being far more advanced then humanity were on a different scale. While the average human was mere (5) to (6) feet tall the average Zeck range from (4000) to (5000) feet tall. So upon landing the Zeck saw the average human as little more then a (2.5) mm pest to wipe away so they could put the planet to better use for their own people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the Zeck were coming to earth in order to colonize and humanity was seen as a minor nuisance and not a true danger to colonization efforts bombardment was not an option the Zeck leadership finding that it would cause to much damage to a world needing so little terraforming. This left the Zeck with having to take the planet with ground troops, colonization command figuring that this tactic would only add a few weeks to the colonization process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the people of Earth were lucky they weren't destroyed from orbit the coming fight didn't give much hope. Humanity was left to fight a one sided war with no clear path to victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimeline: <br>\r\nThe attack: Near-Future <br>\r\nThe Resistance: 100 years later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Important Tech</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Humans</b><br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/08/07/e6/0807e6cbb35f36ae77bc4faf680c6476.jpg\"> Exo-Suit MI-2028:</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/08/07/e6/0807e6cbb35f36ae77bc4faf680c6476.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> Allows the user to run longer and faster and allows a person to lift 10 times that of a normal person.
