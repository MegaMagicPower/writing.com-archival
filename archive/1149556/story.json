(These guards were generally Villain's least favorite guards, for they were the most easily harmed.) The castle itself is a large central building that has two wings. (left and right) Attached to the hub and the wings was many superfluous towers that housed commodities such as swimming pools and indoor golf courses. Underground beneath the left wing was the secret hideout for Villain whenever his castle was under attack. As you approach the castle, one of the guards standing at the wall spots you begins to stupidly grunt at the men in the towers to begin firing at the winged intruder. You aim some well placed light blasts at the wall and destroy some of the offensive towers, but their are still more to be dealt with. Eventually the castle defense gets the best of you, and you are forced to retreat. You decide to try a different method of infiltrating the castle. You obviously broke down enough wall that the guards will need to spend some time for repairs, so you may be able to go over the wall while the guards are focused with repairs. As you approach the wall for the second time today, you notice a guard who appears to be exceptionally stupid. So, how you going to get in.  </span></div></div>",

Disappointed that all villages are devoid of sword wielding Heroes, he figures you died on your quest to him.

Most of them end up taking a part of you with them, either as a souvenir, or (gulp), a meal. Suffice to say, you never see any of them again. Eventually, you are whittled down to just a head. Then, an enterprising adventurer has the bright idea of dividing you up further by carefully using the trap blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, things just get worse and worse for you. The first adventurer  took the top of your head to use as a plate, leaving your brain exposed. A second took the remains of your head to use as a boll, leaving just your face, ears, and brain behind. At long last, someone takes pity on you. They decide to take your face and ears with them. Eventually, the two of you make it out of the maze! When he gets home, he treats you very well, and the two of you become good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day however, you feel your thoughts getting a bit sluggish. It occurs to you, that your brain is still in the maze, and that something bad must be happening to it! However, since you can't see, hear, or feel anything near it, you have no way of telling what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the maze, your brain is slowly being picked away, be it by birds, insects, mold, or even simple exposure to the elements. As more and more parts of it are consumed, more and more of your mind starts to fade. Then, one fateful day, another adventurer comes by, fails to notice your brain in time, and steps on it. Your already failing mind dies completely as soon as your brain is squished by that boot. Although your friend morns your loss, instead of giving you a funeral, he sells your still living face and ears as a novelty mask and earrings respectively.</span></div></div>",
