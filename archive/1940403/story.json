            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>                It's been two days since my parents went to Las Vegas for their anniversary and I was watching over my little sister Ashley, she was pretty intelligent for a seven year old but she was too na\u00efve to be mature. I was listening to music on my IPod till it hit 7pm and had to make some dinner for us when my sister started tugging at my shirt with my cell phone in her other hand. I grabbed my phone when my mom said \"Scarlet, I don't have much time but there's an virus that kills people then brings them back as an aggressive cannibal they can only hear and can smell some what try not to make much noise if you have to take out the pistol then just attach the silencer that your dad has in the drawer, and don't be scared your dad taught you some of what he learned in the marines, we will be back from our vacation shortly be careful.\" before I could say anything she hung up. I thought for awhile before I realized something \"This virus is like zombie virus so the only way to kill them is trauma to the head and it probably spreads through bites, scratches and their blood.\" Worried  I told my sister to quietly go to the attic as I went upstairs to take a look outside, I saw what my mom was talking about they looked like corpses luckily they don't seem to be that bright and not that fast either but there was about ten out there so I cant so go out until some of them leave most likely I could leave by tomorrow to get supplies before they're all gone. I went to the kitchen quietly made some sandwiches for us then went up to the attic to eat them as we were eating then she said\"Why are we eating in the attic?.\"<br>\r\n              \"Well...it seems like fun.\" I said nervously as I kinda smiled to make it more convincing.<br>\r\n              \"Ok\" She said with said with a smile. She continued eating convinced as I finished eating then just went to my room for some sleeping bags then quickly went back to the attic. I looked at my phone it was 7:30pm, I told her to sleep for I can look out the window without her being terrified of those human-eating corpses. So I told her a story kissed her forehead then told her goodnight. Once she was asleep I looked out the window to see there's a gas station a couple of streets away and looks like no one has broke in and took anything yet so I've a chance to get some supplies but right now I need to get some rest. I crawled up next to my sister in my sleeping bag then whispered in her ear\" I'll try my best to keep us alive, I promise.\" I then closed my eyes and slept like there was nothing wrong.<br>\r\n              <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
