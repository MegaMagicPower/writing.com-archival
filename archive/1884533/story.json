It was calm and peaceful in till an unusual sound broke the morning chorus. A Spacecraft shot out from the clouds toward the surface. The plane-like Spacecraft circled the jungle a couple of times looking for a spot to set down. It located a clearing surrounded by a few trees. It landed down, its engines wining as it descended toward the ground. Landing gear popped out of the bottom of the craft setting itself gently down of the surface of the planet. After a long pause a ramp lowered from the bottom of the craft. Group of soldiers dressed in armored space-suits exited the ship. They carried an assortment of weapons and explosives. They walked onto the wet ground stomping through puddles. They all looked around studying the environment. Kenny Dale let out a deep breath.  \u201cWhelp, this already sucks. Why are we here again?\u201d<br>\r\nTommy Landis turned to Kenny. \u201cSearch and rescue remember.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cRight Search and rescue in what General Lutz calls the space Bermuda triangle, yeah we\u2019re going to find something here.\u201d   <br>\r\n\u201cHey we just might.\u201d Lonnie Williams said. \u201cRemember Carlos, He was lost on Mars for weeks. We found him.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cMars is like our freakin backyard; this is an uncharted area of space. From what Lutz explained ships have been disappearing in this sector for years, and now were here on death planet woohoo for us.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cDammit Dale, can you stop complaining for five minutes!\u201d  Jack Foley, a young black haired man, yelled across the clearing at Dale. \u201cWe\u2019re here to find a friend. A close friend, a friend that has been missing for a year away from his family and his home, and the more you complain the less chance any of us have of going back.\u201d He was in front of Kenny now. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t mind could you shut the hell up and get moving?\u201d <br>\r\nThey\u2019re eyes locked on each other for a while when finally Kenny let out a deep breath and nodded. \u201cWhatever you say chief.\u201d  Kenny Spurted.<br>\r\nHe walked off. Jack had known Steven almost all his life. After word got out that he was missing Jack was the first to volunteer for a rescue mission. He was very brave and loyal to his friends. He turned to the rest of the group. <br>\r\n\u201cListen up! We have our orders from Sargent Leo to search the perimeter while the rest of the men on the ship set up camp. From then on it\u2019s a full search and rescue for Cole. So let\u2019s gear up and get moving people.\u201d <br>\r\nThe rest of the group nodded their heads in agreement, grabbed their equipment and started walking into the thick brush of the forest. Larry rou\u00e9s ran up to Jack. \u201cFunny, you were always the quiet type.\u201d <br>\r\nJack nodded. \u201cThis is a friend we\u2019re looking for and I have no time guy\u2019s screwing around.\u201d <br>\r\nLarry smiled. \u201cYes sir.\u201d <br>\r\nThey began their trek. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>he group had been walking for at least two hours. They had gotten out of the denser parts of the forest. The group was now in a swamp like part of the jungle. The dirty water was up to their knees while different kinds of marshes and plants peeked out of the water. Kenny took a seat on a downed tree. He let out a sigh. \u201cOh man,\u201d He looked over to Larry who was doing some calculations on his wrist computer. \u201cHey Larry would you advise taking off your helmet?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNo, most of the air seems breathable but there\u2019s a certain particle in the air that I\u2019ve never seen before, could be dangerous.\u201d  He responded.<br>\r\n\u201cSo then that\u2019s a no?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes that\u2019s a no.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Kenny said rolling his eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cKenny, Larry let\u2019s get a move on.\u201d Jack yelled back. <br>\r\n\u201cJack! Jack!\u201d Lonnie screamed. He was running through the swamp creating waves. <br>\r\n\u201cJack, you need see this.\u201d Lonnie said out of breath. <br>\r\nLonnie led the group as they ran across the swamp. Tommy was standing next to a metallic object pointing out of the waters. It was a wing, a spaceship wing. <br>\r\n\u201cThat that must be a part of Cole\u2019s wreckage.\u201d Kenny said. <br>\r\n \u201cYeah must be. He must have flown over head of hear before crashing. We can\u2019t be far from the crash site.\u201d Tommy said. <br>\r\n\u201cNope, Not at all.\u201d Larry said staring across the swamp. There was a large pit surrounded by downed trees across the swamp. Little pieces of debris were scattered across the pit. <br>\r\nThe group walked over to it. <br>\r\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s the crash site?\u201d Kenny said to Jack. <br>\r\n\u201cMight be, Looks the part.\u201d Jack replied. <br>\r\n\u201cWell then where the hell is ship.\u201d <br>\r\nKenny was right. \u201cLarry scan the area.\u201d <br>\r\nLarry raised his right arm. A chorus of red beams shot out of his wrist scanning every part of the area. He looked down at his wrist computer. <br>\r\n\u201cAll scans seem correct. There was a ship here once.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Steve?\u201d Jack asked. <br>\r\n\u201cThere to have been some type of activity here. The scan is showing bare foot prints on the marsh. Feminine, Bi-pedal, more than one. Something someone was here and a lot of them.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying something moved this ship?\u201d Kenny asked. <br>\r\n\u201cPossibly.\u201d Larry replied. <br>\r\nThere was movement in the trees. All the men went for their weapons. Something was watching them. <br>\r\n\u201cAlright we\u2019re heading back.\u201d Jack radioed the ship. \u201cSargent Leo this Foley, My men and I have found Steven Cole\u2019s wreckage. No he\u2019s not here but we are not alone on this rock. Yes. Yes we\u2019re heading back now Foley out.\u201d <br>\r\nJack turned to the rest of the men. \u201cWe\u2019re heading out now!\u201d <br>\r\nThey started running out of the swamp. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group sprinted toward base. The ship was now surrounded by other soldiers, weapons carts, and turrets. As the group entered the camp Sargent Leo walked up to them. <br>\r\n\u201cFoley.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSargent.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else out there Sargent.\u201d Kenny said. <br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? Your report has everyone going crazy around here.\u201d The Sargent asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Larry tell him.\u201d Kenny said.  <br>\r\n\u201cI picked up some readings on my scanner. There was other being by the wreckage it had to be.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGood job boys. Get back in the ship and wash-.\u201d The Sargent paused. Lonnie was standing completely still with a blank look on his face, almost a dead confusing look. <br>\r\n\u201cWilliams, you okay?\u201d  The Sargent asked. <br>\r\nLonnie\u2019s body jolted as he spat up blood. He fell to the ground face first. The entire unit held their breath. Lonnie had two long wooden arrows in his back. <br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE FU-\u201cKenny shouted. <br>\r\n There was an explosion; towering beings began jumping out of the jungles. The turrets began to spin firing.  The explosion caused smoke to shower the area around the ship. Sounds of gunfire, arrows, and odd shouts of gibberish filled the air. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat hells going on?!\u201d Kenny shouted. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know I- what the?!\u201d <br>\r\nThe smoke began to clear and the identities off their attackers became clearer. 7 ft. women in loin cloths were attacking the men. They were armed with an assortment of different weapons including spears and swords. The women were beautiful, sexy vixens golden skin complexions. They were killing the men in droves with no remorse. Jack grabbed his gun and began to fire at the assailant\u2019s so did the rest of the men. <br>\r\n\u201cWho they hell are they?!\u201d Tommy yelled. <br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know?\u201d Larry yelled back firing his machine-gun. <br>\r\n\u201cThese guys- I mean girls are fast!\u201d Kenny yelled. <br>\r\n\u201cJust keep shooting dammit!\u201d Jack commanded. <br>\r\nThe women were destroying the turrets and weapon depots. The men didn\u2019t stand much of a chance. The women were formable and organized. They had troops up in the trees firing arrows while ground forces fought the men off. One off the women grabbed Jack and threw him far across the base perimeter.  They knocked out the Sargent and Larry. Kenny dropped his gun surrendering.  Tommy killed off a few more of them before being picked up and violently thrown into the ground. Jack got up firing a few more rounds when suddenly there was an immense explosion in front of him. He was blown into the thick brush. He tumbled down a hill coming to a violent stop in a wet marsh.  He got up groaning and grabbed his gun. He heard a large splash. He quickly turned around arming his gun and opened fire. One of the women had followed him down the hill. She had long black hair and cute but menacing face. She was covered in blue tattooed symbols and wore a toothed necklace around her neck probably from an animal she had killed. She was holding two wicked looking broad swords. She started at Jack. Jack held his weapon up and unleashed an array of bullets. She used to her bullets to block most of the fire. She lunged one of her swords at him. He barrel rolled out of the way taking out his side arm. He continued to evade her. She shouted out more gibberish probably their native language. He took an impulse grenade from his belt and threw it at her without pulling the pin. He turned in a spilt second and fired a bullet at the grenade. It blew right in front of her blowing her back into a tree hard.  She slumped to the ground knocked out and defeated. Jack got up and walked toward her reloading his weapon. He studied her, his weapon trained on her. She looked peaceful. <br>\r\n\u201cMan,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAren\u2019t you a sight for sore eyes?\u201d   <br>\r\nJack then saw something that made his eyes widen like a deer in head lights. On her neck was a tattoo of Dog tag numbers 577-085. Jack couldn\u2019t believe it. <br>\r\n\u201cSteve?\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Sargent Leo awoke dazed. He was in excruciating pain. He looked around his surroundings, he was in some kind of wooden house house. He looked to his left. His men were tied up against the wall in some kind purple rope. He looked down at his chest discovering he was to. <br>\r\n\"Sir, Sir are you alright?\" someone asked. <br>\r\nThe Sargent looked over, it was Tommy, he was in the middle of the row.  <br>\r\n\"Landis that you?\" The Sargent asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes sir. You alright?\" He asked. <br>\r\n\"Is alright none of us are alright! We're all dead!\" Kenny let out. <br>\r\n\"Dale? What the hell happened Landis, where are we?\" The Sargent asked. <br>\r\n\"They ambushed us sir, fast and hard. They took what was left of us here.\" Tommy explained. <br>\r\n\"Where is here?\" The Sargent asked. <br>\r\n\"Some kind of small village. Must be there base, There are a lot of hostels sir.\" <br>\r\nThe Sargent looked over again, he only counted twelve soldiers. \"This can't be all of us.\" He said. <br>\r\n\"It's not,\" Tommy said. \"They took the other half of survivors to a different side of the camp.\" <br>\r\n The was a creak at the entrance to the house. The door slowly opened as two armored women holding spears entered the room and stood at attention. A third women entered the room. She was a tall beautiful red head, Bella. She studied the men with a smile. Her eyes scanned each one of their faces looking for weakness and fear. She was stumped when her eyes came to Sargent Leo's face, his expression mean and twisted, his eyes frozen over with rage. He showed her no fear. Bella gave a wave of her hand at the other two women. They nodded and quickly left the hut closing the door shut. Bella waited a while making sure no one else came. She looked back down at the Sargent. <br>\r\n\"So, your the leader yes?\" She said. <br>\r\nSargent Leo's angry expression changed to that of amazement. \"You speak English?\" He asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes, I actually speak many earthly languages, but that's not the point.\" She said. <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Tommy commanded. \"Why are you keeping us here?!\" <br>\r\n\"Silence your tongue! You were not permitted to speak!!\" Bella yelled. <br>\r\n\"Yeah he is you crazy bitch now answer his question!\" Sargent Leo said backing Tommy up. <br>\r\nBella smiled. \"No need for name calling Leo.\" <br>\r\nBella paced around the room slowly swaying her hips. \"As much as I would want to answer your question I have a more pressing concern.\"  <br>\r\nBella took a black disc out of her loin cloth. She held it in her palm as a hologram appeared from the surface. The hologram was of the woman who attacked Jack during the ambush. She held it up to The Sargent's face, the blue light reflected off his helmet. <br>\r\n\"Have you seen this woman?\" Bella asked. <br>\r\n\"Lost one of your stray dogs?\" The Sargent replied.<br>\r\nBella ignored him and passed the hologram down in front of all of the men's faces. \"Have any of you seen this woman?\" She said going down the row. \"It would be to your benefit to answer.\" She was now in front of Kenny. She held the Hologram in front of his helmet. \"Seen her?\" Bella asked. <br>\r\nKenny looked through the hologram at Bella's nearly exposed breast's. <br>\r\n\"No but baby I wanna be seeing more of you!\" He yelped. <br>\r\nBella rolled her eyes and started walking away. \"Nice ass!\" Kenny whispered. <br>\r\nBella hearing the comment started back toward Kenny she keeled down in front of him, she grabbed one of her breast. <br>\r\n\"You like that don't you,\" She said sweetly. \"You like em big don't you.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah baby I like em big!\" Kenny said mesmerized by Bella's Breast when suddenly Bella reached over and tore off Kenny's helmet. He choked on the gas like air as Bella ripping his suit apart revealing his bare chest. <br>\r\n\"Well hopefully you get a pair of em.\" She walked off as Kenny continued to cough. Bella turned to the rest of the solders. \"If you want to stay alive, if you want to leave this planet alive you will stay here and remain quiet! Any attempt's at escape or struggle will result in death. Or you'll end up like Kenny over there.\" <br>\r\nBella started for the door. \"You never answered my question.\" Sargent Leo said. <br>\r\nBella turned toward him. \"Bait.\" <br>\r\nBella exited the hut slamming the door shut.               <br>\r\n                 <br>\r\n                       </span></div></div>",

He had set a small fire which separated him and the female warrior that attacked him earlier. Jack had tied her up against a tree. Jack studied her features pondering. She looked so peaceful while she slept. Her face calm and warm, her lips almost formed something of a smile. Her body was lean and outlined with sexy curves. She was beautiful, perfect almost but who she is was a problem.  Jack sighed in disbelief. \u201cIs that really you Steve?\u201d He whispered to himself.   \u201cWhat the hell did they do to you buddy?\u201d  <br>\r\nJust as Jack finished those words the warrior jolted awake. She looked about slowly confused and disoriented. She caught sight of Jack and let out a howl of anger. Jack gripped his side arm. The warrior struggled to get free of her bonds but could not, she spat out gibberish as she squirmed to be free. <br>\r\n\u201cThose vines are really something aren\u2019t they?\u201d Jack said to the warrior. \u201cKnew they\u2019d hold ya, well I prayed they\u2019d hold ya.\u201d <br>\r\nThe warrior faced Jack with an expression of disgust. \u201cFig umnny Ai Ly kay.\u201d she said before she raised her head to the sky and howled. <br>\r\nJack snickered within his helmet at the oddness of the warrior. \u201cUh if you\u2019re calling for help you\u2019re not going to get it. I we\u2019re a long ways from my base camp and I\u2019m guessing yours.\u201d <br>\r\nThe warrior kept on howling not understanding a word Jack was saying. Jack his helmet and paced around a bit. He looked back at the warrior. \u201cSteve?\u201d He said blankly. <br>\r\n\u201cSteven Cole, ring any bells?\u201d  The warrior kept howling. It was almost as if she wasn\u2019t running out of air. \u201cHEY!!\u201d Jack took out his side arm and trained it on the warrior. Her howling stopped abruptly as she lowered her head. Her eyes met the barrel of the pistol then drifted up toward Jack\u2019s. <br>\r\n\u201cFig jah loc num-\u201c <br>\r\n\u201cStop with the fucking gibberish, please!\u201d  Jack yelled cutting her off. The warrior fell silent her attention devoted to Jack. <br>\r\n\u201cSteve, Steve Cole. Do, do you know what that is?\u201d Jack said. <br>\r\nThe warrior stared at him blank faced. Jack gestured toward himself. \u201cJack, Jack Foley? Best friends sense high school introduced you to Mary\u2026MARY!\u201d Jack unzipped a pocket on his suit. He pulled out a small silver square plate. He tapped it and a holographic image appeared. Two men, a woman, and a child (probably around 5) sat at a kitchen table.  They were young and happy. Jack showed the warrior the picture. <br>\r\n\u201cSteve, hey Look remember this? It\u2019s me, you, Mary, Timmy. Your wife your son?\u201d <br>\r\nThe warrior looked at the picture in horror. She turned her head away closing her eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cNIO, NIO!!\u201d She repeated shaking her head. <br>\r\n\u201cYou remember don\u2019t you? But something\u2019s telling you not to. Steve remember, remember your family, your friends. Remember.\u201d <br>\r\nThe warrior raised her head and shouted. \u201cNIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\u201d <br>\r\nThe warrior passed out. Jack dropped the gun and fell to the warrior\u2019s side. \u201cSteve, Steve buddy are you alright? STEVE!\u201d <br>\r\nThe warrior raised her head. \u201cWhat\u2026..what\u2019s going\u2026.\u201d She turned her head to face Jack. \u201cJack? Jack Foley is that\u2026..is that you.\u201d <br>\r\nJack smiled speechless. STEVE looked around confused. \u201cWhy am I tied to a tree?\u201d <br>\r\nJack laughed. \u201cI think the real question is why you are seven feet tall with boobs.\u201d <br>\r\nSteve looked down at his chest. \u201cThat is a good question.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
