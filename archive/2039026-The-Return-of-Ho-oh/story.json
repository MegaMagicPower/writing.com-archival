            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another day of training with your Pokemon has come to an end. You wiped the moist sweat off your face and called your Vaporeon back to your side and patted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, Vaporeon! You sure did a great job today. Hope you keep up the good work. At the rate you're improving, I probably have to buy you some Pokeblocks soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon gave you a satisfied cry and nuzzled you hand affectionately. You brought out her Pokeball and returned her before clipping it back onto your belt. The past few months had been relatively quiet, no disasters or any crazy organizations causing havoc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a refreshing change for once! you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the fine weather, you decided to take a walk in the forest before returning. The sun is nearing the horizon, casting the trees in a brilliant orange and pink. As you walked among the trees and bushes, you reminisced about the past. This was the same forest where you were shrunken by accident. Has it really been a year since I first met Lugia among these tall canopies? Time sure flies when you're happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia and Floatzel are still in regular contact with you. Sometimes, you met in person for a little reliving of your shrunken state. Every time, both Pokemons fight over who should let the human explore their body first. But most of the time, you chose to stick with Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt other times, you spent hours talking with Lugia telepathically about your life and activities. From what you learned, both of Lugia and Floatzel returned to being teacher and protege, training and strengthening each other. Floatzel is progressing tremendously with his psychic power and from what Lugia said, he could soon become a mentor in his own right. The Sea Weasel Pokemon constantly boasted that he will soon be a Legendary that will unseat Lugia to rule the sea, much to the amusement of his teacher. You had many good laughs with the two Pokemons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to your recent schedule, you and Lugia haven't been able to see each other more frequently. But your affection for her has not diminish. In fact, you felt ever more attached to Lugia. You took note that you probably should arrange another meeting with her once you have time. You can't wait to meet the beautiful Pokemon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts led you to think of another Pokemon, one that is far less welcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh on the other hand, is something you want to relegate to the deepest, repressed and unreachable part of your brain. That so-called Legendary bird is a real piece of work. And you are glad that you haven't heard of him for an entire year since you rammed him into a cave wall. His disappearance hasn't gone by unnoticed. Trainers are abuzz with theories of what led to Ho-oh's sudden departure, with many lamenting that they won't have the chance of capturing the Pokemon. The priestess of the Burned Tower said that this is a bad omen of gargantuan proportion. Ho-oh's disappearance also surprised even the most seasoned Pokemon scientists into declaring it an unprecedented abnormality. The news are drumming up stories that this somehow means that the end is near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your opinion, it's all just nonsense and outright silliness. Those are just crazed theories cooked up by someone looking to scare others. Besides, those people haven't heard about the low regard that Pokemon has for humans. If they did, they'll be singing a different tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you like to think that Ho-oh is probably somewhere wallowing in his own sadness after being owned and defeated by a human and Lugia. You especially took pleasure to imagine how pathetic he must felt right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chortled at the mental image as you strolled to a particularly large tree in the deeper part of the forest. It's the tree you always went to when you wanted to clear your mind of life problems or battle losses. The wide branches and leaves provide the perfect shade while the roots act as your seat. You sat at the usual spot and looked at the orange twilight while wondering what you will do tomorrow. You noticed a shape in the distant sky flying toward you. The object is massive and glowing with power. You immediately thought that it might be Lugia but quickly reminded yourself that she is currently at Whirlpool Islands and didn't plan on visiting you until two weeks later. <i>So who's that then?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark form of the creature got closer to you. You could make out the feathered tail and wings the glows bright orange in the subset. The leaves rustled around you as the gales grew intense from the fluttering wings of the Pokemon. You closed your eyes and covered your face with your clothes to shield yourself from the pebbles being kicked up. When the dusts settled a few seconds later, you slowly uncovered your face and opening your eyes. Your vision is still blurry from tears but you can make out a massive form in front of you. Orange feathers, talons, green crown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again, human,\" a very familiar voice chimed.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are blinked your eyes as the being came into sharp focus. It took your mind less than a second to register the identity of the voice. It belongs to none other than Ho-oh, the so-called Legendary Pokemon. The giant bird perched himself on a large log several yards away from you. There was the initial feeling of surprise upon seeing his immense form. But disgust quickly took over as memories of your detention came back to you. He was the last thing you ever wanted to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?!\" You growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meeting up with an old friend,\" Ho-oh said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?! Quite the nerves you have to show up again,\" you glared at the Pokemon, \"Just scram, I don't want to see you again. Get out of my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, is that the way you're supposed to talk to me? Such awful lack of manners, human. I hope you wouldn't hate the consequences. But you know perfectly well what I'm capable of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always have to start things off with a threat, don't you Ho-oh? But, I'm no longer under your control and I don't care whatever you want to do to me. I was wishing that you've somehow banished yourself from existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never missed me over my one-year absence?\" Ho-oh said with fake sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never. I was hoping that you've been miserable for the last twelve months,\" you jabbed back in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's exactly what happened,\" Ho-oh said, \"You see, the mess you and Lugia caused while controlling me took me months to fix. When news about my humiliation at your hand became public, thanks to Lugia, I was forced to go into hiding from all the prying and critical eyes I get everywhere I go. I was accused by many of setting back Pokemon-human relations by hundreds of years. I told them that humans are nothing but a pain and oppressor of Legendaries. None would hear out my story of my miserable encounter with you. They said I 'lost it' after my first capture and abandonment by a trainer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They weren't that far off about that,\" you said, enjoying every moment of Ho-oh misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, human!!!\" Ho-oh screeched, \"Worst of all, news of this mess somehow traveled all the way up to Lord Arceus and he is NOT happy about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you meant not happy about your actions. I won't be surprised if He decided to erase you from existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! He paid me a visit and lectured me for days. That nincompoop told me that he has suspended my legendary status indefinitely and strongly curtailed my powers. How can I show my face if I'm no longer considered a Legendary Pokemon? They'll laugh me out of Council. I've lost all credibility because of Lugia, and particularly, because of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Ho-oh became visibly upset and glared at you menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly, you deserved it,\" you replied unfazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what they all say!\" the Pokemon fired back, \"Arceus told me to make up for my mistakes, you know those typical requirement where I 'learn to be friends with the human' and 'friendship blah blah blah' before giving my powers back to me. Not believing any of that. Not one bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it looks like you are never getting your power and prestige back, Ho-oh,\" you said gleefully, \"I hope you enjoy being an ordinary Pokemon for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a smartass, human! I have dealt with your kind for far more than you'll ever live. I came to you specifically to fix that. I've figured a workaround to my problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your problem? That's got nothing to do with me and I definitely do not want to be a part of your sorry drama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Ho-oh craned his head downward and reach eye level with you. The look he gave you could probably set you on fire if he wills it strongly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in no mood at being insulted, human. So you could do well and listen to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon used his beak to push you back into the tree trunk. Ho-oh lowered his head until he rests his head directly in front of you toward you and positioned his large eyes on you. Those brilliant vermillion irises reflected your frightened face as Ho-oh's beak curled into a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now see for yourself the damage you've wrecked upon me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon's pupils dilated to unnaturally large size until the irises are thin rings. The dark, featureless pools flashed and began to beam images like a display. The first thing you see is a forum that was used by Ho-oh. The thread pasted by an anonymous Pokemon begins with the headline \"Ho-oh Lost It!!! Human-hating Phoenix is Legendary No More!\" Save for a few posts of sympathy, the responses were mostly nasty and sarcastic. Many \"congratulated\" the Pokemon for his demotion. Others recommend that he should get used to being treated like a common Pidgey. From the look of it, he isn't exactly popular right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it gets \"better\" ,\" Ho-oh seethed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh blinked his eyes to change the content. This time his pupils showed a network called \"Psyfriends\". You remembered that Lugia told you about this Pokenet site for psychic Pokemons to meet up. Ho-oh's profile page is defaced with crude pictures and messages written in all caps calling the Pokemon a human-hater. Some of the posts contained explicits pictures, the same ones you've encountered when you visited Ho-oh's brain. They were somehow leaked. To makes matter worst, he responded angrily and denied those belonged to him. The replies from his friends were caught between shock and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh Exposed! Legendary revealed to be a Pervert,\" someone said gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><i>I can't believe you WERE a sicko. Goodbye Ho-oh! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't believe that you would do that. And what, we're friends for centuries? That's just low, buddy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you?! You never told me that you were going to use me in your weird fantasies. That's it, perv. Don't you ever talk to me again.\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everybody! Let's all unfriend this bastard to oblivion!\" one suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Ho-oh's friend list at the side of the page. Sure enough his list of friends has gone from 130 down to just 1 in three hours. Only Lugia's name remained on the list and she was blocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh blinked his eyes again and they now depict an art blog dedicated to Ho-oh in the worst imaginable way. The whole forum is filled with demeaning drawings depicting the Legendary Pokemon as a dark menacing being or as a klutzy-headed buffoon. Some of tge drawing are little more that poorly drawn stick figures. One that really takes the cake has Ho-oh as a crying chick in a playpen whining about how everyone hates him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh blinked his eyes again and brought them back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing these just makes my blood boil! I've become the laughingstock of the Pokenet and all my usual friends are avoiding me,\" Ho-oh stomped his talon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it sucks to be you,\" you said with an eyeroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to feel sorry for me, you human!\" Ho-oh said as his voice hardened again, \"You're coming with me to fix things up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes! I was planning on making my body a little friendlier for you. No more slop for food or slimy rooms. For all of that, I just want you to get everything back in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Live in that hellhole you call your body, forget it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad! You have no choices,\" Ho-oh said as he lunged at you and grabbed you with his beak, \"I hope I'll be the better host this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh threw you up in to the air and watched you plunged into his mouth, savoring your taste for a brief moment before swallowing.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn't believe what was happening. How in the world had everything gone from 'life is good' to 'once again being trapped by Ho-oh?' And how had he found you? Well it's possible he had heard that it had been in that forest where you and Lugia had met, where you had been shrunk a year ago. But of all days he had to go to that forest just when you were feeling nostalgic and wanted to walk around there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were the odds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more likely that Ho-oh had kept watching over the forest somehow, waiting for you. That wasn't more comforting at all, in fact it was more unnerving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you hit Ho-oh's tongue you almost faint. Usually when you reentered Lugia or Floatzel's body through the mouth your contact with saliva was minimal, but this time you had fell face-first onto the tongue, practically getting soaked. The tongue moved backwards, bringing you towards the throat. You barely had time to react before you were unceremoniously thrown back into a place you were sure you would never visit again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey down Ho-oh's long neck was quick, depositing you in an organ that wasn't familiar to you, filled with rocks and other similar indigestible material. However before you had any time to even stand up you were pushed down another path, which led to one place that you did remember, and not because you had loved it, the gizzard. The avian stomach was just like you remembered, spacious and definitely not very welcoming. To make everything even worse, unlike the last time you were there, where the content of the gizzard was limited to puddles of acids and nothing else, it now was half-full of soggy herbs and plants. \"Oh great, just great. Did you do this on purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?\" Ho-oh replied curtly. You could notice the annoyance in his voice and you were not surprised to notice you didn't care the least about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you have to trap me shortly after you had lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were the one who went to the forest at this time. It's not my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had said you would be a better host!\" <i>Not that he could be worse...or that I plan to stay for long.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident, okay? I do intend to be a better host in some ways, but I also haven't forgotten all the suffering you and Lugia made me go through. I have the right to be petty at times\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalmed, groaning, and stood up. You climbed the plants around you, being careful to not to fall in any liquids that were gathering on the floor of the gizzard. It was just as disgusting as you expected, and in that moment you felt very grateful to Lugia and Floatzel for keeping their stomachs empty when you were inside them. \"I haven't agreed I'll help you. You weren't exactly a gracious host and I haven't forgotten that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a moment while you finally got to the highest point. Finally Ho-oh talked, apparently having calmed down a bit. It seemed he was doing an huge effort trying to be civil. \"We're not going to get anywhere if we keep focusing on what we did to each other. You did wrong to me and I suppose it could be possible I may have given you just a little bit of bad treatment before. But I'm desperate. Do you think if I weren't desperate you'd be alive in this moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a point there. You imagined that if you ever met again he'd incinerate you at the first chance, not lock you again in his body...with supposedly better conditions. Ho-oh continued speaking. \"I really need my Legendary status back. I have lived with it too long to simply go back to being a common Pok\u00e9mon. You caused this and so you're the only one who can solve this. Lugia won't even talk to me for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm actually ordering...begging you here: help me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth. While you were kind of grateful he had some mercy on letting you live...your actual situation definitely wasn't going to be what you would have chosen if he had asked, although you doubted you'd ever have listened what he had to say. Besides you were once again locked inside him. Escaping? He surely learned from last time. No more trips to his brain. That was very likely to not to be an option anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several entrances and exits to the body, but surely Ho-oh already took measures to block them, although knowing him there was a chance the only one he left was the most humiliating and least desirable one, which would be his cloaca, just to see you escape and trap you instantly. You weren't going to give him the satisfaction of such a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, accepting your situation seemed...the only thing to do. You hated yourself a little for what you were going to say. \"Okay, I'll stay here, but there are some conditions I need to lay. Without them I won't do anything to help you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh grumbled under his breath before replying. \"Okay, okay. What conditions are those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First: no pressuring me. I have no idea yet how to do such thing, so I need time to think. I don't know how long it'll take, either, so just leave this to me\" <i>That should give me some time to think of a way to stop all this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also want to be treated with dignity. No pushing me to places I don't want to go. No impromptu journeys to your bowels, no going around cleaning, no giving you forced pleasure, nothing like that. If I ever go to any place it'll be on my own will\" <i>Not that I plan to go hang around his intestines or his privates again.</i> I already had enough of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was obvious, human. I said I'd be a better host\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third. Uh...\" you couldn't really think of a third. You considered making him give you a way to keep in contact with Lugia or Floatzel, but he wasn't an idiot. There was no way he was going to accept that. Besides, he didn't know you were supposed to meet Lugia in two weeks. If you resisted two weeks inside him then maybe things would get solved by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't think of a third, ah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third, I want to be free to walk around your body\" you decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't allow you to access my brain if that's what you're insinuating\" Ho-oh's tone had gotten harsher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't what I meant. Keep that out of limits, I suppose, but I want to be able to go anywhere else\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. You can go anywhere in my body except my brain. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's all for now. Where will I sleep?\" you looked around the gizzard. That better not be your new bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a sign of good will I'll allow you to choose the location if your bedroom anywhere in my body. You should remember a few places in it, but in case you don't know here are some indications from my gizzard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll find four openings. One goes into my intestines, one goes into my back and towards my back and tail feathers and all organs through that path, one goes towards my chest and all organs in that location and the last one goes towards my foundry. This last one is not a good option, you wouldn't be able to endure the heat for hours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but which one leads where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for you to find out\" Ho-oh cawed and refused to say anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you looked around the gizzard, locating the four options. You pinpointed where the sphincter you had come through was and deduced the opening directly opposite to that one led to the bowels, so that option was crossed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way towards the chest was high in the walls, you'd need to go and climb more of Ho-oh's lunch to reach it. The one that went to his back and to the end of his tail was the one closest to you. The one for the foundry must have been the last one, so you ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of trying to remember the location of the organs you had seen last time (you noticed that you couldn't even guess where in Ho-oh's body most of them were located), you made your decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You chose the passage that you assumed will take you to Ho-oh's chest. It is near the top of the gizzard and is almost vertical in position. For this simple reason, it's impossible for you to reach that opening without first climbing through the green mush that is Ho-oh's lunch and dirtying yourself in the process. You believed that Ho-oh made the better choices hard to reach as his method of screwing with you. It's his way of telling you to 'give up and just live in the tail end where I can toy with you all I want'. You aren't gonna let that happen and allow Ho-oh to have his merry way. If he intends to test you, then you're gonna returning the favor by besting all the challenges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, to establish a goal is one thing but to actually put your plan into action, it requires far more effort. Especially true when you are nauseous at the sight of half-digested plants and herbs piled several stories high around you. The movements within the gizzard made the whole mountain look alive, even menacing. It brought back awful memories of the unmentionable food you were force fed last time and you intend to avoid anything that's remotely related to mush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, made up your mind yet, human? Your friendly host Ho-oh is getting a little impatient here,\" the Pokemon chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm trying to figure out how to navigate past all this pile of junk,\" you replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better make it quick then. You don't want me to change my mind and let you sleep in my gizzard,\" Ho-oh laughed smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter to me anyways. It seems to me that your body was designed to make my life as miserable as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make it better!\" Ho-oh replied impatiently, \"Just give me time, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very doubtful about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is there to doubt about, human?\" Ho-oh asked inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see. First, you did yourself a very bad first impression by snatching me from Lugia and rambled about your hatred for humankind nonstop. Then you decide to use me as your personal servant to clean your bowels and gizzard as a way to validate those twisted beliefs, punishing me with electrical shocks should I disobey. And let's not forget the pleasure game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Look human, I went a bit overboard with your treatment, alright?\" the Pokemon relented, \"My past experience with humans got the best of me. I promise you, there will be no more force-feeding or unreasonable questionnaires. I believe this is a perfect chance for us to start a new page. Wouldn't you agree, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overboard? I think the better term would be nefarious. I find it rather difficult to believe that you're being honest here. And you've made no guarantee that you won't return to your arrogant and snarky ways once I helped get your Legendary status reinstated. What exactly do I have to gain from helping you if you're essentially unchanged?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh remained silent for a while to let your words sink in. It's a surprise that he hasn't figured out a smartass reply like he usually do. You heard him giving a frustrated sigh before speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, human,\" Ho-oh said through clenched teeth, \"You seriously need to stop being so distrustful. I'm trying my best to be nice here and that's some awfully hard work for someone who hated your guts not so long ago. Now, I believe that you and I can agree to one thing: we're in a situation we don't like. So let's face the matter we have at hand, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you made it worth my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember this, I can be nice but if you step out of line, don't blame me when you find yourself under my old wrathful side. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the time being, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'll talk with you later when you reached your destination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Ho-oh snorted and went on about his business, leaving you to make your next move. The Pokemon spread his multicolored wings and took off toward the sky at breakneck speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped internally as you felt a slight lurch and the familiar feeling of lightness. There's no going back on this one. Ho-oh talking with some semblance of rationality isn't something you're used to yet. You could tell that he is holding back his tongue and hastily attempt to show that he's friendly. You'll give the Pokemon credit for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo use sitting here. Better get moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing Ho-oh's meal wasn't bad if you are able to disregard crawling on all four up a mushy heap of leaves and flowers that's starting to ferment in the heat. You are less than a third way up and your shirt and pants are already covered in green juice and smelled of rotting hay. Your favorite shoes are in no better state. It took several falls and yelps before you reached the sphincter you want to use. You could hear Ho-oh snickering about you're predicament as he glided idly through the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally reminded yourself that you're asking Ho-oh to pay you for ruining your clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter forcing it open, a rush of cool air blew past you, sending a shiver down your moist back. The tunnel above is little more than a shaft with rungs embedded in its fleshy walls. Climbing the steps is an arduous task and the churning and the groaning flesh all added a disconcerting feeling to this already narrow passage to a supposedly better location in the chest. Ho-oh's heartbeat is strong enough is send a powerful vibration through the entire shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne exhausting and uncertain ascent later, you reached another sphincter which promptly opened and invited you in. You entered a small cavity about the size of a living room that is supported by several ivory-colored ribs. The entire floor is covered with soft translucent bumps that made it look like bubble wrappers. The see-through nature of the floor allows you to view Ho-oh's giant heart and his equally impressive pair of lungs doing their work to support this impressive Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the all-new chest chamber,\" Ho-oh said, \"I hope you'll find it more welcoming than my stomach, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enjoying the view of the vital organs, you turned your attention to the chamber's other features. On one side is a raised rectangular mound covered with green and orange feathers. Upon closer look, there is a pouch-like depression large enough to fit you snugly. You sat on it and felt the softness and warmth. It's a big upgrade from the damp stomach you were accommodated at last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple desk and chair set made of iron sit right next to the bed. On the desk was a familiar and unsettling piece of equipment: the locator watch. That strap was used by Ho-oh to deliver electric shocks and to track your location in his body. The mere sight of the device upsets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I thought you promised that there's no coercing,\" you said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who told you I'm giving you the same thing?\" Ho-oh asked amusedly, \"I removed the shocker and added more helpful functions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The locator can still allow me to see your location. But you now have a 'privacy switch' that allows you to turn it off at anytime you want. Be aware that visits to unauthorized places can still be detected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that addresses one concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In return for staying with me, you'll receive an allowance of 50 tokens each week that can be spent on all sorts of amenities I can provide. Additional tokens can be earned by helping out around my body or improving my reputation. When you save enough, you have the opportunity to upgrade your room more to your liking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds acceptable at least. And what does this yellow button on the side do? I don't remember seeing that before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a new feature of the locator that you'll love. Remember the shocker function I removed from your locator? It is now installed in various parts in my body. That button activates those shockers. You can now use it to discipline me should I start being rude to you or other Pokemons. It'll remind me when I'm misbehaving. Heck, you can even shock me for little trivial things like I do. What I did to you was unjustified and it's only fair that I endure the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one feature I'll definitely use!\" You grinned as you strapped the locator to your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any places you would like to go to, human?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Idly touching the yellow button that would let him shock Ho-oh and barely restraining yourself you thought about your options. It was starting to be late, you may as well try to get comfortable. You had a bedroom, that was good, although the heartbeat could potentially be a bother during nighttime. Now what other necessity did you have and you wanted to see solved now...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to be sure you weren't going to be fed sludge like last time. It was a tad late for lunch and a bit early for dinner but you didn't mind. Peace of mind was good at any point of the day. \"If you don't mind I'd like to eat something\" you stated \"Where do I need to go for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, is there a problem with that? I could try later\" you tried your best to not to sound defiant. The last thing you wanted was to make your host angry just before eating. Who knew what he would do to your food if you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find something. I didn't think you'd want to eat so soon...\" he grumbled but seemed to accept your request \"Follow that path, it isn't too far from your room\" the room seemed to tilt, making you look in the opposite direction from where you had entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I be right if I think you're vegetarian?\" With some luck the answer was yes and he would be bothered by having to find you some meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. I can get you some meat\" On the other hand that was good. If he wasn't picky about that then you could get something good \"I won't give you some right now, if that's what you're implying\" his voice hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was just curiosity\" making sure the locator machine would stay in your wrist you walked towards that direction, arriving to a rather small room in just a couple minutes. It was almost empty, only having a ledge where you supposed you could sit. It was a relief to see it was different to the place where a year ago Ho-oh force-feed you, maybe he was serious about the whole 'being friendlier', even if it wasn't much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all how soon can somebody like Ho-oh change and really be at least kind to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit there\" your host instructed \"It won't take long\" you obeyed, waiting patiently. In a few seconds a heap of strands of herbs fell from the ceiling. You could recognize some of them mainly because you just had seen them in the process of fermenting. That didn't help your appetite at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these even edible for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you expect me to know?\" he groused \"Try them and see, that's all there's for now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that your next meals are better than this one you grabbed a handful and chewed them a bit. Just as you expected it was a strange experience and not exactly pleasant. They tasted bland and were definitely not suitable for you. But the fact you were given that was at least calming. You weren't going to receive any nasty stuff when you asked for food. Trusting Ho-oh just a tiny bit more you continued chewing until you were sure you weren't going to fall down with severe stomach cramps. \"Thank you\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else you want to see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing these herbs remind me way too much of the welcome I had\" you stated, leaving them on the ledge and hoping Ho-oh wouldn't notice you hadn't eaten much \"I want to take a bath. Where can I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think I have lots of water just for you to have baths whenever you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it's urgent\" Your hands and arms were starting to itch. Maybe some of those plants weren't something you should be touching your bare skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine! I'll show you!\" A new path opened to the side of the place you were in right now. It was just a bit bigger than you and you had the hunch Ho-oh had made it that way to bother you, as a petty revenge for making him prepare that. Soon you arrived in a round room with a big pool of water in the center. You're liking the fact that the water was clean but the temperature was a bit on the lukewarm side. But you're going to have to make this work; Ho-oh wouldn't like a chooser. You started undressing, but while you were doing it you found something round you had forgotten you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be...\" You had forgotten about Vaporeon. She had been with you in the forest shortly before Ho-oh found you and she had gone into her Pok\u00e9ball...she was trapped with you. \"Oh, damn\" Telling Ho-oh was something to do now. At least, you had that new function of the locator if Ho-oh got funny ideas or tried to get Vaporeon outside. But first...you had to make sure Vaporeon understood the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she had been inside Lugia, but that was different. Lugia was a friendly host, Ho-oh was not...very much. Even their bodies were different! Vaporeon needed to know what was going on. Then after that you'd tell Ho-oh that a new guest was inadvertently brought inside him all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to order your thoughts you threw the Pok\u00e9ball inside the pool, seeing it release your friend.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your Pokeball landed on the surface of the pool and popped open with a dazzling display of blue light. At first, only faint silhouette emerged from the contraption but it gradually grew in size. Basic features such as the face and tail became apparent as the Pokemon slowly reconstruct herself from the water. No matter how many times you see it, you are still amazed at the process of how Vaporeon can merge with surrounding water without ever giving away her presence. Perfectly invisible. When it comes to surprise, nothing beats hiding in a tub and waiting for the perfect moment to give you a faceful of Water Gun. It happened so many times that you consider her the assertive one whenever you two are around a swimming pool or river. It's no wonder that bath time is her favorite part of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her reformation is completed, Vaporeon shrilled and leapt out out of the pool to give you a playful nuzzle. You patted her head, eliciting a satisfied coo as the Pokemon wrapped her fish-like tail around your leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Vaporeon. How are we doing?\" you said cheerfully, \"Didn't expect me to drop you directly in the pool, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon tilted her head and eyed you inquisitively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I was just trying different ways to keep you entertained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon looked at you with an amused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, I was thinking that we both can really use a bath right now. Wanna join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon removed herself from you and started shrilling happily. The word 'bath' is the trigger word that would make her forget all her worries. With her excitement hardly contained, Vaporeon bounced in circles in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. You go first, as always,\" you said as you removed your underwear and socks threw them aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon curiously examined the water by touching it with one of her paws. Sensing that nothing is unusual, she pounced in without second thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Vaporeon went into the pool without any delays. You settled down near the middle where the water is deep enough to cover your neck. Your favorite companion returned to her water form and playfully swam around your body. The tickling sensation of her paws and tail brushing you made you squirm. And her Water Jet knows where exactly to strike for maximum effect. You swirled your finger in the pool and allowed the half-dissolved Vaporeon to chase and gently nip at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha...you sure are lively today,\" you chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a happy cry in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just perfect,\" you said softly, \" Never thought Ho-oh could provide something resembling hospitality.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon's ears perked up at some gurgling sound and she studied her surroundings carefully. It is the first time she noticed the organic looking walls and ceiling. She realized that this isn't the lodge or swimming pool she's used to. The Pokemon turned her blue eyes on you, longing for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably wondering what the heck is this place. Long story short, I got recaptured by an old acquaintance,\" you said and glare at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon followed your eyes for a few seconds but returned her gaze toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That look can only mean one thing: you want to hear more, right?Are you sure you wanna hear the long version?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're always one for stories,\" you said with a weak smile, \"Curl up and hear me then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told her about your first encounter with the legendary Ho-oh and all the nefarious acts he committed.  You chronicled your escape, subsequent adventures, and eventual return to normal life. A year later, you were taking a stroll and Ho-oh suddenly came to recapture you. You explained that Ho-oh promised that he will try to be a better host and wanted you to help him get his Legendary status restored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Vaporeon merely listened to your one-sided talk with her, she seemed to get the gist and general feeling you're conveying. For you,  it is nice to speak with someone you know is on your side although you never expected a response from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour story continued for another half hour or so, explaining to Vaporeon how you'll likely proceed with Ho-oh and the kinds of plans you have for him in the future.  By the time you finished your story, Vaporeon looked drowsy and gave an audible yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's it for today. Come. let me get you in a bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up from the pool and carried Vaporeon back to the chest chamber and settled her on the top of the desk. You'll have to tell your host about her soon. The feathered bed looks very welcoming as you are feeling sleepy too. But you realized that you are missing your clothes. The old ones are no good to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ho-oh, I'm done with my bath. I'm planning on hitting the hay soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, are you happy now?\" Ho-oh said testily, \"You used up a quarter of my water for that long bath. Those water could have lasted three days. I hope you're thinking about what to do for me in return.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'll have to think about that since you only performed the tasks half-heartedly and begrudgingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be thankful that I even have you in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say. By the way, you got anything I could wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got nothing like that. Do I look like I got stores throughout my body? I'm structured more differently than Lugia,\" Ho-oh said irritatingly, \"Why would you need clothes anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, Pokemons like you either have feathers or fur to keep themselves warm in cold climates and have no exact concept of modesty. But I'm human and it's just unnatural to be clothless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! There's no one in here to see you naked except me,\" Ho-oh said teasingly, \"No need to be shy here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to try out that little yellow button, you pervert?\" you said firmly, \"I need really some clothes and fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Fine! Just let me get it ready by morning. You are such a killjoy to me. Now just sleep, will you? We've got a long day ahead and I got some more flying to do before I rest too,\" Ho-oh said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Ho-oh\" you said, trying to sound polite again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep tight, human. And don't let my body have fun with you at night,\" Ho-oh said cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly lay down on the bed, making sure that Vaporeon is also good, and made yourself comfortable before snoozing off in a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you awoke you were amazed you fell asleep in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how long it had been until you looked at your locator. Much to your surprise you had slept seven hours despite the disturbances in the chest chamber, it was 3 AM. The heart below the transparent floor resounded in your bedroom, almost as if it were directly inside your head. Groaning you stood up, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost hypnotic to watch it, but you had better things to do than stare at your host's heart, even if its slow rhythm was kind of relaxing when you focused on it. It was going to officially be the first full day inside Ho-oh and you had some serious thinking to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon was happily asleep over the desk and you didn't want to wake her up unnecessarily. As long as she didn't get out of your bedroom everything should be fine. You had a concrete place to go, as you craved anything that could confirm without any doubt what Ho-oh had been saying about being a better host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you quite a while to find a path to the head and to your objective. In your other stay you didn't really explore the winding paths that weren't organs or anything else, so most of the body was unknown at least in that regard. The path was tiring and you were glad you at least slept deeply, even if it was still way too early. You blamed the sound of Ho-oh's breathing and heartbeat and considered asking him to let you move, but you suspected a hefty amount of tokens would be needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after around half an hour of ascending nonstop you walked forward until you got to the place you were hoping to reach. A few steps along the edge of the throat until you stepped on the tongue. You officially were inside Ho-oh's beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved to see that it was slightly open, way more than enough for you to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over the length of the tongue, always staring at the way out, until you were almost on the tip. There you sat down, thoughtful. Did this mean Ho-oh wanted to be a better host? He had knowingly left an easy way out. Sure, you wouldn't really be able to do a lot in your actual size and Ho-oh was the only one who could return you to your size, but compared to last time this is as if he left an huge hole on the wall of a fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If he's really willing to do this then...I suppose I could give him a chance. At least he's more reasonable now. But what could convince Arceus? I doubt a mere 'hey we're friends now' would be enough for hi to give back the legendary status to this stupid bird.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue under you shifted, making you think Ho-oh was awake now, but nothing else happened. You continued sitting, trying to think. Yesterday you had shared Vaporeon possible plans for the future inside Ho-oh, but it wasn't anything you were completely sure would happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first: we have to truly trust each other, but how can I do that? You had never owned any avian Pok\u00e9mon, so you had no idea how to bond with one, and even if you did it was likely anything you could do wouldn't work from the inside. <i>Unless.</i>..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered a not so good moment from a year ago. You had been forced groom Ho-oh and it had been a bad experience, as expected from anything that would involve the bird. <i>If it's ever needed I at least could interact with a projection of him. </i>That didn't change the fact you had no idea how to proceed, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to escape, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were startled, snapping out of your thoughts. \"No, no, no, no! I was just here, thinking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have done that in your room\" he groused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been here for quite a while. I could have escaped anytime but I didn't\" Ho-oh didn't reply at that. Instead something ringed in your locator, prompting you to look. Once you did you saw a number. \"Twenty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your weekly allowance\" he explained \"Since your very inconsiderate use of my resources I decided to charge you for your daily necessities. You can also see in your locator a list of the prices\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did so, frowning. With twenty tokens you didn't have enough for three daily meals, a bath and anything else you needed. You'd be short for a couple days. \"I wouldn't have asked for a bath if it weren't for your very inconsiderate welcome, you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed the yellow button, sending a shock on wherever Ho-oh was ready to be punished. Ho-oh suddenly stood up, making you fall face first onto the tongue. \"Okay, it was, it was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see we understand each other, but these tokens won't be enough for the week\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you yesterday that by doing jobs inside me you would obtain more, and I'm very generous with them. A single one would give you enough for the week, while the hardest one would last you at least two months. You could check that in the Work Center\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How nice. Either way, I have been thinking about what we have to do and...yeah, I'm cooperating. I think I know what to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First we need to actually...like each other, even if it is enough for you to not to rip my head off at the first chance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you plan to do such a feat?\" he said, almost amused. You scowled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell if I know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh didn't really like that answer \"Then go think about that!\" The tongue under you moved, bringing you to the throat again. Just before you got swallowed again you made your decision on what to do.</span></div></div>",

You fell and landed back into the gizzard with a thud. Thankfully, the place has been emptied of the disgusting mixture of herbs, leaving behind a quite spacious chamber. At least he's being a bit more thoughtful this time, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, human. You have two simple choices. Here's the deal. Either you try whatever unhelpful method you might have to bond with me or you start making yourself useful. So what would it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered the choices presented by Ho-oh and decided that bonding with the Pokemon could wait. Finding something to like about Ho-oh is near impossible and with mutual distrust still running deep, it's unlikely in the near term. The more urgent thing is to earn tokens if you want to survive in here. You stood up and focused your voice at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Please guide me to the Work Center. I want to earn some tokens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take the last tunnel to your left, human. Further instructions will be given once you're at the center,\" Ho-oh said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as he instructed and entered the tunnel which takes you on a relatively slope-free route to your new destination. In the middle of your travel, you noticed that your locator started beeping; it sounded a bit different from the notification for added tokens. You lifted your hand and saw the screen on your wrist is showing a transaction of 8 tokens along with a short message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><i>\"New clothing you ordered will cost you 8 tkns. Thank you &gt;:P\"</i></span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're irritated by the taunting message and the fact that you've got only 12 tokens left. If you recall correctly, that amount will only get you a simple dish of raw plants and some berry juice with only a few tokens left for a 1-minute shower. You hated the idea of how Ho-oh still seems to relish on your misfortune despite his reassurance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's the big idea? I'm already short on tokens and you're still charging me for those clothes?\" you said annoyingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those clothes cost me time and effort to make; it's hard work for me,\" the Pokemon said complacently, \"As I said before, I have limited resources in my body. You should be thankful that I'm even sharing them. A few tokens of appreciation isn't too much to ask, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is! You're deliberately making it difficult for me, Ho-oh. And why should I play along with your game?\" you said bluntly, \"My old clothes got trashed and it's entirely your fault. Aren't you supposed to act more responsible after that \"reminder\" I gave you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am being responsible!\" the Pokemon defended, \"I made good on my promise to accommodate you. I provided you with a room, food, and a bathing chamber. Plus, I'm on my best possible behavior. And I got no rewards for that. Yet you're still complaining?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh's immature attempt to change the subject of the conversation only irks you further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the problem, Ho-oh,\" you said as you attempt to control yourself, \"I'm not a tightwad by any means but that charge is plain unacceptable given the cirsumstances. I simply want you to return the 8 tokens you took from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to happen. I told you that I will start charging for everything and I intend to follow through on that,\" Ho-oh replied, \"Quit whining and shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou promptly pressed the shocker on your locator several times, causing Ho-oh to cringe and howl in pain while in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...ow....owwww...Making it stop! Make it stop!!! My wings...they're growing numb. Gosh, you're giving me cramps. Please, I'll listen to you...I  get it! Please stop shocking me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like your so-called improvements are still highly unsatisfactory. Now, are you gonna refund me?\" you grinned before you stopped shocking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I'll remove the clothing charge this time,\" the Pokemon relented and returned 8 tokens to your locator. You heard another beep from the device to confirm the transaction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Isn't it much better if you just listen to me for once? I'm wondering why you always seems to get yourself in trouble, especially with that loud beak you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like trouble keeps getting in my way, human. I'm really starting to regret that I even willingly installed these shockers over my body,\" Ho-oh groaned, \"I'm the idiot for giving you so much power. Wait a minute, maybe I should also charge you for every shock you give me. Sounds fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more than willing to pay to see you getting fried. I believe that you need someone to discipline you and set you straight; someone who will establish the rules for you to behave. And I find myself unfortunate enough to be in that role as your sitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! I'm not a young hatchling anymore! I don't need you to tell me what I can or cannot do,\" the bird scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet, you're acting like a petulant kid with a tantrum problem,\" You added rhetorically, \"You wouldn't be in this position had you made a better first impression. How you managed to be promoted to a Legendary Pokemon is beyond me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Enough chitchat, human. Just get to the Work Center!\" Ho-oh huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored Ho-oh's frustrated grunt and continued down the path. It took little effort for you to reach your intended destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you see a doorway marked 'Work Center' at the end of the tunnel. You ushered yourself through a steel door and took in the sight. The room is about the same size as the chest chamber and resembles an amalgamation of a classroom and conference room. The floor is separated into terraced form, similar to a theater. If it weren't for the fact that the walls are literally flesh, you would assume that you had stumbled into some hidden lair. Schematic maps of Ho-oh's body are mounted on the walls of the Center. Each one of them has labels and captions explaining their purposes. The centerpieces of the room are a large screen which occupies an entire wall and an impressive-looking workstation in front of you. The workstation consists of even more displays that shows various measurements and statuses about the Pokemon's body. You sat in the single steel chair provided for you which caused the large screen blinked to life:<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"corange\"><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><br>\r\n<b>\"Welcome to the Work Management System! <br>\r\nPlease tap your locator on the sensor on the workstation to begin.\"</b><br>\r\n</font></span></i><br>\r\nYou did as instructed and the screen refreshes automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>Before you start your work for me, I believe that an orientation would be appropriate. We'll go over important things like rules, my various body parts, your responsibility, rewards, and of course, your compensation and the penalties for noncompliance. Please tap again and we're off to a good start :)<br>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerful instruction offered little explanation of what your duties would include. Penalties? Rewards? You're not liking the sound of those terms. You heaved a sigh and prepared yourself for whatever Ho-oh is going to throw at you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The prospect of having to work in order to have a relatively dignified stay inside Ho-oh is something you really hate. You were considering telling Ho-oh about what you could do, which wasn't much right now, but his words made you decide to do it later. You had to think something effective for him to accept to cooperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped you'd think of something quick before you have to do a lot of work for your host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before starting I want you to promise I'm not going to be forced to do anything I don't want to do\" you demanded firmly. Ho-oh was silent for a moment before saying calmly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't. You'll only do what you want to do, but remember your rewards are equivalent to your effort\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was good enough for you. At least you weren't threatened with something like not having a room for the night if you didn't work. Besides it could be good to keep yourself busy while you tried to think a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing yourself for the worst you tapped the sensor. The screen instantly turned bright, and a voice sounded, which you recognized as Ho-oh. You wondered for how long he had this recording in him. Maybe since before he found you? While the recording spoke several images filled the screen, providing helpful additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been recruited as a worker inside my body. It may not be the best perspective but there has been several changes since your last time. As now you're a willing worker...\" you took a moment to scoff at that \"...you're going to be informed of several things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are only two rules: you'll finish your task before twenty four hours. You're allowed to stop and continue later, but if your job isn't finished you'll pay a penalty. The second rule is that you're going to do your job diligently and with care. You're being trusted with the maintenance of my body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was reasonable enough, in your opinion. Once those two rules were explained Ho-oh's recording started a long and frankly tedious explanation of his different organs. It was nothing you didn't know already. There were a few you had already visited a year ago, and the rest were organs and systems most living organisms have. You started tuning out, your thoughts wandering to focusing on quick ways to get Ho-oh to let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...for all tasks you accept you'll receive objects and equipment to make the task as easy as possible\" you smiled in relief. That was something you were very grateful for. \"Many tasks also include rewards which are added to your payment once the task is finished. These rewards can be from new furniture for your bedroom to access to communication to the outside world. Of course these rewards are limited to the most strenuous tasks in existence\" Your smile was gone. It was to be expected, Ho-oh would never give you something that could make it easier to escape without having to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The payment for each task is equivalent to the effort and time needed. The most menial task is guaranteed to cover your basic necessities for two days, while the highest paid one will allow you to live comfortably for a month\" <i>I'm not going to be here a month, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recording continued onto the last part. \"Penalties range from a reduced payment to the downgrading of your bedroom. As promised you won't be forced to experiment any nasty environments against your will but if you incur in penalties at some point you could even find yourself with not even a bed in your bedroom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the end. Overall nothing the recording said was anything new or useful. Ho-oh may as well have said 'WORK AND GET PAID' and that would have been all you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen showed what resembled a desktop with several applications, one of them apparently to see what tasks there were available. You opened it and found a dozen of options. You hovered over the task, a little map on the corner of the screen shining with the area or organ it involved. \"That was neat and all that, Ho-oh, but are you sure you'll make this at least bearable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want any problems with you, human\" Ho-oh said \"Just work if you wish but remember you'll have to endure hardships if you wish to live with enough accommodations\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued hovering over the tasks until you got to one in middle of the list that got your attention. The map on the corner showed Ho-oh's silhouette glowing, the whole body involved. \"Groom Ho-oh\" That was short and to the point, but it have you an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegendary, former Legendary or not Ho-oh was still a Pok\u00e9mon. You had raised and trained a team, six Pok\u00e9mon loyal to you and to full strength. Vaporeon, currently in your bedroom or at least you hoped that, was proof of what you could achieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow else to achieve a bond with Ho-oh but caring for him as if he were your own Pok\u00e9mon? Feeding him, keeping him clean, getting him to be stronger, doing everything in your power to ensure he knew he could trust you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's a simple plan and with some luck Vaporeon can help me with this. A Pok\u00e9mon trained by me helping a new member of the team...it has logic.</i> You had to tell Vaporeon about the plan. While she couldn't speak your language you were sure you'd understand any ideas she could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh, I'm going to do something for you today\" you said \"How much is this task worth?\" You touched the task, highlighting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worth 300 tokens. You could live well enough for a week\" the bird informed and added with some mockery in his voice \"I never thought you'd think of doing it again. To me it didn't seem like you had fun a year ago. Are you sure you want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed \"Yeah. It'll be good help, won't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'm going to have a change of attitude this time. We must turn f-f-friends...\" it was something so ridiculous you couldn't say it in one try \"...and the best way for that is to show I'm willing to do it, right? I'm going to take care of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again there was silence for a moment until Ho-oh finally replied. \"I see...I don't know what to say but I'll accept it. Thank you human...for that\" His tone was strange, like he didn't know how that made him feel. In a sense that was encouraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you it was proof he was willing to accept what you intended to do. Maybe while you were doing that you could take the chance to talk with him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ho-oh's hesitation was a rather unexpected thing. Normally, he would have already been barking orders at you and making hard to fulfill demands about how to clean him. Equally surprising is the 'thank you' that came out of his mouth. It's the first time he expressed anything resembling gratitude toward you. <i>Why did Ho-oh sounded slightly concerned when you volunteered to groom him? Does this means the former Legendary really intends to become better, albeit in his own mocking and sarcastic way? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I better get started then, Ho-oh,\" you said, \"But before I start, could you hold on for a while please? I gotta head back to the bedroom to get some things. I have to prepare for this occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me. But make it quick,\" Ho-oh ordered, \"As you already aware, I'm not one who is used to waiting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't keep you hanging for too long. I promise,\" you assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Alright, be ready within an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where will I be going in order to groom you? Do I have to go outside to do that?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! You won't need to leave my body to perform that task. You'll be going back to that chamber where you were forced to clean my virtual representation last time,\" the bird said with a sneer, \"Don't think that I'm naive enough to simply let you walk out of my mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twisted your face in disgust at the thought. The memories of the dirt and smell quickly resurfaced as well as Ho-oh's cackling face while you polished his talons and beak. You were about to protest but was silenced by Ho-oh's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... it'll be a much more pleasant task for you this time,\" Ho-oh added with an unusually sugary tone, \"You'll see when you get there. You have my words... Well then, human. Let's not waste our time lingering here! I'm really looking forward to the grooming you'll provide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, you made your way back to the chest chamber to fetch your Pokemon. Along the way, you start thinking about all the grooming methods you learned as a Trainer. It's obvious that Legendaries, former Legendary in this case, would require far more than just a simple soap and brush or Pokeblocks to be happy, especially for a prideful one like Ho-oh. But you'll have to give it a try. You noted that Ho-oh seems to have  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're in the bedroom again, you found Vaporeon still lounging on the metallic desk next to your bed. You quietly approached the desk and gently stroked her back to wake her up. It made the Pokemon instinctively yawn and stretch herself before looking at you with half-opened eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Vaporeon. Time to wake up there, buddy. I have a a special assignment for you,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Water Pokemon tilted her head with a perplexed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see... Ho-oh just gave me the opportunity, although the better term would be coerced me, to look after his body in exchange for tokens to purchase goods and necessities. I will have to work for him to sustain our current lifestyle, otherwise he'll impose penalties and downgrade our bedrooms. I don't want to upset Ho-oh or end up sleeping on the floor so I volunteered to help groom Ho-oh which he promised to pay me 300 tokens, enough help us get by for a week. In order to do that, I'll need a little of your assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon looked at you with an unchanging expression as her fish-like tail swished about behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In addition to that, there's no way I can keep you hidden from him forever. Sooner or later I have to reveal you to Ho-oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon's ears pricked up and yowled loudly at you. It's as if she's protesting your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. I'm still conflicted whether I should fully trust him or not. His past actions should have made it a resounding no but he's attempting to be nice for once. Unfortunately, I'm not a Psychic Pokemon so I have no method of learning if he's genuine or does he have ulterior motives. This is a risk we'll have to make together. This is the only choice we have right now,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon looked unsure for a moment. She remained like that for several minutes but you remained beside her and continue to pat her, trying to reassure the anxious Pokemon that things will turn out for the good. She eventually gave an affirmative cry and leap down from the desk to brush herself against your legs. It her way of saying that it's up to you to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Vaporeon,\" you chimed as you stroke her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took out your Pokeball and returned Vaporeon to it before clipping it onto your belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked Ho-oh about the location of the chamber which, if you recalled correctly, is somewhere along the spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For such a memorable experience, I assume that you would at least remember where it took place,\" Ho-oh said half-derisively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one thing, cleaning your wings is not something I would find memorable. I prefer traumatizing as the description!\" you sniped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting a little cocky, are we?\" Ho-oh asked with an amused tone,\"....Fine...I'll get you there. Just follow the gold line I made for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his words, a glowing gold line emerged in the flesh on the floor to lead you. You followed it through a maze of sphincters and hallways, It reminded you of the dreaded body tour you were forced to take previously. The thoughts made you even more nervous about the surprises you might find in your destination. The glowing line led you to one particular sphincter in the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, human,\" Ho-oh said, \"Beyond is where you'll be grooming me. Heh heh heh...Have a good time in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touched the sphincter to open it and walked in. You prepared yourself for the worst of Ho-oh's antics. Instead, you are greeted by something else entirely. It's a location from the outside world. You were standing upon a small hill so you had a good look at your surroundings. A waterfall crested over a rock ledge before falling into a lake with water delivered from other parts of Ho-oh's body. Tall trees in the surrounding area have all turn brilliant hues of red and orange, dancing animatedly in the wind like a blaze. Beside the lake, a majestic pagoda proudly stood against the lavender sky. The 10-story tall structure looks like it has been through centuries without any major repairs. It's fiery red wood frames compliment the fall colors of the place. Ornate gold bells are suspended from each of the four corners on the tallest floor. You walked toward the structure and saw a wooden sign attached at the top of the doors. Though the dark inks were faded by time, it still reads legibly as the 'Bell Tower'. <i>Appropriate enough</i>, you thought as you recalled Ho-oh's legend from Ecruteak City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large shadow suddenly loomed over you before you had the opportunity to enter the structure. You looked up and saw Ho-oh's virtual representation is perched on top of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, human!\" Ho-oh said expectantly as he looked down from above, \"It's about time you showed up. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon spread his golden wings and flew down, landing just a few meters in front of you. Ho-oh looks imposing this up close while his red eyes focused on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my new place working for you?\" the virtual entity said noting your surprised expression, \"Illusion spells could get you this far if you're powerful and old enough. Puts all Ninetales out there to shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is all this for? I thought you wanted me to groom you,\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be discussed later on. For now, I want to make your experience much better than last time. I made this environment more relaxing and familiar for you. I'm curious, human, have you ever visited my hometown before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only passed through Ecruteak City once but I haven't really stayed here before,\" you said admittedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to correct that. I suggest that you accompany me to the bathhouse in town where I can indulge you in some local hospitality,\" Ho-oh said with a grin and a mischievous glint in his eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ho-oh flew to a couple meters over the ground and towards the rest of the town. When you arrived to the town you unconsciously grasped Vaporeon's Pok\u00e9ball. It had been in this town where you had obtained the Water Stone to evolve her so the town brought back some memories. Despite that moment it was true you had practically passed through without even taking a moment to rest. It was just like two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived to the town itself Ho-oh flew to the top of the roof of what you supposed was the bathhouse, a large building built traditionally. As you hadn't seen an building this large when you passed through there you suspected it either didn't exist anymore or Ho-oh had enlarged it in his illusion. \"It's a beautiful town\" you commented with sincerity \"Maybe I should have spent a bit more of time when I was in this area\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have\" Ho-oh grumbled, getting onto the ground to enter the bathhouse \"It's much nicer in person but you won't be going there in the near future\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, when one says 'let me show you the town's hospitality' normally that doesn't involve giving a bath to who offered it\" you said, opening the door. The inside of the bathhouse was quite simple: a round hole taking most of the space inside, lined with blue tiles. Around it you could see furniture with different implements and towels, nothing unusual or strange, at least at first sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll have to be when you're done. Have you forgotten what you're here for?\" Ho-oh descended into the hole, you noticed it was big enough for him to extend his wings to full span, almost touching the edge. You would be able to crouch comfortably on the edge and work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I should get it done. So since we're in a bathhouse how different will this be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I normally don't enjoy water in excess. Swimming is not for me. You'll see later what this is for. Now work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom of the pool filled with a shallow layer of water, barely covering Ho-oh's talons. You looked at the tools on the shelves and picked one that resembled a rake. It was good that at least this time you wouldn't need to use your hands or your own clothes. Seeing what you had picked up Ho-oh turned around, showing his back to you and standing as close as possible to the edge. \"I'm not completely sure how to use this but it shouldn't be too hard. Stand still\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh obeyed and you carefully placed the rake at the base of the neck, dragging it down to the base of the tail. With each stroke the feathers aligned, forming perfect rows.You could see Ho-oh had closed his eyes, the touch of the rake relaxing him. You continued brushing for several minutes until there wasn't a single feather out of place. \"Right, this part is done. Extend your wings\" Ho-oh obeyed without a word, but after a couple tries you were sure the rake wouldn't work. As nothing else you saw around seemed to work for this you donned a pair of thin gloves you found and carefully aligned the feathers on the wings. Now that there was no pressure on doing the job nor Ho-oh was being a pain on the neck the task was...calming. You had to focus and that kept your mind blank, without any concrete worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never thought you'd truly enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking on the tale was the same than the wings, and after fifteen minutes you had finished that. The hardest part was to style the feathers of the head so it had the shape of the signature crest, but Ho-oh waited with patience. \"I'm done here. Turn around\" you requested, taking a small towel from a shelf and absorbing a bit of water from the bottom of the pool \"This won't take more than five minutes\" Ho-oh had opened his eyes and was now staring at you. Seeing those red eyes from so close made you nervous, but you didn't let it show. \"Admit I have done it fine so far\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh muttered under his breath but you didn't understand any of that. \"Yeah, yeah, you did. Much better than I expected\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't so hard to admit, was it?\" You grinned but before Ho-oh could reply you put the towel on his beak \"Now be quiet, this'll be quick\" it didn't take long to clean his beak, and soon it was so clean you could almost see your reflection. As soon as you took away the towel the bird crowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was hard to admit but that's because I can't believe you did this without any protests. You'll have to admit it was better than you thought\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you accepted I did it good then I'll accept it was...fine\" you took off your shoes and jumped into the pool. As expected the water felt authentic, it definitely wasn't an illusion. You crouched and moistened the towel again, cleaning the legs and talons. Once you were finished you sighed in relief, happy you had done it even better than last time. Ho-oh would have to admit it too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done. You'll be paid now\" the modified locator on your wrist pinged. '<i>You have been paid! 300 tokens have been added to your account'</i>. Seeing the reward for your work was nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you did this for me then I'll do something for you. This town was created for that, I promised you I'd indulge you in some local hospitality\". Ho-oh jumped out of the pool and soon it started filling with warm water, different colors drifting in it. You had the hunch when you entered you'd feel very relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrateful, you took off your clothes and submerged in the pool, thoughtful. You had felt Vaporeon's Pok\u00e9ball on your belt, it was rather amazing Ho-oh hadn't noticed it. Or maybe he had and he just hadn't commented on it, thinking it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you thought it'd be good to reveal it. \"Um, you know you...found me in that forest, right? I had gone there after training one of my Pok\u00e9mon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I should say that...I'm not the only guest you have\" you took the Pok\u00e9ball on your belt and threw it in the pool while Ho-oh watched with neutral expression. \"This is Vaporeon. It's time for you two to meet\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like the previous time, you watched as the water in the center glowed with a brilliant blue light as Vaporeon's form started to materialize from the water. At this point, you are unsure how Ho-oh would react to an additional guest in his body. Would he readily accept her as a friend... or a liability?, you thought. There is possible risk that Ho-oh will have a less-than-friendly reaction to your Pokemon and start punishing you to his liking. It still sends shiver up your spine to imagine being trapped in the colon. Most of all, you had no idea what he would do with Vaporeon. With Ho-oh just becoming a bit more bearable, you quietly hoped that things do not go in that direction.<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh looked intently at the multicolored lights that is dazzling his eyes. The Pokemon has to admit that it was a spectacular sight. <i>But still a poor analogue to my Sacred Fire.</i> He spotted a shape coming from the depth where the human has thrown the Pokeball. Ho-oh narrowed his crimson eyes and frowned at the device; the sight of it's red and white color is still upsetting for the ex-Legendary. It was the same thing that he was trapped with once and, one day, abruptly released from before he could grasp what had happened. The longer he stared at the Pokeball, the more the memories returned in vivid fashion.<i> That trainer who captured me...the professor...and those wretched experiments...</i>Ho-oh realized that he is about lose control of his temper and quickly pushed the memory of his brief encounter with a previous human to the back of his head. <i>No, I cannot allow that incident to cloud my judgement again. I promised already.</i> Ho-oh took some deep breath and allow himself to regain his composure. Luckily, the human was too absorbed with his own Pokemon to notice any changes in his expression.<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon emerged from the water with an overjoyed cry. You smiled back at your Pokemon and embraced her while stroking her body gently. You looked toward Ho-oh whose gaze is fixed on the 'newcomer.'  Other than that, there is no obvious show of emotion from the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Vaporeon!\" you said, \"You're looking pretty chipper there, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Water Pokemon wrapped herself around you with her tail and licked your face.<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Surprise, surprise...we have an additional guest. And that means that I have to share even more of my resources,</i> Ho-oh thought amused, <i>And it's a Vaporeon, a Water-type. I don't remember when I've last met one of those things. But it must be about a a decade or two ago. Usually, these creatures are quite shy and hide themselves in the water. But this one looks that it's well-adapted to human contact. Time to take a closer look. Perhaps I could learn a bit more about this human from the Vaporeon. Whether he's good enough for me to give him more respect.</i><br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough Vaporeon,\" you chimed as you stroked her head, \"Remember what we talked about back in the bedroom. I believe that it is time for both of you and Ho-oh to have a proper introduction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon turned her head and notice the large Pokemon standing next to the large pool. Ho-oh's mere presence seems to intimidate her. You imagined it's due to a combination of his fearsome appearance and your stories about how mean was. You held her up in your arms and presented her to Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh, I would like you to meet Vaporeon,\" you said. The bird only nodded in acknowledgement, \"Vaporeon, this is Ho-oh. He is our host and is kind enough to provide us with this pool I helped groom him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Ho-oh craned his head lower toward Vaporeon and scrutinized her in detail. The first impression that he got is that they must have known each other for a long time. Likely since the human became a trainer at a young age. He looked at every visible body part and fins. While Ho-oh tried to look as welcoming as possible, his naturally sharp eyes and talons reduced the effectiveness. He extended one of his wings and used the feather tip to stroke Vaporeon's head.<i> Let's see....Nothing seems out of place. No signs of injuries or stress anywhere. Her teeth are all in pristine condition. All indication is that she's well cared for.</i>  <i>It's nice to see this human being so close with her.</i> He silently took note of the stark comparison between Vaporeon and the treatment he endured. <i>She's a lucky one.</i>, Ho-oh thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Vaporeon's point of view, Ho-oh looks even more imposing at this distance. One of his eyes alone is about 10 times her size. Those red irises must have probed her for several minutes while you stood there holding your Pokemon. When Ho-oh is finally satisfied with what he saw, he lifted his head and repositioned himself beside the large pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Pokemon looks....quite beautiful and well-groomed,\" Ho-oh commented at last, \"You must have taken good care of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. She is one of my favorite Pokemons. I cannot think of leaving on any adventures without her. Is it okay if I keep her in here? I promise that I will be responsible for all her needs,\" you asked, which sounded a little weird.<br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh thought about the potential advantages and disadvantages of having one additional passenger. <i>Pro: The human has someone other than me to talk and play with. I don't have to do anything for the Pokemon, so that's plus. But I'm still not sure if I should charge the human extra for his Pokemon. Con: Vaporeon might get overexcited cause troubles around my body. I cannot let that happen. I need the human to help me regain my Legendary status. Could his Pokemon ruin everything by distracting him from his job?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh's thoughts went back and forth for a some times as if each side of his brain is locked in a debate. It wasn't for long before he settled for the best option.<br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I've made my decision,\" Ho-oh said, \"After careful consideration, I'll let her stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face brightened up. \"Thank you so much, Ho-oh. Did you hear that, Vappy? You won't have to worry about your living arrangements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you need to follow two conditions I have. First, I want you to keep her out of the Pokeball at all times. Pokemons are supposed to be free to go to anyplace they like and any time they wish without interference from humans. Two, I still want you to reasonably stick to our original goal of getting my Legendary status back. Having your Pokemon on board doesn't mean that our priorities have changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Ho-oh. You have my words. You won't be disappointed. But, why can't I keep Vaporeon in her Pokeball? It's easier to take her around like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh expression hardened and looked at you. \"As I probably told you before, I've had a very bad experience at the hand of a heartless trainer who trapped me in a cramped Pokeball and later abandoned me once he got his Pokedex completed. Seeing any of those things would bring back unhappy memories and those bad moods last for days. Unless you want me to treat you the \"old-fashioned\" way, for whatever stupid reasons you might have, you better keep Pokeballs and Pokedexes out of my sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recalled that you first heard this story after being tied up in the eye chamber. Ho-oh never went into detail about that incident but you decide not to pursue the topic, at least not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...Okay, I get you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou placed the Pokeball away. It would't hurt to let Vaporeon roam around freely. But you may need to keep a closer eye on her lest she gets herself into trouble with Ho-oh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Vaporeon bathed in the pool for about a half more hour before deciding to that you're done and informed Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get yourself dressed then, human,\" Ho-oh said, \"The hospitality doesn't just end here. Come, my other representations are waiting.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once you were dressed and ready to go you called Vaporeon to your side. It was going to be a bit worrying that Vaporeon was going to be at all times outside of her Pokeball. You still remembered the incident from a year ago inside Lugia, when Vaporeon had wandered away without you and you found her amidst badly done products. Luckily it seemed she wasn't in any danger at any point, but it worries you something like this can happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it seems Ho-oh is taking well Vaporeon's presence. You didn't have worry about him treating her wrongly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other representations? You're not going to make me clean all of them, right?\" you said almost jokingly. There was a chance it could happen, after all<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! With a town this big do you think there'd be nobody to take care of everything? There are several like me, with the same memories and all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat\" you reply, not seeing a lot of sense in creating copies just to give you a tour of Ecruteak. You weren't going to complain, though. At least this was interesting and unusual. So, what's going to happen now in your hospitality schedule?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ecruteak is a highly traditional town, valued by its backstories and its attachment to the past. It's to be expected a town like this has a teahouse\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. So we're going to a teahouse. Fine with me\" Vaporeon seemed more interested in tea than you, so you were willing to go and accept that possibility for her sake. And even if she didn't want tea, well...it wasn't like you could reject the invitation. You didn't feel comfortable with not going along with what your host had planned, as you feared repercussions. You knew Ho-oh could be very petty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy to find the teahouse. It was another huge building among the houses and places of normal size. You suspected that if there was anything of big size in this illusion then it meant you would visit it. The teahouse was decorated in an elegant and rather relaxing way, you felt like you could spend hours in there. \"Nice job with the, you know...illusion\" you complimented, wagging your finger around to point at the decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just like I remember. I haven't been in Ecruteak for a long time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you visit Ecruteak one of these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel like it. I'd rather to stay away until you finish your job\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou narrowed your eyes, annoyed. As if you needed more reminders. You already had thought of a plan, but it was mostly a base. The details were hazy and most of your bonding techniques didn't work since you were inside the Pokemon you wanted to bond with. Vaporeon had already met Ho-oh so that part was done...now what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was clear what Ho-oh had meant about his representations. From where you thought was an annex room soon came a smaller version of Ho-oh, awkwardly carrying a tray with a big teapot and two teacups. After it was deposited on the table it bowed and went away. \"That sure was a thing\" you muttered, taking one of the teacups and sliding the other to Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was ready for a while. If I had known earlier there was somebody else around I'd have ordered three\" Ho-oh said, passing the teacup to Vaporeon with his beak, your friend trying her best to drink it. Not having anything else to say you took a sip of the tea, looking at the tray. There was a folded map on it too, but for the moment you preferred to focus on the tea. It was actually likable and it tasted like it was a blend of several types of plants, but you couldn't recognize which ones. What was sure is that you had never tried anything like it before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh took the map and extended it on the table, revealing it was a map of Ecruteak. There were a few places marked with a red circle, places you had seen already and others that maybe were places of interest. You recognized the tower you had arrived near of, the bathhouse and the teahouse. \"What else have you got planned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a Theater, a lake and a farm for food nearby. Lots of stores over here and this over here is the Burned Tower. On this side there's a Dojo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Am I going to visit all of those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you will. How long do you plan to be here resting? You're spending some idle time because I was gracious enough to give you a break, not because you should get used to this\" the bird admonished, making you roll your eyes behind your hand \"You pick the places you want to go but choose carefully. You may want to see as many places as possible but I don't have enough patience for that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for your hospitality\" you said, leaving the map aside \"Okay, since you're so interested in pressuring me to do what I can do to restore your status as  a Legendary then you tell me what to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I? You're the one who is supposed to do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I worded that wrongly\" you put your hand on Vaporeon's head, thinking how to make clear what you wanted to know \"What I mean is...how can I make you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Arceus will give you that status back if he believes we're getting along, okay? But Arceus is, you know, your superior. Doesn't sound to me like he's the kind to be fooled. I'm willing to be your frieeeend...\" saying the word with 'Ho-oh' was still difficult for you \"...but for that we need to reach mutual understanding, trust each other. I have a few ideas of how we can bond but I want you to tell me:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow can I get you to trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the big question, at least in your opinion. Nothing you did would work if Ho-oh didn't consider it worthy. Maybe asking him directly wasn't a good idea, but it was possible it could save you a lot of time and headaches, at least if he chose to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited expectantly for what he could say, hoping that he wouldn't be vague and at least would give you enough hints of what else to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ho-oh thought about the human's question while taking a sip of his tea. The sweet aroma of the herbs did a lot to soothe his anxiety but he still remained uneasy. The Pokemon knew that the question would inevitably come up at some point. But the timing couldn't have been worse: he hasn't given much thought about it. <i>How am I suppose to start? Arceus told me that this trust business has to be mutual for it to work. Without that, any attempt at friendship is doomed to failure. Meaning, I also need to earn the human's trust...somehow... </i> Ho-oh looked at the human who didn't break off eye contact with him. He was beginning to feel uneasy at the attention he was getting. <i>Okay, better say something and look good.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would depend on you actions, human. I will make my decision when the time comes,\" Ho-oh said in a measured tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't feel like an answer to me. I intend to hear something more specific,\" you responded. You are not buying his ambiguous explanation and the Pokemon seemed to take note of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird thought deeply about his answer and cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply put....I...want you to prove to me that you are not like the humans I encountered before you,\" Ho-oh said, \"I don't want you using me like I'm some type of expendable object to satisfy your needs. I want you to treat me in a fair and deferential manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you replied calmly, \"That sounds easy enough. I'm not the kind of person who exploit others for personal gain, so you can rest assured about that. But I still have doubts about your intentions, Ho-oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I ask why....,\" Ho-oh frowned at the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, your previous actions made me doubt your sincerity,\" you said without hesitation, \"Yes, you've tempered your attitude down a bit and treated me to some of your most generous hospitalities yet. I appreciate that. But how can you prove that everything you're doing is genuine and not some charm offensive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do something that is obviously not in my interest, even jeopardize my very existence?\" Ho-oh asked, \"I haven't mistreated you in any ways. I did everything I can to make my body comfortable for you. Most of all, I genuinely want to change. It's everything you could have asked for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make a little assumption, supposedly if Arceus hadn't taken away your Legendary status and powers, would you be this nice to me? Or would you still be your mean old self, making life miserable for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........Hmmm...I... ,\" Ho-oh mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh knew that the human was right to a certain extent: he would've made the him suffer under his old habits. That was until \"The Original One\" changed that. The long lecturing aside, being mostly stripped of his Special Power made Ho-oh feel vulnerable for the first time in a millennium. But he never revealed this feeling to anyone but himself. Any show of weakness was unthinkable for Ho-oh. After being repeatedly turned away and mocked by his former equals, he soon found out that his haughty attitude isn't going to earn him sympathy from either other Legendaries or any humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit, human,\" Ho-oh said, \"I would have been my old self: prideful and abusive. But...that was before I met Arceus and endured the subsequent events. Being powerless isn't fun you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust that Arceus has laid out some conditions for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did. The gist of the long list he gave me; He want me to be friends with you specifically and learn to better myself through my interaction with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And would be the consequences if you break the agreement once he restored your full status and revert to your old ways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, never. Lord Arceus is no fool, human,\" Ho-oh replied gravely, \" If I violate any terms, he could very well take away what he returned to me with a flick of his powers. If severe enough, he'll just blink me out of existence, completely erased without a trace. By then, even you won't realize what happened since your memories are also changed. To defy \"The Original One\" may very well be a death wish.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not something I would like to experience, much less you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I laid out my conditions for me to trust you,\" Ho-oh said diplomatically, \"It's time for me to ask you the same question in return: Tell me, what do I have to do for you to trust me, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...it's not hard to answer. You could be a bit less arrogant and cocky. That's a big sticking point in my opinion,\" you said, \"I also want you to treat me fairly. Most of all, you need to follow through on your promise of changing for the better. When you demonstrate that you are serious, then I could better trust you. As things currently are, my 'trust meter' is wobbling between \"Yes\" and \"No\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try my best to do all of your wishes. But don't get too excited, human, \" Ho-oh warned jocularly, \"Some of my habits can be difficult to kick out, especially my cockiness. Plus, parts of my old personality isn't completely gone yet. You're gonna need some excellent patience dealing with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh put on a smug expression toward you. The remark about his 'old personality' sound weird enough but doesn't disturb you much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to take baby steps then, Ho-oh,\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...great. I'm sure our new relationship is off to a \"good start,\"\" Ho-oh remarked before sipping his tea again.<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ho-oh drank the last of your tea before leaving the teahouse. The little Ho-oh came out and thanked you two for your patronage and escorted you two to the entrance. The sun is just setting in this artificial environment. Ho-oh flew up and glided in the orange skies anove you. You noticed the some changes about the town. The streets of the ancient town felt lively as many representations of the Pokemon, young and old, strolled in traditional clothing. It was strange to see each of the Ho-ohs having different eye colors, body shape, and different styling on their crest.Some of the representation noticed you and greeted you. Food stands are lined at the side of the street selling everything from pastries to exotics delicacies. The appropriate prices are all listed in tokens. The bird children are particularly lively as they hovered around with their kites and lantern in their wings. It reminded you of the festivals you used to play at when you're younger. Some of the female Ho-ohs cladded in beautiful robes and paper umbrellas looked at you while giggling. You blushed and smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going next as our final stop?\" Ho-oh asked from above.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe if you hadn't taken so long in the bathhouse or encouraged a discussion about trusting each other then you would have got time to see more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late. Didn't you see the sunset?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was something supposed to happen. Is it sunset outside too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. Hurry up and choose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\" if you remembered the map correctly the farm was the one furthest away and the theater the closest to where you were. Normally you would have gone for the Burned Tower, but this was a festival! You had been in festivals before specially when you were a child but obviously not in one populated only by this species. It sure was an experience. As such you wanted to go to a place that could be linked to this \"The theater. That should be the final stop\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over there\" Ho-oh started leading you to your decided place, while you looked around trying to see a bit of everything. When you got caught by Ho-oh 36 hours before this moment you never imagined at the next day you'd be in a simulated festival in an old version of Ecruteak, going with Ho-oh as if he were no more than a tour guide. This wasn't really what you imagined your days would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon, walking to your side, was specially enchanted by the surrounding things. You were carrying her so she wouldn't get lost in the crowd and you could hear her happiness from everything. At least there was somebody openly enjoying the hospitality. After buying a couple pastries for you and Vaporeon you reached Ho-oh in front of the Theater. \"Buying things already?\" Ho-oh eyed the pastry in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was starving. Besides I have more than enough tokens, why not to spend them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like you won't work tomorrow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I? I got paid and I can live for a while from that. There's no reason for me to break my back working everyday\" <i>Besides it was also a way to try to start the whole bonding thing too. Most tasks doesn't seem to me like they can work for that objective</i> you thought, entering the building. While Ho-oh seemed like he wanted you to make yourself useful everyday he didn't protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Theater was relatively crowded, with more Ho-ohs. There were no seats, so sitting on the floor was the only option. Getting as close to the platform as possible you relaxed, waiting for the show to start. \"So what'll happen here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're surely ignorant of everything about Ecruteak history I thought you should educate yourself\" Ho-oh replied, making his jab towards you be as glaring as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know about history but I suppose it will be okay to see the play\" You had chosen to be there, you may as well enjoy what there's to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the play had been waiting for your approval to start soon the Theater dimmed and focused all the lighting onto the platform. Somehow backgrounds and props appeared from nowhere, freshly created for the illusion. It showed an even older version of Ecruteak, if that was possible, with a prop of two towers on each side of the platform. What you watched followed pretty closely the tale you had heard about. The Burned Tower, originally called the Brass Tower, was hit by lightning, Pokemon died and were revived as new Legendaries, and Lugia and Ho-oh left the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery character involved was played by a Ho-ohs with masks. It broke the immersion to see birds with masks that were clearly of completely different species, but at lest the quality of the acting helped to make that not be bothersome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Theater, the props and the actors were all part of an illusion that gave Ho-oh complete liberty to make everything as impressive as possible. The play was full of amazing effects and you enjoyed everything, rather impressed by the quality of the events. When it was over you gave a sincere applause, thankful of having seen everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome! You said, exiting the Theater. Ho-oh was pretty smug about your appreciation, and slowly the illusion was over. Everything around you slowly vanished until you found yourself in the empty chamber you had been in a year ago for a task that wasn't nice at all. The contrast between your experience a year ago and now was pretty obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it was. That was the Ecruteak hospitality. I haven't been in the town for a long time but I'm sure they still do all this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not a town anymore. It's a city, but it's still traditional, judging from what I saw when I passed there. I think you'd still like it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ho-oh's representation couldn't leave the chamber he stopped at the entrance. \"Anything else to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did have something to say. \"I have been thinking about what we talked about and...well I'm glad we're at least getting along. This was a good day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're going to be lazy and not do any work tomorrow what will you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not much other than just...moving around. This is a living body, there must be stuff to see. Sure, I saw a lot last time and frankly around half of those are places I don't want to see again, but that isn't all there's to see\" You looked at Vaporeon for a moment \"I also need to find a place for Vaporeon to be in. Some exercise would do her some good, so if I can find a large empty space then great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do something about that\" Ho-oh of course was much more courteous towards Vaporeon than towards you. You couldn't avoid feeling somewhat annoyed about that, for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Good night\" you said, going out, once again alone with Vaporeon and without the overbearing bird aside you. Sure, you were still inside him, but that wasn't the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived to your bedroom you went straight to your bed while Vaporeon settled again in the desk. Since you weren't going to use Vaporeon's Pokeball for a while you threw it against a corner and fell asleep. Overall the day had gone much better than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubted all days would have something like what happened today, but as long as your host did nothing against you you were fine with just living inside for now and trying to achieve mutual trust. How long would that take, though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia's arrival was still scheduled for into nine days. If she got worried about you then...she may suspect something was going on. Would she look for Ho-oh? Chances are that she would and once she did...well, you two had some sort of psychic connection. She'd feel you inside him and you feared she wouldn't let you continue working on this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, if by that time you were willing to vouch for Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContacting Lugia was not an option, it was pretty much impossible that the bird would allow you to do that and even if he let you you didn't want to tell her what was going on. You weren't sure she'd allow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But if I can't tell Lugia then maybe there's some way to make it seem like there's nothing going on and I just can't get to the meeting, but I'd need help for that.</i> There was one Pokemon that could help in some regard. <i>Floatzel.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, at normal size and all you never had a way to contact other Pokemon. Sending messages to them would be enough to make alarms sound, but if you had to choose then telling Floatzel what was going on was better. You made a mental note to try to convince Ho-oh to let you tell him about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morning came faster than you imagined. The beeping sound of the locator served to rouse you from your dreams. You had dreams of meeting up with Lugia and playing with her as if nothing had happened. Unfortunately, the alarm dissipated that illusion. It can't be that soon, you thought. You recalled lying down on your bed and fell asleep in a minute. But a quick look at the locator indicated that it's 8:00 in the morning. Perfect.[/i}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get up, human!\" Ho-oh's voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urggh...,\" you groaned, \"Can't you lower your voice please? I didn't feel that I have slept at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's you're problem, human,\" Ho-oh squawked, \"Even though you don't plan to work today, I can't have you lazing off for an entire day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that I'm gonna waste my day in bed,\" you said as you stretched your arms, \"I'm gonna go on some tours around you body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" the bird said nonchalantly, \"I can't stop you. Anyways, you're free to go anyplace but my brain. That is the one place I don't want you prodding around. Don't think that I have forgotten your last antic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh placed special emphasis on the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry Ho-oh, I'll listen to you,\" you grinned, \"Trust me, I don't want to see any more of your weird fantasies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...,\" Ho-oh gritted, \"Must you mention that? I'm still upset at whoever made those scandalous leaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should beef up on your security next time,\" you cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr...Oh forget it! Go and get your breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou savored the little victory you had as you walked to the small room that has become your new dining chamber. You noticed that there is a new sign fixed to the wall, along with a sensor for your locator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbs and berries ---------------- 5 tokens<br>\r\nWild Fruits----------------------------7 tokens<br>\r\nNut Mix--------------------------------4 tokens<br>\r\nBerry drink---------------------------3 tokens<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the foods I have today. Make your choice, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More choices today I have some Wild Fruits. I haven't eaten anything fresh since you captured me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on there,\" Ho-oh said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh dropped some fruits through the opening above the ledge. You initially assumed that the Pokemon would've given something familiar like grapes or at least fruits that look edible. If only things were like that... The fruits are weirdly-shaped and are of varieties you haven't even seen before. <i>Where could Ho-oh possibly get these? Did he just randomly grabbed these from the forest? What if these are poisonous to humans?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh, are you sure I could eat those safely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you find out yourself?\" Ho-oh jabbed, \"I've eaten those all my life with no ill effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the pile of bite-sized fruit on the table with apprehension. The blemished skins didn't help at all and only made them look rather unappetizing. But then, you heard you stomach growl and your throat feels parched. <i>I guess that I can't be a chooser.</i> You took a small bite of the bright pink fruit that resembles an cherry. It's surprisingly sweet and soft. You helped yourself to more of the other fruits, each of them is distinctly sour, bitter, sugary, and even salty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's better than half-digested herbs and grass, I suppose,\" you said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they are. It took me more time to collect those fruit. It'll cost you 7 tokens for those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard another beep from the locator, indicating another transaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finished you're breakfast, you got up and returned to your bedroom. Vaporeon is already awake and sitting on your feathery bed. She looked happy to see her trainer returning to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take Vaporeon with you, human. I have made something for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered the request you made. \"You finished the place you meant for Vaporeon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Just follow the gold line like last time,\" Ho-oh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed the gold line with Vaporeon close behind. This time the light took you to a lower part of Ho-oh's body. You wondered what kind of place did Ho-oh prepared for your Pokemon. The gold line stopped at another sphincter which you opened promptly. You entered a room that contains a fleshy maze about the height of your knee. At the center of the circular maze is a tall tree-like structure consisting of stairs, holes, mini-waterfalls, and ledges. There are metallic poles sticking out around the perimeter with an organic mesh. A door on the ground floor allowed you to explore the interior of the the structure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're inside, you amazed at how opulent Ho-oh made the place. The place is decorated in the regal gold, orange and green of your host. A large circular rug with an ancient pictograph of Ho-oh is laid at the center. There are various furniture like a table, cushions, couch, shelves filled with toys, picture frames with aerial scenery, and even a large television screen displaying what the bird is seeing. There is also a bed similar to yours next to the couch. Right next to the bed are plates containing water and fresh fruits. And to further add to the extravagance, there is a tub that is large enough to fit both you and Vaporeon comfortably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon ran over to the new attractions and gleefully rolled around on the rug. The bird smiled at how happy the human's Pokemon is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for you, it is the ultimate envy; it's has the comfort and luxury of a Secret Base that you maintained. It's something that Ho-oh is very reluctant to provide you with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh, you seem to prefer the company of Vaporeon over me. I know you're still iffy over humans but I think you should be fair here,\" you said with a hint of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She and I are both Pokemons, human,\" he said as matter-of-factly, \"Isn't it obvious to you that I'm going to treat her preferentially?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course I consider that. But this is absolutely favoritism at its worst,\" you retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh only laughed much to your frustration. \"Who said that I only cared for Vaporeon? I also made some arrangements for your free day.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If it weren't because you knew you two were striving to get along you'd suspect the worst. \"What type of arrangements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you don't feel like working and you don't intend to do anything other than walking around I have planned something for you. It's an attempt to make up for what happened a year ago. Take a look at this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pile of membranes you remembered were the equivalent of paper in his body fell in a corner of the place, most of them being maps to arrive to different organs, in case you forgot how. Leaving Vaporeon to enjoy the amenities your host had provided her you picked the sheet at the top. \"Make up to what happened, you say?\" You were reading a list of the many sufferings you had in your first stay inside him, listed by place and what happened in there. It wasn't a long list, but it still made you cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I was at my worst a year ago I have decided to show you my best. The places you see here were all related to your suffering and I want to show you the better side of them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\" The concept of the idea was encouraging but the execution may not be the best. \"There are a few I want to cross out of this list here. I'd be fine with the rest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I have something planned for every place in there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm completely sure. I don't really feel like remembering my traumas\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were going to trust me\" Ho-oh said, being manipulative. \"You won't acknowledge you can trust me if you don't let me show you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I do want to trust you but I don't feel ready for some of these\" <i>And I honestly doubt I ever will. I could think a hundred better ways than revisiting certain places</i>. Ho-oh, realizing you wouldn't accept it, could only sigh. A thin bar of an unknown material fell near to you, so you picked it up and wrote a few words to the side of some items in the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Place - What Happed a Year Ago</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes - Cleaning<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Intestines -Spending the Night/Cleaning</span> <span class=\"cmaroon\">As if you could make something good happen there.</span><br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Surveillance Room - Surveillance</span> I<span class=\"cmaroon\">t's mind-numbing boring to watch screens without anything happening.

Let's pass.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never really noticed that when it was put like that there weren't that many things you did a year ago. It was even shorter because he had made clear you weren't going into his brain and some of the things you had to do had been in there. \"I'm done here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see what you wrote. Aren't you being excessively picky? You crossed off around half of the list\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me for not being enthusiastic about some of the options\" you say with some bitterness, toying with the locator. You hadn't used the shock function for almost a whole day and with some luck you wouldn't need to for another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh understood what your tone meant. \"Okay, I get it. Let's get this over with. Your ungratefulness frustrates me but I won't force you to do anything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Keep that in mind and we'll get along\" you stood up, picking the maps you needed and leaving them aside for reference. \"You lead the way. It's fair, I rejected some so I think you should at least decide the order I should go around\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the way\" a way out of Vaporeon's new home was opened, and after saying goodbye to your Pokemon you walked into the road, wondering where Ho-oh had decided your day should start.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This better not be another one of your pranks, you hear?\" you warned Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my words. No more pranks,\" Ho-oh said, \"If you think otherwise, feel free to use the shocker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more than happy to oblige,\" you grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you moved down the tunnel, you began to imagine what Ho-oh might have in store for you and you aren't exactly excited about them. Although the Pokemon told you that he will show you the best behavior he got, you still find it difficult to take his words at face value. Ho-oh has a peculiar way of defining things and he \"being his best\" would be no exception. <i>I doubt that his good side can last a minute. In fact, even I am getting sick and tired of being so cynical toward Ho-oh. However, changing someone's personality doesn't come easily...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh eventually led you to the eye chamber. When you saw the familiar pair of window-like openings, your mind was taken back to the last time you stepped foot in this place. You were then attempting an escape after being unceremoniously eaten by the Legendary and forced to listen to Ho-oh spew out his anti-human lecture. All while being bound by cords and later forced to wash his filthy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the negative thoughts aside, you examined the chamber. The place looks far more welcoming today. The fleshly walls and floors are gone, replaced with brightly-colored, felt-like surfaces. The surface of the Ho-oh's eyes are crystal clear without any dirt or grime, allowing rays from the morning sun to cast a bright glow to the room. A bronze sculpture of your host stood prominently on a pedestal, one that depicts him in flight. <i>Interesting choice of artwork...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in the middle, there is a large soft cushion chair and a table facing the windows. The sofa felt velvety when you sat and lie down on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about the eye chamber far is a cry from its spartan-like appearance when you first found your way here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyed the walls and spied the many pictures hanging on it. They depicted Ho-oh together with some of his friends in a variety of locations. It struck you as sad as some of those Pokemons might have broke off with Ho-oh after his nefarious deeds were revealed. When you saw the smiles Ho-oh shared with the other Legendaries in the photos, you wondered if Ho-oh truly deserved to be punished so severely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a piece of translucent paper is placed on the table together with a large glass of fizzling drink:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><br>\r\n\"Welcome to the New Eye Chamber!\" A complimentary glass of my best alcoholic drink. Try it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I hope you like the huge upgrade I made to the place. Once again, I truly want to make up for how I treated you. Let's start amending...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust sit back and enjoy the ride :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Ho-oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set aside the piece of paper and took a sip of the drink. It's refreshing and sweet with a mild aroma of alcohol that isn't too over-powering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax a bit while I plan out where else I can take you,\" Ho-oh said before he flew higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat and stared absentmindedly at the clouds and counted the banks and turns that Ho-oh made in his flight. In parts where the clouds parted, islands and cities resembled miniature model several thousands feet above ground. The other time you were this high up was on a plane flight from Kanto to Hoenn. But compared to the teeny portal while you're stuck in the metal fuselage, Ho-oh's eye chamber offered a far larger and majestic view. The fact that you have a comfy seat all to yourself also helped. The leisurely gliding made it all the more enjoyable. Eyeing the earth beneath, you have to admit that the world looks beautiful from this high up; it gave you a sense of power and dominance like you never felt before. For a brief moment, you imagined yourself having sovereignty over everything below you; you had the world at your whim. It's perhaps that same feeling that influenced your host's personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to believe that it was a year ago when we first met,\" you recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting a little nostalgic already? I left quite the impression in you\" Ho-oh grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. You were giving me that cheesy lecture about humans being a pain in your rear at this very place. I wouldn't call that good memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is for me,\" the Pokemon said, \"I still remember the look on your face when you were tied down. Hahaha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we not mention that again,\" you groaned, \"I want to forget that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit, I went overboard. But my points still stands and you, my friend, are the living proof of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a product of your misguided mind and an overgeneralization of all humans,\" you replied curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misguided? I think the same can be said about you, human. You're attempting to reform a thousand years-old (ex-)Legendary that treated you more like dirt, acted like a smartass, and just being plain obnoxious to you. Attempting to fix someone you don't really trust at all, I'd say that's insanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed at the remark. \"Touch\u00e9. Maybe reforming you is too much to ask of me. But it's worth the try to get you to at least like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down and studied the map Ho oh gave you. There are more places and labels but they're mostly generic rooms. One of them, however, caught your attention. It's a room in Ho-oh's brain labeled \"The Suite\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that over here?\" You said while tapping on the location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best room I got in my body. But you're still far from going there. That's where you'll live once you have my complete trust. And by current progress, it's still a long shot. Say, since you literally crossed off half of the choices I gave you. Would you like me to show you some other places that you haven't been to before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What other places could you possibly have? Another strange organ designed to irritate the heck out of me? I'm unconvinced that you might have more places worth showing,\" you said while gazing out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that as if you aren't already annoyed about my body. No need for me to add more salt to your pessimism. Unless...of course, you have a penchant for being played with. I would gladly accommodate you,\" Ho-oh beamed mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave the shock button on your locator a light tap and heard Ho-oh gave an feminine squeal. His whole body shuddered from the quick jolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...,\" Ho-oh screeched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough Ho-oh!\" you jested,  \"You should learn to tame that smug beak. Could you please tell me where you plan on taking me next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you saw one of Ho-oh's wing come into view in the eye windows and playfully gave you a poor imitation of obscene human gestures with his primary feathers. <i>Pfft, you're even doing it wrong, birdbrain.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmpph, that really discourteous, human. Do you even have a sense of humor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely not your type, Ho-oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine....I'll take you to the Shopping Arcade. Come along,\" the Pokemon said docilely <i>This feels weird but I'm liking this guy more and more. Maybe it's time for some pleasant surprises to kickstart our bonding.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vaporeon's new home hadn't given you any hopes of being treated correctly but Ho-oh was actually showing a will to treat you well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to give credit where it's due: this could work. It may not be today or tomorrow, but looks like you and him could be friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh led you through his winding innards until you got to a long organ. When you stepped in you felt yourself sinking up to your ankles, the floor was some kind of extremely soft rug. You waddled through the rug until you got to the nearest furniture, which seemed to be a cash register. \"I suppose nothing in here will be free\" you said, poking the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course nothing is free! This is the Shopping Arcade, not the Take-All-You-Want Arcade\" Ho-oh replied to you \"Besides you have enough tokens to spend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\" That had some logic. You had to admit he was right. You walked the best you could to the baskets and shelves filled to the brim with objects \"So, what do you have in here you think I'd like? I'm not picky so if you have anything feel free to tell me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it not enough to see the wide variety I have in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's impressive, but surely there must be something you specialize in, something nobody else would be able to replicate. Even if I can't buy it at least it should be nice to see the best object you have in here\" It was more a challenge than anything else. You wanted to see what was the best thing Ho-oh could create and judging by the bragging that came shortly after that your host understood what you meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling of the Shopping Arcade lighted up, pointing you to the back of the store. While you walked you noticed the first section, the one nearest to the entrance, was the most common stuff. There were practical objects, normally seen for everyday life. Clothes, mostly. Since the ones you were wearing were starting to tear you made a mental note to buy some of Ho-oh's products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the furniture, as expected most of them with avian features. Wings and feathers were the prominent elements and although you weren't a person big on decoration you had to admit you wanted a couple of those. However when you took a look at the prices you had to forget that. You weren't going to pilfer your hard-earned tokens on that unless you wanted to eat grass for six months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the most expensive stuff, mostly art. Ho-oh seemed pretty good at sculpting, specially with gold. You remembered that he had some sort of foundry somewhere, you had been there once, but you had never really been able to see what he could do with that. You didn't even bother to check the price because you didn't want to feel just how little money you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I wonder, what's up with Pokemon having stores inside them? Who buys these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't keep them inside us forever. Sending and receiving stuff is normal for us, you wouldn't understand how it works\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even understand how you create them\" you shrugged. That was a good explanation as any. You supposed after it was paid they enlarged the stuff or something, unless they liked to play interior decorators inside their own bodies. It wasn't any of your business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally got to what seemed the exact middle of this place. Right there, hanging on the wall, you could see what definitely fit as Ho-oh's best and most impressive object. It was an extraordinarily long woven picture, made of minuscule threads. In it was depicted Ho-oh in flight, practically everything in Johto under him. Above there were constellations you didn't recognize. It was overall a beautiful work of art. \"You did this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was a gift to me, long ago. We don't squander in lavish gifts when there's a special occasion for that, surely unlike you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know nothing about my gift giving habits. I suppose there's a story behind who gave you this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is but you won't be hearing it. It's private\" Just like you expected \"But since you're in this part I may as well show you the main reason why I brought you here. Keep going, it's just a little further than this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see nearby that it was called a Shopping Arcade in every way of the word. There were machines, surely they were games for you to play. \"What about those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to challenge you. Each game costs a token per play, but that shouldn't be a problem for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for telling me, but what challenge is this? See who is the best in these games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not to play against each other? There's nothing for you to do and I'm so good I can fly and play at the same time. I could even do another dozen things meanwhile\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you want is to give me a defeat in those games of yours. Something likely to happen since you have more experience and all\" Although your words seemed like you were annoyed your tone was more amused than anything else. It was a nice enough way to pass the time, besides a friendly competition between you two should help bonding. You reckoned this was a very accurate way to get you to do something with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll accept, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will. Bring it on\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ho-oh willed another representation to materialize in front of you. Bright flashes and dazzling colors materialized before your eyes. You stood by as you looked as the details of the figure gradually took form. When the process is completed, it looked markedly different from his first representation. Instead of the avian body shape you're so used to, Ho-oh made himself more human-like. His new form is slightly taller than you complete with human hands and feet. His body is still covered in a thin layer of fur while his fingernails are green with white tips. The bird's head remained the same as his original one. Ho-oh wore a long sleeved shirt and a pair of dark blue pants and sport shoes. To add even more authenticity, Ho-oh has a belt with a Pokedex and Pokeball holder clipped on. But you think that the accessories are merely decorative. Top down, Ho-oh looks like any trendy trainers you might meet from the city. The Pokemon gave you a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" Ho-oh said confidently, \"It's time for some friendly competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that as if you're ever going to play fair, Ho-oh,\" you rolled your eyes, \"You've got a home advantage over me and you want me to trust that you won't rig the game in your favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll play fair as long as you also do so pal,\" Ho-oh replied, \"Won't you trust the new and improved Ho-oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not enough to believe that you will be honest. You're will find ways to make me do stupid things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not my problem them,\" the humanoid bird shrugged and gave you a pat on your back, \"Alright then. Suit yourself. But you're forfeiting some really grand prizes I got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More souvenir stuffs I don't need,\" you said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It's something better. But you'll have to win me to find out. A hint though, it's a new privilege for you,\" Ho-oh beamed gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still wonder why I decided to put up with your game,\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh walked toward the arcade without looking back toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ho-oh head over to several roles of arcade consoles with names like \"Whack a Lugia!\", \"Airborne Wings\", \"Pokemon Battles\" and even \"Legend of Ho-oh\". Other games are mostly those that you would find in a fun park. Obviously, most of the games aren't anything original or innovative as they are more of an imitation of various well-known games. <i>This should be easy</i>, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's start playing!\" Ho-oh smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ho-oh started your duel by playing on the \"Whack a Lugia!\" The mechanism of the game is identical to it's real word counterpart, only replacing the Digletts with poorly-designed Lugia's head. It felt a little strange every time you lowered the foam hammer wherever the head pops up. Ho-oh must've made this game as a sort of 'take that' at his nemesis. His opinion of her apparently hasn't improved with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt left you to wonder if you will ever be allowed to contact Lugia or Floatzel. You wanted to tell them that you are with Ho-oh and that he is treating you well so far. Ho-oh won't permit that. At least, not at this time. But knowing Lugia, IF Ho-oh somehow allowed you to use the Pokenet to call her, it is likely that she will overreact and fly straight into Ho-oh's face and confront him at the worst possible time. That's not the outcome you want. Ho-oh and you are just getting along better now and you don't want to destroy this budding friendship. <i>Perhaps it is best to wait a little while. Maybe, he will open up a little about his feud with Lugia.</i><br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of playing through the flight simulator and a well-designed Pokemon fighting game, you and Ho-oh have tied. You spent about 20 tokens on these games including paying for Ho-oh's round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, human,\" the humanoid bird said, \"It's been a long time since I came across such opponent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of the games you have here, I've aced them a long time ago,\" you put bluntly, \"But we're still tied so that obviously mean no prize for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. But I'm about to offer you a way to win possibly win this competition and also earn some extra tokens.\"<br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh led you over across several rows of slot machines. The sight brought back memory of an news report you seen on TV about the replacement of the Game Corner. The move was controversial. Its slot machines used to be one of the must-see sights of Goldenrod City until it's was decided to replace them with a less engaging game of Voltrob Flip. The city explained need to cleanse the city of its tarnished image of being a place for excessive gambling. Team Rocket and their hijacking of the radio tower didn't help either. In your opinion, the city lost its soul the day the Game Corner closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Ho-oh, these reminds me that there's no more slot machines left in Goldenrod,\" you said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about that from a Pokenet conversation too. It's bad enough you humans always find ways to ruin your entertainments. Goldenrod doesn't feel the same without a Game Corner. A sad loss indeed,\" the bird shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But nothing can be done about that now. It's now all about Voltrob Flip in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Ho-oh asked inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the game is a flip card game that depends completely luck. And it's notorious for giving out very few wins,\" you explained, \"I'd like to think of the change as a conspiracy by the city to bilk more money out of the tourists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, these slot machines are not exactly the same as real world versions are. Guaranteed to get you addicted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, I'm not much of a risk taker though. And addiction to slot machines isn't rally healthy. I don't want to lose any more of my hard-earned tokens on these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,\" Ho-oh looked at you with a 'faked' hurt expression, \"Just play a few rounds with me and I'll be happy. Isn't that the whole point of gambling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought gambling is more of a human thing?\" you said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said so?\" Ho-oh frowned, \"Pokemons are just as likely as you to make bets. I used to play these games with my other friends...or former friends in this case. We did some gambling but we mostly bet on goods like those in my shop,\" Ho-oh waved his hands around the mall arcade, \"But be prepared, when it comes to slot machines, I consider myself an ace. Wanna try your luck, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not? I want to see if you really live up to that moniker. Slot machines are a game of luck too. This better be good,\" you smiled widely which made Ho-oh flinch for a second.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The slot machines made you nervous. The good thing is that it took a few minutes for you to consider them being rigged on your host's favor. In a sense that was progress, the possibility didn't jump to your mind as soon as you saw them. You thought of that as once another sign you were trusting Ho-oh more than you considered possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way that was a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say in front of the machines while Ho-oh went to a different one. \"So, how will we do this?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play for a max of five minutes. The one who earns the most tokens wins\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even have tokens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I provide them. I technically have infinite tokens, remember?\" That made sense, although now you didn't take very well how you had to pay for his rounds in the other games. You were given a bunch of stones that represented the tokens you had earned so far. You took one and inserted it in the machine, earning a game. Ho-oh was already playing several rounds, managing to win one. The cascade of stones clanked against the floor. \"I'm already doing great here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you\" you pulled from the lever and watched the slots spin until they all showed a drawing of an X. A complete loss of a single token. It wasn't too much but you at least felt the thrill of seeing how the slot machines worked. It wasn't long before you started putting in several tokens at once, hoping for a big prize. Each time you lost you felt a growing frustration while Ho-oh kept racking in some victories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you were losing. When there was only one minute left you decided to take a risk. \"I'm going all in\" you said aloud, hoping it'd work. Ho-oh turned his head around and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? I'll do the same, then. I'm in a lucky strike right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had worked. Ho-oh wouldn't resist triumphing over you specially if you were doing something unusual. Both of you placed all your remaining tokens in the machine and pulled the lever. Much to your surprise you finally got lucky in the sense it wasn't a complete loss like all rounds before! And much to your annoyance you only recovered half of the tokens you had at the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peered at Ho-oh's slot machine to see his result. It was the same result than yours but since he had placed much more tokens than you his halved result was bigger than yours. He had won. \"I knew I would win! Told you I was an ace, human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just good luck\" you grouched \"If it had been a different type of game I would have won\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did I just win our little competition? This was the tiebreaker and I won. Anybody would have seen it coming!\" he was enormously pleased by his victory over you. You were willing to concede defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was the big prize? What did I just narrowly miss obtaining?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll tell you but first take this\" Ho-oh took some of his tokens and gave them to you. It was enough to cover all your expenses of the day and a bit more than that. You were surprised by his sudden generosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet because it's time for my prize. The truth is that I didn't plan so ahead. I had prepared something for when you won but I hadn't fully thought about a prize for myself\" he admitted but then his face lighted up. The human representation he had created vanished in thin air, you blinked and looked around. \"I got it. I know what my prize is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why doesn't that fill me with comfort\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't make you do anything against your will but the least you could do would be to accept what I want to do next\" he said, his voice taking the more familiar condescending tone you were familiar with. \"It's fair. We competed and you lost. You won't try to get away of this, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would have been great if I had known what losing entailed\" you argued but Ho-oh didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. Give me a bit of trust and just go in this tunnel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay but I'd feel more comfortable knowing what I was getting into\" you sighed and entered the new path. You had the feeling you were deviating from the making amends plan Ho-oh had at the beginning of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to do something I have wanted to do since a year ago: you're going to learn to respect me. You'll know all the amazing things I have done and see I'm nobody to trifle with. After this I'm sure you'll respect me and won't dare to even go against anything I say. That'll be my prize, your complete and undeniable admiration towards me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was much better than you had expected. You were mildly curious, you had to admit it. You continued without saying another word but you were wondering something: Ho-oh wasn't going to let you go to his brain so watching memories was not an option. How will he show you anything?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you walk in the tunnel, you imagined Ho-oh having the biggest smile on his face right now, thinking of the ways he will make you unquestionably admire him and mentally cringed at the ego-stroking that might be going through his head. You admittedly understood little about his background and wanted to know more about your host. But Ho-oh isn't making it an easy task. The way the bird put it didn't give you much assurance that his plan won't end with you in some sort of submissive position. Additionally, Ho-oh mentioned that this was an idea that he has planned since last year so it made you nervous even to think about what his original intention of respect might entail. He loved to dictate things on his terms, conditions which he could easily change in a split second. Fortunately, the Pokemon should have tamed his plan now that relations have warmed up. Should he try something naughty, the threat of more punishment from Arceus should deter that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ho-oh sure loves playing with me for his pleasure and loving every minute.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally arrived at your destination when the passage open into a large hallway with vaulted ceilings. The new surrounding gave you the impression that you entered some grand throne halls. There is only the echo of your footstep as you entered the immense chamber. The ornamentation on the ceiling and pillars are beautifully crafted with stones of all sorts colors. Their polished surface gleamed in the light given off by the walls. You walked on a long orange carpet that seems to be set out for you toward the other side. Hung upon the crystal-like walls are larger than life murals depicting Ho-oh in various settings. There are at least a dozen of those large murals in this long hall. Although you are no exactly well-versed in arts, there was a certain quality that makes them very pleasing to look at. The scene portrayed are mostly important events in Ho-oh's life and his numerous supposed achievement. The first one you laid your eyes on showed a young Ho-oh emerging from a golden egg in the midst of volcanoes and storms. Another depicts Ho-oh gliding into the sunset with a rainbow trail behind him. One notable one depicts Ho-oh glowing with a warm golden aura while surrounded by other Pokemon revering his presence. He was the former representation of the sky after all. The murals are a very propaganda-like display that reminds you of what a narcissist Ho-oh can be. Heroic, just, majestic, and benevolent.... just how the bird perceived himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your time to immerse yourself in the likely stories behind each of the scenes and thought about what to ask the Pokemon once you get the chance. But you know that it'll be mostly half-truths and a load of distortions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the hall is a circular lobby with none other than another life-sized Ho-oh standing there with a welcoming gesture. His face is plastered with the same cryptic smile he gave you at the Game Arcade. His eyes glinted with both excitement and mischief as you approached him. You noticed the tall golden carved pillars that supported this antechamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, human. Welcome to my rather magnificent hall,\" Ho-oh boasts in a showy tone, \"It is about time for me to share with you the fact of how amazing I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly is this place?\" you asked skeptically, \"Is it another one of your illusions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, human. You're about to find out,\" Ho-oh replied as he spread his wings to emphasize himself, \"Since you lost the game, I want you to learn truly how great I can be and I think the best place to start is this shrine that I dedicated to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like I need more of your tricks to know how \"great and powerful\" you are,\" you jabbed while examining the hard floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh suddenly stopped and looked straight at you with a perplexed expression. For a moment, it looked like he was about to make a snarky remark but held back and composed himself at the last moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww...no need to be such a cranky person,\" Ho-oh said with fake sadness, \"We're just starting to get along so well. You're not letting my goodwill go down the drain, are you? We're friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not exactly there yet. Until you tell me what exactly you're doing, I'll err on the side of caution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's put it this way. I always wanted you to play a little game with me. Role play is perhaps a better word,\" the Pokemon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Role play?\" you asked with a raise eyebrow. Fear slowly crept through your mind that Ho-oh will do something bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the kind you think of and in no way will you be harmed,\" Ho-oh added, \"It's a fun one that I thought up while you were one your way here. The basic outline is that I'll play an all powerful god and you'll be my loyal follower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word 'follower' made you wince. <i>That doesn't sound good.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I get to be on the short end of the stick, again....Nice! Not much different from our current situation,\" you commented derisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, human, that's where things get interesting,\" Ho-oh added enigmatically, \"This role play would be a little different and much more exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine me with the power of Lord Arceus and learning about all the secret I hold; doing exactly as I instructed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh only looked at you, expecting your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you know what you're doing,\" you said cautiously, \"I bet Arceus won't be too amused when He finds out that you're making a mockery of Him. Whether intended or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, He's not as wrathful as your mythologies made Him to be. Arceus has some sense of humor so He'll have to deal with my little game. If not, what else can he take from me? There's a lot more important things on his plate than a powerless ex-Legendary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready, human. From this point on, you will address me as Lord Ho-oh. I'll take you on a tour through my shrine, by the end of it, you'll most definitely worship and respect me. You'll see why I'm the bringer of the rays, the holder of hope! Hahaha...come along!\" Ho-oh boasted egotistically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon took off and led you deeper into the hall. You have a strangely curious yet scared feeling as he led you through the first set of doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\"><i>This is where the fun begins....</i></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Ho-oh said he had made a shrine dedicated to himself you expected around a dozen rooms and halls dedicated to himself. The lobby you just left, with the paintings and what not, you chalked it up to a very good demonstration of what the rest of the shrine would be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was exactly like you thought it'd be. Opulent, full of stuff you wouldn't see anywhere else, and designed with the sole function of stroking Ho-oh's already inflated ego. It wasn't the kind of place you really wanted to be in, but you had lost the bet so there was nothing else to do other than accepting you had to deal with this session of praising your host. You just hoped it wouldn't last too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big is this shrine?\" you asked. Ho-oh ignored you without subtlety, turning his head upwards in the most snotty gesture you had seen in your life \"...lord Ho-oh?\" you completed. Ho-oh didn't move but at least decided you had addressed him well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This shrine is so large and filled with so many marvels about me you wouldn't be done within a day. Be thankful I'm guiding you personally\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made sure not to roll your eyes. \"Thank you for your benevolence and consideration, Lord Ho-oh\" As long as you didn't have to see him lying around ordering you to feed him grapes you didn't have that much of a problem with the shrine tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you decided it was a good time to see where exactly you were. It had taken a lot of willpower to not to draw your eyes towards the absolutely massive gold statue in the center of the room. It was several times bigger than the representation of Ho-oh you had to your side, you could easily rest on its head and roll around without dangers of falling down. The statue was in clear position of flying, rainbow trails of strange materials hanging from the feathers of its tail. \"Well that's not very subtle\" you comment, immediately receiving a glare \"...Lord Ho-oh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Ho-oh what\" it seemed he wanted to hear more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Ho-oh, bringer of the rays\" you borrowed his own words from just a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speech that followed to that could be summarized in a few words: 'Ho-oh brings the sun to the world'. It was interesting and instructive in some ways, though. You sincerely listened and tried to match what he was saying to the legends and stories you had heard. While Ho-oh's speech was obviously embellished to give himself a prominent role most of the moments and scenes had some sort of equivalent in human lore. It was a bit strange, somehow, maybe because the chances of Ho-oh's bragging could have a real basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that, human? Do you feel appropriately awed now?\" he asks at the end. You give some exaggerated bows, playing the part of the worshipper almost flawlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was truly enlightening, Lord Ho-oh, bringer of the rays\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bringer of the rays and what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. Seems like you had to add something else. You once again borrow his own words. \"Lord Ho-oh, bringer of the rays and holder of hope\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. It was about time I heard such words coming from your mouth, human. Follow me!\" The room branched into several adjacent hallways, each of them leading to some sort of time in Ho-oh's life. It was impossible he had done amazing stuff so often, chances were he stretched the meaning of the word 'amazing' several times. You of course didn't say that out loud while you walked through the overly decorated hall, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room at the end was painted like the peak of a mountain, a model of some weird ruins were situated in a corner. \"I roosted on the peak of Mt. Silver for a century. Humans wondered where I had gone and why I had taken the sun with me, and it served them right! Without my guidance crops were doomed to not to perform as well, their days were gloomy and the Pok\u00e9mon were unrested until I finally decided it was time to return\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you come here, Lord Ho-oh...bringer of the rays and holder of hope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he serious? \"And reincarnation of the sun\" There. Grandiose and flowery, just like he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I came to this mountain to meditate on what kind of favors the world desrved from me. I weighed the offerings, the work I had done for everybody, and decided what I'd do for the next thousand years\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human tales did mention Ho-oh had been gone for long but not much had changed during that time. You didn't say that, deciding to save it for a moment you were truly pissed off. That would hurt his ego real bad. \"Amazing, Lord Ho-oh. What are those ruins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans built those ruins to commemorate my hundred years long stay on the summit of the mountain. It was a monument to the need to keep me happy and comfortable. Shame nobody learned the lesson after that because when I came back nobody made the festivals and special days I expected there to exist\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he had always been a pampered brat. How old was he, again? A few dozen thousand years old? \"And it was truly a shame\" you bow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done well so far, human. Follow me, as my shrine extends to the confines of my body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was new. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This shrine's size is indescribable. To give a place to everything I have created, everything to commemorate my life, I had to create a vast net of hallways and chambers throughout my body. There's hardly a place where you wouldn't find a way into my shrine\" That was no good. Surely he didn't expect you to see absolutely everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Ho-oh, bringer of you know all that, I don't think my measly human legs will resist such a walk. May I see the rest by my own leisure later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh wasn't happy for that, the scowl in his face showed it, but he knew you had a point. \"Fine! I'll accept that, but for now allow me to take some of the tokens I gave you before coming here\" Well that wasn't so bad. You had a nice amount left \"I do hope you learned something about my marvelous life, even if it was only two places. Do you admire me yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must at least admit you have some amazing moments\" you said and it was true. You made sure those words were as sweet and sincere as possible to appease him, and it seemed like it worked. His feathers fluffed up in pride while he pointed at a hallway. \"This path here will lead you out of my shrine, where you'll be able to continue with your day. There are places yet to visit, if that's what you want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, this shrine and the arcade don't count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...fine, they do. What will you do now, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go find some place to relax for now. If any of them is connected somehow to your ways to compensate me for what happened a year ago then even better, so...please tell me where to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh thought for a moment. \"As soon as you're out go to the right. You'll know when you arrive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obeyed, leaving the shrine and going where he had told you to go to. What you found was a dock and a boat, bobbling leisurely on the surface of some sort of liquid resembling water. \"What's this, Ho-oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour host's voice reverberated around. \"This tunnel will allow you to travel through my body while you relax. Sit or lay down and enjoy the feeling of being carried at my body's pace\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded nice enough, at least you'd rest. You got on the boat, pushing it away from the dock. \"So what's this, part of your circulatory system?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that. Just because I'm a Fire type doesn't mean there isn't any water inside me, human! I think you'd know about that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know more than I need to know about your bodily fluids, thank you. I'll just...rest here for a while and let me take me wherever it will go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes, relaxing and feeling the boat glide smoothly on the surface of the water. What you didn't know was that you were on the mercy of Ho-oh. He could redirect your boat anywhere he wanted. If you had known that you wouldn't have let yourself to doze off. Ho-oh didn't seem to harbor any ill intentions, though, but he wasn't going to let a chance like this pass.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You kicked back your legs let the boat carry you on toward wherever Ho-oh please. Having seen so much impossible features within this Pokemon, you are no longer surprised by the sight of this water tunnel. The thoughts of relaxing is constantly beset by the fear that Ho-oh would prank you somehow. But you tried your best to push those thought aside and focus on all the positive things that might come ahead. With your eyes closed, you listened to the sound of the stream as it rippled against your ride, gently taking you to your host's choice of destination. It's a soothing sound that recalls a previous kayaking trip at the river near you home you enjoyed with Vaporeon. Speaking of which, you wondered what Vaporeon is doing right now. You picture your favorite Pokemon lounging on that plush bed Ho-oh made for her with a satisfied expression as she slept quietly.<i> Lucky her... I hope she is having a good time.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minute's rest, you sat up and find that you are still drifting along the river. You noticed that there seems to be more piers installed along the waterway in this area as your boat went past them. The signposts you saw on the dock include \"Lungs\", \"Foundry\", \"Healing Zone\", \"Game Corner\", \"Eye Chamber\", \"Pleasure Stimulation\" and some unmarked ones. <i>Where could those nameless tunnels lead?</i>, you thought. Presumably, one of those could take you to the brain where you could locate the Communicator to contact Floatzel or Lugia. You badly wanted to get in touch again with your friend but it will be difficult to persuade your host to allow that. Speaking of which, how long have you been inside Ho-oh? <i>Was it a few days or has weeks gone by? Has Lugia realized that something is wrong at this point? I have to speak with her or Floatzel as soon as it's possible. I don't want her jumping to wrong conclusions and making mistakes.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe boat eventually docked at the destination of Ho-oh's choice that looks similar to the one where you set sail. The sign here says \"The Serenity Pavilion\". The name has a mystifying vibe for a room and it doesn't sound like a body organ or some egotistical gimmick like the shrine. You stepped out of your boat onto the dock and entered the tunnel, fully curious about the new place. On the other side of the tunnel, you witnessed a landscape that is almost dream-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed about the place is the warm wind and the fragrant smell of fresh grass. The dullness of Ho-oh's labyrinthine interior is replaced with a valley dotted with waves of vermilion and yellow flower that stretches as far you could see. Impressive snow-capped mountains towered over you on all sides. The huge behemoths looked purple as they rose from the mist that seems to cling to the horizon. Fogs danced around the mountain peaks while sifting through the ridges like a piece of silken scarf. A couple of feet below the ledge you're standing on is a small lake that is so wave-less that it reflected the mountains and the sky like glass. You see the sun among tufts of clouds that cast mottled shadows on the entire valley as they sailed eastward. Besides the organic tunnel you emerged from, there is no other discernible signs that this is all within Ho-oh's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so taken by the beauty of this valley. It's difficult to equate this serene and meditative place with the boisterous Ho-oh. You are tempted to find a rock, sit down, and just absorb the sight and ponder the meaning of life, things....the universe. But you decided to keep exploring the valley, following the dirt path that was cut into the ground. There has to be a reason that Ho-oh got you here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this place seems familiar to you. Was it a novel you read, a painting you've seen, a vivid dream, or your mind playing tricks on you? Isn't this called called d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? The weird feeling of familiarity of a decidedly foreign situation. There is just something about this place that you can't put your finger on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trekked for half an hour through the meadow until you reached the foot of another hill. There is a stone stair leads up the grassy valley and into a grove of pine trees on the top. The steps looked ancient and well-worn as if countless climbers have tread upon them for centuries. It was the only thing that looks human-made in this otherwise pristine valley. You slowly walked up the stairs, curious to see what is in the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the path where the trees cleared apart, you find yourself at the edge of a cliff that gave you an excellent panorama of the whole land. It is here that you truly saw the scale of the meadow you walked through. The dirt path that took you to this clearing resembles a thin thread from this vantage, disappearing into the horizon.  A large pavilion sits at the center of the clearing. The white stones used to built the smooth polished pillars and dome seemed to glow in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Ho-oh's large form in the pavilion looking out at the scenery, likely waiting for your arrival. As you made your way to the stairs leading up to the elevated floor, the bird turned around and saw you coming toward him. His wings are folded neatly to his side while his talons are perched on a thick beam of wood. Ho-oh's expression isn't the usual prideful and boastful one he likes to wear. Instead, his ruby eyes seem to radiate an uncharacteristic calm that surprises you. For the first time, you could say that Ho-oh looked thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, human. I'm so glad that you could join me,\" the bird greeted calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly joined Ho-oh by sitting down beside him. To your surprise, the Pokemon suddenly extended one of his multi-spectral wings and placed it to your side to shield you from the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" you asked as you take in more of the sight around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a place for relaxation of course,\" Ho-oh said, \"You said that you wanted someplace to relax so I decided share with you my private meditation spot where no one besides myself have entered before. Whenever I'm feeling down or in turmoil, I always revisit this place to restore my peace of mind. It's only a small recreation of my favorite place and all of my memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon finished the last sentence with a small sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that there could be more to the story to decided to push a little further, \"Could you tell me more, if you don't mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This valley has special meaning to me. It no longer look like this presently,\" Ho-oh said with a tinge of sadness, \"This is Johto about 3000 years ago. It's also where I was hatched grew up, I missed this place so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohto....three thousands years ago? Now you realized why the place looked so familiar. The distinctive peak of Mt. Silver can be seen in the distance amid the other mountains. The absence of Ecruteak City and the Bell Tower made the location barely recognizable. Moreover, did Ho-oh said something about growing up here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2000 years later, humans began to settle in this valley and built settlements,\" the Pokemon continued, \"They've caught glimpse of me form and assumed that I was some form of sun deity and thus began their worship with me. The humans see me as a protector, a bringer of the Sun and prayed to me in shrines, asking for my \"divine guidance.\" Over time, as more people came to this valley, the villages became towns and eventually into cities. The development changed the sight of the valley. Grasslands became roads and houses while the mountains were mined for their minerals. To the humans, they have successfully developed the land and made it prosperous. To me, I was losing a piece of my home....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been here for almost three millennia. That's an eternity for a human but likely a slow day for you. A lot must have happened since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. But most of them are not very important or relevant to you,\" Ho-oh nonchalantly shrugged off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ho-oh. There has to something that you could share with me,\" you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... what could possibly interest such a curious human?\" he pondered while putting his wing to his beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about asking Ho-oh about his rivalry with Lugia. This might be a chance for you to understand the source of their conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a suggestion: can you please tell me more about your time...with....Lugia?\" you hesitated a little at mentioning her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh looked at you and narrowed his eyes. \"What do you want to know about her?\" the bird asked in a firmer voice, \"You know full well that I do not like you mentioning 'that' Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is a sensitive topic for you, Ho-oh. There seemed to be some sort of frictions between you two. Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh briefly gritted his beak but quickly controlled himself. He lowered his head to your eye-level and focused on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what happened...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It takes you all of your willpower to not to look away when Ho-oh stares directly at your eyes. Your first instinct is to throw yourself at the stone floor of the pavilion and beg him to not to break your spine for your insolent curiosity, but you manage to resist the allure of such cowardly action. Instead you gulp and look back, seeing your reflection in his crimson eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First than all you must promise not to tell her what I'm going to say. She will think it's not important but it is\" he said quite clearly. To you that sounded more like what he was going to tell you was petty or minor. You decided to wait until he actually told you before doing such hasty judgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. What do you know about our legends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was an easy question. Legendary Pokemon weren't held with the same reverence people in the past had but their legends continued being an important part of any region's folklore. You knew a lot but you chose to simplify everything. \"I know you two are guardians of different realms. You belong to the skies, and she belongs to the oceans. You two also lived in the towers in Ecruteak City, I think\" Ho-oh nodded energetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, but your legends are also greatly flawed. We didn't live in the towers, those were monuments in our honor. Mine was the Bell Tower, hers was the Brass Tower. That is very important. What happened to the towers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bell Tower is fine and standing, but the Brass Tower is badly burned\" You knew that too because while you were passing through Ecruteak you took the time to see the Burned Tower, at least from afar. You wanted to see the structure that kept strong even after the devastating events long enough. You doubted the embellished stories were completely true, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the Brass Tower burned we both were near the town. We both saw it burn and she did <i>absolutely nothing</i> to save it. She could have easily doused the fire off but instead she had the gall to suggest <i>I</i> had anything to do with that. I'm a Fire Pokemon but that doesn't mean I can do something like get rid of the fire itself. I could have tried to use my wings to extinguish the fire with wind but that would have toppled the tower. I told her all that but she continued insisting it was my fault and that I should deal with it. Before I could continue she outright <i>left</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat story definitely didn't paint Lugia in a favorable light. At any other moment you would have supposed this would have the usual warping of events to make Ho-oh look better than he actually did, but something in his tone convinced you he wasn't doing such thing right now. He was talking in such a passionate and angry way you doubted he was faking anything of what he was saying. The more he talked the more frustrated his body language was, his wings doing gestures of exasperation. You inched away a bit to avoid getting hit by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh continued. \"And because of her stubbornness three innocent Pokemon died. She left them to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she know they were there?\" you interrupted, wanting to hold onto something that could at least make Lugia look a bit better to your eyes. Ho-oh stopped his gestures for a moment, thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't think she knew. Does it matter?! If she had bothered to protect her tower they wouldn't have died in the first place. Of course I took responsibility of them and did my best to revive them. Three new legendaries were born that day and it's all because of <i>me</i>\" The usual arrogance you had come to expect from him was back for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was...much worse than I was expecting\" you said quietly. The thought of Lugia acting like that confused you, it didn't fit at all the image you had of her. Chances are this had happened quite some time ago. Anybody can change in hundreds and thousands of years. It was likely Lugia regretted having acted like that. In fact, you were convinced she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomebody who hadn't changed from those times wouldn't have saved you when you were shrunken a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides who does she think she is? She doesn't even seem to take her duties seriously! When is the last time she really was the guardian of the oceans? You met her in the <i>forest</i>, for crying out loud! I bet she was lazing around instead of actually doing what she's supposed to be doing\" You had to admit he had a point there. Lugia had briefly gone underwater but that was only after you had escaped from Ho-oh. From all the time you knew her that was the only time you saw her anywhere in contact with the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you two seem to dislike each other. Huh\" you murmured. In a way you were glad to hear the backstory. It let you understand everything a bit better, even if it was a disappointment in terms of how Lugia behaved in the past. But now, well, Ho-oh seemed a bit more justified. \"Hey, so when you encountered her a year ago, when she had me with her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh looked away. \"Yes, I got in the way to mess with her. I keep grudges alive, alright? And then she tells me she has a tiny human with her. I wanted to demand her to tell me just what was she thinking, hosting a human in her body, but I knew she wouldn't let you go. So I did what I thought was right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he thought was right was imprisoning you in his own body, apparently. That made you grit your teeth. \"That was not good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already apologized for that, look all that happened because of what I did. You don't have to remind me it was not good!\" he shouted, glaring at you. Whooops, that hadn't been a good idea. Thankfully Ho-oh backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a moment. You decide to break it with a tentative effort to cheer him up. \"You know, you may not keep grudges as well as you think. I'd be dead if that really mattered to you that much\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really would be dead\" he agreed \"That's all I have to say about Lugia. Happy now?2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...to be honest, yeah, that was...informative\" you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'm kind of glad I told you, maybe now you won't pester me about her again. Forget about her and focus on what you, um-\" he shook his head, correcting his words \"What we must do. I'm not a Legendary again yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we still need to work on that. Don't worry, the moment will come. Besides I think this is progress, right? Friends talk to each other\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, it is progress\" Ho-oh stood at the edge of the pavilion \"I'm leaving. Go find the exit on your own. If you ever want to come back tell me and I'll guide you. Good night\" and after that he flew away, leaving you alone in the pavilion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your opinion this didn't really make you feel better about the possibility of Lugia realizing Ho-oh had you with him. Chances were that it was going to get worse than you expected, but now you felt a sense of loyalty towards Ho-oh. You did want to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were you supposed to do, then? How to deal with Lugia? To be honest letting Ho-oh stop her if she ever came was not a satisfactory idea. There was no way that would end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down and thought. Let's suppose you didn't manage to contact anyone and explain the situation. She could arrive in five minutes, or an hour, or a week, you didn't know. You trusted Ho-oh to at least feel if she was coming, giving you and him enough time to do something. There wouldn't be enough time to plan at that point, so you decided to do it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...just in case it all went to the worst case scenario, which, knowing your luck, was what was going to happen.</span></div></div>",

The receding rays bathed you in a vivid orange color while the air around you cooled down as the warmth of the sun slowly dissipated. Usually, this feels like a perfect opportunity to sit back and enjoy a nice summer's evening. But your mind remained preoccupied with Ho-oh's story and the look of pure rage in his fiery eyes every time he mentioned Lugia. The venomous glare and grimaced beak still shook you deeply. You sighed and look down at the floor. <i>What am I supposed to do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh's tale revealed a lot even if it's a little subjective. At least now you have something to work with, a plan could be conceived and a solution could be sought. However, any good ideas seemed elusive at the moment. The story only added to your problem by making Lugia the antagonist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're finding yourself increasingly seeing things the way your host did and even agreeing with him. That isn't exactly a good development if you want to be impartial on the matter but it expanded your understanding of the Pokemon you once regarded as nothing but a malicious human-hating individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh is justified in being mad at Lugia. After all, it destroyed the Brass Tower and caused three other Legendaries their life and left Ho-oh to bear the brunt of cleaning up the aftermath. You were admittedly mad too at what she did in the past. But questions popped up in your head: How did the fire started in the first place? Ho-oh only said that the Tower burned when they are in town but never discussed what might have cause it. Come to think of it, you've never seen any guidebook mentioning this particular point. It was a mysterious gap in the Brass Tower's history that no one seems to be exploring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the story goes, Lugia demanded that Ho-oh put out the fire himself without even offering any assistance. She insinuated that Ho-oh started the fire without providing any evidence whatsoever. <i>That just doesn't make any sense</i>, you thought. Why would Lugia want Ho-oh to put out the fire himself? Was Lugia trying to hide something that might be in the Tower? Or worse, was there any ulterior motive on her part to pin the blame on Ho-oh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are countless possible reasons Lugia did what she did. No one knows for sure but herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh's own account of what happened is at best incomplete, tainted by personal vendetta and colored by grudge. There are many essential pieces to this story that are missing. What were both Pokemons doing in Ecruteak City at the same time? What are the events that led up to the fire? Why was Lugia so insistent that Ho-oh take responsibility? Were humans involved in this in any ways? Is there a reason why someone would want to destroy the Brass Tower? Most importantly, what does Lugia have to say about this? What's her story?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it! The more I think about a solution, the more questions are crowding out my brain. </i>, you groaned mentally as you rubbed your temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy how agitated Ho-oh got during his recounting, you can tell that their mutual hatred runs deeper than he is willing to disclose. Something has been going on between these two Pokemons for a long time. The incident at the Brass Tower only served as the last straw that broke their backs. A telling clue to their rocky relations is the way Ho-oh cast himself as the more responsible Pokemon. To him, Lugia was never taking her job and responsibility seriously; someone who is undeserving of her Legendary title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd hate to see what would happen if the two run into each other again. One thing for sure, it's bound to reopen old wounds and it won't be resolved by petty name calling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cynical bird and an easy-going sea creature fighting each other...,\" you mused, \"Just what I needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gave you a headache just to imagine Ho-oh and Lugia's voices going back and forth inside your head like two broken records being played simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of the aerial fight between Lugia and Ho-oh as they tried to settle old scores played in your mind. Both Pokemons are arguing about whose story is the true one; both are doing their best to convince you to join their side. In your imagination, when Arceus got news about this, he sent Ho-oh away to another nameless dimension together with Lugia after berating them for their actions. The idea was disturbing enough to send shivers through your spine and that's not saying what kind of fate Arceus would sentence you into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, I can't let that happen.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, you wanted nothing more than to be with Lugia, who is one of your friends and the closest thing you've ever got to a girl. While Ho-oh may be an arrogant jerk sometimes, he can be quite nice if he wants to. Simply too much has happened for you to leave them the way they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you figured that your best option is to somehow get in touch with Lugia and explain what happened to her. That is the only idea resembling a plan so far. It will would be the only way for you to make an informed decision to kick-start the process of regaining Ho-oh's lost status. <br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't noticed how long you've been absorbed by your thoughts. By the time you realized it, the sun has now completely disappeared below the horizon and stars were starting to appear on the dark sky. The air has grown frigid. You looked at the time on your Locator which now reads 9:46PM. You've spent the better part of three hours mentally ruminating over your plan. You were tired and exhausted by the long day and wanted nothing more than to lie on the soft bed in your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and descended the mountain and traced your path through the now-dark grassland and back to the stream. The boat was still there waiting for you to climb in. Once you're safely on board, the boat set off along the stream. Along the way to your next destination, you saw more unmarked openings and docks along the way. You had expected Ho-oh to transport you back to your bed chamber for the evening. However, the single tunnel started branching into separate streams and your boat seemed to traveling into deeper sections of your host's body. You are getting a little concerned when your transport entered a narrower tunnel and started moving erratically in the rapid stream. Where could Ho-oh be taking you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat took you through a dizzying maze of waterways before coming to a stop at the dock. At this point, you were nauseous and unwell from all the swaying. The moment you stepped off, the boat suddenly drifted away into the darkness beyond, stranding you at the dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Ho-oh! What are you doing? Get the boat back here!\" you demanded but was met with silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great. Got stranded once again</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance before you is unmarked but appears larger and more isolated than the others as it is the only one on this particular stretch of the stream. You entered the tunnel and resigned yourself with whatever Ho-oh is going to do to you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are stranded in unknown parts, there's only one path and you are almost convinced this is all something Ho-oh is trying to do to mess with you. Overall you hope this is all over soon. It is getting late, you should check on Vaporeon and then go to your room, you have no time for whatever Ho-oh has planned. Telling that to him as many times as you could shows no result, though. He doesn't even reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you arrive to a room that is completely featureless. It doesn't seem much bigger than your own room, the problem is that you don't see a way out. The only entrance is the tunnel you came from, and you already know that leads nowhere useful. The boat is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems you are stuck in this area. You'll have to wait for Ho-oh to let you out in the morning, since maybe he is already asleep. You pace around the room, looking for a comfortable enough spot on the flesh that makes the place. Everything is soft and kind of squishy, but somehow that doesn't make you wish to just lie anywhere. After a while you settle against the wall and prepare to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even get to close your eyes before the environment changed. \"Another one of these? How many organs does this bird have that can change and show stuff like this?\" you muttered. You expected this from Lugia, being partly Psychic type and all, not from Ho-oh. Maybe it was something all legendaries could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything turned black for a moment before a place resembling an shrine materialized. It didn't seem like something Ho-oh owned, mostly made of stone and without anything that could hint Ho-oh's normal ego. No statues, no carvings, no paintings, all seemed to be rather ancient and almost generic. You sat up, looking around with attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point of your watching Ho-oh - at a normal size compared to you - appeared on the altar but he wasn't alone. Besides you, there was also a figure, seemingly floating beyond the altar, just after a small platform that hung over emptiness. The Pokemon was bigger than any living being you had seen. You, at your normal size, which seemed to be your actual one during this sequence of events, would be barely bigger than his eye. You don't want to imagine how unthinkably humongous you, at your shrunken size, would be if you ever encountered him. You doubted even He would be able to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Arceus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh bowed his head respectfully for a moment. Arceus spoke with a voice you didn't know how to describe, it seemed many things at once. It was impossible to be sure of a word to encompass how it sounded. \"You have been forgiven\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Ho-oh bowed again. Unless Ho-oh had committed more transgressions that required Arceus to be aware of them you were sure this referred to your curren status as Ho-oh's prisoner...partially unwilling assistant. You couldn't really consider yourself a prisoner anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As such you will now be returned your status and your powers.\" Arceus announced. Ho-oh started to shine like the sun he was supposed to represent, forcing you to shield your eyes. When the shine died after a while you saw Ho-oh with a real crown and a garish cape, both of them emblazoned with way too many sun motifs. It was official, this must be some kind of dream or illusion. There was no way getting his powers back also meant receiving that stuff too. It didn't make any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parading around the shrine for a moment Ho-oh returned to Arceus. The god spoke again. \"Where is the human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has been returned home and rewarded as he should be\" the way Ho-oh said it sounded weird to you. There was nothing negative in his tone, which is what got you off-guard, instead he said it with pride and, somehow, a notable dose of affection. Affection towards you? It was true you and him were getting along much better than you ever did, but you don't think it would ever reach levels where the bird would talk about you with such esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus left without replying to that, and Ho-oh once again paraded around the shrine as if he were the most important being in the universe. This was all a strange illusion, but unlike the others Ho-oh didn't seem to be aware of your presence, even if sometimes his eyes looked towards where you were sitting not even once he made any signs of having seen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to guess this all was nothing Ho-oh intended to do, like it was subconscious and you were simply in the right place at the right time. You just hoped that, if this was something you weren't supposed to see, Ho-oh wouldn't be angry with you. It wasn't like you sneak into this place on purpose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe environment around you vanished, and you once again found yourself in the empty and featureless organ. You waited for a few minutes, as if you expected something else to happen, but nothing changed. Guessing there was nothing else to see you once again settled on the flesh floor and looked at the watch in your locator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5:34 AM?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Did you fall asleep at some point? You were sure you didn't, but right now you felt like you had rested for a long while. The illusion can't have lasted that long, either. What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to talk to Ho-oh still gave you no answers at all, it may have been too early to expect him to be awake. Since you still had nothing to do, being trapped in the organ and what not, you paced around idly, waiting patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hello? Human?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a voice, but it wasn't around you, like Ho-oh's usually sounded. It was inside your head. Not only that, but it was also distinctly female. \"<i>Are you awake?</i>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for you to figure out it was Lugia. Of course! She was part Psychic type, and hadn't she a year ago contacted you to your mind several times? You couldn't believe you had forgotten about that. You thought, enunciating the words and doing your best to keep your mind blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm awake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good! I'm sorry for talking to you so early. How are you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been fine. Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way! Remember? We are going to meet in a few hours for our usual quality time together\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tensed. So soon? You thought you had one week more! This was no good, if Lugia linked your presence to Ho-oh this wouldn't end well at all. You had to think of something, but you also knew she would know where in the area you were, the psychic connection would guarantee that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a problem. You decided to keep anything related to Ho-oh hidden for now, arranging a meeting between the two legendaries would end in a disaster, but you couldn't reject the conversation and hope for the better, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh could give you your normal size but you didn't want to leave him. After all, you hadn't fulfilled your task of helping him, and surely going away would undo all the friendly progress you had achieved so far. Besides, if Lugia found you she would take you away to places unknown, effectively making you lose all contact with Ho-oh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you saw it, your priorities were to hide everything about Ho-oh, stay with him, and somehow lie to Lugia without her suspecting anything<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a problem.</span></div></div>",

Being away from home probably did a lot to mess with your sense of time. You can't really recalled the last time you two chat telepathically. By you estimate, it has been two months or probably more. Lugia must be very eager reconnect with you after such long period of silence. It usually was an exciting moment whenever Lugia's soft voice chimed in your mind and start off an hours-long talk. But you currently aren't as elated.<i> How am I supposed to tell her that I'm hanging out with Ho-oh? I can't have her disrupting the progress I made with Ho-oh so far.</i> Deep down you know that it's a matter of time before she finds out. In the meantime, you will have to find a way avoid any suspicions on Lugia's part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are you still with me?\" Lugia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm... Yeah! I'm still here. Just got a little distracted by a notification on my Pokedex,\" you lied through your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's thing going for you, dear?\" Lugia asked curiously, \"Are you still thinking about me often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Lugia addressing you so affectionately made you feel guilty about the charade you are about to pull off at her. But it is necessary and the best option you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course, Lugia. I'm always thinking about your charming, beautiful face and voice,\" you thought warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you,\" she said playfully, \"You're still as sweet as ever. So what have you been up to lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...let's see, where should I start? Things are going pretty awesome for me. I'm spending most of my time training and bonding with my Pokemons. Vaporeon is getting better with her moves each day. Believe it or not, I will be taking on the Elite Four in a few weeks and I really wanted to show you how far I've improved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha... That's great,\" Lugia complimented, \"It's great to hear that things are going well for you. Nothing too out of the ordinary for you these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, no big turbulence for me. Life's been good,\" you told her without much emotion, \"And what have you up to, Lugia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing what I'm supposed to do: Patrolling my seas and its depths. Although, I must admit it gets really repetitive either watching over a featureless, vast sea with only clouds by my sides or swimming down under in pitch darkness. But I have good memories with you to keep me company, that's what keep me going. I can't wait to see you again, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Lugia talking about how much she missed you really made you feel bad since you will be telling her that you are deferring your next get-together with her. You can't bear to keep up this deception. <i>Is it really better to tell her the truth?</i>, you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...about that, Lugia. I'm afraid that I won't be able to make it to our get-together today,\" you said with a sinking feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........Huh, why? What's wrong? Did something happened?,\" she said worryingly but the disappointment in her voice is apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, \" you tried your best to keep it positive, \"You see, an old friend of mine just came over about two days ago and we're planning on going on a little vacation for a week. So I must have to push back our meeting a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so looking forward to it...,\" Lugia said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wish this could have work out better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're going on a vacation with a friend? You aren't dating another Pokemon behind my back, are you?\" Lugia asked jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not. I already got you, Lugia. I assure you that I have no more rooms for anyone else but you. Can't you trust me that I'm just going on a little trip with a friend?\" you pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are going on a trip, is it alright if I tag along with another of your human friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would really love for you to come along but I don't think that would be a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Lugia inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is an absolutely crazy about Legendary Pokemon, especially about you and that \"other Pokemon\". If he knows that I am close friends with you, he'll go absolutely nuts and start posting things about us with his computer, tearing our privacy to shred. I don't think the general population is comfortable about Pokmon-Human relations yet. And to make things worse, my friend will be pestering you and me nonstop about various personal details. Trust me, you wouldn't want to be in a position to answer questions about Pokemon reproductive rituals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....That.....sorta makes sense,\" she said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to keep our relations a secret and, most importantly, for your safety. You don't want Ho-oh to know that we are still together. Who knows when that guy will show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry about him. I have some great news to share with you,\" Lugia said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I thought we're through with him,\" you tried to sound annoyed and disinterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so upset, dear,\" Lugia assured you with smile, \"Did you know that Lord Arceus has revoked Ho-oh's Legendary status pending further decision at the Legendary Summit? I got news about it from Floatzel and I couldn't believe it. Such actions were very rarely taken by Arceus, but in light of how unbecoming of a Legendary Ho-oh has become, I'd say it a fitting punishment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard anything else about him?\" you asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know the details but three-fourth of his special powers have also been removed and Arceus making him listen to lectures about humans. There was a rumor that he will be doing 'special assignments' soon. Ho-oh won't be in our way anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral weeks ago, you would've probably been cheering and celebrating this revelation with Lugia. However, after getting to know Ho-oh and armed with a better understanding of his history with Lugia, it has taken on a sadder tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...wonderful,\" you feigned excitement, \"He got what he deserved all along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. All that's missing is me getting to knock that smug smile off his beak,\" Lugia laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the Locator and sensed that it's about time to wrap up your conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I better check on my friend now, Lugia. We're almost done packing up and will be going soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Stay safe, you hear. Let me know when you get to your destination, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, I sure will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember to keep your promise, dear,\" Lugia warned jocularly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I'll remember that...bye.\"<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lugia's voice was gone from your mind, leaving you alone once more  in the silence of the dark chamber. Your thoughts are completely occupied on what to do next. Although you successfully kept Lugia away for the time being, it felt absolutely awful to deceive her like this. You have reasons to believe that she might already be doubting your explanation about being away with a friend. <i> I'll have to make it up to her in some ways soon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you heard the familiar voice of your host calling for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning. Did you have a good night, human?\" Ho-oh greeted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you exclude the part where you stranded me in a remote part of your body to watch you dream, I would say I did,\" you replied with a groggy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you enjoy the dream I showed you last night?\" he asked, seemingly ignoring your complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It a bit too idealistic to say the least. I think those brightly colored cape and crown look really gaudy on you. And Arceus' character feels off and a bit too forgiving. You also conveniently wrote me out of the dream by saying I went home,\" you monotoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I have no control over the contents of my dream. My mind creates whatever it wants,\" the bird growled annoyingly, \"And since when did you became an expert on dreams? If you have an issue with the direction, you should bring that up with my brain or subconscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I have the chance, I really want to meet the \"director\" about his habit of making ego-stroking stories nonstop,\" you said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say whatever you like, human, but I'm not going to allow you to just randomly waltz into my brain and sift through it without good reasons,\" Ho-oh briefly said using his familiar smug tone, \"Come on now, I've prepared the next boat to take you back to my Eye Chamber. There's something I want you to see.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You'd be lying if you said having talked with Lugia was any good for you. It was true you had thought long about what you could say, and what you would do once it was time to talk with her, but now that you actually did you feel you dug a grave for yourself...hopefully metaphorically. You trusted Lugia would be able to forgive you...you had to repeat that to yourself a few times...but you fully expected this all to be much harder to get in order now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you also wondered how Ho-oh would react if he heard about what you had told to Lugia. Would he be grateful you rejected the chance to tell Lugia about what was going on? It wasn't like you were planning to ever tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the boat Ho-oh prepared for you, you were surprised to find Vaporeon sitting there, waiting for you. She jumped from the boat, running to greet you, and you scratched her behind the fins on her head. \"How did you get here? Ho-oh told you to come?\" Vaporeon confirmed it. Did he have something to show the both of you? The boat did take you to the Eye Chamber, so it wasn't like your host had gotten some weird idea. That was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you entered the Eye Chamber you froze for a moment, remembering what you had to do the first time you were there. Cleaning his eyes hadn't been pleasant at all, and repeating the experience wasn't something you wanted. Vaporeon didn't have such qualms, immediately getting to one of the chairs that had been placed near the front. After a moment you followed her, settling onto the other. Outside, you saw the clouds and the sky. Ho-oh was flying somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here and...Vaporeon is here too. Did you call her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd like to see her. Be grateful!\" Ho-oh commanded. You were grateful \"I brought you here because I wanted you to know I have taken the first step\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First step of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On getting back on my duties, of course. What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuties? Did he mean as a Legendary? That was difficult, having no powers at all. Ho-oh started descending, perching on top of a structure. Not far from there, you saw roofs, a city you recognized. It was Ecruteak. Ho-oh had finally returned to the town. You remembered the rumors about his disappearance, how it was a bad omen and all that. \"Why are you here again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been here since last night. Do you see how responsible I am? I'm here to let the town adore me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...'adore' is kind of the wrong word to use here\" you pointed, although someone had left what seemed to be large bowls of food and some incense near where Ho-oh was resting. You supposed monks had done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm here to be the inspiration the town needs, but don't expect me to do anything further than that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you do when you're here. Pose around and act all high and mighty?\" you weren't surprised about that, to be completely honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make me sound so selfish when you say it like that. I expected some praise out of this\" <i>That doesn't help make you look less selfish</i> \"Besides that is not all I called you here for. I want you to help me here for a while\" Ho-oh went silent, unsure of how to continue. After some encouragement from you, he continued \"If I'm going to try to get along better with you then I think I should get along better with the other humans in this tower. In a way you're one of them now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I?\" was that good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are. You spend time dealing with me and have to treat me well. The only difference between you and them is that you have way more privileges than they do\" So that was what he had called you here for? To make you feel like a glorified monk? You didn't really know that the monks in the Ecruteak towers did in honor of the Legendaries, but you did know it was something very few had the privilenge to do. They even sweared secrecy regarding the Legendaries and anything related to them, stopping Trainers and most times working for free. It wasn't a career you had really been interested into, and chances were you wouldn't have even be able to turn into a monk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I want you to help me...\"treat them better\". No, I haven't been mistreating them, I never did, but maybe, just maybe, I haven't been the most pleasant Pokemon in the area. That's where you come in. Guide me, just for a few hours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't sound that difficult, and if it got Ho-oh to progress in treating people better, it meant you'd be treated better too. It was worth a try. Besides it was also a chance for you to see first-hand what was the monks' work with Ho-oh and the tower. A chance like this was likely not to repeat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's do it\"</span></div></div>",

I don't see anything in here that I could use to influence your actions. Does this mean I get to use the shocker on you every time you messed up?\" you asked while grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.

Unsurprisingly, Ho-oh\u2019s pride is currently all over the chart no doubt because he is about to show up to the monks in his own dramatic way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you might already know, my beak still lacks discipline and I can be cocky at times. Even with my significant improvements over the past weeks, there is the risk that I might have a relapse in behavior. What I want you to do is give me a little helping hand here. Whenever I feel uncertain, the display before you will show several ideas I thought of. You just have to tap on what you think is the best choice. That microphone is for you to speak with my voice if it's required. In the event you feel that I'm becoming snarky or mean, press the X icon to warn me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo basically, you want me to be that little voice in your head,\u201d you said in am amused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a way, yes. Isn't being a Legendaries' conscience for a few hours a really exciting opportunity?\u201d Ho-oh asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that it isn't good or bad for that matter. Seeing that I have very little knowledge about the rituals, I don't know if I'm able to assist you that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't have to worry about that. I will teach you about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you heard a faint jingle wafting through the air. Ho-oh perked his head up toward the Tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bells... They are performing the summoning. It's time for us to make an appearance,\" he said as he took off..<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both of you reached the Bell Tower, there was a small group of people on the top floor waiting for the Legendary to descent. The Kimono Girls are dancing and playing with ancient instruments as the four golden bells hanging from the corners of the eave, chimed and glowed with the slow rhythm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's make this a memorable and grandoise appearance, shall we?\" Ho-oh said as he circled the tower, \"Think of this as my welcome-back party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are five figures seated in a meditative posture before an altar with more offerings. Those must be the sacred monks the Ho-oh mentioned. An older monk sat on an elevated mat and with a more ornate robe that resemble Ho-oh\u2019s plumage. It is clear to you he is the leader of this secretive sect and he has been in this position for decades at least. Within his hands, there is a golden staff carved with old symbols and topped with a small figure of Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh landed on the top of the tower before the altar which is filled with all sorts of fruits and decorations. The bird tilted up his beak and cried out, seeking the attention of all those present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old monk lifted his head toward Ho-oh and bowed down in reverence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Lord Ho-oh, the Bringer of the Rays,\" he addressed your host solemnly, \"It an honor to be graced with your presence once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is also an honor to be received by you again, O' Sacred Monk of Ecruteak,\" he spoke telepathically in a courteous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After forsaking us for so long, you have at last returned to us, Lord Ho-oh,\" the head monk declared, \"Where art thou during your absence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O' Sacred Monk, never have I forsaken the people of Ecruteak or you. My presence was requested by \"The Original One\" and was the reason I remained unseen for so long,\" Ho-oh replied as a half-truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is \"The Original One\" who requested you, there is nothing we could do to interfere with His will,\" the monk acknowledged, \"Lord Ho-oh, please do forgive me for my curiosity. Why has \"The Original One\" send for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are things that I cannot answer for you, O' Sacred Monk, for He has given me instructions to not share it,\" the bird declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then. I will not seek further answers. For now, allow my apprentices and the Kimono Girls to celebrate your return.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh, the Bringer of Ray, we are here perform a dance for you,\" the Kimono Girls recited together, \"Raise your head and light our city with your Sacred Fire to commence our celebration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon looked down upon the other humans below him, delighted at being asked to perform his moves for them to behold. He will use Sacred Fire to light up Ecruteak in a bright arc of rainbow like he always like to do. It was his big moment to show everyone how much he has change. He even planned to request that people stop talking to him in such a stilted manner. Ho-oh smiled as he opened his mouth to release the flames to begin the celebration, which could be the beginning of his path to getting his status back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh expected to feel a ball of energy forming within his beak, but he felt nothing there. As quickly as his excitement came, there was a sudden realization: he didn't have enough power to perform the move. Arceus took away a majority of his power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon's face turned pale as he looked at the expectant humans below him. He hadn't thought about his limited power when he came back here. Ho-oh felt his stomach tying into knots and his head spinning. This is going to be awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, several warnings are going off on the display, you see a brief message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\"><b><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\u201cHuman, I think I just screwed up big time. I don't have the power to make the necessary impression. What should we do now?\u201d </span><br>\r\n</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked outside the Eye Chamber and saw everyone giving Ho-oh a very confusing look. By extension, they are also looking at you which made you uncomfortable like your host is. Something has to be done before they start asking more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll improvise, Ho-oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<i>Somewhere over the skies of Johto</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia glided high above Olivine City, eyeing the tiny streets that snakes through its hills and the many recently-constructed buildings that dotted it's port. The city has expanded significantly over the past few years by adding more docks for cruise ships and new resorts for visitors. The development transformed the city from a mere port to a new tourist destination for humans around the world; many of them are certainly here to catch a glimpse of her. What those people didn't realized was that Lugia was gone for pretty much the last two months, out at sea. The Pokemon turned her gaze toward the horizon, to several islets just off the coast of the glistening city: Whirl Islands. Lugia sighed as she focused on the churning whirlpools that swirled between the islands she called home, recalling her conversation moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings haven't gone as she had wanted. After being on constant duty, Lugia was so looking forward to meeting with her human again. When she established her telepathy with him, she had fully expected the human to be excited that they would soon take off on another date. But unfortunately, her timing was off. The human was on a vacation of his own with another friend and won't be back for another week. The news was saddening for her, but they had some nice telepathic conversation and the human promised to meet at a later date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Lugia didn't feel quite right about this whole thing. It took a lot more effort for her to establish a communication with the human. It felt as if he was very far off or in someplace that is resistant to psychic power. That shouldn't have happened...especially with my ability. What made Lugia especially leery is that she didn't recalled the human talking about any other friends during all their time together. From what she could tell, he didn't have many to begin with. Now that she thought about it, the human seemed a little jumpy and hesitant during their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why would he do that?</i>, Lugia thought fearfully. <i>Something is going on here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lugia felt a presence, the summoning power of a song being played far away...from the direction of Ecruteak City. She could faintly feel the pulsing jingle of the bells on the Tower and the gentle music that calls for \u201chim\u201d. The familiarity of that song is very jarring for Lugia. She knew it by heart from long ago, when the two of them are on better terms; back when the Brass Tower was still standing and before the three Legendaries perished in that fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh's absence hasn't gone unnoticed by the humans, as they continuously made attempts to summon him several times without results. T<i>here's no point in summoning \u201chim\u201d now</i>, Lugia thought derisively, <i>Don't they know that he has been removed by Arceus? What makes them think that it\u2019ll work this time?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen seconds later, her question was answered. Lugia felt it, the responding call from \"him\" to the summoners. No... it can't be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ho-oh is powerless and no longer entitled to be a Legendary. He has no more business at the Bell Tower! What is he doing there?</i>, she thought alarmingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia's blue eyes looked in the direction of the ancient town and frowned, <i>I guess I have to pay our old place a visit. </i> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could already see a thousand ways this could go wrong. Sacred Fire was Ho-oh's signature move, therefore everyone would expect him to do it. You weren't sure what were its effects beyond burning stuff. \"We can't just stand here and do nothing! Can you use any other Fire moves?\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\"><br>\r\nOf course I can!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll have to do something like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">Everyone will know that's not what they asked for!</span> Several options came on the screen in front of you. Half of them were related to running away, which would be quite a bad scenario. How would people take that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see what else to do when it's time. Just do it!\" You advised Ho-oh on what moves to use. He didn't have that many options, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before the head monk started approaching to check if there was anything wrong, Ho-oh used Sunny Day and then Fire Blast towards the sky. It was a far cry from using Sacred Fire, but right now what mattered was to do something, anything! The monks and the Kimono Girls stared in confusion while Ho-oh did it for several seconds. Neither Ho-oh nor you realized it, your eyesight focused towards the sky. Once the Fire Blast was done, Ho-oh looked at the head monk, who was now standing in front of the altar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While the power shown is unmistakably mesmerizing, Lord Ho-oh, it is not what the ceremony requires. Is everything in order?\" the monk asked in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emotions showed Ho-oh was starting to panic, although thankfully none of that was shown outwardly. \"We'll have to lie our way out of this, I guess\" you said and got closer to the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be possible my journey has left me quite exhausted. I'm not in condition to perform our rites\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">Why did you admit that?!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of disappointment washed over the monk's face. You looked away. \"It's a half-truth! That should be good enough, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand\" the monk replied \"In that case, we shan't announce your return to the city of Ecruteak yet. Shall we continue our ceremonies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that, despite the lack of Sacred Fire, everyone was willing to continue the ceremony. You weren't sure if that was good or bad, but at least the head monk had accepted your excuse. That was always a good sign. Ho-oh nodded, his stress ebbing away. The head monk turned around, announcing to everyone gathered that the ceremony would continue, and although most people looked reticent, no one protested. The Kimono Girls' dance started. Watching it was certainly something interesting, the way they twirled and moved around seemed to have been created according to topics Ho-oh found pleasant. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">I think I can continue for a bit from here </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh was required to participate in a very short event after the dance, where he lighted up several torches near the walls and incinerated a series of offerings made to bring prosperity and blessings to Ecruteak. Bowls of fruits, samples of fine objects, it all was turned into ashes that Ho-oh later scattered through the wind with his wings. All in all, the ceremony seemed to go rather well despite Ho-oh's lack of powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall rejoice because Lord Ho-oh has returned!\" the head monk proclaimed to everyone gathered. Usually that would be told to the city as a whole, but due to Ho-oh's lack of powers it was limited to only those authorized. It went unsaid secrecy was expected from all of them \"He shall rest here until it's time for him to be shown to the city. For now, let us retire and finish the ceremony!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It went better than expected\" you commented, relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">It did! We got lucky.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Ho-oh, please stay around until your condition has improved\" the head monk requested, bowing \"Our monks shall attend your needs and follow the necessary protocols, and I shall oversee them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your services, O' Sacred Monk\" Ho-oh replied telepathically, being led towards a room aside. Ho-oh and the monk had barely crossed the area when the winds started to pick up, having an intensity that hadn't been foreseen at all. It was obvious it wasn't a natural occurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">This isn't a good sign.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Do you feel something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">Lugia is coming.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost fell from your seat. How had everything gone so wrong when it seemed to be okay! But there wasn't time to despair, something needed to be done, and fast. \"Do you think she'll find out I'm inside you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">That's a possibility!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head monk had stopped when the winds started, but after verifying it wouldn't impede the arrival to Ho-oh's temporal abode he continued leading the bird, closing the doors and leaving Ho-oh inside a rather luxurious room, where the Pok\u00e9mon would be able to rest for as long as necessary. Ho-oh didn't have time to enjoy the place, though. \"This isn't good! What am I supposed to do now?!\" Ho-oh shouted at you once he was sure the monk was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! You tell me! Will she find out I'm here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has psychic powers! Normally they would be diminished because of my own powers, but Arceus took a good part of them away!\" that explained how Lugia had managed to make contact with you. Had she sensed it was a lie or that you were inside someone else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you suggest we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh paced around. \"If you stay inside me you could continue advising me on what to say, but you'd be at risk of being found out. You could leave my body, but then it'd be up to me to talk to her and I don't know if I can do that without causing a fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't leave your body, that'd be dangerous for me!\" you protested, but then you looked towards where Vaporeon was sitting and watching everything. That's true, she could protect you and make sure nothing happened to you while you were outside. It wasn't required for her to eat you or anything, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! But those are the only options I can think right now. You tell me what to do, we don't have much longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo either you stayed inside Ho-oh, helped him yet risked Lugia finding out you had lied to her - you feared the consequences the both of you would have, although you knew she wouldn't hurt you - or you could leave his body temporally and trust Vaporeon to help you stay hidden somewhere in the tower, or maybe out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew Lugia wasn't the type to lose control over her emotions, and that she wouldn't attack Ho-oh unprovoked, but leaving him alone with her seemed risky to you. He could say something wrong, and the situation would get worse. It was a better idea to stay with him and make sure that wouldn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh was silent for a moment before begrudgingly accepting that. \"Fine. You do what you want. But whatever happens won't be my fault, I warn you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you waited for several minutes more, until the floor trembled outside. Something heavy had landed on the platform outside. It could only be Lugia. After a moment of hesitation, Ho-oh fluffed up his feathers and stepped outside, looking as arrogant as usual. You could imagine Lugia out there. \"About time you got here\" Ho-oh said, his voice unwavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia wasn't in mood to beat around the bush, she was too worried about you. There was something odd about your excuse about meeting with a friend, and she feared the worst. \"Have you seen the human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have seen many humans\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know who I'm talking about. You'd have a reason to look for him\" and do much worse than just meet you, she refrained from saying \"Tell me, did you ever see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no reason to answer anything to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sucked air through your teeth. Ho-oh was starting to be a little too defensive, that'd be enough to raise suspicions. You patted the floor around you, hoping he'd feel it. \"Calm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer me\" Lugia demanded sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh took a moment to make sure he was composed before continuing. \"No. I didn't see him. I don't want to see him ever again. That guy is the one who made me be like this, why'd I want to see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To take revenge on him!\" Lugia approached, a bit menacing. She didn't have the patience to let him talk his way out of this \"You're spiteful enough to do something like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't hurt him at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia focused on Ho-oh, trying to find out if he was telling the truth. Being a Psychic-type Pokemon had its perks. Before Ho-oh could prepare himself, he felt a slight headache while she forced her way into his mind. It didn't take more than just a few seconds, but that was enough. \"...okay, you're telling the truth. Do you at least know where he is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't keep tabs on the people I hate\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, of course not\" Lugia sighed \"I thought you'd have tried to hurt him, but you didn't do that. Maybe he was telling the truth about meeting a friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doubt what he told you?\" Ho-oh didn't know what she was talking about, but anything that'd make her go away seemed like a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I doubt it, it just feel so strange...\" Lugia shook her head \"I'm not going to tell you about it. I'll just try to pinpoint where he is, just to know he's okay\" If the human showed to be anywhere where he had said his town was, then he was fine. If not, well, she'd get more worried. Lugia went to the edge of the tower and closed her eyes, focusing on you. Where was the human...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out he was very close to her right now. Startled, she turned around in Ho-oh's direction, and without interrupting her search, she slowly approached. Starting to feel dread, Ho-oh swallowed with nervousness but managed to keep his defiant stare towards her. \"...it's strange, it feels like he was around here...\" she said, approaching Ho-oh. The human had to be where Ho-oh was standing. You listened to what she said, starting to feel the same nervousness Ho-oh had. <i>We're busted.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh craned his neck and looked around, feigning ignorance. \"I don't see him\" he moved around. That was his mistake. Lugia, still trying to find the human, felt the human's presence moving. It didn't take long for her to connect the dots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...he's inside you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what? I don't know----\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's inside you! The human! Why's he inside you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask me, I don't know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your face into your hands. This was going to be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know? It's your body! I doubt he could get inside you without you knowing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know nothing! Stop bothering me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat answer wasn't satisfactory to Lugia. It didn't take long for you to hear her voice in your head. \"Where are you? You're inside Ho-oh, right? Why are you there?\" You thought for a moment. Denying it wouldn't go well, so maybe if you cleared up the situation she'd understand. You and she were friends, surely she'd respect your wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, making friends with Ho-oh was something good, she wouldn't get in the way of that. All you had to do was explain. After preparing yourself, you answered back.</span></div></div>",

Stop!,</span> the message on the screen blared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got off your seat and slowly walked toward one of the \u201cwindows\u201d to show yourself to Lugia. Her eyes widened in shock as she saw the human she love so much appear in the vermilion eyes of Ho-oh. She moved her head closer toward Ho-oh\u2019s pupil and looked straight at you, scrutinizing every inch of your being for the slightest sign of mistreatment. Dozens of questions raced through her head at breakneck speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing with this sorry excuse of a Legendary?! And just why did you lie to me about being on a vacation with a friend? You could have called me for help!,\u201d Lugia exclaimed, her voice both concerned and upset at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish that I could tell you sooner, but I wasn't able to....,\u201d you offered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could explain further, Lugia\u2019s expression turned into a sharp glare that was clearly meant for Ho-oh. However from your vantage point, those blue eyes also pierced through you like a pair of raging maelstroms threatening to slowly drag you down to unknown depths. For all the time you spent with her, you've never seen her like this. It made you feel much worse for lying about your whereabouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you trying to accomplish here, Ho-oh?\u201d she demanded through clenched teeth, \u201cWhat are you doing with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....I was trying to become\u2026... friends with the human,\u201d Ho-oh mustered enough of his courage to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have caused more than enough problems for the Pokemon world,\u201d she snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia moved menacingly toward Ho-oh until their faces were mere inches apart. You swore you could feel the hot air rushing out of her nostrils through the eye membrane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelease him this instance and leave!\u201d she ordered, \u201cNow! I'm in no mood for your games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn't a game, Lugia,\u201d the phoenix retorted, doing his best to keep his temper in check, \u201cIf I ever want my Legendary status restored by Lord Arceus, I have to find the human first and become friend with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFind him? More like snatched him I presume,\u201d Lugia said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Ho-oh admitted, \u201cWhen I found him, the human was initially unsympathetic to my plight and told me that I deserved this punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd rightfully so. Arceus has every right to strip you of your title and its power after what you did to my dear human. Now release him!\u201d Lugia demanded, \u201cI cannot possibly allow you to keep him any longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I might've had a rough start by snatching him and lecturing him about my problems but I didn\u2019t subject him to any of my old antics. I have treated him with nothing but hospitality. We have even grown to have a level of respect for one another. You can ask him if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how am I supposed to believe a Pokemon who has lost every last ounce of credibility?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I were bent on exacting my revenge, would the human still be standing here unscathed?\u201d Ho-oh said with thinning patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia briefly paused for a moment before focusing her attention back toward you. She looked conflicted between wanting to believe Ho-oh\u2019s statement and dismissing it as part of a manipulation scheme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">I guess we have to tell her everything now</span>, the screen reads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath before you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLugia, I'm sorry that I lied to you about being with Ho-oh\u2026. I made the wrong but necessary decision under this particular circumstance and I know that you wanted to give me a huge piece of your mind for leaving your in the dark. If I had told you the truth back then, you would've swooped in and kicked Ho-oh a new one just as he was showing me that he was willing to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had serious doubts about his intentions when he first showed up raging about how I am responsible for his downfall with all the excuses he can come up with. He went on to force me down his body. At that point, I thought that he would be subjecting me to those same nasty things. But then, he started showing me around various nice places in his body and telling me about things that had happened between you and him like the incident at the Burned Tower which, according to Ho-oh, was the source of many of your differences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can tell that he really wanted to change for the better but didn\u2019t know how. I guess that\u2019s the one of the reasons Arceus asked him to be friends with me. Are you willing to give him the same benefit of doubt?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Needless to say, hearing Ho-oh had caught you and imprisoned you against your will did nothing to make Lugia feel any better about this. The way that sounded, it was like the phoenix was tormenting you again, just to solve his own problems and forcing you to cooperate with him. When you said you and he shared some form of respect Lugia felt a tinge of jealousy. You were the human she cherished so much, and now you were trying to be merciful towards the one Pokemon that had caused you a lot of suffering and discomfort.<i> This isn't right, this is...almost stupid!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't say that. If she did, she would be insulting you, and she respected you too much for that. She wanted to trust you knew what you were doing, and that if you were in trouble you'd indicate it somehow. She wanted to believe it more than anything else right now, but she couldn't, not when you were with someone she didn't trust at all. She had already left three Pokemon to die in a burning tower once, unaware they had been there, and leaving Ho-oh to solve a problem she thought he had caused. If she went away now, and something happened to you because of Ho-oh and you got hurt and died, she wouldn't ever forgive herself, especially because of how important you were for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could give you the benefit of the doubt, but she couldn't extend it to Ho-oh. \"No. No, I can't\" she stepped back, gving Ho-oh some space \"I'm not believing for a second he can treat you right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can't\" Ho-oh muttered, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're in better terms with him, but I just don't like the thought of you being inside him, do you understand that'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. You had hoped she'd be a bit more reasonable, but at least she wasn't lashing out. That was a good sign. \"I get it, but seriously, I'm okay here! Ho-oh is pretty tolerable when he's not upset with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so\" she didn't sound convinced at all. She didn't want to leave you, but it wasn't like she could force you out. Trying to help you escape Ho-oh was one thing, making you leave against your will an entirely different. \"I just hope you know what you're doing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have this under control\" you promised. Lugia looked at you through Ho-oh's eyes, full of doubt, and shook her head before flying away. She didn't even bother saying goodbye to Ho-oh. This didn't go as badly as Ho-oh expected, but it could have gone better, too. There wasn't a big fight right now and that was what mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">She trust you but not me at all, you know that?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed\" you said, approaching the eye membrane and carefully placing a hand on it. It was the closest you could do to patting Ho-oh's back. \"Don't blame her, you haven't exactly been a saint to us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">I know that. I don't need a constant reminder of that.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat remained to be seen was what Lugia would do now. Knowing her, she wouldn't let the problem rest, especially if doing nothing could to you being in trouble. You just hoped it wouldn't be too much of a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">Thanks for supporting me. You know what, go over here. There's something I bet a human like you would like</span> a passageway opened in the back of the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where does that one go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">There's a wind tunnel over there. Do you want to know what flying's like? Go take a look</span>. It didn't sound bad at all! Anything that could help you relax would be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia flew through the clouds. She had decided to stay close to Ecruteak, just in case, but that didn't seem enough. The more she thought about Ho-oh keeping the human inside him, the less she liked it. What if he had lied, if the human had been under duress? She couldn't think how he'd force the human to lie, but it was a possibility, even if it was a remote one. Upset towards Ho-oh, she decided not to fall in inaction, she decided to look for the help of someone who could help her. In times like these, it was good to be in good terms with the one Pokemon that could hold Ho-oh accountable. \"Lord Arceus?\" she wrote in the chat app. It took several minutes for a reply to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>I hope this is urgent</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia explained the situation and how she felt about it, making sure not to mislead or lie. Arceus wasn't a fool, if she exaggerated anything, he'd find out in no time. Besides, telling everything like it was would allow Arceus to take better decisions. Once she was finished, she awaited Arceus' response. <i>He's wiser than all of us, if there's someone who can make sure the human will be okay it's him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Do you not trust the human? Is this not for the better, them to bond and be in good terms?</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has been trapped inside Ho-oh before, he's not infallible\" she hoped that was a good point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>You expect too much from me</u> For a moment Lugia's heart sank, and then Arceus continued <u>Allow me make this clear: I will not separate Ho-oh and the human. This is for their own good, and I hope you will accept this. However, if you are feeling unsatisfied over the current arrangement, I will try to find a measure that will allow them to continue bonding, and you to not fret about it.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, anything will work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Ho-oh's legendary status will only be given back if he and the human bond. If Ho-oh taking care of him won't be enough, then there's another possibility I can think of. Bonding through one supporting the other through hard times is an option too.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia hurried to add: \"Please don't make the human have more problems in his life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>I wouldn't think of doing that. Ho-oh is the one who needs reforming, not the human. Leave this to me, I will try to arrange something with the human. I will contact him once I have confirmed it could be done.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing Lugia could do other than hoping Arceus would do the right thing. She chose to trust his decisions.</span></div></div>",

She obviously doubt your decision but you don\u2019t blame her for doing so; it is understandable. If someone had asked you to put your trust in Ho-oh a few days ago, you\u2019d probably consider them insane. After all, Lugia had known him for centuries...eons\u2026several lifetimes over... Her opinions will be exceptionally difficult to change at this rate but it\u2019s not impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I know what I\u2019m doing, Lugia\u2026</i>, you thought pensively.  <br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boat reached your destination, you are greeted by a large sign with flashy words complete with a caricature of Ho-oh at the entrance: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">HO-OH'S FLYING EXPERIENCE</font><br>\r\nLearn to Soar through the Sky like a Legendary</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it past the entrance and emerged in a chamber that you could only describe as a large planetarium. The domed ceiling of this structure extends more than a hundred feet high like an indoor amphitheater while being at least 80 feet across. The perimeter surrounding the chamber has a soft membrane separating you from the inner area like a protective glass barrier. You observed that the floor beyond the membrane consists of thin, elastic tendons that has been criss-crossed to form a wire mesh. When you looked past the wire mesh and deeper below, you could make out several large sphincters that are tightly closed. You recalled seeing similar wind tunnels at an amusement park but you never had the guts to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there. Looks like someone here is ready for some flying lessons,\u201d a familiar voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back and saw the humanoid Ho-oh you met back at the Game Corner dressed in a bright green flight suit that has an exaggerated amount of flight patches running all the way down his sleeves. The representation has a wide smirk as he greeted you with a big pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the encouragement back there,\u201d he said, \u201cI could really use that sometimes... Anyways, welcome to my wind tunnel and I get to be your flight instructor today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthropomorphic Ho-oh\u2019s smile only grew wider as he relished at the opportunity of showing you the art of flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 Ho-oh, what\u2019s with the costume?\u201d you looked quizzically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you mean this?\u201d Ho-oh flaunted his ensemble, \u201cJust something to make your experience more authentic. I hear humans wear these when they try to fly. Doesn't it just look great on me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...It's a bit on the gaudy side if you ask me,\u201d you winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird looked at you with mock offense before quickly brushing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus, it would be easier for me to teach you in this form. Wouldn't it be unfair for some large bird to teach someone without feathers or wings, so to speak?\u201d Ho-oh remarked self-deprecatingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...I guess that makes sense in a way,\u201d you shrugged, too flabbergasted to question him, \u201cWhat do you want me to do now, Ho-oh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst order of things, we'll get you a flight suit. Come along now!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon practically dragged you by the hand to a counter filled with various clothing and protective gears. Ho-oh browsed around and handed you a few equipment before leading you to a small stall for you to change out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, after making sure that you have everything on, you presented yourself to Ho-oh outside the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now in a bright orange suit with green and white trims made from elastic material that fits your body snugly. When you extended your arms, wing-like appendages spread out gracefully from your sleeves. Rather incredibly, there are actual feathers attached to the wire frames. It made you look like you\u2019re wearing a passable cosplay of your host, especially with the crested head-covering and the visor which has Ho-oh\u2019s red eyes printed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it any better,\u201d Ho-oh clasped his hands, \u201cYou should really look at yourself, human. All equipped and ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...Do you really have to put this on me?\u201d you asked embarrassingly, pointing to the words emblazoned across your chest: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cborange\"><i><span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">Ho-oh\u2019s #1 Trainee</span></i></span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s the truth! You\u2019re the first human that I get to train,\u201d the Pokemon said cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're bragging again, Ho-oh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s my specialty, human,\u201d Ho-oh snickered, \u201cThat one isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, even with reformation.\u201d<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh led you past the protective barrier and into the wind tunnel proper. The soft, cushy feel of the mesh below you made it feel like walking on a trampoline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, human. Flying is all about knowing how to manipulate the wind to your favor,\u201d the Pokemon explained, \u201cYou have to know the wind and will it to follow your directions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I do that?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExplaining through words would require far more efforts than simply showing it to you. Let get started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh snapped his fingers and made several of the large sphincters open beneath you open up. An intense gust immediately filled the room, almost knocking you out of balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dome above you darkened and changed into a 360\u00b0 scenery of a mountaintop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, spread your hands wide open and hold them steady,\u201d the Pokemon instructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stretched your arms, a strong lift blew through your wings. However, you didn\u2019t time both hands correctly, causing you to flip and fall back onto the floor with a thud.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHa ha, you fly like a fledgling,\u201d Ho-oh mocked jocularly, \"Let me show you how it's done.\"<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the crevices of space and time is the place where the Alpha Pokemon called his home: an astral hall made of aurora and celestial matters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the area he designated as a personal study, Arceus looked at all of the universes on the vast expanse of \u2018existence\u2019 he has summoned before him. Countless galaxies, stars, and planets swirled as he gave each one a glance. Normally, Arceus likes to see everything that is going on within his space simultaneously. But he quietly kept his attention on one particular universe where the human and Ho-oh getting ready to fly together within the simulator. He allowed a gentle smile to sneak upon his otherwise emotionless face. After assuring Lugia about his plan for the human, Arceus slowly plans his next move, making more notes of his observations on the crystal plate in front of him using an ancient writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Things are coming together for the next step.You will soon see, dear Lugia...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your host had graciously decided to give you flying lessons. You sure weren\u2019t going to say no to that! The only experience you had with flight was when a Pokemon you used to have carried you, but this time you were going to fly without a Pokemon. It was almost anyone\u2019s dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, it was all going to be in a very safe manner in a wind tube, but it was flight nonetheless. Given the control Ho-oh had of his inner world, you were sure even if it was a wind tube it\u2019d be quite the experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh's form stepped right beside you and expertly let the wind carry him upward, he even did a flip to show how easy it was. Feeling like that was taunting you, you extended your arms like wings and let the wind carry you. The strength of the wind left you breathless, for a moment you thought you would suffocate, but with some effort you breathed through your mouth. It was a exhilarating feeling, knowing you were weightless for a few minutes, and you were so focused on these strange and awesome sensations you almost missed what Ho-oh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to focus on your surroundings! You\u2019re never the only one up in the air\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there can\u2019t be anyone else inside you!\u201d Unless he also started flying with you, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh sounded annoyed: \u201cThat\u2019s not my point. Just do what I\u2019m telling you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter not to argue back, you figure. You forced yourself to stop getting lost in the sensation of the wind against you and looked around. The landscape was peaceful; it didn\u2019t seem like there was anything in particular to watch out for. \u201cEverything\u2019s clear\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he still seemed to be annoyed. Wondering why he was like that, you took a better look around. That\u2019s when you saw in the distance vague shapes. Is that what he wanted you to see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see what\u2019s that coming towards me\u201d it was like a group of bird Pokemon? Given your speed and how quickly it was coming towards you, you didn\u2019t have long to think. Dodging should be your priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t-oh\u201d he realized your eyesight wasn\u2019t nearly as good as his. Obviously you wouldn\u2019t be able to see it before this moment. \u201cQuick, tilt to a side!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rotated in the air towards the right. It didn\u2019t do much. The birds kept approaching at a steady pace. \u201cIt\u2019s not working!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh shouted: \u201cIt has to work! Push yourself in that direction!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feebly tried to move like you were told. The feathers on your costume helped somewhat, but your legs were getting in the way. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working!\u201d you say right when the group of birds \u2013 silhouettes that didn\u2019t even match any species you knew \u2013 enveloped you. Dodging the birds had been impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was obvious that, although Ho-oh tried to make you be as similar as possible to him, there was a limit to that. From the look on his face, you judged he hadn\u2019t considered it much before. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not a bird like you, Ho-oh\u201d you said, floating in the air, the group of birds dispelled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep trying. I\u2019m having fun even if I just failed at the very basics.\u201d Avoiding obstacles seemed like the very first tenet of flight. You wanted to keep giving it a try, both because you liked the experience and because you wanted Ho-oh to have the satisfaction of seeing you do this right. He did like that you still wanted to learn that, even though you had failed like that and he had overlooked that. He really had thought an anthropomorphic form would help him adapt flight to the human, but doing it like a bird was just too ingrained into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was supposed to be a moment focused mostly on fun turned into an ordeal when Ho-oh started taking this very seriously. Giving you instructions while you were in the air, he tried to find a way to get you to do this properly, while you followed his words attentively. Over and over the same group of birds kept coming at you, while you tried to avoid it as quickly as possible. You failed a dozen times, unable to move before the silhouettes touched you, until finally, on one attempt, you managed to move just enough for the group to pass right above you. You could have extended a hand to touch it if you wanted, for the second it passed above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was too close!\u201d Ho-oh grumbled. \u201cIf you were flying for real, that still would have been dangerous. But it\u2019s the best we can do. How do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel accomplished\u201d you hadn\u2019t been enveloped by the birds again, it was a victory as far as you were concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. We\u2019ll try to get you to speed up now. Pay attention\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLearning the basics of flight was more difficult than you expected. It had a lot more positioning and details than you had thought. With surprising patience, Ho-oh gave you every instruction. With some practice you managed to be halfway competent at flying. You had gotten used to the wind and to the weightlessness, so much that, when you landed on the ground, you had to stand still for a moment so you would once again be used to the solid surface underneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe illusion around you dispelled. The solid ground turned again into the springy mesh, and all around you there was the red and pink colors of flesh. Ho-oh, back into its normal form, seemed rather proud of himself. \u201cI\u2019m not so bad of a teacher!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re patient enough for it, at least\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not enough praise!\u201d he complained. Amused by his shamelessness, you praised him some more, until he was satisfied. It wasn\u2019t really forced; you were more than willing to say everything he wanted. \u201cThat's better. You know what, I should let you rest for today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when are you so concerned about my wellbeing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky I have thick skin or else I'd get upset by that question\" he said, pretending to be offended. \"Get back to your room. I have to rest too -- and hope the monks of the tower don't come and bother me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped off the mesh, taking off the visor and crest. \"Do they know what you can do with their insides?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never tell them. Consider yourself lucky you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do other Legendaries do this stuff too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh led the way. He seemed to be considering how to talk about this, but in the end, once you reached your room,he decided it was okay to tell you about other Legendaries. \"Fine. I'll tell you what I know as long as you don't go around telling humans once you return home. We're supposed to be mysterious, dignified, and distant\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean other humans have been harbored inside other Legendaries? How were their insides like?\" you asked, sitting on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that! You're the only lucky human who's been inside Pokemon. Now if you really want to hear about other Legendaries, shut up and listen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever been inside someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask so many questions, you're being nosy\" he bended his knees and settled on the floor, like he was going to spend the night there. Starting to feel sleepy, you got comfortable to listen. Did other Legendaries have internal wonders like Lugia and Ho-oh did? You suspected Floatzel learned to do it because of his friendship with Lugia, so it was unlikely normal Pokemon knew, right? There was a lot you were wondering about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon's internal worlds were unprecedented. Now that you had experienced how they were like, you couldn't avoid wondering about that.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">After your adventure within Lugia and Floatzel, you returned to your previous life of Pokemon training and exploring the world. You still meet up with the Legendaries from time to time to relive the amazing experience as a shrunken resident within their body. Lugia has gotten even closer and is planning on finding some ways to truly make the relationship work! But in the midst of this, a familiar face returns...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sequel to the Lugia arc in \"\"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1774401-Pokemon-Endo-Vore\" title=\"You suddenly shrunk and Pokemons wanted to eat you and make you explore their interiors.\" target=\"_top\">Pokemon Endo Vore</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"You suddenly shrunk and Pokemons wanted to eat you and make you explore their interiors.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1774401-Pokemon-Endo-Vore\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Basic Rules:<br>\r\n1. Vore is absolutely allowed. The trainer can enter from any part of the Pokemon's body.<br>\r\n2. The Pokemons have the ability to talk like humans.<br>\r\n3. The Trainer can explore the 'interior world' of the Pokemon. The locations can be real (i.e. stomach, brains, eyes, etc.) or imagined (i.e. rooms, chambers, etc.)<br>\r\n4. Erotic body parts/elements are allowed. This includes cock/anal/un-birth.<br>\r\n5. Digestion is discouraged; the main point is a \"Fantastic Voyage-esque\" plot.<br>\r\n6. One-sentenced entries aren't appreciated; be sure to make it longer.<br>\r\n7. You are free to add whatever you like as long as it is on-topic and not too short.<br>\r\n8. Enjoy adding to the interactive.</td>",
