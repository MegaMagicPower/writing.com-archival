In between all the chaos, a cave entrence stood solidly against the face of a cliff. Inside a red figure skalcked around, grumbling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCluching his staff tightly, he fussed of a few magic scrolls sprawled out in front of him. His eyes narrowed. \"Hmm, a pioson spell might be good, but a shrinking one sounds well enough too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to search the scroll, determind to find a proper spell that was simple but yet effective to use. When the first parchesment proved useless, he threw it aside. He grumbled further to himself, thinking of the time he first escaped Avalar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at least a week ago. His glass jar prison offered him much time to ponder, constructing a plan to escape. He tricked the elder to release him by proving he was good. They sized him back to normale, and he stole away the following night, heading towards the moantians to hatch his evil plot - to get rid of Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith him out of the way, Avalar (and the realms beyond that) will all be his. But right now, he just had to figure out a way to get rid of the purple-brate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden gust of wind entered the cave, blowing paper everywhere. One paper happened to fly directly in Red's face. He clawed it away and his eye was caught by what was written on it. \"Weight gain spell\" it said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the unstructions, Red smiled evily. \"This will do nicely,\" he said in a sinister tone. The spell was simple; all Red needed was a bowl of water and some liquified red and green gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as the instructions bid him, he fetched a bowl, filled it with water, and placed it on a stone table. Looking ito one of his bags, Red founded a full bottel of green juice crystals. But when he founded the red juice, it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake your choice (1): A full bottle.

Something caught my eye. It was sighning brightly, hidden away under some rock. I walked towards the where the object was. Lifting the rock I found a strange looking gem under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like nothing I ever saw in my life. It was white, but suddenly changed color to a bright green. I was in complete awe. The crystal was attached to a golden chain that glitterd in the bits of sunlight shinning through the roof of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo beautiful to just leave it there, I diceded to to throwit around my neck.

I didn't find much more than the gem and lots of ruins. Emphasis on the word 'ruins'. There was rubble and broken bridges and such everywhere. Homes and other buildings had become unrecognizable in their state. However, something felt strange from time to time, I can't even explain the feeling now. I wrote it off as nothing, which turned out to be a huge mistake on my part. Flying up felt a bit sluggish, as I had always been thin and quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of being thin, Sparx would sometimes annoy me about how thin I had been. It always reminded me of my past under Malefor's cruel reign, and it made me feel embarrassed about myself. Spyro had expressed his concerns about how thin, how hungry I looked. To be fair, my eating habits were similar to those of dragons suffering from mild anorexia. It didn't take a lot to see some of my ribs and I was usually hungrier than I let off, primarily because everyone around me had gotten used to my troubling habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow things have changed since then, thanks to that...

I felt very sluggish and tired, and I crashed as soon as I laid down in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after I had woken up, I felt just as tired as when I fell asleep, which I almost never had happen to me. I went to look at myself in the mirror and I was shocked to see my own reflection. The transformations that occurred on my body were mild, but noticeable. I looked tired, very tired. I seemed a bit taller, longer, and wider. I also looked like I was a healthy weight. It was exciting but also frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt conflicted. A part of me was telling me to find the source of my gain and solve it. However, most of me was saying not to worry about it, that this was how things were supposed to be. I wanted to take a walk, but I felt too tired to actually do so. Soon after I get back to bed and lay down for a while, my thoughts telling me to do something, before I take a short nap.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week had past since the event of the strange breakfast, but in those days things did not get any less peculiar: Ember's hunger seemed to increase with every meal she ate, her food portions piling up until she was eating the equivalent of a full-grown male dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, this showed on her figure quite visibly: she was developing pudge all over her body, her rear, belly, limbs, and face becoming round and soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her friends were deeply concerned about this, all except Flame. The red dragon found, for some unknown reason, that he was attracted to this. He watched Ember as she ate, feeling the strange urge to feed her, play with her growing belly and developing lovehandles, to kiss her on her soft cheeks. Flame never voiced this out loud, for the fear of being ridiculed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on one day, when they were alone in his room, the red dragon could not handle the temptation anymore. He decided to come clean, to reveal what he thought about this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber was busy nibbling on mango, reclined on a pair of cushions with Flame, her chubby body pressed close to the reed dragon, watching the sun set over the walls of Warfang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ember,\" Flame suddenly said, breaking the peaceful silence, \"Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" the pink dragoness said, resting her head on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been eating a lot lately and...\" Flame trailed off, embarrassment catching his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber rolled her eyes. She knew what was coming next. Yet another lecture of how she should watch what she's eating and the amount of weight she was gaining because of her unhealthy diet. Ember had heard this from Cynder, Spyro, and even the guardians! What was their problem? Can't she eat a little more than usual? She was not gaining that much weight, was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what Flame sad next caught her by surprise. \"And I was thinking of helping you gain weight and feeding you,\" said Flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber pulled her neck away from her lover and stared at Flame with surprise. \"Really?\" asked Ember, \"You mean that you like me fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame rubbed the back of his head, saying: \"Yeah, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber smiled. She could use this to her advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad someone excepts my lifestyle,\" she said, giving the dragon a kiss.</span></div></div>",

The black dragon was never very skillful with his element, but when it came to magic he was a expert, able to cast complex spells that only elder dragons could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his weak elemental abilities was not the reason why he was here; he was here because of his body. You see, Kas had a slender figure that more belonged to a dragoness than a drake. All through the black dragon's life he had always envied other's hulking forms. Being the youngest of six, he was considered the runt of the litter. All his older siblings were well-build, characteristics the owned from their father, but he was cursed with his mother's features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven here in Warfang things weren't so easy: he was picked on by his peers, getting a date was impossible, and his grades at combat training with Terrador wasn't so good. The final straw happened today, when entered a pharmacy to gets some herbs for an injury, when the silly mole at the counter mistaken him for a female. Some other dragons in the shop giggled, and the humiliation was too much to bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was here in the library. It was late, a good thing; Kas didn't want anyone to discover what he was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally found the spell that he was looking for, a spell that was meant for plants only, but he wanted to use it on himself. The spell could transmit organic mass from one organism to the next, making one plant whither away and the other grow. Farmer apparently used this on crops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKas stood ready, saying the words for the spell loud and clearly. First nothing happened, and Kas was disappointed, but suddenly a tingling feeling spread throughout his body and it began to grow a earthy green color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon grinned. He knew very well that the spell was active on his body now, that he can leech off any muscular thing, but the question was whom? There was the legendary purple dragon Spyro, who had a good body, and the muscular red dragon known as Flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kas thought better; he knew that they would get suspicious when they saw his bodies began to dwindle and his grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he had to pick another option. There was his towering behemoth of a mentor, Terrador. Kas was sure that this resaviour of muscle wouldn't mind if a little bit of his strength is leeched away. Hell, he wouldn't even notice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what's it going to be? Should he play it safe and suck the away the muscle of his mentor, or should he prey on the purple or red dragons?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
