She stifled a small frightened gasp and bruised her back against the concrete structure she was standing next to.She cursed softly and watched the vermin scurry to parts unknown,into a void.She thought she saw a male figure running into the streets quickly enclosed by the old apartments that leaned and hovered like sleeping vultures.She heard the wind blowing through some of the empty hollow buildings.Temperature was dropping,Jenny could feel her skin growing goose pimply and she shivered a little.Hot days cold nights,she could never get used to the dramatic changes in the weather .<br>\r\nWith some resolution and more than a little determination Jenny began walking forward.She did not know or care as to where she was going,she was leaving this area.Lights be damned.After a few twist and turns around debris and rusted cars and general bric a brac of refuse ,Jenny stumbled.It was dark around her now and her senses heightened immediately.She scrambled about headlong trying to find her balance.In the end she had fallen and she sat somewhat breathless facing a dead body.She could touch the body with her feet.She kick its proximity away from her ,taken aback,but not dumbfounded.Jenny scrambled to her feet and began to run towards the tenements,away from the body.<br>\r\nJust then a bright light flashed in her eyes effectively blinding her.In an instant she raised her arms over her face,frightened by this sudden illumination.She felt a sting on her neck that made her cry out.As she swatted at the location of the pain she noticed her legs were beginning to feel wobbly and she was quickly losing sensations about her body.Everything seemed to happening in a hurry.The activity was confusing and Jenny began to lose consciousness. </span></div></div>",

She rushed past crowds of people all out living their lives, even in the dark of night little Hong Kong was a bustling center of activity but mostly of the illicit kind. In her haste Heather darted right into a chinese man dressed in black. With a gasp Heather released her grip on the box and it fell to the floor.Both Heather and the stranger were startled and looked down at the falling object. The man grunted something to Heather as she quickly collected herself and the box. She drew herself erect and mumbled an apology as she turned away to leave, there was a sharp glint off the box as the ancient silver symbols on the box brightened for a brief couple seconds an act that caught the man's eye, the chinese man darted his eyes about to follow that glint but Heather was already gone.<br>\r\n Heather brushed herself;f off and she turned into a crowded alley full of boxes and large trash bins and general junk. She slowed her pace and carefully made her way through the rubble stepping over piles of debris as she moved forwards. There was a hard sound behind her and she paused. She looked behind her but it was dark, darker than she remembered, it seem the lamp light at the start of the alley had gone out. She waited but heard nothing further. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a notepad with the address and gave it a scan, Heather knew the address she was heading for was just a street over, a short cut was this alleyway.<br>\r\n She turned towards her goal and kept her ears open. After a few feet she heard a cough and a sound of garbage crashing to the ground. Heather quickened her pace  and made her way to the high wired fence at the end of the alley, she just had to get through to reach the other street. She heard shuffling,it sounded purposeful and it was getting closer to where she was. She arrived at the fence and searched for a hole, a tear, a cut away of some kind but there was nothing she would have to climb. She couldn't climb with the box she would have to push it through from below the fence to the other side then hop over. She stooped and began to force the box through the bottom of the fence after she had bent some of the fencing away. Just as she had pushed away her last wire mesh there was a clanking noise and Heather sprung to her feet she quickly began using her heel to force the black box through the fence.<br>\r\n Looming out of the shadows was the figure of a man, as he stepped into the light Heather realized it was the chinese man she had accidentally stumbled into earlier. She panicked and slammed her heal into the stubborn box, it seemed it had snagged on some wires and was having a hard time  slipping through.<br>\r\n \" The box.\" the man demanded,\"give it to me.\"<br>\r\n Heather could feel her heart beating hard in her chest. she scanned the area for a weapon as she dipped her hand into her small sack. Heather felt about her bag for something, anything. she saw some wood piled against a few boxes, if she could get to it that would be a good weapon.</span></div></div>",

Jonah could feel Pete's hot breath on his own unshaven face.Pete then whispered almost inaudibly even at the close range.<br>\r\n\"My wife and my little girl ...well...I don't think they are who they say they are.\" Pete breathed out a long build up sigh that burned Jonah's neck. Jonah stiffened then slowly eased away until he was standing. He was rigid with his motions as a panic welled up in him.He stared intently at Pete and pete turned to look into Jonah's eyes.<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" Jonah almost barked his words out but he held some modicum of restraint,at this point he could have withstood a hurricane he was that stiff.<br>\r\nPete shook his head and cupped his eyes. \"I know what you must be thinking Jonah...that I've been hitting the hooch again.\" He looked up at Jonah with pleading desperate eyes. Jonah softened and headed to the rolling bar. He up upended two shot glasses and  poured them both a good dollop of brandy. He walked back to Pete and handed him a glass. \"Drink up\" he commanded.<br>\r\nThe two men drank and then made their way to the kitchen table and sat opposite each other across a round dinette.They leaned in conspiratorially and spoke in whisper even  though there  was no one in the immediate vicinity.<br>\r\nJonah asked Pete,\"tell me about it. Jonah's heart pounded as he kept thinking about his own monster right above them,laying in his master bedroom where it had taken up residence of late. When would he notice she was not his daughter anymore,how far can love take you,blinded,before the truth sinks in. Pete began his story..</span></div></div>",

The men passed her by and she turned to follow where they were going.<br>\r\nThere were people all about.The stairwell had become very crowded all of a sudden.<br>\r\nMore than seemed possible.There was ample space between her and the people yet the people all seemed to be about to collide but it never happened.The she witnessed a door,a closed door and many other doors next to that one.The crowd had gathered at these doors and some people were coming in through the door and some were going out through the door.Nobody paid attention to Jessica so she naturally assumed she was invisible,but she was lost.At this point she didn't know what to do.She began to tune in to the murmurs until the gurgling sound became voices,clear and audible.She heard one man greet another.This seemed to be the general attitude on this stairwell.<br>\r\nPeople were greeting each other,others were talking and laughing,some minded there own business,some were hugging,or crying.<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard a female voice call to her and expressed surprise at seeing her.<br>\r\n\"Are you here too?\"was the question the woman asked.Jessica nodded not recognizing the woman.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The evening sun was a sight to behold in the sky. It was a large orange more  of the darker tones ball that  used its rays to illuminate the clouds and moisture into somber  soulful hues of the red and orange variety as dark clouds rolled by. The heat was as oppressive as it could possibly be this time of year. Any break leads directly into a thunder and lightning storm. with a loud crack,booming and deafening the break in the heat came. Jonah rocked slowly and steadily backwards and forwards in his old style wooden porch rocking chair. He watched the first few large bullets of moisture plummet to the dirt driveway , the driveway he was meaning to lay down some tar on  and turn it into a proper driveway, another project left in the maybe never bin in his mind. It had been six weeks since his little Jessica turned into foul hideous bloated creature that wore his daughter's sweet face only now it had mangled into distortion by the monster , his new baby girl. <br>\r\n Jonah heard the pelting rain as it came down in sheets upon porch roof and in general .It wouldn't last too long,Jonah decided,too sudden and too hard. Jonah thought himself a good judge of the weather. Meanwhile he rocked slowly back and forth his mind stuck on what his next move might be. He idly fingered his rifle in a caress along the shaft. He was determined,he thought, to use it tonight,after supper. He'd sit with his wife whom he playfully called Mother. He would sit across the small round Formica table from Mother and exchange the salt and the pepper.Their actions would be practiced more reflex actually. He would look up from his potatoes and smile at her gently. When she caught his eye he would smile and nod just a little.Jonah believed she understood his non verbal form of communication. He knew she would balk, he anticipated Mother turning her face away from him quickly lowering her eyelids. She may begin to weep or she may decide to get up and leave,never turning back. Jonah imagined his wife's face in his mind. She looked old, older than her years would assume. She looked tired,drawn in cheeks and deep pocketed  skull like eye sockets. Her eyes appeared preternaturally large and they were filled with fear and sorrow. They would eat mechanically,habitually. <br>\r\n Jonah was tired and he knew Mother was too. But this was not a tiredness borne of a hard days work or a job well done, there was no gratification left here. Jonah was tired beyond anything he ever felt before, he felt it in his bones and it emanated from Mother like waves it was palpable.That was why he had to be strong now, he needed his resolve, he was not going to be dissuaded by his wife , not her tears or anger or fright or by his own tricky emotions that threatened to overwhelm him even now.<br>\r\nThe rain and the thunder and the lightning began to dissipate,evaporating with his growing resolution. He heard the loud booming noise but this time it was not the thunder,this ruckus was coming from the upstairs bedroom, Jessica's bedroom. Jessica was trashing the place again and he assumed that Mother was cowering in a dusky corner of that room trying to coax her daughter to calm down. Jessica often did not like Mother's alternative dinners. Jessica demanded meat and it was of a very specific sort, the meat of a human. Obviously Mother could not just wander into the supermarket and order up a human chuck or human steaks. When regular meats did not pass approval Jonah had started hunting in the woods out back. He brought home various dead mammals and some larger critters. Jessica became  picky and Jonah then had to bring in the fresh kill as is to the child's bedroom where they kept her securely locked in away from prying eyes and government agencies. Jessica was a sickening sight to witness and Mother would often turn away bury her face in her hands and sob loudly,hard body racking sobs that tore at Jonah's heart. Jonah would stand very still and stare at his Jessica,his little seven year old as she devoured the fresh kill. But over time this was not enough and never satisfying to Jessica's peculiar habit, she demanded human meat. She had had it before,she knew what it tasted like,she craved it,Jonah shook his head as he remembered the young home health aide that was Jessica's introduction to man meat.</span></div></div>",
