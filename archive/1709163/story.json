            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chapter 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia pulls away in her Mazda RX-8 and takes Paolo to a garage where he had a choice of cars to choose from and then takes him to a safe house where he can \u2018lay low\u2019. With enough money in the bank, he can choose from a VW Golf, Ford Focus RS, Lexus IS300, Fiat Punto, Chevrolet Cobalt or a VW Golf Mk5. Paolo decides that he will buy two cars. He chooses the Golf R32 Mk4 and the Focus RS.<br>\r\nAs soon as Paolo leaves the safe house, the police are on his trail. Quickly and in a panic, he phones Mia, he then explains his situation to her and she replies calmly \u201cPaolo, listen, all around this part of town are things known as pursuit breakers, they are designed so that once they have been hit, they will fall and wreck the pursuit cars.\u201d Paolo replies, \u201cWon\u2019t they wreck my car?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d replies Mia, \u201cthe pursuit breakers are designed to destroy their cars, not yours.\u201d Confused, Paolo asks, \u201cWhere\u2019s the nearest pursuit breaker?\u201d Mia hesitates and then tells Paolo not to use the pursuit breakers. Angry, Paolo moans \u201cWhat do you mean, do not use the pursuit breakers? I\u2019m gonna get busted for this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d, Mia says, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing\u201d<br>\r\nPaolo complains, but then calmly replies \u201cI hope so\u201d. Mia then hangs up on him and then call him back, \u201cI forgot to mention, if you wanna run with Razor, you gotta keep the pursuit going for as long as possible, that way you will raise the bounty needed to run with him\u201d. Paolo then slams his foot down on the throttle, his Focus slowly pulls away and before he knows it, the Focus has reached 112mph, yet the Rosewood City Police are still behind him, nervous, he pulls a 180o handbrake spin. Facing the cops was not a good idea, now Paolo is cornered like a lone tiger. Reports have come through of a street race through on the police radio, which all of the cars receivers have been altered so that they can pick up the police frequency which means that all racers can hear the radio chatter on their receivers so they know what is going on where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo receives information of a 10-83, but because he is new to the city, he doesn't know what a 10-83 call is.  <br>\r\nMia phones up and says to Paolo, \"half of the Rosewood City pursuit department are on a 10-83 shout so you have no need to worry as much.\" Paolo then calls Mia and says \"Worry as much, are you insane woman, I'm worrying more than ever. And anyway what the hell is a 10-83 call Mia.\"<br>\r\n\u201cA 10-83 call means that there is illegal street racing going on somewhere. It's basically police talk and usually, a 10-83 requires backup from additional units, so half of the Rosewood City Police department has been drafted in to deal with the problem over in the Camden Beach district.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did the reserve units chase me, I wasn't doing any harm, I was only going to the garage to put some modifications onto my ride and they started coming after me.\" Paolo exclaimed. Mia then says to him \"the only way that they will come after you is if you were caught at excessive speeds.\"<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I was only doing 112mph.\"<br>\r\n\u201cThey see speeds exceeding 100mph as over the limit.\"<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why they came after me?\"<br>\r\n\u201cYes, now tell me Paolo, what does your tach (tachometer) read,\"<br>\r\n\u201cIt reads 120mph and rising, I haven't even got my foot on the throttle.\"<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because the model you have Paolo has a built in turbocharger in the engine, so even when you haven\u2019t got your foot on the accelerator, the turbo and the direct port nitrous oxide kick in to give the car that little extra power when needed most.\u201d<br>\r\nPaolo finally realises that the turbocharger had give him an extra 8mph without the need for the throttle. The direct port nitrous oxide injections also give him a short burst of extra power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sonny\u2019s ride was a blue VW Golf Mk5 with Chinese decals on it. With the race about to start, Paolo makes the final adjustments to his car via a computer that has been programmed to the cars ECU chip.<br>\r\nThe race gets under way but Paolo\u2019s Focus gets off to a slow start, which gives Sonny a slight lead, but almost instantly, the Focus gains ground and overtakes the Golf. Sonny tries to slide into the corners to catch the Focus, but hasn\u2019t got the handling of the Focus. Paolo slides the final corner of the course and takes the first race.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve won\u201d, said Paolo excitedly on the phone to Mia. Mia then calls back and breaks the news to Paolo, \u201cyou\u2019ve still got another race before you can bring down Sonny.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT? You\u2019ve got to be joking Mia, nobody told me about a 2nd race against these guys.\u201d<br>\r\nPaolo is disappointed, but deep down inside, he knows that he has overcome the first obstacle and has one more obstacle to overcome in order to make it on the Blacklist and one day become the Most Wanted.<br>\r\nThe next race starts in Rosewood Forest, past the garage and through the housing estate before coming on to the motorway and back through Rosewood Forest to the line.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to be easier than I thought\u201d Paolo said to himself, \u201cI\u2019ve done this route many times trying to evade the police. And it\u2019s paid off eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonny then says over the radio in his best English, \u201cDon\u2019t get cocky, punk, there\u2019s all to play for. If you beat me, I will hand over the keys to my ride, but if I defeat you, then both races will have to be run again to determine the overall winner.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? If I beat you, you\u2019ll hand over your keys to me just like that? No tricks or anything?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo tricks kid, just a simple pink slip wager.\u201d<br>\r\nPaolo thought to himself, \u201cthis\u2026 I mean\u2026 I didn\u2019t know that this was a pink slip wager where the victor gets the loser\u2019s car. OUCH! That must have been why I lost my BMW to that idiot Razor.\u201d<br>\r\nThe final race gets under way, again, the Golf pulls ahead, but the Focus has the power to regain ground and overtake the Golf, in the process, trading paint with the Golf. Narrowly avoiding the oncoming traffic, Paolo launches his Focus past the Golf and slides the corner taking him on the motorway. Sonny is slowly falling behind. As Paolo reaches the forest to complete the 1st lap, Razor calls over the radio, \u201cyou\u2019re getting luck punk, doesn\u2019t matter how hard you try, you\u2019ll be good enough to run with me. It only gets harder from here. Good luck in your attempt to challenge me, you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d<br>\r\nWith the Golf slowly catching him, Paolo passes through the forest and enters the garage, when all of a sudden he sees a mass of blue smoke from Sonny\u2019s engine. So Paolo stops his car and gets out of it. He walks up to Sonny and asks, \u201cHey man what happened? All I saw was a mass of blue smoke billowing from your car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonny tells Paolo, confused, \u201cMy engine\u2019s gone. What are you doing anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cListen, Sonny, in the Underground scene, I was taught by the best, ever heard of Rachael Teller?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe was my mentor and taught me everything I needed to know about street racing, and one lesson that I was taught was \u2018never leave a fellow street racer behind, unless of course in a Drag Race\u2019, but you know.\u201d<br>\r\nPaolo and Sonny got into a brief conversation and talking about what was going on when Sonny told him, \u201cAccording to the mechanic, the crankshaft and the camshaft have both split cleanly in two.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! Complete engine rebuild in my opinion, and I know that a complete engine rebuild is not cheap unless you know the right people.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know somebody that could rebuild the engine cheap, but do a good job?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do. Tell you what I\u2019ll do; do you have any rope that I can attach the cars together with?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI have rope.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood, do you mind getting it for me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me Sonny; I\u2019ve done this many times in the Underground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Paolo is helping Sonny, one of his tyres bursts. Sonny says to him discretely, \u201cI think you\u2019d better get a tyre changed because one of them just burst\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHave you got a spare tyre anywhere in your car?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I have one under my ICE install.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s an ICE install?\u201d Sonny queries. \u201cAn ICE install is a custom feature that can be loaded into a car in a special unit called a surround.\u201d Paolo explains.<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sell ICE around here, where\u2019d you get it from anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI got it imported from the Bayview Underground Racing Scene from a friend of mine who took it out of my old 350Z when I left the scene to come and explore new places and experience new things.\u201d<br>\r\nFinally Paolo changes the tyre and attaches the rope to Sonny\u2019s car as tight as possible. In order for both cars to start moving, Sonny needs to be in the Golf in order for Paolo to tow him. However, Paolo tows the Golf in such a way that it makes out that the Golf is slipstreaming the Focus. Both cars complete the race and Sonny hands over the keys to his Golf. \u201cHere are the keys like I promised.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if you ever need anything, just call me and I\u2019ll be there. And don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll have the Golf fixed in no time. Here is my address and contact number if you want to come and pick up the Golf alright.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOK kid, be careful with her and good luck for the rest of your time here in Rockport.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but engine is under the bonnet?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 300bhp Nissan Skyline RB25 engine, completely rebuilt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not everyday that a Japanese supercar engine powers a hot hatch. But it\u2019s possible, because Sonny\u2019s engine was in fact the engine from a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo V. That was powering a VW Golf Mk5. Not far short of having enough money to modify both his Focus and put some new rims on the Golf, he could also buy himself a new car. But what car? With $100,000 in the bank, he could fully modify the Black Focus that he used in the Underground Scene a few years ago, he could increase its performance by increasing the attributes to maximum and he could also buy himself the Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift Toyota Chaser. What Paolo doesn\u2019t realise is that the Chaser is in fact a standard drift ready model when it first leaves the factory bound for the showroom. He buys it for the drift events, but it can also be used for the circuit events when drifting is pivotal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chapter 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo\u2019s next blacklist racer is Taz. Taz owns a Burnt Sienna Lexus IS300 with custom body kit, red rims, drifting spoiler and custom decal. However, Taz has specific tasks which need to be fulfilled before anybody can race with him. The trials include being caught at high speed throughout different parts of the city; keep a pursuit going for a long period of time and other trials. This increases Paolo\u2019s bounty and also gets him closer to running with Taz. However, there are also races that must be won before Taz is challenged. Once theses races have been won, Taz is closer than ever to race, but Paolo is short of his bounty target by 1,500cts (cost to state/ bounty). Paolo manages to obtain the bounty by performing a point to point race with a difference. The idea of this race was to get a ticket from one set of toll booths to the other end within an allotted time. For this challenge, Paolo needed a quick car, so he chose the Chaser. Paolo pulls away from the line quickly and before long, he reaches the first checkpoint giving him extra time to reach the next checkpoint. Before long, Paolo reaches the next checkpoint and the third checkpoint is not far away, Paolo slams the throttle down and accelerates at a rapid rate. He reaches the next checkpoint and is given a little extra time to reach the final checkpoint. With a few hundredths of a second to spare, he reaches the final checkpoint, but the police are waiting for him. Meanwhile Taz looks on. Paolo pulls another 180 degree turn. He is now face to face with one of the pursuit cars. Both cars accelerate swiftly and the next minute the pursuit car is airborne. <br>\r\n\u201cThat kid\u2019s got guts when he\u2019s under pressure\u201d reported Taz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Razor reports back, \u201cI don\u2019t care whether the kid\u2019s got style or not, he\u2019d better watch his back.\u201d Later, Paolo can finally run with Taz. Both cars involved have near enough the same attributes, but the Focus has slightly better straight line speed. The Lexus pulls ahead by a few feet, but the Focus briskly regains ground on the Lexus and passes it. Both cars finish the race and the final race begins. The Focus accelerates hurriedly and gains more than enough ground over the IS300. Both cars finish the 1st lap and halfway through the second lap, Paolo gets a warning from his onboard computer saying that the engine was overheating quite quickly. Just before the line, Paolo\u2019s engine gives up, however, with the speed he was carrying before the engine shut down, the momentum was enough to carry him over the line, a few thousandths of a second before Taz crossed the line. The most extraordinary thing happened after the race; Taz got out of the car, gave Paolo the keys to his ride and offered to help Paolo get back to the garage. After both Taz and Paolo managed to reach the garage, Paolo\u2019s mechanic, Corey, gave Paolo some news \u201cthe reason you\u2019re engine has overheated is because your nitrous ntercooler has ruptured, causing coolant to go everywhere therefore the coolant not reaching the engine. Fortunately, the Golf was working again and the Chaser was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The next racer Paolo had to face was Vic. Vic owned a Blue Supra with custom body kit and Japanese BGW with black OZ GT rims. Paolo needed a Japanese car that was capable of staying with the Supra. So, Paolo chose the Chaser again, this time he had enough money to remodify the Chaser. Both the Supra and the Chaser have similar attributes, but the Chaser has slightly better handling when sliding corners at high speed. The Supra pulls ahead just as the race begins, but the Chaser has the power to catch the Supra and overtake it. The end of the 1st race and Vic is close to being busted. The next race begins but this time the Chaser pulls away from the line and stays ahead of the Supra throughout the race, to show off, Paolo slides every corner and pulls a 180o turn and reverses over the line, adding insult to injury for Vic. Vic then hands over the keys of his Supra to Paolo and also the keys to Camden Beach. The police now arrest Vic but while half of the police units are over in Camden Beach; SGT Cross is busy chasing Paolo for street racing and being caught at excessive speeds, again. Instead of being in his Corvette Z06, he has a Nismo Nissan Skyline GT-R (R34). This now becomes Japanese vs. Japanese car battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toyota Chaser starts sliding the corners to avoid Cross, and it pays off because as the Skyline slid into the corner, it hits a wall, ripping off the body kit and wrecking the engine. <br>\r\n\u201cPhew\u201d thought Paolo to himself.<br>\r\nThen Razor contacts him, boasting, \u201cyou are not worthy of running with me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, we\u2019ll see shall we.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better watch your back, punk.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHA! It should be you watching your back because I\u2019m coming after you and so are the police\u201d replied Paolo with a hint of confidence in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazor got angry, but had nothing to say so he slams down the phone. He knows that Paolo has bought down Sonny, Taz and Vic.<br>\r\nThe next race that was being set up was a drift event. \u201cPerfect\u201d thought Paolo confidently, \u201cI think I will use the Chaser for this race.\u201d<br>\r\nWhat he didn\u2019t realise was the fact that he was up against a rampant Rex and a \u2018kick-ass\u2019 wide, lightened 350Z. Both cars were lighter than the Chaser. But this brings a problem with the handling for both cars. Because both cars had been lightened, the handling was a lot harder when it comes to sliding corners. For this event, each car takes part in a 2 lap circuit and the winner is the racer with the most points at the end. First up was the Rex. The Rex has no problem with sliding into the corners until it comes to the 2nd lap when it hits a raised apex, sending it flying through the air, ripping off its front splitter and spoiler before it hit a wall which resulted in it writing itself off. Shame though. It was a Touge Heroes Rex. Next up was the Zeke, like the Rex, it has no problems with the corners until the end of the 1st lap when it hits a different bit of raised apex, sending it spinning into a barrier at 110mph, writing itself off. \u201cI\u2019m done for if I\u2019m not careful\u201d though Paolo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Paolo starts off his run slowly, building up speed and flicking the car sideways as far as he can get it. The longest corner was a spiral ramp. Paolo pulls the back of the car out as far as he can get it, producing huge amounts of smoke in the process. During the 2nd lap, he hits the same part of raised apex as the Rex, but Paolo was able to correct it and still managed to get the car extremely sideways before pulling a nitrous drift. This skill requires practice and if it goes wrong, devastating consequences occur. As it was, Paolo was able to hold the slide and even managed to spin the car deliberately to show off to the crowd that had gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What he didn\u2019t realise, was that the guys from the EDC had come along to watch. They were impressed by his style. In fact, they were so impressed that they asked him for a 3 car drift race. Paolo accepted and the race got under way. Both Subaru Imprezas got ahead but the Chaser was slightly better at holding high speed drifts. Whereas both EDC drivers had to apply their brakes before kicking the car sideways, Paolo didn\u2019t apply any brakes at all, instead, he shifted down, pulls the handbrake and flicked the car sideways as well as applying some N2O to the equation to make it that slightly more interesting. The EDC guys could not believe what was going on. They were talking to each other over their radios in their native Japanese, \u201cwhat the hell is this guy doing, you cannot use N2O in a drift. But that guy has style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the run, both guys congratulated Paolo and one of them handed him a card with the name of their manager and their location. The other guy says to Paolo, \u201cI like your style. But I have a question to ask you. Where did you learn to hold a nitrous drift a drift event?\u201d<br>\r\nPaolo replies, \u201cI learnt to hold nitrous drifts when I was in Angel City and when I was part of the Underground racing scene.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou were part of the Underground racing scene?\u201d said a mysterious voice. <br>\r\n\u201cYes I was sir.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember a racer called Takumi?\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cYes I do, he taught me everything there is to know about drifting.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTell me Paolo, if you know such much about drifting, how many types of drifting are there and name a few.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere are 10 types of drifting and some of those types include dirt drop drift, clutch kick, heel kick, handbrake drift etc.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood, then you know who I am.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the real drift king aren\u2019t you, Keiichi Tsuchiya, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. I\u2019ve heard that you are the best drifter in these parts. If it is true, then you\u2019ll be able to beat me in a drift race. I\u2019ll have my trademark Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno while you have your car. What do you say? Yes or no?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI accept your challenge Mr. Tsuchiya. To make it a little more interesting, let\u2019s make it a 5 lap race.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe race begins and Keiichi Tsuchiya pulls ahead. If anybody doesn\u2019t know who Keiichi Tsuchiya is, he is the pioneer of drifting and also uses drifting in non-drifting races. Anyway, Keiichi gets a bigger lead going into the 3rd lap, when out of nowhere; the Chaser overtakes him and pulls a nitrous drift again to get the car near enough sideways into the corner. Keiichi can\u2019t believe what he has just seen and at the end of the race, he goes to Paolo, \u201chow were you able to hold that slide at the speed you were drifting?\u201d Paolo then replies, \u201cI just don\u2019t know how.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was enrolled into a show off event by a crew called the Wildcats and one of the skills was a nitrous drift.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEvery drifter back home wants to know how you slid your Chaser with nitrous. Tell me your secret.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOK, in order to start the drift, your foot needs to be firm on the throttle, next, drift the car, but instead of having your foot on the throttle when you\u2019re sliding, inject nitrous into the engine first and then feather the throttle, thus controlling the drift and making sure that the car remains side wards but expect to be further sideways when in the drift.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you do when you inject nitrous into the engine when in a drift, do you keep the wheel straight, what do you do?\u201d<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later, Paolo answers, \u201cyou can have the wheel sideways when in the drift because the combustion happens when the switch has been activated on the wheel. The switch is linked by infra-red signals to the on board computer.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo what you are telling me is that you can nitrous drift without losing control of the wheel.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d replies Paolo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiichi thanks Paolo and leaves. \u201cWait,\u201d said Paolo. Keiichi turns around and says to Paolo, \u201cwhat do you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI want to know if you\u2019d be involved in some of the drift events, because some require more than one driver.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to be involved.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGreat! The next race is in a couple of days, all I have to do is get you signed up with my \u2018manager\u2019, Mia Townsend.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMia, eh? Lovely name.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI also have a picture of her if you want to see what she looks like.\u201d<br>\r\nPaolo shows Keiichi his photo of Mia and Keiichi says under his breath, \u201clovely name for a lovely girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Paolo leaves the event, with \u201cPrepare for War\u201d playing. Just as he got out of the car park, the police are on his tail, again, but this time, they were not after him. Suddenly, Cross pulls along side Paolo and winds down his window, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t happen to know what happened over in Camden Beach, would you, because we have had reports of a drift race taking place.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Cross, all I know is that I had gone into the car park because I was picking up something from a friend of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was the item?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA new ///ALPINE amp for my car.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI hear you have Prepare for War playing then.\u201d <br>\r\nSuddenly it finishes and Nightrage starts playing.  <br>\r\n\u201cNightrage, Frozen. Amazing song. What nationality is the band?\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cI think that they are Greek/Swedish melodic death metallers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNice.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I will leave you to your business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCross leaves and then so does Paolo. Next minute, Paolo receives a call from one of the EDC guys. \u201cPaolo, you need to get to casualty as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKeiichi has had a heart attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo phones Cross. \u201cCross, listen I need a favour, I need to get to casualty quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend Keiichi Tsuchiya has just had a heart attack.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, follow me and you\u2019ll be there in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Cross.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCross speeds off and Paolo follows, by the time they reach the Accident and Emergency department, one of the EDC guys comes out off the ward with his head bowed. Paolo knows something is wrong and he asks the EDC guy, \u201cHe\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid so.\u201d<br>\r\nCross now feels sympathetic and has his head bowed as a sign of respect. Keiichi\u2019s wife comes out in tears. Paolo calls Mia. \u201cMia, a friend of mine has just died and I have his wife with me, do you mind coming to pick her up and take her to the safe house?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure, not a problem, where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m at the Rosewood City Hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, escort her out and I\u2019ll take her to the safe house.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mia, you\u2019re a star.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia arrives and takes Keiichi\u2019s wife, Aiko, to Paolo\u2019s safe house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Paolo goes back inside to where Keiichi lay and started talking to both of the EDC guys when suddenly, guys from the Le Mans 24 Hours series and the D1 guys came into the room and bowed their heads when they saw Keiichi was finally at peace with the world. <br>\r\nOne of the D1 guys asks Paolo discreetly, \u201cdo you know what Keiichi died of?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was a sudden heart attack.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHe taught us all about drifting, and now he\u2019s gone, what else is there to learn about drifting?<br>\r\n\u201cPaolo has one thing to teach you guys about drifting, tell them Paolo.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cFine, it\u2019s called a Nitrous Drift.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s strictly not allowed. Nitrous is dangerous if it caught on fire.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, I know how to pull off a nitrous drift and still keep all four wheels on the floor.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine, if you think you can do a nitrous drift, show us.\u201d<br>\r\nPaolo jumps in his car and heads off to the hospital roundabout. He slides the car with ease and then hits the boost. When the boost reaches maximum psi, Paolo hits the nitrous control in the Chaser. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He keeps the drift going, to prove that nitrous drifting is not dangerous. This bewilders the Team Japspeed guys.<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Paolo stops drifting and the Japspeed guys talk to Paolo about what had just happened. <br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you have proved us wrong for now, but can you do that type of drift on a circuit?\u201d<br>\r\nPaolo smirks. \u201cEasy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cProve it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Japspeed guys take Paolo to the special drifting track that they use for testing before the start of a new season.<br>\r\nPaolo, Banksy, Shane and Danny all go for a spin on the track.<br>\r\nBanksy, being of Max Power magazine status as well as drifting guru, runs with Paolo as well as Shane and Danny in their Japspeed Silvia S15s follow. Just to trick Banksy, Paolo pulls a 180o reverse drift. This confuses Banksy.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell do you think you are doing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing pulling a 180o reverse drift for?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I want to,\u201d replies Paolo.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind just drifting properly?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I was only trying to have a bit of fun.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust show me what you got kid. Show me what everybody has been talking about in the world of drift.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Paolo mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he swings his car back to face the right way, he decides to pull a nitrous drift.<br>\r\nBanksy couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. Nitrous oxide being used in a drift. <br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s CRAZY,\u201d thinks Banksy.<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s good, watch what he does Banksy.\u201d<br>\r\nBanksy watches on as Paolo drifts with a nitrous burst.<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Christ, that kid has a death wish, but he knows how to drift, especially with nitrous. I wish there were more people who can pull drifts like that and still remain in control the way he does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe run ends and Banksy says to Paolo, \u201cyou must have a death wish. Or you are extremely stupid. But, nonetheless, that was the most incredible thing I have ever seen. Nobody that drifts can pull a nitrous drift, let alone control it with ease. That was remarkable. How would you like to join Team Japspeed when you have finished here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo didn\u2019t know what to say, he was just stunned at the offer of joining a truly remarkable drifting team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to accept the offer, here is my number. We would like to see some more of that drifting prowess. Bearing in mind, if you do decide to join, it will be against professional drifters, including myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the Japspeed guys left Rockport and headed to the next EDC race venue.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Paolo returns to Camden Beach and prepares to face his next blacklist racer. His next opponent is Izzy, a female street racer who owns an OEM Mazda RX-8. Her whole family were in the racing business and now she is one of that family. Her Mazda is just like the RX-7 Paolo faced a few days ago, but it was slightly heavier than the RX-7, which means that it can hold the corners well in high speed drifts without crashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo already has enough bounty and has completed the required number of tasks to face her. Both races take place in Camden Beach in around the industrial park. The first race will be from the bridge to the ferry port which means going through the industrial park. Both drivers pull up to the line waiting for the race to start. Out of nowhere, an undercover pursuit car pulls up at the cross section of the road. The car then pulls into the car park of the coffee shop. The driver of the pursuit car steps out of the car and looks around and sees both cars at the line. He doesn\u2019t pay attention to the fact that they are about to race. He thinks that they are at the lights to travel in separate directions. The other officer steps out and they both head into the coffee shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, the race can get underway\u201d, thought Izzy. The flag is lowered to signal the start. Both cars launch off the line in a cloud of smoke and burning rubber. Both cars are trading paint for the majority of the race, but 3/4s through the race, Paolo pulls ahead and stays there until the end of the race. Izzy then turns up at the line and congratulates Paolo for a great race but she knows if she loses the next race, not only will she have lost her Mazda; she would have also been busted by Paolo. This was a risk Izzy was not willing to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally the second race starts and like the first race, both cars launch off the line in a cloud of smoke and burning rubber. Both cars head into the first corner with Izzy out in front. But when she reaches the bridge intersection half way through the race, she runs wide which allows Paolo to get the jump on her.  Izzy then pulls ahead again, but runs wide again and again when she slides the corners. Paolo crosses the line followed by Izzy. She knows that she has been busted so she hands over the keys to her RX-8 and she waits for the police. By this time, Paolo has left and prepares for his next race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe calls Rog and asks him if he could bring Mia so that she could pick up his Chaser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRog replies: \u201cI\u2019d love to Paolo, but where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m at the intersection between Camden Beach and Rosewood City.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem, see you soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Rog turns up in his black Pontiac GTO with Mia next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you turned up because I have the police coming after me.\u201d <br>\r\nPaolo throws the keys to Mia and tells her to get out of here as soon as possible.<br>\r\nMia jumps in the car and starts it up. She slams her foot on the throttle and the Chaser disappears in a cloud of tyre smoke. Before long, Rog vanishes in a cloud of smoke. After a while, Paolo takes off in the RX-8 but the police where nowhere to be seen. Just as soon as he reaches the border ramp, the police see him and chase him. Paolo doesn\u2019t stop, instead, he launches the Rex over the ramp and lands smoothly, but the pursuit cars do the same, instead of landing smoothly, they have a rough landing and wreck the radiators of every single car. This gives Paolo enough time to reach Rosewood before the police are after him again. He reaches his safe house to realise that it has been overrun by police. Fortunately, he knew where another safe house was, so he headed back to Camden Beach. When he arrived, he saw Mia and Rog outside. Mia was holding a sheet of paper with Paolo\u2019s name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got Mia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis? This is your rap sheet that the police hold on you. It says that you have a total bounty of $155,750 and your cost to the state is $45,000.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else does it say about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt says here that you have 20 incidents reported for illegal street racing, causing a nuisance in a public place and speeding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was over the legal speed limit because of Keiichi\u2019s heart attack, but Cross let me off with that one. I don\u2019t see why the police still have recorded the incident when Cross told the administrator officer about the speed issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter Paolo, listen, you\u2019d better get the speed issue sorted as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo hands over the keys of the Mazda to Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRog, could you do me another favour, could you take me to the car lot, I want to buy myself a new ride.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo jumps into Rog\u2019s car and is driven to the car lot. Waiting for him in the car lot were 4 cars. They were a Nismo Nissan 350Z, VeilSide Nissan Skyline R33, Mitsubishi Eclipse GTS and an ABT Audi TT-R Le Mans racer. Paolo only had $25,000 to spend, but luckily for him, all the cars were priced at $6,250, so he bought all 4 vehicles. He got three of the cars transported back to his safe house in Camden Beach, but on the way back from the cat lot; SGT Cross sees the transporter and follows it to the Camden Beach safe house. By the time Paolo and Rog returned to the safe house, the transporter and SGT Cross were waiting outside. Cross then approaches Paolo and Rog.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I see that you have the correct licence for these cars.\u201d Cross then hands the documentation back to Paolo and heads back to the Rosewood City Police station. A few minutes later, Rog leaves and Paolo receives a phone call about his next Blacklist opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo answers the call. The call goes on for about 3 minutes before Mia puts the phone down. Paolo now has as much information on his next opponent and what car he has. His next opponent has a Midnight Blue Mitsubishi Eclipse GTS with an Asian style decal as well as imported AMS wide body kit and AMS tuning parts fitted to it. Paolo\u2019s next opponent goes by the name of Big Lou and he was waiting for Paolo just before the intersection where the Rosewood City motorway joins the Rosewood City town roads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo knew that he had no chance against Big Lou unless he had a car that was quick enough but light at the same time. Paolo finally decides to pick the VeilSide Skyline R33 and sets off to meet Big Lou at the start line. Instead of seeing only one car at the start line, Paolo sees two other Mitsubishi Eclipses just like Big Lou, but they were not modified and they were a burnt sienna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the people who want to know why Big Lou was with two other Eclipses, they were his escorts, not there to make sure that Paolo doesn\u2019t defeat Big Lou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the story, the race gets under way and both cars are bumper to bumper in a thrilling battle between two Japanese supercars. Big Lou has a slight advantage because of his remapped ECU chip but this only gives his car at least 10bhp more. Then, Paolo flies past without the need for any chip or even any nitrous. He just floors the car and the boost kicks in, but so does the turbo and the turbo timer is slowly ticking away. Paolo has a big enough lead, just as well because his turbo timer has shown that the turbo has finished its job and the boost gauge finally shows that the entire boost for this lap is used up. But, when the final lap gets under way, both cars have their boost back. This time, Paolo uses his boost sparingly, so that he has enough left for the final sprint to the line. The finish line is now in Paolo\u2019s view, but one of the orange Eclipses decides to block Paolo and slow him down. However, this does not stop Paolo; he pulls out from behind the Eclipse and just in time because Big Lou was quickly approaching the line as well. With the boost that Paolo has left, he sprints across the line at the last minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second race commences and both cars reach the first corner when the police notice both of them. The police chase them when Paolo rams a tanker. The entire tanker erupts, spilling its load all over the road and then setting alight when the driver drops a cigarette out of his window. This causes a large wall of fire which the pursuit cars drive straight through. They catch fire and finally burn out on the side of the road. The occupying officers manage to escape with nothing more than a few cuts and bruises. Big Lou laughs when he sees the aftermath of the incident and carries on racing. He catches Paolo and overtakes him. Just before both cars reach the line, Big Lou\u2019s car slows down. This turns out to be a loss of power which results in Big Lou having to complete the race with only half of the cars original power. Paolo uses this to his advantage because he pulls past Big Lou and holds the car in a slide. He finally reaches a straight stretch of road and tries to straighten up when he spins his car and it rolls. Fortunately, the car finally lands back on its tyres and Paolo is able to carry on. Big Lou pulls up behind Paolo and tries to get past him. Paolo pulls into the lane where Big Lou is and manages to defend his lead. They both reach the line when Big Lou steps out from his Eclipse and heads over to Paolo. He asks Paolo, \u201cDo you know what happened on the motorway?\u201d Paolo replies, \u201cYeah, I do. Want to know? I caused it by ramming a fuel tanker, which resulted in the fuel spilling everywhere and it igniting.\u201d They both laugh at what Paolo has just stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Lou congratulates Paolo on his victory and hands over the takings for the race and the keys to his car. All this happens while Razor Callahan looks on. When the police arrive, Razor walks away, smirking while Big Lou is pushed into the back of an undercover police pursuit car. Razor drives away and Paolo drives away in the car that he now owns, while Mia drives Paolo\u2019s car to the safe house in Rosewood City. Mia then calls Paolo to say that Razor has been spotted racing around the Rockport area. This news does not scare Paolo, because he knows that he will soon be ready to face Razor for possession of the BMW M3 GTR. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the mean time, Paolo knows he has to face ten more drivers before he challenges Razor. His next opponent is Baron. Baron owns a black Porsche Cayman with flame decals on the body kit and the whole of the car. Paolo must choose whether to stay with the Eclipse or drive a different car. He decides to drive Vic\u2019s old Supra but modify it. He heads over to the garage and enters the \u2018backdoor\u2019 store room. Here, Paolo decides to change the body kit, rims, spoiler, decals and spoiler while upgrading the engine in the process to give it more power, but also more stability round the corners. By the time Paolo has finished in the storeroom, the once blue Supra is now black with a new look all over. The once goldish rims are now black 17\u2019\u2019 RE30 rims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe accelerates away from the garage faster than it did when Vic was driving it.  The police drive past him without noticing that he is driving with excessive speed. The police finally realise that he has excessive speed when he takes off after launching his car over a mount of dirt that separates the northbound dual carriageway and the southbound carriageway. They start pursuing Paolo when they receive a call about a 10-83 taking place in the Rockport area. This 10-83 involves Razor and another street racer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron phones Paolo and says, \u201cIt looks like I\u2019m next, your winning streak is ending when you face me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so Baron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo then makes his way to Camden Beach where he meets Mia outside the safe house. They talk for a little while. Mia then drives off and so does Paolo. While Mia heads back to Rockport, Paolo heads back to the Rosewood City hospital where Baron was waiting for him. Baron then pulls up to the line and the official gets ready. The official lowers the flag and the race begins. Baron flies ahead but hits one of the pedestrian cars which allows Paolo to gain ground on Baron. When Baron finally reverses his car free, Paolo is already a long way ahead and the gap is growing every second. Baron uses a burst of nitrous oxide (N2O) to try and catch Paolo, but it is no use. Baron ends up losing the first race by a large margin. But,he knows he has a chance to redeem himself in the second race. Both Baron and Paolo pull up to the line where the official is waiting with the flag and the spectators. The flag is lowered once again and the second race is under way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron tries being clever into the first corner, but it doesn\u2019t pay off because he hits a tree, causing him to spin into the path of an oncoming vehicle. He collides with the vehicle, sending Baron spinning the opposite way and finally hitting a barrier. In the initial impact, Baron believes that his car is alright, but then he assesses the damage caused by the impact. The whole of the front bumper is bent beyond repair, the radiator is spewing fluid everywhere and the engine gives up because the fluid floods the engine bay. Baron now knows that his race is over. He admits defeat and is arrested. Paolo on the other hand has one of those looks which suggests he had something to do with the incident. In fact, Paolo had nothing to do with the incident, instead it was a sheer lack of driving skill on Baron\u2019s part and his keys are now in Paolo\u2019s hands. He gives the keys to the vehicle recovery truck driver, who locks the car and helps Paolo push it on to the back of the truck, which will then be taken back to the body shop in Rosewood City for a new front bumper and the engine will be replaced as well as the radiator being replaced and new windscreens installed on the car, this time, with a thick but transparent safety film. This film will stop the shards of glass from the windscreen going everywhere when the car flips over and the windscreen smashes. Meanwhile, Paolo heads back to Camden Beach where he will face Earl, an Afro-American. But before he challenges Earl, he must modify his car for the upcoming drift events which are tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore heading to the event, Paolo hits the sack, so to speak. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In spite of this, Paolo must now select which car to use. He can maintain the Chaser, or he can select another car. He nominates the ARP Mitsubishi Evo 8 from Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift for this event. As this car has had its drivetrain modified from a 4 wheel drive to a rear wheel drive, Paolo must learn to drift this new car, so he heads over to the local raceway for a few practice laps before the event starts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo can\u2019t seem to master the Evo 8, but then, he hears a couple of voices over the radio explaining to him what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you guys?\u201d Paolo asks the voices over the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Han Lue\u201d replies one voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I am Sean Boswell\u201d replies the other voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHan then says to Paolo, \u201cwe are drift masters, but be careful, there are a few people who take to Gaijin (English: outsiders) very well. There is one person who falls into this category; his name is Takashi, (also known as DK) in Japan because he has defeated all of his opponents and left them in a cloud of smoke. He is not like the other drifters; he uses his car as a battering ram to try to force the other cars off the road. I\u2019d watch your back, if I were you, because he is believed to be in the Rosewood City area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know where he is, because I have already seen him. He owns a dark grey Nissan 350Z with a VeilSide VS3 wide body kit if I\u2019m correct.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are indeed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I watch my back anyway, he\u2019s part of my crew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be having a laugh, there is no way DK will be part of any crew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got news for you Han, he\u2019s right here with me. If you don\u2019t believe me, why don\u2019t you ask him yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo hands the radio over to DK san and he talks to Han in Japanese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDK, is it true that you are part of a crew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is. I am part of Paolo\u2019s crew. It is called \u201cJapspeed forever\u201d\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you still got your 350Z or have you got rid of that, DK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still have it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m now in Camden Beach, I think\u201d, he silently asks Paolo where they are and Paolo tells DK that he is in Camden Beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut now I have many more cars to drive which is going to be fun to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to visit Camden Beach, I\u2019ve heard so much about it, but I have never been there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look forward to seeing you soon Han. Are you coming alone or are you bringing Sean with you?\u201d Paolo enquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be bringing Sean as well.\u201d Han responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, I look forward to meeting you guys. See ya soon.\u201d Paolo then puts the phone down and drives off with DK following behind in his Veilside 350Z.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo and DK head off to the event, but because DK is not registered as a participant, he has to settle on the sidelines and watch. Meanwhile, Paolo drives to the start line and prepares himself. The other racers are the D1 Team GTO, the Team Japspeed S15 guys, Banksy, and the guys from the EDC, BDC and WDC. Paolo knows what the Team Japspeed guys, EDC/BDC guys and the D1 guys are capable of because they all went for a run on the test track in England. The only team that Paolo doesn\u2019t know is the WDC guys because he has never seen them drift before, so he doesn\u2019t know what they are capable of but the only way to find out is to go head-to-head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 5-lap race gets under way and Paolo has already got an advantage over Shane and Danny because his car is lighter than their cars but Paolo also had a tank of NX nitrous in the boot of his car along with the ICE install that he was given from the Underground scene when he was driving the Corsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the race, Banksy has to retire with a ruptured radiator and one of the WDC cars had to retire because of a transmission failure. It was Danny, Shane, Paolo and the only remaining WDC car left. Paolo and the WDC car were bumper to bumper into the corner when Paolo uses his secret weapon and flies past the WDC driver, who looked on in shock. Paolo then past DK and DK was as shocked as the WDC driver because he has never seen such a scene before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final lap is under way when Paolo notices that his car has slowed right down, even with the nitrous boost. It turns out that one of his pipes ruptured and fuel was flooding the engine. Just as Shane Lynch caught up with Paolo, Paolo\u2019s car suddenly comes back to life and he is able to pull ahead of Shane and win the race by 0.6 seconds. The WDC driver finishes and comes over to congratulate Paolo on such a performance and the other drivers congratulate Paolo. All of a sudden, DK leaps over the barrier and congratulates Paolo on his performance, but he doesn\u2019t know what to say about the nitrous drift. At first, DK is confused, but after Paolo explained to DK what happened, DK understood and asked Paolo for some training. Paolo agrees to this and the next day, DK and Paolo are on the Camden Beach construction site. DK is in the passenger seat while Paolo is driving. Paolo slides into one of the corners and hits the nitrous again. DK watches on in amazement at what he is seeing, but then, he sees that Paolo has serious control of the car in the slide and DK can hear the engine red lining while Paolo is feathering the throttle to control the drift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, it is the turn of DK to try and perfect the nitrous drift. At first, DK spins the car, but within half an hour, he has mastered it and he is ready to race Paolo in a quick race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo and DK go for a spin around the abandoned construction site. They both perform nitrous drifts and DK controlled his car perfectly. After the race, Paolo is impressed by DK\u2019s performance and registers him for a team drift event.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chapter 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 days later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 days after the race, Paolo has to race Baron in order to progress up the blacklist rankings for a chance to race Razor Callahan and win his BMW back. Paolo can only dream of this, but in the real world, he has to race. At the start line, Baron waits while Paolo is still choosing his car. Baron is currently in his black Porsche Cayman S. Paolo finally arrives in an Audi Quattro. Paolo pulls up to the line. Baron looks at Paolo\u2019s car and snickers with a smug grin on his face. In his mind, Paolo knows that Baron is jealous. The next race begins and Baron accelerates with a massive amount of tyre smoke. Paolo quickly overtakes Baron and slides into the first corner. Baron is now looking slightly stunned at what he has just seen. He tries his best to decrease the deficit, but runs out of luck and time. The end of the first race proves that just about anything can happen when it comes to street racing. Baron walks over to his car and gets into it with a defeated look on his face. Paolo knows that he is one step closer to challenging Razor and finally bringing the police department\u2019s most wanted to justice. Baron suspects something sinister about Paolo, not just that he has his car wired up correctly with the right parts, but he also suspects that Paolo is working along side the police to bring the blacklist to justice. DK knows about Paolo but he is not letting anything slip because if he does, it could blow Paolo\u2019s and Mia\u2019s cover as an undercover officer and an undercover operative working for the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Paolo gets back into his Audi and sets off to the line where Baron is waiting. The official is already at the line with the flag and the line markers (smoke flares with red led lights in them to signify the line. They both rev their engines and set off. This time Paolo gets a better start than last time and sets off down the road, leaving Baron in a cloud of burning rubber. Baron knows that he must do everything in his right mind to catch Paolo and prevent him progressing up the blacklist. He catches Paolo before the line, but then slows right down. He doesn\u2019t know what is happening at the moment, all he can see on his Head-Up-Display on his on-board computer is that Paolo\u2019s lead is increasing rapidly and there is a wailing from the computer\u2019s oil sensor which suggests that Baron has lost a lot of oil pressure, but he doesn\u2019t know how or why. He doesn\u2019t think that Paolo is capable of sabotage, he just thinks that either the oil pump has malfunctioned or the main oil feeder pipe has ruptured. He just manages to pull up to a garage when Paolo flies past in his Quattro. The mechanic pushes Baron\u2019s car inside and tells him that both oil pumps had malfunctioned and the feeder pipes had ruptured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron is finally worried about how much it will cost to repair them. The mechanic tells Baron that he can replace them free of charge. Meanwhile, Paolo is halfway around the track when he notices a huge oil slick on the road. He follows it and finds Baron and the mechanic replacing the ruined parts. Paolo\u2019s friend Sean is outside the \u2018backroom\u2019 waiting for him. Paolo pulls up to him and asks why there is a massive oil slick on the road. Sean then replies, \u201cfrom what I have heard, your opponent has lost a lot of oil because of the oil pumps malfunctioning and the pipes that supply the pumps ruptured.\u201d Paolo looks surprised at the news because he didn\u2019t know that Porsche oil pumps and pipes could rupture. This is news to him. However, Paolo knows where to get the parts from, so he goes into his boot and pulls open a small hidden compartment where spare parts are and pulls out 2 Porsche Carrera GT oil pumps and all the pipes needed to supply them. Paolo knows that they won\u2019t malfunction or rupture because they are heavily supported. Paolo gives the goods to Sean and asks him to give them to the mechanics before the keys are exchanged hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police arrive on the scene and they attempt to arrest Paolo for street racing, but Paolo shows his police badge in front of Sean, DK, Han and the mechanic. Baron doesn\u2019t know that Paolo is an undercover agent. Cross arrives and arrests Baron after the keys to his Cayman S have been handed over to Paolo. Sean asks Paolo if he really is a cop and he agrees to the statement. Baron looks on with amazement after Cross told him about Paolo\u2019s true identity. Sean drives away in the Quattro and Paolo pulls away from the garage after the new, reinforced parts had been fitted and immediately catches up with Sean and they head off to the next race<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Han and Sean have borrowed cars from Paolo while Takashi is using his own. Mia is the official for this race. She raises the flag and lowers it to signify the start of the race, Paolo and Takashi head off around the first corner followed by Sean and Han. Takashi and Han form a snake behind Paolo. All the drivers are now approaching the tightest corner of the track, the notorious \u2018Super-Tight S\u2019 bend. In order to tackle it, the cars need the right speed and the right entry angle, otherwise the back end steps out and the car is sent spinning with the risk of writing it off. Luckily, Paolo, Takashi, Han and Sean all know the corner well and they navigate it with ease. Han and Takashi then form either side of Paolo and Sean for a \u201cfour-abreast\u201d turn on the widest part of the course. The race ends and Mia walks over to the group, who are currently chatting away about who will be the team captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean decides that he will be the captain and they get ready to drive away from the track when Mia asks Paolo a question. Paolo replies with a confident smile on his face. Then, out of nowhere, the police arrive and question Paolo about the reason(s) that they were on the retail park grounds. Paolo replies calmly, \u201cOfficers, me and my fellow drivers are just getting some practice before the invitational crew drift race at the annual Laguna Seca Open drift events where drivers from all over the world are invited and at the end of it, the overall winning team is crowned \u201cthe official Laguna Seca Open Drift\u201d champions.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officers ask the drivers to step out of their cars and ask for their invitations. Each driver produces their valid invitation for the event and the police allow them to leave after handing back their invites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group then head off to Paolo\u2019s safe house in Camden Beach to study the course before they actually visit the circuit. Sean, Han and Takashi find out that the course is a lot longer but a lot narrower than they predicted. Meanwhile, in the storage room, Paolo was thinking about what car and what setup of the car he and the rest of his crew should use because of the circuits sweeping bends as well as blind downhill crests and the famous Laguna Seca corkscrew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few days left until the big event, Paolo and the crew head off to Laguna Seca for a look at the course and take a few practice runs on it in the MotoGP pace car to make sure that they get used to the layout of the course before they head out on it for real. All of the drivers must take a couple of laps around the circuit so they know where to overtake and where not to overtake as well as the setup for their cars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Paolo and the guys hit the beach around the Laguna Seca circuit where they relax on the beach and listen to the cars fly past. They then decide to hit the pubs and clubs in and around the Californian beach area. They enter one bar where they order a few pints of beer and then they end up drinking vodka shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, they decide to call it a night and so they call a taxi and head off to their hotel. The next few hours are torturing them only because they are hung-over from the drinking the next morning. Luckily, they have a couple more days to sober up before they head out on the track for possibly the biggest race event in the racing season. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 11am, they head out to the garage to pick up their cars ready to head off to another state before heading back to California tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then head back to California after a few days on the beaches around the Californian coastline. All of a sudden, Sean radios in to Paolo to say that someone has tampered with his car, but he doesn\u2019t know who tampered with it or what they had done. They pull over and inspect the cause of the problem, nobody had actually touched the car, but because of how hard they were driving to California, the engine\u2019s head gasket had finally \u2018blown\u2019 after it was repaired when he first got his car 10 years ago which led to a significant power reduction and the exhaust gases being forced into the cooling system, which then led to his engine overheating and increasing his engine\u2019s rate of wear because of the motor oil being mixed with antifreeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, a vehicle recovery truck passed by and was \u2018flagged down\u2019 by Paolo. Sean\u2019s Evo was taken to a nearby engine repair shop where the gasket was replaced within a few hours and the guys were finally on their way to California again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey head to Portland, Oregon where they visit the town and the surrounding areas of the city. While they were in Portland, they visited some of the surrounding areas including some of the arenas that Portland has to offer. A couple of hours later, they head back to California ready for the race. They later arrive at the circuit with a couple of minutes to spare before the gates close to all participants and spectators. Paolo pulls up to the line next to Ken Nakamura, a celebrity in his own native country, but after the great drifting legend Keiichi Tsuchiya, Ken is the prince of drift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaolo and Ken roll up to the line where the judge raises the flag. The flag is then lowered and the race begins. Ken pulls ahead of Paolo. After half of the lap has gone, Ken makes a mistake, which causes him to retire with a punctured radiator. This means that Paolo moves into the quarter-finals, where he has to face Ken Tanaka, cousin to Keiichi\u2019s wife Aiko Tsuchiya. But Ken pulls out of the race because of a mechanical failure (i.e. the radiator has ruptured) leaving his car standing in the paddock.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each member from each participating team must be involved in at least one of the classes. The rest of the group decides what class they want to participate in. Sean decides to participate in the Americas class; Takashi decides to participate in the South Asian and Oriental class, which leaves Han to participate in the North Asian class. Sean, Takashi and Han all set off on their runs around different sections of the circuit. By the end of their races, the guys are one step closer to the elusive \u201cDrift Team of the Year\u201d trophy and a place in the Laguna Seca Hall of Fame. A few, nerve wracking hours later, the guys are called back onto the track in their respective race classes. Paolo and his opponent start their race. At the end of Paolo\u2019s race, he discovers that his opponent has been disqualified because he jumped the start. This means that Paolo is now in the final of the event, and so are his crew mates. All they need to do is to wait to find out who their opponents are in the finals. All of the guys have to face professional drifters in the final. Beating these guys was easier said than done. Each race commences and the professional drifters are not going to be well-mannered because Paolo and the other members of his team are newcomers to the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for DK and Sean, their opponents write off their cars after a high speed collision wit the wall, but the drivers are safe and well. The only injuries the drivers sustained were mere cuts and bruises. The medic car takes the drivers back to the paddock, where they will be checked out for any other injuries and then allowed to wait in the crowd or in the paddock with the mechanics. Han just passes his opponent on the last corner of the circuit and flies past the pit lane. Paolo follows suit and overtakes his opponent before pulling off his signature move. He flies past the retired drivers in the paddock sideways. The drivers can\u2019t believe what they have just witnessed. Banksy and the rest of the D1 teams come out and congratulate Paolo, DK, Han and Sean for their excellent performance despite them only being single-timers. They then make their way to parc ferme for the presentation and the celebrations. After the ceremony, the guys leave Laguna Seca with a smile on their faces, knowing that they have won the prestigious trophy and they now know that their names will be on the Laguna Seca Wall of Fame.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Present day: Blacklist #15 (Razor) and Paolo race. Both cars are being pursued by cops. Paolo then races Ronnie in his old Supra. Ronnie loses to Paolo and hands over $10,000. Next race, Paolo is racing Bull (Toru Sato) in a black McLaren Mercedes SLR. Again, the police are involved. Bull slows down which allows Paolo to increase the lead over him and Paolo is given another $10,000 for his victory. After the race, Bull runs off and Rog appears in his black and red Pontiac GTO. Rog says, \u201cWell look what the Underground let loose, let\u2019s see how you do in the daylight.\u201d In between Rog and Paolo are randomly customised cars which include a Mazda RX-8 and a 2006 Subaru Impreza WRX. The race starts and Paolo pulls ahead. He keeps increasing the gap between him and the other racers. At the end of the race, Rog congratulates Paolo and says to him, \u201cNice run, I like your style, just make sure you watch your back with these guys alright, see ya \u2018round.\u201d Razor then appears in his custom black 2005 Mustang GT with custom vinyl and RZ logo, and boasts, \u201cWhat\u2019s up poser, I like the way ya puttin\u2019 it down out there, I really am, cause I can\u2019t wait to get a crack at tha\u2019 ride, what didn\u2019t anybody tell ya, ya gotta put your ride on the line against a Blacklist racer, and that is why people aren\u2019t stupid enough to do it, I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d Now Paolo has two choices, to go ahead with the race and risk losing his ride even though it has been tampered with or go flat out to beat Razor. The race gets under way when both drivers are being pursued by the police. After losing them, Paolo receives a call from Mia saying \u201chey, there\u2019s something wrong with your ride, you left a huge oil slick at the start line, and you gotta end the race fast.\u201d Finally Paolo realises that there is something wrong with his ride, so he slams the car into neutral to try to the end of the race, but with Razor on his tail, he has no choice but to slam back into 1st gear. At this time, most of his oil has drained from the engine and the engine finally gave up, leaving him stranded while he watches his beloved BMW taken away on the back of a recovery vehicle. Finally Cross and his fellow officer arrests Paolo and takes him to the Rockport Police Station where he is thrown in a cell. However, without sufficient evidence, they later release Paolo when Mia turns up and causes a distraction so that she and Paolo can get away. </td>",
