These days always sent students from the nearby Yasogami High scrambling for their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was no exception for that, having ran back to his apartment as quickly as possible. A resident of Class 2-3 in the school, he was an exchange student along with a friend of his from America. So far, the transition was....well it was as good as you would expect. Learning the language was tougher than the classes. Then again, he had to know enough Japanese just to be considered for this exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all that aside, Greg was currently doing a little practice with the dual pair of wooden swords he had. He had a bit of practice with swords back home, as he always had an interest. Granted, no one really taught dual swords; that was more of a Greg thing. Still, as he was practicing a little bit, he heard a knock on his door. He knew who it would be. Only one person really came over that often. His long-time friend....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, coming!\" Greg says as he puts the swords in his hands, opening the door...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jacob knocked on the door, leaning onto his heel of his right foot as he waited for Greg to answer the door. He came along with Greg for the exchange as well. Inaba reminded him a bit of his old hometown, mostly small farmland and rural homes. He liked it. It wasn't a large metropolis or anything. Just some nice calm town. He and Greg were assigned to a nearby school, Yasogami High. He and Greg were placed in room 2-3 with some of the second years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob, unlike other students, liked to do research and study. He was very interested in weaponry, but unusual kinds of weapons, like scythes, glaives, and whips. He would do more research when he was bored to get more information on these. And along with that, he also was very interested in religion and mythology, especially with the beings concerning them. But that isn't why he came over. He kept hearing a constant rumor about a t.v. program that comes on at Midnight on rainy days. And it was a rainy day. The door opened and Jacob smiled. \"What's up Greg? You wanna try that Midnight Channel thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg pulled a face, \"Really? You think you'll actually see your soulmate?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob shrugged his shoulders and invited himself in. \"I don't know. That's why I wanna try it. Kids at school keep saying it works, so why not try it?\" Greg sighed, but let him stay to try. They passed the time ordering some delivery and playing some games or being left to their own devices. It wasn't long until midnight rolled around, Jacob sitting in front of the T.V. Greg stood beside him, \"You know nothing's gonna happen right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\" Jacob snapped quietly as the clock striked midnight. The t.v turned on and a static-y yellow screen was displayed. \"Huh? This...this is the Midnight Channel?\" Jacob said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smirked, \"I don't see anyone on screen. What does that about your love life Jacob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob shot a glare at Greg, \"Shut up!\" He turned back to the screen, something was off. It looked like the screen had dimensions. He reached out to touch the screen...only to go into the t.v. Greg shouted out in awe. \"J-Jacob?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob leaned in a little more, thinking he could....He stuck his head in and looked around, but he couldn't see anything. It was really foggy. Jacob also realized he was stuck inside. He began to push on the outside of the screen before he pulled out from the t.v, hitting his head on a table behind him. The t.v turned off as soon as he did. \"Ow! Ow ow ow ow....\" he exclaimed, rubbing his head.\"So it's true....can this work on any t.v?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked confused for a few reasons. \"You wanna try again?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course....actually, there's a flat screen at Junes we could try it on...\" Jacob thought before standing up. \"Let's meet at Junes tomorrow, ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sighed, he was officially interested now. \"Fine.\" Jacob soon went to his apartment to sleep, ready to try again tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there was one thing Greg found hard to adjust to in Japan, it was having school on Saturdays. Thankfully, the multitude of holidays they had here kind of evened things out, but boy was it odd. Still, at least things were rather welcoming here. He and Jacob got the usual heckling you'd expect transfer students to get, but overall, things were pretty good. The two of them had split for a while to clear up their own business, and Jacob had gone ahead after school had ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a bad feeling about this.\" Greg sighed. He had never been the type for these mythical sorts of things; he mostly left those to Jacob. As a precaution, he brought his wooden swords with him, as who knows what could happen. He was glad though that no one seemed to think oddly of him with them though. He had noticed upon their arrival in Inaba how uptight a lot of people were, mostly due to the string of murders in the area. It was quite chilling to think about, which was probably why Greg didn't like to think about it. Trouble was the last thing he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, he found the elevator, taking himself up to a certain floor at Junes. The place was essentially the Japanese equivalent to Walmart; both in terms of size and reputation for the most part. Greg got that vibe no doubt from all the disturbing rumors of the place. He felt pity for whoever ran the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg!\" He immediately heard his name called as he exited the elevator, seeing Jacob there with his backpack still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you set then?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, got all my stuff. I needed to make sure I had what I needed.\" Jacob replied with a smile. Greg simply nodded in reply as both boys began making their way towards the electronics area. There were never a lot of people there, so it was perfect for a private moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to ask, what made you think of here of all places?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I tried to think of big TV's, this was what came to mind.\" Jacob replied. \"Ours is okay, but not that big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough...\" Greg groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two found the big TV Jacob had talked about. As usual, there were few customers. Once Greg had made sure no one was looking, he briefly touched the screen, immediately seeing a ripple like water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....as they say, age before beauty.\" Greg mock bowed with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only 3 weeks younger, you ass.\" Jacob smirked back with a light shove. Still, he took a deep breath, slowly putting one arm in. It was strange seeing the screen light up like that when he did, but his sense of adventure won over, and he took the dive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob!\" Greg called as Jacob fully vanished inside. He hadn't expected Jacob to go right in. \"Ugh, if this gets us killed, I'm going to kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring what was wrong with that vocabulary, Greg put his arm slowly through, before closing his eyes and jumping in, leaving nothing where the boys were to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Inside the TV World*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like being in a wormhole, or so Greg thought after he jumped. The black and light lines that came through as he fell gave him an odd sense of vertigo. He couldn't see anything else but it until it caused him to blackout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Greg knew it, he was surely on solid ground, though he could feel a headache coming. Groaning, he slowly opened his eyes, and immediately wondered if something was wrong with his vision. There was....nothing but yellow around him. He seemed to be on some structure, but it was hard to make out. Already his eyes felt weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob!\" Greg called, hoping for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here!\" He heard reply to his right. As Greg turned, he could see Jacob getting to his feet as well. He was likely knocked out as well. Greg struggled to his feet, giving Jacob a hand as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Jacob said. \"Wow....what is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Greg said. \"You know....this reminds me of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. You know, that stuff with the Twilight Realm? The glow here gives me a very similar feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....you'd best hope it's not the same.\" Jacob said. \"You remember what happened to the people in that game, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, point taken.\" Greg replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, this is what's inside the t.v?\" Jacob said looking around. It was hard to see too much, with all the fog. \"Fog here too huh?\" He said looking around. He could make out a few things. There was a weird symbol on the floor, black circles and such, reminding him of a target board. He could see a few metal walkways at their level, and a few lights and metal beams hung above them. \"Is this a filming a studio?\" He asked no one in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now? We're in a t.v. Have a plan?\" Greg said,  asking Jacob in a voice saying 'I will kill you here if you don't'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob waved his hand. \"I do. We explore.\" Jacob dropped the bag down and pulled out a leather whip, very standard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...where did you get an actual weapon?!\" Greg asked surprised. He never spoke about having one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I bought it before I came here. There's this shop, Daidara's Metalworks or something. He sells a lot of old antique weapons.\" Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't think to let me know? I have wooden swords!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You suck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was welcoming banter to this otherwise stressful situation. \"Just come on. Let's see what's this way.\" Jacob said heading down a path. Greg followed hesitantly as they wandered the inside of a t.v.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed as the two walked. They were walking down a foggy path still. Both of them were tired from their walking.\"Hey, you bring along snacks or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob laughed nervously, \"To be honest, I thought we'd be out by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dead, Jacob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a-. Huh?\" Jacob soon noticed the ground was different, now an asphalt look and feel to it instead of that of a walkway. The two looked forward to see an odd looking path. \"I...I've been here before.\" Jacob commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg knew what he meant, since he had always been here before. \"This is a street in Inaba right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jacob answered. \"It had some takoyaki place and a shrine further down the road.\" Jacob recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this mean?\" Greg began saying before there was a loud noise. The two turned to see something....something. It was an odd striped shell, floating, with....lips and a...a tongue? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg took a few steps back. \"Jacob. You have ten seconds to tell me what that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being quickly moved toward them, swinging it's entire body at them, but the two managed to dodge out of the way. Jacob pulled his whip out and let it reach and make contact with the thing's skin before yanking the whip back. The being recoiled in pain and turned to face Jacob. As it did so, Greg took the opportunity to get behind it and strike it. The thing yelled out as it turned and struck Greg, knocking him back. Jacob soon hurried toward Greg's side. \"You good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, but I don't think these are doing too much. You have an idea?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was ready to give up when a loud flash went out. Jacob and Greg both saw something floating in front of them. Cards. Like playing cards or something. Jacob reached out to his and Greg to his, and as they went to grab it, a word seemed to enter into their mouths. \"Persona....\" they both grabbed a hold of their cards as they flashed and two beings appeared. In front of Greg was a man dressed in the armor of an emperor or a general in old Japanese times, Jacob recognized him as a way-way-too-close resemblance to Oda Nobunaga. In front of Jacob was a large blue dragon, water sliding off it's blue skin. Jacob didn't recognize him entirely, though it reminded him of Kohryu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The 'personas' soon performed an action. Greg's took up a blade and made a strong slash, slicing into the tongue-thing as Jacob's roared, ice enveloping the being as it shattered, icy shards digging into the being, which slammed into the ground and vanished in a black and red mist. The two beings vanished and Greg and Jacob were left there again. \"Jacob....you have another ten seconds to say what that was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob shrugged. \"I-I honestly don't know...we called them...Personas?\" Jacob said. He suddenly noticed a bright light getting close. With not enough time to get out of the way. Jacob pushed Greg to the side. \"Watch out!!\" He said before being struck by a bolt of lightning. Jacob was tossed like ragdoll through a building's display window as he laid on the ground, fading in and out of consciousness, groaning in pain amd writhing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob!!\" Greg said, he looked toward the new being. A large being with wheels for legs, spike instead of arms, and a yellow mask. Greg knew he didn't stand amd chance. The being was ready to strike again when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Go Izanagi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Greg heard that, a rush of lightning surged forth, hitting the strange being square in the chest. The being wobbled back in forth before collapsing, falling into the same red mist as before. Catching his breath from that, Greg looked up to see another strange being like that \"persona\" Jacob mentioned. The being was mostly black with a large weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Greg spat out before he suddenly saw a hand near his face. He looked up to see a silver-haired teenager above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" the silver-haired boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, y-yeah.\" Greg sputters as he staggers to his feet. No sooner that he does that he remembers. \"Wait! Jacob! He got blasted through that window!\" Greg cried out, not quite sure what was going on, but knew that Jacob needed to be tended to. The silver-haired boy looked to the crashed window quickly, seeing the injured Jacob inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks bad.\" the boy said before turning. \"Yukiko, someone needs help!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his word, Greg suddenly turned around, seeing a group of people around. Some were actually clearing away some other dark beings that showed up. However, when the boy cried, Greg saw a dark-haired girl run over. She wore the typical school uniform, though with a red cardigan over it, and wore a red headband. Slowly, they retrieved Jacob from inside, who seemed to be knocked out by now. Once he was out, Greg saw her concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konohana Sakuya.\" At those words, Greg saw another being, this one mostly white and pink, appear. Then, Greg saw her channeling something into Jacob. Perhaps it was because he played one too many RPG's, but he imagined this had to be some sort of healing. The group didn't look malicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need any patching up?\" asked the silver-haired boy to Greg, who turned his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no.\" Greg said. \"I'm just a little dinged is all.\" Greg shook his head, trying to get his thoughts straight. \"Thanks....for saving us back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy seemed to smile. \"It's no trouble. We're just glad we made it in time.\" Then, the boy continued by offering his hand. \"I'm Yu Narukami by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg Henry. Pleasure.\" Greg said, returning the shake. \"Oh, and that's Jacob as you can see.\" Greg motioned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you guys ran into a pretty tough Shadow.\" Yu pointed out. \"You don't normally see ones that strong here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow? What's that?\" Greg asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now's probably not the time to explain.\" Yu said. \"We should get out of here as quickly as possible. I'll help you both back to the exit.\" Yu explained this as he helped Jacob up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an exit!\" Greg exclaimed. \"Oh, thank god. I was worried for a while when we didn't see one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you don't have to worry.\" Yu smiled. \"Teddie left it open, so I'll help you back while the others here do a little clean up. We wouldn't want more shadows coming out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping for a better explanation later, Greg decided to remain quiet, staying close to Yu while he watched the others take out other shadows. As they approached the film set area again, Greg decided to talk. \"So really, who are you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yu walked towards a stack of TV's, he just turned and smiled. \"Apparently, the same as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Real World, Greg's Apartment*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" Jacob groaned as he finally came to, seeing himself on a couch with a blanket on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back.\" Greg deadpanned from a seat nearby. \"Hope you like my couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the attack, Jacob slowly got up, stretching his aching body. \"So...we're back in your apartment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Greg said. \"After you got knocked out, some other guys showed up. Judging by their clothes, looks like they go to the same school as us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? But....\" Jacob tried to start, but Greg knew what he would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call them? Personas? Looks like they have them too.\" Greg said. \"One of them actually healed your injuries. Probably saved us from an explanation at the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Jacob said as he was getting the picture. Looking outside, it was probably late afternoon. Perhaps it was time for some dinner....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KNOCK* *KNOCK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys jumped a bit at the sudden knock on their door. Jacob was wondering what it could be, but Greg had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*****Flashback*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send someone to come over later.\" Yu said as he was about to leave. He had set Jacob on the couch. \"I need to go back and make sure they're okay. I'm sure they would love to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****End flashback*****</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's Yu's friends.\" Greg said. He didn't get a good look at them before, so he was admittingly a bit curious to see what they were like. He walked over and slowly opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside were three people. The first one was the black-haired girl who had healed Jacob's wounds. The second one was a light brown-haired girl who wore a green sweater over her uniform. Greg didn't know why, but she had a really contagious grin on her face. The third person....actually Greg couldn't make the person out. Was that a boy or a girl? He couldn't tell. The third person was shorter than the others, wearing a boys uniform, and having a hat covering short blue hair. The person was pretty lanky, but Greg didn't get the feeling that the person was a guy. Call it a hunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the light brown-haired girl smiled again. \"Hey there! Mind if we come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure.\" Greg said, letting them all come inside. Jacob immediately tensed up, seeing them all come in. Before anything could be said though, the black-haired girl gave a courteous bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I didn't get the time to say so before. I'm Yukiko Amagi.\" Yukiko smiled, shaking Greg's and Jacob's hands. Before Greg could reply though, the other girl jumped in and grabbed his hand...or crushed it, either one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Chie Satonaka! Nice to meet you!\" Chie smiled before turning to the 3rd person. \"Well Naoto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other person suddenly tensed up at the mention. \"Oh...I'm Naoto Shirogane. Sorry for the intrusion.\" The person spoke pretty softly, almost a bit hard to hear. However, that term suddenly caused Greg and Jacob's eyes to widen. Shirogane? They heard that name before? Wasn't that the so-called \"Detective Prince\" that was actually a....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that cleared that up at least.</span></div></div>",

Greg got it since it was pretty cheap and had everything he needed, bed, kitchen, a living room and bathroom. Jacob's apartment was no different, being fairly small. Nonetheless, there was room in there for all of them. Yukiko and Chie took a seat on the couch, Naoto stayed standing by the couch. Jacob took a seat in a chair as Greg took the free space on the couch beside Chie. \"I'm Greg, and that's Jacob there.\" Greg said, motioning over to Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You two must be the new transfer students that arrived,\" Naoto deducted, receiving confirmation from Jacob and Greg that they were in Room 2-3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you doing? You're looking better,\" Yukiko spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg leaned forward, speaking up a little. \"Oh yeah, she's the one who healed you Jacob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob turned to face the red-clad girl. \"Really? Thank you.\" Jacob smiled a bit and bowed his head. \"So I'm guessing all of you use personas as well then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto nodded, joining into the conversation. \"That's right. I've only discovered my power with it recently as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was first there when Yu and Yosuke went in.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What was that like?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'd rather not talk about that, haha...\" she replied, embarrassed for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob shrugged and turned back to face Naoto. \"Hey, I noticed something while me and Greg were fighting those....uhm...\" Jacob had come up with a name for them yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean a Shadow?\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto spoke up and nodded. \"Yes. We call those beings in the T.V Shadows. We're still trying to figure out exactly what they are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. While we were fighting Shadows, Greg's Persona looked a lot like Oda Nobunaga.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? As in the Warlord Nobunaga during the Warring States time?\" Yukiko said with great interest, looking back to Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! He....did stuff, right?\" Chie said, not remembering the entire lesson on Nobunaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto spoke up. \"He conquered about a third of Japan in the 16th Century. That sounds like a helpful persona to have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg kinda smirked a bit. Although he was new to this whole \"Personas and Shadows\" thing, having Nobunaga as one seemed pretty cool to him. Jacob leaned back a bit, thinking some more. \"So...what's the point of the T.V world? What's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we still aren't sure about that, but...it's tied to the murders that have happened recently.\" Chie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and Greg both took attention to that immediately. \"How?!\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's taking people and throwing them into the T.V. Then, when the fog comes here, the fog lifts there and the Shadows kill whoever is on the other side. Actually, me and Naoto were kidnapped.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two were kidnapped?!\" Jacob and Greg asked in union. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we went in and rescued them.\" Chie spoke up, a bit of triumph lined her voice as she said that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob thought again, \"How did you know they were inside the T.V?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, The Midnight Channel.\" Chie replied, assuming that Greg and Jacob already knew of it since they managed to go into a T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what it does!\" Jacob exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, whenever someone enters into the T.V world, they show up on the Midnight Channel.\" Naoto explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jacob, this was surprisingly all making sense. Greg spoke up after being silent for a little bit. \"So what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back to Junes later, by the food court. The rest of us will be there and we'll talk about what to do next.\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discussion continued, turning into small talk between them all about classes or things of the like. Greg seemed to go into a long conversation with Chie about fighting styles, Yukiko joining in here and there. Jacob had been talking to Naoto a bit about her profession and his interest in it. The two seemed to enjoy the conversation a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three soon got around and left, leaving Greg and Jacob there. \"So...Junes later?\" Jacob said, kicking his feet up and sitting sideways on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think we have that much of a choice. What have we gotten ourselves into?\" Greg asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out,\" Jacob grinned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was September 25. It was a Sunday, which both guys were thankful for. Jacob was mostly better, but still a bit achy from the ordeal. Greg was thankful that he wouldn't have to do any explaining to any police or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Greg got a text from Yu, saying that he was leaving for Junes soon. The two had exchanged numbers just before Yu left the apartment the other day. Greg could tell that Yu was the leadership type, as if he knew exactly what to do. Well anyway, after walking over to Jacob's next door apartment to wake him up, the  two were on their way a little ways after 9:00. It was pretty early, but Greg figured that it would be best. There was a lot to cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" asked Greg as they both went into the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...just stings a tiny bit.\" Jacob winced a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't push it.\" Greg reminded, getting a reluctant nod from Jacob. Eventually, they had reached the top, looking out over the area. There always seemed to be teens here, regardless of which day it was. Guess it was that kind of place. The two boys walked through the crowd, making their way around. Soon enough, Greg heard a shout aimed at them. He looked to his left, seeing Yu waving from a table. However, the shout seemed to come from the bright-haired boy sitting next to him. Standing next to them was.....wasn't that the mascot that was always around Junes? That weird bear thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yu.\" Greg smiled as both guys exchanged a shake with him. \"And you are?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yosuke Hanamura.\" the boy smiled, offering a shake as well. As they did though, Greg's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? Yosuke? As in....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my dad kind of runs the place. I get that a lot.\" Yosuke seemed to grimace a tiny bit at that. \"Have a seat. The others haven't shown up yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Jacob said, eagerly taking a seat. Right as he did though, he saw the bear looking at him. \"Um, what's with the mascot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddie, leave him alone.\" Yosuke sighed. \"I'm putting back on duty if you mess around with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not nice, Yosuke!\" Greg and Jacob jumped a bit when they actually heard it talking. \"I've been working hard all week! You never let me have any fun, just like with the ice cream machine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you were hogging it up! Do you have any idea how much trouble you put me in?!\" Yosuke said back. The two then started going back and forth, causing Yu to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too alarmed. They do this all the time.\" Yu explained. Though, he noticed the still-shocked looks on their faces.\" Oh yeah, Teddie is part of the group too. He's a Persona-user as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Greg asked. \"But...what is he anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....we don't really know. He's originally from the TV World.\" Yu explained. \"But he doesn't really remember much about how he came to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, amnesia. Always a plot device.\" Greg pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet.\" Jacob sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you were thinking the same thing.\" Greg retorted. For a while, Yosuke and Teddie continued to go at it, until another voice interrupted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys going at it this early in the morning?\" The boys looked back, seeing another boy there. He looked bigger than the others, with slicked back blonde hair. Greg briefly saw Jacob recoil a tiny bit at the vibe the boy gave off. Thankfully, Yosuke broke up the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Kanji.\" Yosuke smiled. \"Meet the newest Persona users we told you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kanji looked towards Greg and Jacob, smiling a bit. \"Ah, so it's you two. I'm Kanji Tatsumi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg Henry.\" Greg shook his head. Jacob introduced himself as well, also shaking. Though, his body ached a tiny bit as he did, causing him to sit back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You alright?\" Kanji asked with a bit of worry. \"I-I didn't mean to grab too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah..\" Jacob smiled. \"I'm just still aching from yesterday. Just have to work it off.\" He assured. Kanji looked a little troubled, but Yu gave him a gentle nod and he took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...is it just us?\" Kanji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the girls were invited too, but I guess they're running a bit late. Funny, I figured Naoto would have been here at least.\" Yosuke said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, you know she's always got something on her mind.\" Yu replied. \"Well, you guys met most of them yesterday, right? You think we should get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well. I'd really like to know what's going on.\" Greg said a bit impatiently. Yu and Yosuke nodded to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right...so I believe Naoto gave you some basics before?\" Yu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she told us some things about the TV and the Shadows.\" Greg said. \"So, in a nut shell, it's some other world with monsters crawling everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one way of putting it.\" Yosuke nodded. \"Partner here...\" he pointed in Yu's direction, \"was the first to discover it out of all of us. He was also the first to summon a Persona, and he didn't have to fight his own Shadow for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that raised Greg and Jacob's eyebrows. \"His own Shadow?\" Jacob asked. \"You talking about something more specific?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke, Kanji, and Teddie visibly sighed, as if it wasn't a pleasant topic. \"Yeah...normally when you get tossed into the TV, your own Shadow appears. It looks almost exactly like you, basically reflecting the side of you that you don't want to admit. Your darker desires in a way. Everyone has them, even if they don't know it.\" Yosuke explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...sounds rough.\" Greg said. \"So, does that mean you've done it before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Kanji spoke up. \"That's how we got our Personas. Wasn't easy though. Those bastards were tough to kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The worst thing is that the more you deny your Shadow, the stronger it gets. It feeds off of it.\" Yosuke went further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you deny it?\" Greg asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's not something you want to admit. Sometimes it goes against everything you believed you were.\" Yosuke went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke's story from there went on to explain his and Yu's days earlier in the year. The two were the first to really explore the TV World, and Yosuke was the first to confront his own Shadow. However, he refrained from explaining exactly what his Shadow was about, much to Greg and Jacob's confusion. Kanji and Teddie were just as unwilling to explain their Shadows too. Furthermore, they explained that, on foggy nights in Inaba, the fog would lift in the TV World. There, the Shadows would overwhelm and kill whoever was inside. That alone was chilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're really tight-lipped on those.\" Jacob said. \"Are you still ashamed of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Kanji was scratching the back of his head. \"Our Shadows....nah, never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was still as confused as ever, but at least he had an idea of what was going on. \"Okay, so you fight these Shadows all the time. And you're trying to catch whoever killed those people and Yosuke's girlfriend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't my girlfriend!\" Yosuke immediately defended, which brought a grin to Teddie's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you wish she was. I've been reading your.....!\" And before Teddie could finish, Yosuke clamped his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more word and I'm docking your pay!\" That seemed to shut Teddie up. Apparently, Greg and Jacob were slowly getting used to the odd bear. He didn't seem all that bright. \"So....that's everything I can think of.\" Yosuke finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....what do you think? You in?\" Yu asked. Greg and Jacob looked to each other. Both had the same idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're already locked in, I guess.\" Greg smiled. \"So, let's do it!\" He capitalized it with a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAY!\" Teddie jumped for joy, immediately glomping both boys. \"Oh, what a happy day! To celebrate our new friends, we should have lunch! On Yosuke's tab of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop mooching off of me!\" Yosuke retaliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch? It's only 10:00\" Kanji murmured to himself. The two Junes workers didn't hear him however, starting another shouting fight. \"So...um, I noticed the other day that you have two swords?\" Kanji continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he got it straight out of Tales of Symphonia.\" Jacob smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Mr. Castlevania.\" Greg shot back. \"But yeah, I learned some swordplay back in the US. Mostly for fun, though I guess it'll come in handy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\" Kanji smiled. \"Oh and....um..if you ever get your clothes beat up while fighting...I can fix that too.\" Kanji's face was beat red as he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Greg asked. \"Can you sew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he can.\" Yu smiled. \"You'd be hard pressed to find anyone better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah there, senpai!\" Kanji immediately waved his arms around. \"It's nothing special!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it doesn't sound bad to me.\" Jacob said. \"That's a useful talent. You certainly won't find any of us good with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....that's good.\" Kanji seemed to smile, a bit more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should break those two up now.\" Yu said, referring to the still arguing Junes members. \"Hey guys, could you cut it out?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two immediately stopped. \"Sorry sensei.\" Teddie said in apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too.\" Yosuke said. \"All right, if you want it that much, I'll treat you all to lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did somebody say lunch?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone else turned to see the girls approaching, Yosuke just looked down. \"And of course now she decides to show up.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yosuke seemed less reluctant to pay for the food on his own now that the girls arrived. Chie seemed to get into an argument with him about it. Jacob felt for Yosuke. He seemed to get the short end of the stick in each situation so far. Yosuke finally caved and bought for the girls as well. Jacob overheard only a few orders, such as Yukiko getting tofu and Chie getting something that looked like just a bowl meat....no really, A LOT OF MEAT. Could be an entire animal's worth of meat. Jacob just bought some noodles and Greg something similar and cheap, so as to not put a big strain on Yosuke's tab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal went by quickly with small talk between the group. \"Won't be long until midterms come back around,\" Yukiko had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie groaned, already near the bottom of her meat bowl. \"Oooohh,  why would you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still awhile Chie-senpai,  they aren't that soon.\" Kanji spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie groaned again, \"I knooow,  I just don't like thinking about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob looked over to Naoto, \"Are the midterms that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for some, it would seem.\" She answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke turned and looked toward Yu. \"Not for Yu here, he's gotten the top score on these things recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg repositioned himself in his seat. \"Really? Looks like you have some competition Jacob.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was never a flawless test taker, but would do well on them, getting in the top ten from time-to-time. \"I-It's nothing that big,  Greg.\" Jacob said a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continued for awhile longer as the meals were finished off, the group heading toward electronics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Inside the T.V.*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood back in that hub again, walkways branching off from it. As they stood there and looked around, Jacob noticed something. They were all wearing glasses now. Jacob spoke up, \"Um...I'm not sure if I should know why but...why are you all wearing glasses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you guys still need a pair. Teddie, have any spares?\" Yu asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Teddie walked in front of the two and handed glasses to them, Jacob's had a blue/silver outline on them, Greg's with a green shaded outline. The two shrugged to each other and put them on. Almost instantaneously, the fog in front of them cleared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! So that's what they do. How, though?\" Greg said, looking around now with a new perspective and more clarity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise spoke up, \"It let's us see through the fog, that's all we can tell about it really. That and Teddie makes them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? He does a nice job with them.\" Jacob said, feel in his frames on his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu walked up in front of them. \"We're gonna send you through one of the areas to help train you. Judging on your levels, a good start for you would be the game world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob groaned and leaned back to Greg. \"Okay we were joking at first but now it's seriously like a game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh.\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, anyone here wanna go with them and give them some back up?\" Yu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go! I got some new moves to test out on the shadows!\" Chie said, fired up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go along too. It'll be nice to train some more.\" Naoto commented nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise offered to lead the way for us as we made our way to the zone. Jacob walked alongside Naoto. \"Thanks for volunteering. A little worried we'd head in by ourselves.\" Jacob commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, we have your back now.\" Naoto replied with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jacob, the world froze as he soon had a feeling of growth between him and Naoto.<br>\r\n-Fortune Social Link Rank 1-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had a similar conversation with Chie, the same phenomena taking place.<br>\r\n-Chariot Social Link Rank 1-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon arrived, and man was it a game world. Pixels resembling old 16-bit games, and noises matching it. Jacob,  Greg, Naoto and Chie soon entered as they encountered an enemy right off the bat, being two Escapist Soldiers. Jacob took the first strike with a whip, while Greg followed up using Nobunaga's Vorpal Blade to strike both enemies. Naoto fired a few shots off from a Peacemaker and knocked down one of the Shadows, letting Chie kick it...quite literally into space (little star ding and everything). The remaining Shadow struck Greg, knocking him off-guard. Jacob struck by using a Sukunda on the remaining Escapist Soldier. Chie then ran over and reached a hand to Greg. \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, thanks.\" Greg said thankfully as he lunged toward the Shadow, striking it down with his dual blades. And the battle was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, you two are naturals!\" Chie cheered. They traveled through a bit more, defeating Shadows, chasing weird golden hands, and avoiding treasure boxes with rattling chains coming from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all soon returned to the group as they got tired. \"You guys ready to go?\" Teddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob nodded and yawned, Greg yawning and stretching. \"Yes please...\" They soon exited as it was getting late. They all went seperate paths, ready to sleep. \"So Greg, excited about this?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Why not? Let's be careful about it though...\" Greg replied as the two stretched and went to their apartments to sleep. The next days involved more training and things of the sort, including upgrading armor, weapons, and gear. Soon...</span></div></div>",

Since Naoto had fully recovered from her ordeal in the Midnight Channel (and Jacob was back to full strength too), she was giving her explanation on her kidnapping. Greg and Jacob were able to learn about many events that happened before they got involved, such as the incident with Mitsuo Kubo, a student once believed to be the killer after a teacher was murdered. Long story short, the culprit was still at large, but the group was staying confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt at least made things easier for Greg and Jacob to keep up with current events. They honestly really didn't beforehand, but now they had some actual people here to talk to. No one really did then they first arrived after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Naoto had arranged a check-up for everyone, just to see if there was anything about the TV world affecting their health. It was fairly routine, though it revealed that Teddie was....empty for lack of a better word. Course, the serious situation was diffused as Teddie revealed that he had taken everyone's records. He and Yosuke were a bit too excited to learn the girl's measurements. Needless to say, that was interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, it made for an interesting everyday life, until Saturday October 8th came. The school bell had just rung, but as Greg was getting his stuff, he got a text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, looks like Yosuke wants everyone to meet on the roof before we head out.\" Greg said, getting a nod from Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****On the Roof*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you PLEASE be available for this weekend?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Yosuke practically begging everyone once they had arrived. Essentially, the story was that the Inaba Police was going to host an event with an idol that Rise used to know (somewhat). However, due to Naoto's disappearance, the police were too busy, and Junes got stuck with the job at the very last second! Yosuke's dad was on dire straits trying to piece it all together, and Yosuke wouldn't have everything crumbling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan, Yosuke?\" Yu inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what was Yosuke's grand plan? Get Rise on stage to substitute. At first, Rise was questioning it, but she eventually accepted on one condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want everyone on stage with me.\" That immediately got everyone riled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Greg cried. \"You want us on stage?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be an idol!\" Chie cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be troublesome if people tried to recruit me to be an idol.\" Yukiko muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too! I already have an exclusive contract with Junes!\" Teddie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never even been in a school play!\" Jacob added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You people are really worrying about the oddest things.\" Kanji grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in turn, Rise's grand plan was that she needed a band, which was to be the team. Greg immediately groaned. He actually had a guitar he brought along, but he was a casual player. He wasn't sure if Jacob even did instruments. Naoto confirmed that she could play a keyboard, and Yosuke had something he had as well. Well, everyone decided to split and bring what they could to the Music Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Jacob, let's get my guitar. I'm sure there's some junk for you.\" Greg and Jacob both groaned at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Later at the Music Room*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Kanji deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gong.\" Yukiko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh, why's it here?\" Yosuke groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, it wasn't the widest instrument range. Chie got what she could that wasn't already in use. After much talk (and comparing instruments to weapons), Kanjo got put on drums. Teddie was on the percussion instruments. Yu, Yosuke, and Greg were on the bass and guitars. And then finally, Chie and Jacob got trumpets while Yukiko got a saxophone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, doesn't this look like a band?\" Yosuke grinned and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a wannabe band.\" Greg muttered to himself and Jacob, both of them laughing a bit. Though, Greg could swear Chie heard as well, since he heard her laugh a tiny bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not bad.\" Rise seemed to approve. \"All right everyone, let's practice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it took quite a while to get everyone going, especially for those on the wind instruments. Jacob almost went blue in the face from blowing too hard once. Still, they kept at it for what it was worth. Not exactly a lot came out of this practice. Thankfully they still had Sunday try again. The sun was beginning to set soon after the day's events. After a while, Rise called it quits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, we'll give it another go tomorrow. Rest up, okay?\" Rise said, trying to be encouraging.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jacob and Greg walked home from their Saturday practice. \"Can't believe we're actually doing this. I don't know the first thing about music or concerts,\" worried Jacob as they walked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither, but it's nice to help Yosuke out.\" Greg said, trying to remain optimistic about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say. You have a guitar!\" Jacob replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no expert on it! I can play it but I'm not sure at that level.\" Greg points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob groans, slouching a bit. \"You have at least starter's knowledge on this. I'm not entirely sure still how to read sheet music!\" Jacob sighed and scratched the back of his head, frustrated. \"Sorry. I'm just stressing out over this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sighed too. \"At least it's being taken seriously. We gotta make sure we try on this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon reached their apartments, immediately going to look over how to play each of their instruments. Jacob's work was cut out for him, while at the same time he tried to learn sheet music and the parts of a trumpet. He did this throughout the night before his body forced him to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------The Next Day-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....-pai? Wak-.....Jacob-senpai?....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob let out a loud groan, opening one eye slowly, seeing the top of his desk and his laptop. He groaned, but soon noticed someone in the room. Turning, he saw Naoto standing there, wearing her blue coat and hat, looking down at Jacob. \"Are you alright?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. Just tired....tried to learn all of this before the concert...How'd you get in anyway?\" He asked, no enthusiasm in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your door was unlocked. That led me to worry something happened. You really should lock it at night.\" Naoto somewhat scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob thought to himself, 'Did I forget to lock it?' He shook his head and turned back to her. \"I-I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto spoke up. \"Greg told me to check on you. We're waiting at the school to start practice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob grimaced a little. \"I'm that late? S-sorry about that....\" Jacob scratched his head, trying to keep himself awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob soon saw Naoto set a cup of coffee on the desk,  Naoto smiling. \"I assumed you were asleep from staying up and trying to learn more about sheet music. I took the liberty of using your coffee machine to brew some up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob smiled tiredly, taking the cup and lifting it to his lips, drinking it. \"Mmmmm. I'll get dressed and we can go. Thanks Naoto.\" Jacob soon witnessed another flash for a split second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----Fortune Social Link Rank 2-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob got dressed and soon left with Naoto for the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he arrived, practice started again. It was a definite improvement from yesterday. Currently, they practiced by playing the song, but in a slower tempo. It was going well, when all of a sudden, a weird noise rang out in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that wasn't me!...I think!\" Chie stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob spoke, confused, \"I'm pretty sure trumpets don't make that kind of noise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't me, either. I mean, I can't get any sound at all out of this.\" Yukiko spoke as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, came Teddie, who Greg and Jacob still didn't know too much about. \"A hip and young audience yearns for the element of surprise in music as well! A bizarre sound suddenly rings out...An overturning of the expected cliches found in today's sound! You get it?\" Teddie said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty clear to everyone now about what happened. \"...Oh, I get it. That means, 'Teddie did it,' doesn't it?\" Kanji said, as though he was gonna kill Teddie. Everyone took a break afterwards. They talked about possibly calling this off, and not doing the concert at all. Then Yu stepped in and seemed to rally up everyone back up. Greg nodded in agreement, 'Good thing he's leader. Yu has the charisma of a saint.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Rise decided it was time to try for real. After giving a quick countdown, everyone played in tune and in time as Rise got through the first verse of her song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...! Didn't that sound pretty good!?\" Yosuke said, breaking the silence after the test play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie had a big smirk on her face, Greg sharing it with her. \"That was actual music!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob smiled, sighing in relief, \"Yeah, it was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems there's hope after all.\" Naoto smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's hard work was slowly taking shape. Practice went on late into the night for the actual performance tomorrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, it was Monday now. Time for the big performance. To say the boys were feeling anxious was an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, the closest I've ever been to a performance was curtain work in the 7th grade,\" Greg moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you've gotten better. All those reports you had to do in front of the class has helped,\" Jacob smiled. \"Besides, look at this way, they'll probably be looking at Rise more than they'll be looking at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Greg smiled. \"Well, let's go....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made them feel even odder was the fact that their \"costumes\" for the concert was just the winter school uniforms. It was easy for Greg to understand now why they do stuff like that. Summer was brutal in this country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Junes*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, Greg thought his nerves were actually calmer once he and Jacob met with everyone else. They were just as nervous, except for perhaps Yu who was as calm as a statue. Greg really had to wonder where he got it from. Guess that was why he was the leader. Teddie wasn't too nervous, but then again, did that bear even know what worry meant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right everyone, get in!\" Rise cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in typical group fashion, Rise organized a group high five. Cheesy as hell were Greg's thoughts, but who was he to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, who's ready?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE ARE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying in front of a crowd larger than Yosuke expected honestly wasn't too bad. The crowd was cheering the whole time as Rise sung her song, with Chie and Yukiko providing some chorus in the background. Greg and Jacob were actually able to stop thinking about it after a while, once they saw how everyone was having fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then came the one thing they didn't account for: an encore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah......I didn't think about that..\" Rise admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! So now what?!\" Greg exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only know one song!\" Chie cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole group was worried about what to do, until Teddie apparently saw something and jumped into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crowdsurf!\" He cried as the crowd bounced him up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Teddie. We can't play without him.\" Rise moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what? Should we follow him?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it'd be trouble if we all jumped in.\" said Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to do it that much, then just have the guys do it.\" Chie said. At that, Kanji got up from his drums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! I'll show you what it means to be a man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Yu, Yosuke, and Kanji tried diving into the crowd.....only for them to faceplant on the ground. Well, two of them at least. Yu landed straight on his feet, but Yosuke and Kanji were on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! That's gotta hurt.\" Greg grimaced. \"So....how about we take the diversion and get out?\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably a good idea.\" Rise agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, while the other boys were recovering, the rest exited the stage, happy to have that over. If the crowd was any indication, it was a definite success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had never been so happy to see something over with. Everyone was exhausted from that event. With Yosuke's troubles done for now, the group basically decided to split afterwards. Though, Jacob did a not-so-subtle shove at Greg in Chie's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can tell you're looking at her. Why don't you talk to her?\" Jacob smirked in that way that made Greg groan. Still, he did have a point. Sighing, Greg saw Chie beginning to head towards the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait! Chie!\" Greg called out as he tried to run up to her. She immediately stopped and looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's up?\" She asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...did you really...have anything else to do today?\" Greg asked, just hoping his voice was loud enough for her to hear. To his appreciation though, Chie seemed to hear him just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't really have much planned. Yukiko has her inn duties to tend to and everyone else is probably beat. Though...\" Chie said as she looked at her watch. \"I was thinking of getting lunch. Wanna come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? That..would be great.\" Greg smiled, getting one back as the two got into the elevator. \"Jacob and I honestly haven't been to too many places. What with the transfer and all, we've kind of been limited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie seemed to nod in understanding as they exited the elevator. \"Yeah, I can see that. Must be rough coming all the way out here. I mean, Yu's a transfer student too, but he just came from Tokyo. And Yosuke of course has his company behind him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's true.\" Greg nodded, a bit more comfortable. \"You wouldn't believe how much studying Jacob and I needed to get this. I actually needed to have a somewhat fluent Japanese conversation with who was in charge of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Chie laughed a little bit, something Greg found very cute. \"Well, I can hear you just fine. I wish I could say the same. My English scores...are not good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to Yosuke, all your scores aren't good.\" At this, Chie immediately glared at him. \"That's just what he said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, he's got another kick coming his way.\" Greg immediately grimaced. Their battles in the TV world gave him all the knowledge that Chie's kicks were deadly.  But then, her mood brightened. \"Ah, here we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked up to see \"Aiya\" written above him. So...this must be that restaurant he heard about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I've heard of this before. Jacob and I have never eaten here though. Our odd jobs is barely enough for rent.\" Greg said sadly. However, Chie's smile only widened, and she even grabbed his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you have yet to live! Onward!\" Chie cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was really starting to get a sense of who Chie was, despite the limited time he had known her. Just as he thought that, he thought he saw a brief flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----Chariot Social Link Rank 2-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he wasn't going anywhere until he had a meal here. Oh well.</span></div></div>",

They did schoolwork, sometimes visited the T.V World, and would check the Midnight Channel every now and then. But surprisingly, the Shadow World was not the most worrying thing to Jacob, Greg, and the others. The midterms were. Jacob had a hard time at first actually. Learning something in his previous school and then going to a new one to be dropped in the middle of another lesson different from what he has been learning. He was currently sitting after school in the school's library, textbooks stacked up at his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob ran a hand through his hair. \"I got that....but what does...how do you do that?...\" Jacob spoke quietly to himself about different things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob?\" Jacob turned his head, taken off-guard a bit to see Naoto standing there, wearing the blue button up coat and hat. \"Are you alright? It sounded like the ravings of a madman as I walked by.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sighed, \"Hey Naoto. I was trying to study for the Midterms. There's too much to learn in the time I've been here...\" Jacob rested his head in his hand as he flipped through a history textbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jacob's surprise, Naoto took the seat beside him and took half the books from the stack. \"I know some of the things you're learning about, so I can help you on those. I could quiz you a bit on vocabulary and things of the sort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob had a look as though he had seen some deity. \"Really? You'd do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I'm still a bit worried about the Midterms, this could be beneficial for the both of us.\" Naoto said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Quiz away.\" Jacob said. He seemed to understand Naoto a bit more in her act to help him study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----Fortune Social Link Rank 3-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays passed as the Midterms were finally over, Jacob answering questions about why snow in some European nations was red, and what the \"Left Hand Rule\" was. Jacob sighed as class ended, the final day for the Midterms over. Greg and Yu and a few others had gotten in a group discussing it. Much to Chie's chagrin, it seems like she's gotten another question wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob dropped his head onto his desk, giving a sigh of relief. \"There....it's done.\" He lifted his head, seeing Greg and others around. He did begin to wonder just how everyone else did, especially Greg, as he was dealing with the same thing as himself. Pushing himself up from thedesk, he stood and went over to them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*****Flashback to Thursday, October 13*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jacob was holed up in the library constantly, Greg preferred the same way he always studied back in the USA; which would be in his room, or apartment in this case. He always felt he did better when he didn't have so many people around him. Tomorrow was when things were set to begin, and Greg hadn't seen much of anyone over the week. Even Jacob spent more time in his apartment now. Not that Greg didn't mind; he liked his peace and quiet after all, especially when studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, break time.\" After a while, he settled down for some TV and food. He took breaks often when he felt he did enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****The next couple days*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had met with Yu and Yosuke for a bit on the way to school. Yu looked calm as ever, but Yosuke looked like he was about to fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Greg asked. It was the first words he had spoken to anyone in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All-nighter\" Yosuke yawned. \"Not to mention that Teddie wouldn't stop talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rough.\" Greg said out of sympathy, not that it really helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good luck.\" smiled Yu. As Greg gave a small thanks, the three split up for their classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday and Saturday went well enough for Greg, though he still didn't really talk with anyone during either class period. Greg was thankful that the first 2 days relatively focused on the subjects he was good in, which meant he was probably in for hell next week. Just the thought of it made him groan. There wasn't much middle ground with Greg. He either knew a subject well...or not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Sunday, October 16*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, everyone had a day of respite before returning to the grind. It was a sunny day, and after Greg put in a bit more studying and after he found out there was nothing good on, he figured that he might as well take a walk. The weather overall was nice; sunny, but with a nice breezy wind. After a while, he had ended up near the Samegawa flood plain, with not really much to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg?\" Greg jumped as he heard his name being called. Thankfully, it was nothing much. He turned around and smiled a bit when he saw Yukiko sitting at the shaded bench off to the side. She seemed to be offering a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Yukiko.\" Greg said as he accepted the seat. \"Didn't expect to see you on your own out here.\" He looked down to see some books around. So she was studying here too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought a change of scenery might help.\" Yukiko smiled. \"I invited Chie but I think she's decided to study in her room. It's probably for the best. She gets distracted a bit easily outside of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we all?\" Greg smirked, getting a small laugh from both of them. \"So...it kind of seems like you keep her in check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko gently nodded. \"She's the best friend I could ever ask for. I owe a lot to her, especially after....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko trailed off after that, though Greg had an idea. For the most part, he and Jacob got a recap of what had happened so far in the Investigative Team's adventures, so he remembered the tales of \"Princess Yukiko's Castle\". Boy, those TV shows must have been so embarrassing. Greg never felt so fortunate that he and Jacob seemed to possess Persona potential without the need to fight a shadow of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can see how that would effect you.\" Greg nodded. \"I guess something good can come out of these situations, even if you don't know it at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Yukiko nodded. However, right then, Greg couldn't tell if there was a glint in her eyes. \"I'm sure Chie is counting on you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah!\" Greg said, stumbling a bit as he was caught off-guard. \"W-What do you mean by that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you both heading to lunch after the concert.\" Yukiko smiled. \"Chie seemed to enjoy it. I imagine it won't be too long until she asks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg blushed a tiny bit. Was Yukiko trying to imply that Chie was interested in him?.....Nah, it couldn't be. Chie didn't seem to think about that stuff a lot. Not to mention, Yukiko was usually oblivious to love advances, especially to those directed at her. Greg kind of wondered how a popular girl like her could be so oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them talked for a tiny bit about stuff before Greg decided to leave her alone to her studies.</span></div></div>",

Even at lunch, the guy was knee-deep in studies. Guess Greg was just more casual in that regard. Though, he found the large amount of testing days to be quite taxing. You never had a string of testing days like this in the USA. Sometimes maybe 3 or 4 days in a row, but not this long.

Greg wanted to get a word from Jacob but he was already gone. Sighing, Greg packed his backpack and began walking out of the classroom. He traveled down to put his other shoes. That was one thing he was still getting used to. Japanese customs, go figure. However, just as he was finishing, he actually heard someone call his name for the first time in ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg!\" Greg jumped a bit, turning around to see Chie running up to him. \"Phew....glad I caught you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were....you looking for me?\" Greg asked a bit off-hand. This was the first time any girl had stopped him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...heh heh...\": Chie's face suddenly got a little red. \"I know this might be a bit out of the blue but....you know what tomorrow's subject is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg thought back to what he remembered from the schedule. \"Oh yeah, isn't it mostly English? Guess I won't have too much of a problem, no offense.\" Greg said with a nervous laugh. Chie gave a similar laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, heh heh....so, um, you think you could...give me a little help?\" Chie asked, her hands in a bit of a pleading position. \"Please? I need to know I passed something and no one here knows it better than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Greg couldn't exactly turn that down. \"All right,\" he said with a smile. \"You want to come to my apartment? I have a dictionary that we could use, as well as any notes you have. Well, assuming you have any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Chie got angry. \"Who said I never take notes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Yosuke?\" It was true, he had mentioned that to Greg. Once again, Chie was fuming though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so gonna....\" Needless to say, Greg had learned quickly that Yosuke and Chie had a strained relationship at times, particularly when it came to Yosuke babbling about her faults. Greg found it good to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that aside, let's go. Assuming I know the map correctly, my apartment is at least partially on the way to your house so you won't have too far to go afterwards.\" Greg reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Let's go!\" Chie yelled, her enthusiasm a bit back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the two began the talk to Greg's apartment. Needless to say though, Greg found it a bit hard to concentrate. Yukiko's words were still ringing in his ears, and it made him blush a bit. He....never had a girlfriend back in the USA, and he certainly never expected to get one in Japan either. Still, Chie was perhaps the first to really enjoy spending time with him, so that was a plus. Thankfully, it wasn't a long walk, given the nature of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Greg's Apartment*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, make yourself comfortable.\" Greg said, setting his back down near the table he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, for a town like ours, this is pretty good.\" Chie nodded. \"At least you don't have anything falling apart. Seriously, even my house needs a few touch-ups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from what I can tell, Inaba really has that old town feel.\" Greg smiled as he took a seat. \"So, wanna get started?\" he added while finding what he was looking for: a dictionary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Chie smiled while getting a notebook out. \"My mom might kill me if I stay too long at a guy's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Greg and Chie shared a laugh at that. He was really getting the sense that Chie was easy to hang around. Perhaps he was just thinking too much on it. Anything that comes will come, but for now, she was a great friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----Chariot Social Link Rank 3-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Thursday October 19*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the final day of testing came and went. Eventually, the final bell rang, signaling the end for good. Greg sighed, resting his head for a bit before he turned back to Jacob. Jacob's seat was a ways behind Greg, near the back of the class. Smiling, Greg got up and walked to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you finally emerge from your cave.\" Greg smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Jacob smirked back, the two sharing words and high fives for the first time in a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how the others turned out. I'm sure everyone's a bit tired.\" Greg said, getting a nod from Jacob. The two of them, packs in hand, walked the short distance to Room 2-2, where the four other group members were still talking in the middle.</span></div></div>",
