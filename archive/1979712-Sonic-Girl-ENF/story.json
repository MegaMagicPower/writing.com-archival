She just wanted to get a nice relaxing shower before bed so she could be ready for anything that the world through at her the next day! After scrubbing her body down, she rinsed herself off and (after slipping and falling on her cute butt!) she turned off the water and began to dry off. She wrapped one towel around her head to dry her quills down, used another to dry off her body, and a third one to wrap around her naked body. Poor Amy was incredibly modest when it came to her body. Since she didn't own a bathrobe, she often walked around barefoot and in a towel to ensure that she wouldn't be walking around exposed for anyone to see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy walked into her room, opening drawers to find her clothing when...well...that's what was missing. Clothes. She checked each drawer in her room, each one with more panic building up inside her. She checked her closet, empty. She checked her laundry, empty. She checked her shoe rack, empty. Sock drawer, empty. Underwear drawer, empty. She had NO clothes throughout her whole home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"W-what?? This can't be happening, where are my clothes? I literally had them in here this morning! My shoes were at the front door, my panties were here, my dress was here...there's nothing here! I can't walk around naked! I live in an apartment! I can't just walk to go get more clothes! And if I go out in a towel, people will take it no doubt! This is so embarrassing already...no shoes, no dress, nothing!!!\"</span>Amy said to herself with a slight whine in her voice...</span></div></div>",

Until today where she got a mischievous idea. She swooped down near Blaze and introduced her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You must be Blaze, right?\" She asked her. \"The inter-dimensional princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yes, that's me.\" Blaze answered. \"Do I know you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until now, Rouge the Bat.\" She greeted as they shook hands. \"Say, I couldn't help but notice you were littering just now. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I just missed the trash can, that's all.\" Blaze said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. That's a relief. If that were me, I could've been in a lot trouble.\" Rouge said. \"But you, on the other hand, would've gotten off scott-free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Blaze asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know? I'm saying you, specifically, have complete immunity from the law in this dimension.\" Rouge explained. \"You see, anybody not from this world is free to do anything they want without any form of diplomacy to stop them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this true?\" Blaze asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me. Did you see any cops around when you accidentally threw your coffee cup on the ground?\" Rouge asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No?\" Blaze answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, sister! You're from another dimension. That means you're free to do whatever you want in our world without getting in trouble.\" Rouge persuaded Blaze. \"Sometimes, I envy the lucky.\" She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was dumbfounded by Rouge's words. She had no idea if what Rouge was saying is true or not. Her royal upbringing prevented her from being a free spirit and, as such, she has respected and honored that code throughout her whole life. Then again, if what Rouge is saying is true, there could've been no way for Blaze pass up this golden opportunity to experience freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is her response?</span></div></div>",

You've convinced me!\" Blaze tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta girl! I knew you'd see the light.\" Rouge patted Blaze on the back. \"Hey! I have an idea to help you out. Are you at all fond of the clothes you're wearing?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I mean, I guess they're uncomfortable sometimes.\" Blaze admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you feel that way, just take'em off.\" Rouge suggested. \"Walk around butt-naked if you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?!\" Blaze jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like I said, you'll never be in trouble for doing so.\" Rouge reassured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R- Right. It just feels embarrassing to even think about.\" Blaze says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know until you try.\" Rouge dared her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Blaze gave in to Rouge's words. She took off all of her clothes in view of the public. Not that anyone was passing by, she was just taken aback by what she was doing right now. Within seconds, Blaze was now completely clad in nothing but her fur. She never thought she would be this brave to get naked in front of a stranger she just met.
