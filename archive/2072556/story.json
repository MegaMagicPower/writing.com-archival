            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With one glance at the damsel, what came to mind was purity. A light-skinned, slender body with voluptuous breasts wrapped tightly in white decorative silk. Her garment was like a thin robe loose sleeves that left her shoulders bare and cuts off at her upper thighs like a short skirt. A red robe held her top in pristine robe in place, tied right beneath her bosoms. The small section of her breasts from the sides was left bare but in no real danger of spilling out. A royal color of gold decorated her clothes, rims around the edges with oriental patterns. Wide, flat ribbons of translucent white dangled down from her robes with golden rims, and one linked her sleeves in the back which formed a halo-like shape where her head was centered at from a frontal view. Smooth, flawless skin as the far as the eyes could tell upon tracing along her bare slender legs until a pair of white shoes with golden heels sheathed her feet. Her long, straight, glossy black hair was let down beyond her back with long, thin bangs framing her face from the sides, reaching down to her chest. Golden pupils and red eyeliners, her large eyes were gentle and kind, innocent and sweet. She had a hairpin on the left side of her head which appeared like a white petaled flower with a red center orb. The girl wielded a spear with a length comparable to her height. A white shaft with a long spearhead \u2013 white edges of the blade and golden patterns along the flat sides. Her polearm weapon had an axe-like blade right at the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the personification of elegance and pristine, gracefully striding through the woods. The large brilliant full moon casted its lunar rays down such that shadows stretched from the trees, ferns, and rocky formations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ominous miasma lingered in the thick molasses-like air. Corrupting lust radiated out from a myriad of unknown entities that shrouded themselves in the shadows. Glowing red eyes leered out, locking their sights onto the human girl. Their bodies were in constant turmoil between temptation and caution. Despite her appearance, this tender youth was a warrior from the Haan family who slayed countless of monsters with her masterful use of the spear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThump! Thump! Thump!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground suddenly shook. A large, hulking beast approached the human girl with its heavy steps, standing three times her height. Muscles bulged from its hairy arms. Dark-grey from head to toe with gleaming red eyes, the giant gorilla let out a growl as he repeatedly smacked against his own chest like a drum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAra stood her ground and readied her spear. As soon as the monstrous ape leaped into the air and came plummeting straight down on top of her, she swiftly leaped to the side before the ground rumbled from the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA gorilla?\u201d Her eyes glared sharply at the beast. \u201cHas the animals around here fallen into darkness?\u201d She leaped several meters into the air before stomping her feet against the trunk towering behind to propel herself. As soon as the massive silver ape turned its head, a golden crescent light flashed passed his sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human girl swiftly descended behind the ape as blood scattered into the air. With a single swing of her polearm, she hacked off the ape\u2019s head with the axe of her spear. The hulking beast collapsed onto its stomach, causing the earth the shake once more. But the looming danger did not end there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom below, a massive dark paw with large claws sprouted forth, reaching to swipe the girl. But the young warrior jumped into the air before it could touch her. Landing on a branch, she gazed down to see a massive dark-furred savage-looking mole popping out of the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother one?\u201d she whispered, encountering yet another tainted beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the branch she stood on began to sway, disorienting her sense of balance, \u201cWha-!?\u201d As her eyes shifted, a pair of sinister eyes and splintering mouth formed at the middle section of the trunk. She jumped away, but as she descended, the mole-monster was ready to take another swipe at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging her pole, Ara hacked the mole\u2019s arm right as it came to clash into her. Upon landing, she quickly thrusted her spear until it punctured through the creature\u2019s heart. Another beast had been slain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, roots began to coil around her ankles and slither up her legs. Casting a glance down, she realized that even the trees around here have been turned into monsters. As she tried to lift either of her foot, she found herself struck by the entangling appendages. Slashing her weapon downwards, the girl cleaved through the soil, severing the roots in a single swing. As soon as she gained freedom in her legs, she leaped away, now cautious of what would appear from below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip tensed as she saw a ring of eyes encircling her from all sides. Dark silhouettes a various shapes and sizes stepped out of the shadows as a horde of monsters had her surrounded. With a force of this magnitude, it would usually require a team of at least five warriors of her level to wipe out. Could she really solo against this many foes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor hours, Ara Haan battled against the monsters. Goblins, orcs, imps, trees, mushrooms, werewolves, and snakes, these were only some of the types of creatures that she combatted. For each adversary, it took no more than two assaults for her to take down. But it was the sheer number of them that had her wary. Her stamina was being chipped away little by little. She had slain hundreds of them, but more kept on coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting for air, the girl was notably fatigued. She was given no more than a few seconds of rest before another creature would lunge towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressured and overwhelmed by the numbers, the warrior began to run. Lost in the forest, she had no sense of where the closest exit might lie. Monsters chased her down. She no longer resisted them, instead she weaved and jumped around them as she sprinted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, she saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
