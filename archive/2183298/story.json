Conventional dates weren't really all that fun anymore, but this was on a whole new level. The app held such an impressive variety of options available, humans from across the world and monsters from just about any reality. A few nights of swiping left and right and now a date unlike anything ever tried before was about to start. But who are the lucky ones? Did someone find a monster to date or was it the monster that connected with that special person?</span></div></div>",

He was content enough, but something deep inside him wanted more. When he came across the app he saw it as the perfect way to add some much needed spice to his life. He just hopes that whoever he ends up with mirrors his own calm and collected nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChadwick Tenneville. A 24 year old construction worker and by his own description a 'raging sex bomb'. He's never been in a relation that lasted more than a month and he's never looked at a woman as anything other than some nights of hot sex before moving on. Most of his friends call him Chad and though they won't tell him, he can tell by their faces that they're definitely jealous of his precocious lifestyle. All these rumors that everyone considered him to be a massive douchebag were probably just that, rumors. But after years of chasing after human girls he began to get a little bored with it. He wanted something new and exciting and that's when he stumbled upon this app. He couldn't wait to show these monster girls what they've been missing out on all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl Hessen. A 19 year old blogger and self-styled 'debunker'. He travels all over the country to research the science and hoaxes behind local myths and legends. He had a shot of popularity when he revealed the sightings of a local town ghoul to just be someone in a suit. Since then he's chased more stories than he can count, but nothing managed to rake in the views of that big scoop. Now he's come across this Monstr app and he was eager to blow the lid of this one. A dating app for monsters? There was no doubt in his mind this was all an elaborate prank. He'd invite one of these 'monsters' for a date and carefully record him unmasking them. This would get him the fame he always desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou. It's you. You're mildly jealous of all these other guys getting to date monsters and you want in on the action. Hopefully you don't find yourself in over your head.</span></div></div>",

The two of them have been chatting back and forth for days now and she finally decided to come over. There were so many things he wanted to experience up close with her. The smooth scales on her skin, her cute long muzzle embraced in an intimate kiss. The list goes on. He checks his hair and outfit again for the third time in five minutes. He wanted to make a good first impression at all costs and she said she'd be here at 7, mere minutes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe calms yourself by whipping out his phone and looking at the pictures she'd sent. A few cute shots of her face, highlighting her draconic features. A few aerial shots along with the promise that if Matt was real sweet she'd take him for a ride. Though it didn't take much to guess that the ride she was talking about didn't have anything to do with flying. He may feel bad for thinking it, but her messages did make her sound quite eager to get to the action. Not that it mattered too much. Getting to score with a dragon was more than he could've ever imagined himself achieving romantically. He scans the room one last time to make sure everything is perfect for his guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy beat of wings suddenly echoed all around him. Emily was arriving. But if that was the volume her wings could produce he might run into an issue. It now dawned on Matt that in his eagerness to meet her he never quite accounted for her size. Her pictures didn't really have a lot of reference material to suggest her to be anything other than human-sized. It'd be awkward if she had to struggle to fit through the door. More heavy thumps followed, pounding on his nerves. Finally relief as the doorbell rang. Matt straightens himself up one last time before walking down the little hall and swinging open the front door to greet his date. What he saw nearly caused his jaw to hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stood in all her radiant beauty, easily blocking the road and sidewalks with her giant stature. The dragoness wouldn't be able to fit through Matt's door indeed as she was at least twice as tall as his whole house. Her piercing gaze down at her little human date was effortlessly intimidating. Her smile was kind and her features were intoxicating. She was covered from head to toe in a fine pattern of deep red scales, shimmering like rubies. There wasn't a blemish to be seen in them on her whole body. Her leathery wings a faded beige matching the underside of her clawed hands and feet. She stood on all fours like the European dragons he'd seen so often in movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" She said, her voice reverberating with power. He was awestruck at her sheer size and beauty, stammering out a timid hello in return. The dragoness leaned her head in close, her fiery gaze inspecting him thoroughly. She seemed pleased, humming with delight as she spoke to him. \"You're Matt, right? You're precisely what I was looking for.\" She tried to be sweet, but her voice was so powerful it made his legs wobble. He swallows his fears and replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you must be Emily. Pleased to meet you. I was going to invite you inside, but I'm thinking that might not end well for my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's kind of you.\" She said, giggling a little at his gesture. \"It's okay, little guy. How about I take you someplace nice instead?\" She reached her large clawed hand towards him, each of the fearsome talons longer than his leg. With practiced care the thick digits wrapped around him and with a heavy beat of her wings she lifted herself off the ground. The whole experience felt like a dream. The firm grip of her claw, the air rushing by as she flew away with Matt in hand and the pang of fear that settled in once he realized he had no idea where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Matt had no choice but to wait for her to reach her destination. The forests and mountains seemed to stretch on without end. Hopefully this date went well, because there would be no way out of here without her help. Finally she slowed herself a little, approaching a mountain with a large gash in the side. It was the entrance to her lair. By his estimation even the hardiest explorers would need weeks to reach this place on foot. No wonder she'd managed to stay hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily carefully glides down, landing on three feet. Matt shivers as the ground came frightfully close, but this wasn't the dragon's first time bringing something along. The tight grip of her leathery claw dissipates as she gently sets her date down on the ground. The cavern stretching out before him looked strangely well-kept. There was no clear sign of anything living here, but the floor had been smoothed out and the walls didn't quite look natural either. A large tunnel stretched ahead and Emily wandered in, shaking the ground a little with her every step. Matt runs alongside her, struggling to keep up with her casual pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, Matt.\" She announces proudly, turning a corner. Before him stretched out a huge cavern. The walls were lined with lights getting their power from who knows where. The ceiling too was adorned with all manner of small lamps tied to the rocky surface. The floor was smoothed, a mesmerizing pattern running throughout the cave. But his attention was drawn almost immediately to her hoard. She'd mentioned it a few times, but she never told him what she hoarded. He always just assumed dragons would all be hoarding gold or other valuables. But Emily had a somewhat... different collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw hits the floor as Matt stares at her hoard of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scurrying all over the expansive cave were men. It didn't take Matt long to notice some eerie similarities. Each of them seemed to have the same shaggy haircut he does. They all also wore roughly similar outfits. Was that why Emily insisted on him wearing this? The red dragon beamed with joy upon looking at her collection. It was always a good day when she found more souls to add to it. Emily loudly cleared her throat, causing all the men in the cave to freeze in their tracks and turn their attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back everyone, and I've got another boyfriend to help you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome forced cheering and a lot of murmuring rose up from the crowd. None of them seemed particularly happy to see Matt arrive. He didn't know what was going on, but he became very nervous. Is this what she had in mind for him? Another slave to add to her hoard? He didn't have to wait long for an answer as the dragoness happily continued her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just love this new app. It makes finding suitable boyfriends and capturing them so much easier. And since the hoard has grown so much lately, there's so many new faces around. If you've been here for a while, get back to work. For the newbies, let me explain what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two-thirds of the men went back to whatever it was they were doing. Mostly it seemed they were busy hauling around food to prepare dinner for everyone. One massive plate of various meats, both raw and cooked, for Emily and whatever scraps were left over for them. Matt gulped as he and the other new joiners kept their attention on the towering dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very simple really. I expect my boyfriends to treat me like the queen I am. That means you'll do everything I say when I say it. I won't tolerate any lip from you and while we're on that subject...\" She trails off as her eyes scan the cave, looking for someone in particular. She walks over to the kitchen and grabs one of them men in a large clawed hand. Her grip was murderously tight, but his crushed lungs wouldn't permit him to scream. He winced uncomfortably as she carried him back to the awestruck men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you disobey me, give me attitude, piss me off or worst of all, <i>steal</i> from me...\" Her grip tightened. Matt was sure he could hear one of the man's bones snap. Suddenly she released her grip and with a large claw tore at his tattered pants. The pockets were ripped to shreds and several glimmering ruby scales dropped out. The man tried to cry out an apology, but Emily was going to make an example out of him. She snatched him up again and brought him to her fearsome maw. Rows of razor sharp teeth glistened in the cave's light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily opened wide and dropped the man on her squishy tongue. She quickly snapped her jaws shut, her victim pulling his arms on board before she would sever them in a single bite. The dragon didn't care. With or without arms, there was only one place left for this thief. She tilted her head back and with a single mighty gulp she sent him down her gullet. Matt stood there, looking horrified. His date just casually ate a man. Swallowed him whole. As the bulge traveled down her neck and disappeared into her body she looked back down at the frightened men, finally finishing her sentence. \"... I will reduce you to a quick snack, if I don't feel like torturing you first. Now get back to work! Except you, Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other men quickly scurried back to their tasks, looking busier than ever to avoid becoming an example too. Emily took a step closer to her date, looming over him with a gleeful smile. She lowered her head down and stared into his eyes. Matt had no idea what horrible plans she had for him, but he needed to be careful if he ever hoped to get back home. Her hot breath washed over him as she intently watched his every jitter. \"Now what should this lovely new boyfriend do for me...\" She mused with a broad toothy smirk.</span></div></div>",

Please don't hurt me.\" He muttered, barely loud enough for the looming dragon to hear. Emily cracked a toothy smile, snorting a bit as she held back a laugh. Her new boyfriend already knew his place it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a natural...\" She mused, leaning in close and letting her tongue slip from her lips. The slender muscle dragged along Matt's face, leaving a trail of warm drool behind. \"...and you taste just right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gulped. He couldn't begin to guess what Emily had in mind, but being referred to as tasty didn't ease his nerves in any way. He always thought the risks of dating a monster would be some bad body odour or rough manners. How did he ever think it was a good idea to go and date a full-blown dragon. Internally he was kicking himself, but all Emily saw was her date muttering and twitching a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look cute when you're desperate.\" She said bluntly. Matt snapped out of his little tantrum to look up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me?\" He said, immediately flinching as he feared he'd overstepped his boundaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From you personally? Right now... I think I want pleasure.\" Emily's smile grew wider and she grabbed her boyfriend in a large clawed hand. With big steps she marched through her cave to what seemed like a bedroom. The large doors swung open and Matt's fears were confirmed. It was a bedroom. A separate smaller cave sealed behind a set of imposing metal doors. A large mountain of pillows passed for a bed and the remainder of the room was filled with all manner of heaps. A pile of self-care products with a large pack of humans toiling to keep them sorted. A stack of old clothes, no doubt from other people she'd abducted and gotten rid of. And lastly a small pile of shimmering red scales. The same she took from the thief moments before eating him. It was the closest thing in this cave resembling a dragon's hoard of treasure. Matt wasn't given another second to look around as he was thrown across the room into the large collection of pillows. He screamed all the way, only widening Emily's playful grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other humans toiling in her bedroom all dropped what they were doing and scurried for the door. Their master was looking for private time and those that got in her way would meet a swift demise. In under a minute Matt was the only human left in the room, the doors closing with a heavy thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to help pleasure me. Do well and I might let you stay here and recover. Resist if you must, that usually just makes it feel even better for me. And if you're really good, I might feel so generous as to let you return to your boring life. But mark my words: Once you've experienced what pleasures I and I alone can bring you, you'll be begging me to take you back.\" Emily spoke confidently, slowly approaching her date. Matt looked up like a deer in the headlights and gulped. There was no escape. He could only beg her for what little mercy was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... please don't kill me.\" He stammered. Emily paused her approach to laugh, leaning her large head close to her boyfriend and whispering in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I haven't killed anyone with sex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could utter another word the dragon got started.</span></div></div>",

The lustful look in her eyes didn't bode well for him. He tried to get back on his feet, but the small mountain of pillows he was standing on failed to provide a solid enough surface for him to stay up. He fell back down and could only gasp in horror as he witnessed just how forward his date was intending to be with her advances. She stood over him, her large rear turned his way. Looming overhead was her sex. The first drops of her arousal were already leaking from the glistening slit. She only had a narrow ribbon of leathery white scales that formed her underbelly, the only part of her body not covered in radiant scales. Sitting at the very base of that thin strip of white were two puffed up labia, each at least as big as Matt's whole body. Before he had met her, the sight of a dragon's pussy might've aroused him. But now he stared in fear as the snatch slowly lowering itself onto him looked ready to swallow him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his head Matt imagined how different this whole scenario would be if Emily was closer to his size. He might not be fearing for his life right now. But if the sex wasn't going to kill him, would he really be that much better off? As far as he could tell his survival only meant that he could join the hoard of other 'boyfriends' Emily had gathered. And seeing how she treated them, being a part of her collection just seemed like a death sentence with extra work. The despair in his eyes had not gone unnoticed though, as the dragon suddenly paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheer up, you'll probably be fine. I was only joking before. About the killing you I mean, not the setting you free if you're pleasurable enough part. That's still open for you to achieve. Just wriggle lots in there and I'm sure you'll be fine.\" The dragon tried to be comforting, but the overwhelming nature of the situation made it hard for Matt to draw much solace from her words. Her booming voice didn't help things either. He dreaded to discover what that large pussy would feel like up close and hearing her talk about going 'in there' removed all doubt on what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way to go but in, Matt grit his teeth, straightening himself out and preparing to take the plunge. He sat up and reached for the sky, putting his hands together like a diver ready to jump into the pool. Emily smirked naughtily and didn't keep her date waiting another second. She lowered herself down onto him, moaning as she felt his hands slip between her lower lips and into her love tunnel. He tried to maintain his resolve, but seeing that huge pussy fill his vision forced him to let out a panicked scream. Her aim was practiced, insuring she would not accidentally crush him flat beneath her vast body. A sloppy, wet squelch signaled a successful landing, putting a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily huffed and moaned, feeling the little man wriggle inside of her. Even his smallest movements against her sensitive folds were enough to send waves of pleasure through her. \"Oh yes, that's the spot! More! Please, <i>more!</i>\" Her words slurred a little. It didn't matter much anyway, as Matt was in too deep to hear a single letter of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe struggling man had more pressing things to worry about. In an instant everything from the waist up had been engulfed by his date's love tunnel. The slickened walls dragged against him whilst her inner muscles occasionally gripped him, forcefully rubbing her feminine juices into his body and hair. The smell was overpowering, a piercing musk that stank unlike anything else he'd ever smelled. His nose ached from the sheer intensity of it. Strangest and scariest was the uncanny feeling that the inner walls were trying to pull him in deeper. He couldn't tell for sure, his mind and senses hazed by the heavy scent of Emily's arousal, but it felt like more and more of his body was pulled into the slimy, warm embrace of her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon cried out with pleasure, her living man-toy providing stimulation in ways only a real man could. No vibrator or dildo came close to the bliss she felt at this very moment. It wouldn't be much longer until~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooooh\" Emily moaned lewdly as she rolled around on the huge heap of pillows, scattering them everywhere. Her orgasm hit like a freight train, a river of unfiltered joy streaming from her nethers. It lasted for what felt like an eternity, drenching many of the pillows in sticky slime. She could only imagine what kind of rollercoaster that must've been for her date. Highly satisfied, the dragon slowly regained her bearings and checked up on Matt. </span></div></div>",

She couldn't remember the last time a human was capable of bringing such joy to her day. After this he'd certainly earned his freedom. The dragon rolled onto her side to inspect the state of her date and a broad smirk crept onto her face. Even a climax that intense wasn't enough to dislodge him from her love tunnel. Only his legs dangled limply outside, drenched in her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was carefully pulled free and flopped onto the pillows. He didn't move a muscle, something Emily attributed to him being utterly exhausted from such a wild ride. Maybe she shouldn't have gone at this so quickly. She'd only met the guy today. But he was just one in her hoard of boyfriends. If it wasn't him, another would find himself in the same place. As seconds ticked by she did feel a pang of concern. He hadn't moved at all, but he also didn't gasp for air like some of her other lovers did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt? Hello? Can you hear me?\" Her voice was a little cracked from the intense pleasure, but the concern in it was clear as day. Emily reached in and poked him with one of her sharp talons. No response, not even a flinch. The bitter truth began to creep up on the dragon. She'd ended him for her pleasure. In the heights of her climax she must've drowned him in her juices. Or maybe her inner walls had simply crushed the life from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Emily felt overwhelmed with emotions. There was sadness that Matt was already gone, but it was overshadowed by something far darker. She felt empowered, affirmed in her draconic might. A man had died to bring her pleasure, and that felt almost as good as his writhing inside of her. The dragon's loins burned with renewed eagerness. With a cruel smirk and a seductive voice she asked him a question:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling all kinds of ready to go again. Any objections from you?\" The dragon knew the answer already but waited politely for a few seconds in case Matt made a miraculous recovery. Her patience could only hold back her lust for so long though as she grabbed his body and shoved it right back inside of her pussy. The mountain shook with her moans several more times that day as she used up her boyfriend. Each round her powerful inner walls cracked more of his bones until she'd finally had enough, leaving him covered in layer after layer of her juices for her servants to dispose of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter such a thoroughly entertaining day Emily could only think of one more thing to do. She opened up her phone, launched Monstr and started looking around for the next addition to her hoard. Hopefully this one would be a little sturdier.</span></div></div>",

He could smell ice cream, and pizza, and steak, and sushi, almost the entire spectrum of human delicacies. He soon found out why as he was presented with a towering mountain of food before him. Packaged goods, sweets and meals were practically overflowing on top of each other. The human was also presented with a biting chill, this must be Emily\u2019s fridge. The dragoness smirked down at the shivering human, \u201cImpressive ain\u2019t it? A whole lot of supermarkets are probably pretty mad at me\u2026 but they\u2019d never suspect a dragon was shoplifting them. I know it\u2019s typical for humans to think they\u2019re a dragon\u2019s favorite food\u2026\u201d Emily stomped over to the pile, grabbing dozens of sushi cartons, peeling them open and dumping them into her cavernous snout. As she chewed her food she sloppily replied with her mouth full, \u201cBut\u2026 to tell ya\u2019 the truth, I much prefer the taste of human food as opposed to making humans my food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished chewing and swallowed, ripping a nasty belch in Matt\u2019s direction. She gave Matt a cute giggle and continued, \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a foodie admittedly,\u201d she poked at her chubby, wobbling belly, \u201cWhich explains the belly I\u2019ve got. But you humans REALLY know how to eat well. I don\u2019t even know how I got by before eating chocolate. And alcohol? My favorite beverage.\u201d She stuck her claws into the corks of five bottles of Hennessy, crudely ripping them open before dumping their contents into a massive dragon-sized chalice. She raised the golden cup, \u201cTo our date. And, hopefully, a long, loving relationship.\u201d She shot-gunned the strong drink like it was nothing.\u201d She ripped another belch, this one was so strong a jet flame shot out of her gullet, \u201cOof, excuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stomped out of the way, waving her claws in front of the mountain of delicacies, \u201cGo on, babe. What\u2019s mine is yours. Take whatever you\u2019d like. We can eat to our hearts content and then maybe we could cuddle up and watch something together.\u201d Admittedly a bit strange, this date was starting off pretty great. Perhaps Emily was a bit of a glutton, but she was a big girl after all, plus she essentially was providing him with an all-you-can-eat buffet. The human smiled up at the dragoness, \u201cThanks so much.\u201d Matt eagerly ate some sushi, as well as heated up some steak and spaghetti in Emily\u2019s microwave. Matt also felt quite stuffed after his feast, burping from the food stuffed in his gut. Emily giggled at her dates belch, she reached out with a claw and poked his side, \u201cOh, looks like I\u2019m rubbing off on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human and dragoness chuckled as Emily gestured for Matt to follow her deeper into her lair. The two eventually entered a living-room-like area with a theater-system. What looked like a theater-screen to Matt was probably only TV-sized for Emily. The dragoness sat down and beckoned for Matt to rest with her, \u201cCome on, cute stuff. Cuddle with me, sit on my belly if you\u2019d like.\u201d Matt obliged and scaled the large, scaly woman, until he was laying down on her chubby dome of a belly. Her scales on her underbelly were especially soft and smooth. Emily cooed, \u201cAw, you\u2019re so cute. So\u2026 now that we\u2019re nice and close, how about\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

They swept past the residential area where Matt lived and over the heart of the city. Something seemed to change in the air, and before long Matt noticed signs of other large creatures flying in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could make out what they were, Matt felt Emily's grip shift, and the two of them swooped downward. The air rushing by roared in his ears, and he couldn't help but feel like he was falling. Thankfully, Emily's sure grip provided a sense of security even as a primal terror gripped Matt. They soon landed in front of an enormous building with an imposing set of doors, though after a moment Matt realized there were several sets of smaller doors set into the main pair that would let creatures of a wide variety of sizes through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily placed Matt gently on his feet, and supported him as he struggled to find his balance. Once he was standing on his own, she asked him in a playful tone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy the flight?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMatt didn't want to admit that he'd been afraid, and chose instead to say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's got to be the most exciting way I've ever traveled!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily seemed to appreciate that, smiling as she gestured toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you, m'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a gentleman!\" Emily laughed as she pushed open the large door and led the way into a foyer decorated with lush plants, beyond which lay an array of candlelit tables. Sharp-dressed waitstaff pushed carts laden with dishes too large for any human, and a variety of monsters sat at various tables, speaking quietly amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily spoke with a host, a black-haired troll with gleaming white eyes and an imposing set of horns. The host looked up her reservation quickly, and Matt realized with a jolt that she must have planned this from the very beginning. When the host asked where the pair wished to be seated, Emily looked at Matt expectantly.</span></div></div>",

It was only a moment before the pair had been led to a spacious booth that was easily the size of Matt's house. Emily gently scooped Matt up with a clawed hand, her grip much lighter now than the first time she had held him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily lifted Matt up to the edge of the table, Matt was relieved to see that the restaurant had accounted for the difference in size between creatures such as Emily and himself. There was a human-sized walkway affixed to the side of the table leading to a comfortable-looking seating area that dipped down below the tables edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Matt walked along the walkway, Emily climbed into the large seat on the other side. She rested most of her body sideways aling the padded seat, allowing her tail to hang over the edge and curl on the floor. The low light of the restaurant booth caused Emily's scales to take on a golden glint as she made herself comfortable. She fixed Matt with another smile when he sat down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made small talk as a griffon waiter, smaller than Emily but still massive by human standards provided them with menus and drinks. Matt talked about his job and desire for something new, while Emily described a fascination with humans, but the trouble she'd had meeting them. Matt still found the dragoness overwhelming, with breathtaking beauty and a terrifying sense of power; but she spoke with a casualness and confidence that made him trust her easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it, the waiter was back and asking if they were ready to order.</span></div></div>",

It's made from the finest beef. I believe that's the custom in the human world too, right?\" Emily chuckled as her date's face got almost as red as her scales. She gave her own order, a luxurious feast that could feed Matt and his entire extended family for a week. He didn't mind her large appetite one bit. The more she gorged herself now, the less chance there was of him becoming dessert. She might be his date, but the towering dragon still looked like she could snap him up without another thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was oblivious to his fears and when the waiter left smalltalk resumed. Matt talked a bit about his friends and family and the dragon had more than a few stories to share as well. One that stood out to him was the tale of Sapphire, a close friend of her and by her description the unluckiest dragon out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she decides it's time to make a name for herself, since she accidentally destroyed the last kingdom she was trying to dominate. Plan's easy enough: Swoop in, grab the princess, take her to lair and bingo, knights and heroes will come to her. She finally gets the attention she deserves and if that don't work, snatch up more of the royal family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sat and listened, no longer feeling unnerved by the casual tone with which the red dragon regaled stories of abduction and murder. There was something empowering about feeling completely outside of the law like her. The confidence with which she spoke was impressive, like this was just how things were supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, few days pass, nobody shows up yet and suddenly some scrawny peasant arrives. She puts on her best intimidation, but the guy explains he's not here for the princess, he's got a message from the king. Turns out the princess was a royal pain in the ass and he sent his thanks to Sapphire for dealing with his problem. So she's so pissed she goes from a blue dragon to a red dragon for a minute, flies over to the king and burns some villages along the way. Grabs the snarky shit right of his throne and nearly just eats him right there. She leaves, hoping the abducted king would spur some action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can see where this is going...\" Matt said jokingly, a big grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, after a week a nobleman arrives to explain that the king was almost as big of a dickhead and if she could please eat them both. She just goes back inside and the only thing the guy hears was her loudly yelling 'oh for <i>fuck</i> sake!'. I mean, it'd be kinda sad if it wasn't so funny. I don't know how she does it, but this happens almost every time. She really has the worst luck. All she ever wanted was the attention of some valiant hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why though? Don't those guys usually only try to kill you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily burst out in laughter, her bellowing voice sending a shiver down your spine. \"Hah, you really think their little swords can harm us? Nah, most stories about a hero defeating the foul dragon are a very one-sided retelling. Truth is, we just toy with them for a bit and leave when we're bored. If they survive the toying, they're free to write whatever heroic poetry they want, doesn't matter to us. Honestly, it's just fun to mess with people like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt a little nervous at his date's stories. Part of him felt like he was just another guy for her to play around with. By now their food had arrived and they were nearly at the end of their dinner. But Emily still had a surprise in store for him.</span></div></div>",

Matt almost expected to see flames from the dragon, but the intense heat was present all the same. He was thankful to be sitting across from her. Any closer and  that might've done some damage. It was awe-inspiring that even something so casual and small from the dragon could pose such risks. As he kept staring dreamily at her she flagged the griffon to get the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later the waiter arrived with a large leather clip holding the bill for Emily and left the pair to serve another table. The red dragon would be paying, since she ordered a hundred times more than the human. Matt tried to be polite and pay for his meal, but he was quickly laughed away as she reminded him she had a literal mountain of treasure at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for today, Matt.\" She said with a happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for such an unforgettable experience.\" He replied, making her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This restaurant always has the best food around. But if I'm honest, I don't like coming here alone. It makes me feel sort of self-conscious.\" Emily muttered, her voice somewhat hushed. He was surprised to hear this mighty dragon was even able to feel that kind of embarrassment. With the way she radiated power and confidence, it was odd to hear her describe feeling any kind of outside pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of why you're here.\" She continued, her tone becoming more stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Matt asked, feeling his concern mounting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've not really got much more use for you.\" She stated flatly, reaching over and grabbing him. Matt let out a shocked yelp, but the dragon's tight grip prevented him from making a scene. She opened the clip again, money already present inside, and placed her date on top. Emily quickly snapped it shut, trapping him up to his neck in the thick, leather binding. Without another word she got up and left, simply abandoning her date as a tip for the waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tried to struggle free, but the magnetic clasp was too powerful. The pressure was overwhelming, but not painful. What did sting was the utter bluntness with which his date had simply discarded him. It shouldn't come as a surprise when she talked so much about using others, especially humans, for her own goals but it hurt all the same. With every passing minute he feared some opportunistic patron or waiter would snap him up and make him into a quick snack. He would soon discover if his fears were true as the griffon approached the table. The man only ended up tiring himself out by the time the waiter arrived. The griffon looked down at the clip with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess you didn't impress the lady. Don't feel too bad, most of her 'dates' end like this.\" His voice was comforting, but Matt still felt very afraid as the griffon popped loose the clasp and grabbed him. The waiter's talons were rough, but compared to the sheer size and strength of Emily's claws a lot more comfortable. The griffon checked the payment, nodding to himself before taking it to the register. He paid little attention to the human in his hand until he'd finished putting away the money. After that, the mythical beast's attention turned fully to the little man.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gryphon waiter held Matt close to his face, inspecting him thoroughly. The man could see the gears in his captor's head turn, shivering a little at the possibilities. He was completely at the monster's mercy and he wasn't na\u00efve enough to believe he wouldn't be gobbled up just like that if it felt like it. He stared into those cold, avian eyes for a moment until the tension was finally broken. The waiter looked around, nodding to himself and going to the kitchen. As he walked through the busy kitchen he announced to nobody in particular:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having my break, it's quiet right now. I'll be back in 30.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome vague mumbling from the other staff confirmed the gryphon's break and he pushed through another door. There was a small set of offices in the back as well as a break room. Matt was surprised to see the monster walk right past the break room and into a small cubicle all the way in the back. He closed the door and switched on the light. The place was a mess, stacks of paper everywhere and enough unfinished work to make any office worker throw up their hands and quit. The dust on the shelves gave the human the impression that this place hadn't seen active use in months. Until now, that is. The gryphon finally released him from the firm grip of his talons, setting him down on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening?\" The man asked, his voice full of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. I want to make a deal.\" He said, catching the little guy off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deal? What are you talking about?\" Matt tried to temper his voice, but still sounded irate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you got ditched here and that sucks. But if you help me out I'll fly you home. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you? How is someone my size gonna be able to help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon just let out some incomprehensible muttering before giving Matt a very clear impression of his intentions. He dropped his pants and dragged his talons along his crotch, the tip of his pointed cock poking out from his sheath. The little man's jaw nearly hit the floor. What the hell was this monster planning to do with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll feel huge in your hands...\" The gryphon mumbled awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm not going near that thing!\" Matt shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it down.\" The waiter hissed back. \"You're lucky I'm even giving you a chance. Most unattended humans end up in someone's belly, so unless you'd prefer taking your chances with the other staff this is your ticket back home.\" He gave his cock another stroke, eliciting more of the fleshy spire to emerge from its den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shuddered to think what foul thoughts were running through the gryphon's mind, but if he spoke the truth then there might not be another way. The chances of another staff member treating him kindly were there, but they could just as easily snuff him out. At least the waiter seemed to want him alive, even if just for this. With some reluctance he probed a little further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I do this, you'll take me home... This isn't some cruel joke where you'll just eat me anyway once you're done with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just have to trust me...\" The monster gave Matt a lecherous smile.</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to take his chances and try his luck with the other staff. The gryphon might be lying about it all, but if he didn't it would be the death of him. He looked the monster in the eye and nodded begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter let out a dark chuckle, his cock nearly fully erect by now. He'd felt pent up for days and this little man was just what he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now give me a hand so i can get over there.\" The man complained. The distance between the desk he was on and the gryphon was far too great to jump. The waiter quickly obliged, grabbing Matt and bringing him to the musky pillar. The man's nose ached from the strong smell. He winced as the monster pressed him into the fleshy surface. Every throb resonated through him and the damp surface stained his clothes. He'd have to burn those back home, there's no way that kind of stench is ever gonna come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to it, little man. If I have to help it might not end well.\" The monster squeezed his victim against his cock tightly, making Matt wince in pain. The man reached his arms as far as he could, but the thick shaft was too girthy for him to wrap around completely. He started rubbing, eliciting a moan from the gryphon. The crushing grip lessened, allowing the man more mobility to reach even more of the sensitive flesh. The musky tower twitched. The waiter wasn't lying about being on edge. Only a few seconds of rubbing at it already felt on the verge of erupting. But Matt knew it would take more than just working the shaft to finish this task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon looked down at his crotch in wonderment as he felt the little man move. He was really trying to climb up? After all that moaning the effort Matt was putting in was commendable. Not wanting to wait until the little man finally reached his sensitive tip the gryphon carefully held a talon under his feet. Matt saw the kind, if horny, expression on the monster's face. He carefully put his feet on the talon and in mere moments was boosted up to the top of the monster's cock. The tapered form let him wrap it into a wide hug, something that proved needed because every twitch shook him around so much more. It was hard for him not to be flung off, but Matt was on a mission to get this over with as fast as possible. The gryphon had to struggle more and more to subdue his moans as the little man carressed his cock in ways he didn't think could feel this good. Those tiny hands made him feel so damn powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn't hold on much longer. He needed to finish this before the throbbing shaft threw him off. He reached up as far as he could and found the beast's slit. He closed his eyes, shutting off his brain as much as he could for the disgusting act he was about to perform. He raised his arm high and plunged it in as deep as he could. Gooey, warm slime covered his arm but there was no time for revulsion. The waiter moaned, the manhood quaking with pent up release. Matt was thrown into the monster's hairy belly, holding on as he watched the fleshy tower spew thick ropes of cum into the air. He was glad not to be anywhere near that. The monster's whole body relaxed, tension dissipating along with the powerful release. The man felt a strange sort of relief himself too. Hopefully this was enough to earn him a way back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter sat back in the office chair, basking in the afterglow of a spectacular orgasm. He'd made quite a mess, but nobody ever came into this dusty old room anyways. These stains wouldn't be the first he'd made in here. He'd kept his reservations about the little man's abilities. The monster was entirely ready to eat him if he didn't do a good job. But after this he felt Matt had more than earned his reward. There was just one little problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome, little guy. You definitely know how to handle big guys like me.\" He spoke softly. Matt didn't seem too impressed by the compliment, rolling his eyes. The waiter chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that wasn't quite how you expected your date to end either. But I'm a monster of my word. I'll fly you back home...\" Matt smiled, but the gryphon still had something to add. \"...right after my shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man groaned a little. \"Well, how long's that gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two more hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Fine... Not like I have a choice. I'll wait.\" Matt's frustration was clearly present, but the gryphon's mind was elsewhere already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to hide you until then.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt grumbled a little as the gryphon grabbed him. The monster's large talons wrapped around him tightly, carrying him away from the soft-furred lower half of his belly. He even got to watch as the wilting cock withdrew into it's sheath. The tip was still messy and leaking, but the waiter seemed in a hurry to retract his manhood. Once only the narrow tip still peeked out from the furred pouch Matt was alarmed to see it come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In there you'll be safe and warm. Just don't wiggle too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you crazy? Just put me in your apron or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't risk having you slip out and hurt yourself, Matt. This place is dangerous for unattended humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they might run into monsters that want to shove them up their dicks!\" Matt shouted back angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter wouldn't hear another word of protest, squeezing the little man to silence him and bringing him right up to the musky sheath. The pervasive stench irritated Matt's nose, but it would be nothing compared to what was awaiting him inside. The gryphon grunted with pleasure as he pushed the squirming man in head-first. There was no resistance against the overwhelming force pushing the human inside the damp cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt could feel the smooth surfaces around him. Both the inside of the sheath and the flaccid manhood it contained were damp with slippery slime. The stink of the monster's last orgasm hung heavy in the air. The waiter busied himself with wiping away the mess on his belly, ignoring all the streaks of white he'd leaked onto the office floor. He saw the little man still stuck in his position, two little legs still squirming outside. With a lewd moan he helped the last of the man into his sheath. Already he could feel his manhood stir, but he couldn't have the human causing trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen closely, Matt. I don't want you trying to get me into trouble by giving me a boner. Just hold still and everything will be fine. But if you go wriggling around like that I will get hard and I will let nature take its course. And if you're wondering what that means, picture yourself trapped in there whilst my growing cock slowly crushes you to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Don't give me a boner.' Says the guy that shoved me in with his dick!\" Matt snarked back, but his words were muffled by the musky pouch holding him. It was no use. Even flaccid the gryphon's manhood was too heavy to move around. Climbing out would probably arouse his captor too much and even if he succeeded the waiter would almost certainly capture him immediately. It irked the man that the gryphon hadn't even considered stashing him somewhere in this little office. By his own admission nobody ever came here. But as even his slightest twitch seemed to send a shiver of pleasure down the beast's whole body it became clear for the man that this had as much to do with his safekeeping as it did with the waiter's enjoyment. He let out a weary sigh. This wasn't even the first time today he'd been used as a sex toy. Hell, counting being stood up earlier it was the third time he was used by a monster in the last hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's world shook as the waiter got on his feet. He dusted himself off and straightened his outfit, trying to hide the last few hints that could've alluded to his actions in the office. Jerking off during breaktime wasn't strictly forbidden, but the others tended to frown on it. But how could the waiter ignore the opportunity provided by this desperate lost human? He felt the odd tingle from his crotch, but nothing that would be a cause for alarm. The next two hours practically flew by, the monster's thoughts frequently wandering off to his little passenger. Finally his shift was over. The waiter changed into his casual clothes, not mentioning a word of the little human to the others. Everyone else had already left when the gryphon slowly coaxed the slime-covered Matt from his sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was exhausted, beaten down by the intense smell and warmth he'd been marinating in for the last two hours. The waiter gave him a vague smile before stepping outside. With a powerful beat of his wings he launched himself into the air, holding his little friend tightly in his left talon. Finally the man spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster smiled and replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm taking you back to your place, as we agreed upon.\" The gryphon stated with a strange sense of pride. Did he expect a pat on the back for being honest? He did follow it up with a question. \"So uhm... where is your place exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gave the monster his address and the waiter nodded. The man didn't question how his ride already knew his neighborhood. Emily had flown for a good while before arriving at the restaurant, it couldn't be close. \"So you're actually just gonna fly me home? No catch at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Don't you trust us monsters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense, but my monster date stood me up and left me in the middle of nowhere, so I had to resort to giving out handjobs in exchange for getting back home. Just saying, I've not got the best track record for monster trust.\" The man snarked, making the gryphon laugh out loud. At least Matt's sense of humor was still alive and well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll find a way to make it up to you or something.\" The monster added awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, maybe you can talk some sense into my annoying neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got one too? Some things never change.\" The gryphon lamented, sympathizing with the little man in his talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, asshole complains if so much as a pin drops in my house. He's constantly harassing me about the smallest squeak. I'm pretty sure he makes half of it up just so he can get in my face and be a dick about it. I've tried to get him to stop, but nothing I say or do ever seems to get through. Maybe a building-sized monster could convince him to leave me be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck with that, those types of neighbor don't listen to anyone, human, monster or otherwise.\" The gryphon gave Matt a nod and a smile. As they rocketed through the sky Matt began to recognize parts of the skyline. They'd been in the air for what couldn't have been longer than half an hour and already they were at the city limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah, you're a lot faster than her.\" He remarked with surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she took the scenic route to impress her date.\" The gryphon mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean her meal ticket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't feel too bad, man. You could've ended up in her belly along with the food.\" The monster tried to cheer the man up, but Matt wasn't feeling too happy after everything that happened today. Minutes later they soared over his neighborhood and the waiter loosened his grip just enough to let Matt free an arm to point out his street and his house. They landed in front of his house. The tight clench of the beast's talons finally opened up completely. Matt didn't mind being held tightly as they flew. Rather that than risking him falling. His steps were a bit shaky after being handled by monsters for so long, but soon after he found his footing. Before he could walk away though a talon stopped him. He turned to see the waiter blushing awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... uhm... before you go, let me give you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was immediately apprehensive, worried the monster would demand more degrading tasks. Instead he was caught off guard as the beast fished a small scrap of paper from his pack and wrote down a number on it. He handed the scrap to Matt, who saw a phone number scribbled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my number... In case you ever want to... You know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spend more time with your dick? Sorry, but that's not my kind of thing.\" Matt threw up his hands, not wanting to give the waiter the wrong impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? You seemed awfully familiar with how to handle it.\" The monster chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I was terrified you'd kill me otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon scoffed. \"Nah, you went out on a date with a <i>dragon</i>, you don't scare that easily. Look, just think it over and who knows where it'll go, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed. He gave a half-hearted nod to the monster. He didn't see any merit in building a friendship with someone who only seemed interested in using him as a toy. But he wasn't about tell the gryphon that. The last thing he wanted was for the waiter to change his mind and abduct him anyway. He was finally able to walk back home as he heard the beast's heavy footsteps pace over to the house to his right. Apparently the gryphon wasn't kidding when he mentioned talking to the annoying neighbor. The man entered through his front door, but what he heard outside sent a chill down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck are y~ Oh my God! AAAaaa-...\" His neighbor screamed before a wet crunch followed. The waiter had undoubtedly unleashed all that pent up frustration from his own annoying neighbor. Loud gulps followed. Matt had never been more curious, but he decided not to look. Ignorance is bliss and all that. From outside the waiter's voice rang one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solved you neighbor problem.\" He said cheerily. Shortly after that the heavy flap of wings fading into the distance let Matt know that this ordeal was finally over. He closed the door behind him and went straight to the bathroom. The next hour would be spent cleaning himself of the horrors he'd been left to stew in for hours. Today had been distressing to say the least. At first his date with a dragon seemed to go alright, only for her to leave him stranded. Then this pervert of a waiter flies him home, but only after jerking the guy off and spending two hours stewing in his sheath. Was this normal for monsters? He seemed to have no issue doing any of this at work. It made him wonder what the dragon would've done if she brought him to her place. Maybe being stood up was a blessing in disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days pass...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt was minding his own business, reading a book. He hadn't touched Monstr since his date with Emily. Being stood up like that had sapped his desire to date more monsters, at least for a while. All of which served to add to his surprise when a large shadow darkened his house. He looked up from his book in surprise. The shadow passed but Matt had a sinking feeling he was about to be part of another monster adventure. He hoped it was all just a figment of his imagination, but moments later his doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmpf, let's get this over with.\" He sighed to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man opened his front door and before him towered Emily. The large red dragon looked imposing as ever, but her expression was far less confident than before. They hadn't exchanged a word since their date. Given how she'd used him, he didn't expect to ever see her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... hi?\" He stammered, unsure what his visitor wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Matt...\" She said with a sigh. Before he could ask what she was doing the dragoness continued. \"I just wanted to say... I'm sorry for what happened earlier. It was rude of me to just discard you like that. I... I felt bad about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I guess there's a first time for everything, right? You, feeling bad for a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a twinge of anger in her eyes, but it melted away as she let out a resigned sigh. Hot breath washed over the man as she had to admit he was right. \"Yeah, I deserved that one. Look, I'm not used to this whole dating thing. Usually the humans that 'accompany' me are just random strangers I grab off the streets. But you... You're someone who specifically sought out a connection with me. And more importantly, through the app I sought a connection with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gave her a puzzled look, making Emily huff a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not good at this sappy emotional stuff. Bottom line is I wanted to apologize to you for my actions. I shouldn't have left you behind in that restaurant and I was hoping I could make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wasn't sure what to say. A full-blown red dragon was on his doorstep apologizing to him. He could tell this was fresh territory for Emily and he almost wanted to reach out and soothe her. But she might just take offense to that and burn him to a crisp. Instead he waited for her to take charge and soldier on with her apology. She did so by producing a tiny satchel and handing it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, a little token from me to you.\" She said. The small bag was surprisingly heavy. Matt opened it up to find a handful of coins and jewels inside. These must be worth a fortune. Those rubies alone looked like they were worth more than his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... Thanks.\" He stammered, shellshocked by the great wealth she'd so casually given him. But Emily wasn't quite finished yet.</span></div></div>",

The fine scales felt smooth, a gust of hot air blasting over him as she huffed a little. \"It's okay, no hard feelings. For what it's worth, I had fun with you on our date. Except for the ditching me part of course. Maybe we could give it another try sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shudders as she giggles. \"Haha, no thanks. This has already gotten weird enough for me. I'm sure there's plenty of others on Monstr that'd be more than happy to date you. Though they probably won't be as pretty as me.\" She boasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've definitely set the bar high on that challenge.\" He responds, smiling calmly, his eyes meeting her piercing gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Matt.\" She says, giving him a small grin. The man had been so absorbed by watching his words and paying attention to her head that he'd completely missed the large clawed hand sneaking up behind him. She grabbed hold of him in an instant, making him yelp in surprise. His open mouth was quickly tended to as she planted a large kiss on his face. The slightest tip of her pointed tongue was enough to fill his mouth, Emily being careful not to hurt this silly little man. With a loud smack she concluded her romantic assault, releasing her grasp and smirking as he struggled to remain standing after her overwhelming kiss. She knew he wouldn't forget that one for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon unfurled her mighty wings and in a single powerful blast launched herself into the air. The gust of air created by her departure was more than enough to knock Matt off his feet and set off his neighbor's car alarm. He scrambled back onto his feet, watching the huge beast soar off. It was cute to see her one last time, especially having her apologize to him. Perhaps this whole monster dating had more to offer than one bad day. He took the satchel of valuables she'd given him and went back into his house. He sat down on his couch to try and process what just happened and from the corner of his eye he saw his phone. Maybe this app was worth another shot...</span></div></div>",

He hit it off with this girl who\u2019s fursona is a fox, apparently she\u2019s very insistent that she\u2019s a kitsune in real life, but Matt didn\u2019t buy it. Still, it would be kind of cute if she showed up to their date with a pair of fox ears on her head. He also had to give her props, whoever animated her profile picture made it look extremely life like. Matt was dressed modestly in a clean t-shirt and black jeans. He was fussing with his hair in the mirror until he heard a knock on his dorm room door. He jumped from the sound. It was already 6? He didn\u2019t even have time to brush his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human shuffled his way to the door and quickly opened it. Standing before him was a fox woman, snout, ears, paws, fur and everything. She had orange fur, a white underbelly, a long snout lined with sharp teeth, canine eyes, and a fairly curvy form to boot. She wore short jeans, and a black t-shirt. She grinned at him, showing off her sharp teeth, \u201cHiya.\u201d Matt stared at her dumfounded, \u201cY-you are?\u201d Yuki narrowed her eyes and grimaced, but it soon returned to a smile, \u201cYour date silly.

She plopped down on the couch and smiled up at him, \u201cSo\u2026 um\u2026 what should we do?\u201d Matt felt a bit scrambled and off-guard having realized his date was a real monster, \u201cWell, ugh, we could get food together\u2026 or see a movie\u2026 or hang out here. Well\u2026 wait\u2026 are you comfortable being seen by humans, like\u2026 out in public?\u201d Yuki paused and considered it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the summer break of Matt\u2019s sophomore year of college. He felt a bit alienated from the few high school friends he had, and most people at the college he\u2019s attending lived in different areas of the state. So he was feeling pretty lonely\u2026 thankfully he discovered Monster after a random late night deep dive had him looking up crypto\u2019s and apparently a couple of naive forum users were using a dating app called Monstr to \u2018capture\u2019 and see magical creatures in the flesh. Of course most of the users who have supposedly used this app recount getting punished by their \u2018dates\u2019 when they revealed they only wanted to meet to get them on camera or to sell them to the government, their angry monster dates would do everything from slapping them in the face to swallowing them whole and trapping them in their guts for days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, most people didn\u2019t believe this and brushed off the dating app as Malware or a joke. Out of boredom, the 20 year old decided to check the app out and after looking it over\u2026 it seemed legit. But monsters couldn\u2019t possibly be real. This must be some kind of roleplaying site, and these monsters were these women\u2019s fursona\u2019s or something. Still\u2026 might be a nice way to find someone cute and interesting. Matt ended up matching and hitting it off with a werewolf girl named Wendy. She was 21, a big punk rocker, kind of crass and abrasive, and seemingly care free and fun to be around. Even if she wasn\u2019t a real werewolf, she\u2019d sounded fun to be around. He ended up scheduling a date late in July on a weekend he knew his parents would be out of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow is that weekend, and the sun was going down as Matt waited for his date. It was around 9pm and soon enough there was a loud knock on his door. He walked up to the wooden door, hoping deep down he wasn\u2019t getting catfished by some obese dude in his forties. Another knock on the door. She\u2019s getting impatient. Matt gulped and opened the door as the humid summer night air entered his nostrils. Standing before him on his front porch, looming over him was a massive, hairy beast with massive teeth\u2026 probably perfect for tearing apart tasty humans like him. Matt fell backwards onto the hardwood floor and screamed, screaming like he was on a rollercoaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy smiled down happily at her human date. He looked so cute in his profile picture, and she couldn\u2019t wait for a long night of partying, getting wasted and cuddling the little guy. Humans were so cute\u2026 and tasty. As soon as he started screaming her smile fell, and turned into a look of worry. Matt fumbled forward and grabbed the front door, slamming it on her and locking it, bracing his entire body against the door in an attempt to hold her off. Matt gasped and gazed at the ceiling in shock of what he just say. A monster! A real werewolf. But\u2026 if a werewolf showed up at the same time Wendy was supposed to show up,.. that means\u2026? Wendy knocked on the door again, scowling and narrowing her eyes, \u201cHey, what gives? HELLOOOOOO! Human? Open up. We have a date, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealing himself, Matt moved away and opened the door once again. The large werewolf clamped her muscular paw on the door, holding it open. She raised a brow and had a sarcastic grin on her muzzle, \u201cOk\u2026 not the best entrance one of my dates have had. But I can overlook that because you look especially cute for a human. I\u2019m Wendy, it\u2019s nice to meet you Matt.\u201d Being the forward person that she was, Wendy lunged forward, wrapping Matt up in her tree-trunk, furry arms and hugging him tightly to her bountiful chest. Wendy was big, even for a werewolf, at nearly ten feet in height with a chubby form, thick arms and legs, a muffin top belly, a bountiful chest and a bouncy rear end. She was decked out in punk rock garb from a leather jacket coated in patched and spikes, to her long flowing hair with streaks of green dye through her fur and hair, she even had a spiky nose ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also smelt very \u2018punk rock\u2019, having the same kind of encompassing B.O. that the bathroom of a punk rock bar/venue might have. Her breath too was very rancid and meaty, but this should\u2019ve been expected with a monster gal, let alone a werewolf. Despite that, she was fairly pretty and seemed to glow in the moonlight. After a nearly, spine-breaking hug, the werewolf left her date down and smiled at him, \u201cI\u2019m really excited about our date. What would you rather do\u2026 come back to the, um\u2026 Monster World with me? Or did you have a place around here in mind? It\u2019s ok, if your friends see me with you I promise not to embarrass you. But I could take you to a really fun club if you\u2019re interested\u2026 you could meet some of my monster friends. They love humans, both to chat with and gobble up, he-heh! But I\u2019m game for anything!\u201d So, where do you go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wait, there's a whole, separate Monster World?\" Matt stammered. It was hard enough to believe that a werewolf nearly twice his size just gave him a hug, but now she's about to claim there's many more like her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, sort of? It's complicated. But we can go there and I can show you some of it. Let's start by going to my place. I'm sure you'll love it.\" She says with unrestrained enthusiasm. \"But first, is this a date or what? Pucker up, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt pulled his head back to see Wendy closing in for a kiss. He barely had time to prepare before a clawed hand at the back of his head stopped him from pulling back further. He winced at his date's foul breath, but there was no going back. He quickly pursed his lips to receive her affection. Wendy had to almost kneel down to get eye to eye with Matt, but she didn't care. She was getting that kiss, even if she had to pin him down for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man finally resigned himself to his fate. He had been chatting with this woman for a few weeks now, he should've expected this. And going by her rather suggestive texts before the date, he should probably prepare for much more too. She stole his thoughts as her stocky muzzle made contact, her tongue prying past his lips almost instantly. Matt's eyes shot open, both at how gross the taste was and how strangely amazing it felt to intimately kiss a werewolf. Her tongue was so powerful, directing his own in a weird little back and forth as the two of them let out mumbling little moans. It was good to hear this was as great for her as it was for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwaaaah... Hmmm... Delicious and a good kisser. How have you been single this long?\" Wendy mused with a toothy grin. Matt was still busy recovering from the overwhelming assault on his senses when he saw his date search for something in her purse. The small leather satchel was covered in patches, most of which from bands. To his surprise there were a fair few human bands in there as well. He tried not to giggle at the idea of her trying to blend in at a human punk concert. After a few moments she fished out a small collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put this on.\" She said, handing Matt the collar. He raised an eyebrow in contempt. The little tag dangling from it read: \"Property of Wendy Wolfbottom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, property? What the hell is that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sighed. \"Any stray human wandering around in the Monster World is free food for whoever wants them. With that around your neck any hungry monsters have to ask me for permission first. Don't worry, it's not like I want you to be my slave or anything. Unless you're into that of course.\" She gave him a big wink and smile. Matt was still not too comfortable with the idea of being her 'property', even if it was just to keep up appearances. But this wasn't the moment for cold feet. He wanted to see this Monster World. With a sigh he put the collar on, making the werewolf let out a little squeak of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the cutest, now follow me.\" She said, taking a few steps back. Matt grabbed his coat, locked the door behind him and followed the large werewolf down the street. Only a few streets further Wendy turned into a narrow alleyway. Matt knew this was a dead end, but something told him his date might have a way. She planted a large foot on a manhole cover and to his amazement it slid open. He peered down and saw nothing but darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first time is always scary. Here, allow me.\" She said, reaching out a hand to Matt. He grabbed it and she quickly pulled him into another tight hug. The man wrapped his arms around his date and closed his eyes as the werewolf casually hopped into the darkness. He felt his stomach turn as it seemed like they were weightless. Moments later it felt like gravity had reversed, the two of them 'falling' upwards. He opened his eyes to see the same alleyway. Puzzled, he looked around. His city was gone, replaced with something out of a gothic fantasy-horror book. The moon shone bright and green, the houses all looked strange and out of place. Everything felt slightly off, but Matt was the most fascinated by how, in spite of everyhing, similar it seemed. He'd expected castles and lairs, but the Monster World looked as mundane as the human world. Of course, the things that went on behind those doors were anyone's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy set him down and motioned for Matt to follow. As they emerged from the alleyway into a quiet street he got his first look at some of the other creatures sharing this world with her. There was a pair of centaurs, one of which carrying a dainty looking sprite on his back. They were all joking and laughing together. A little ahead of him a bored looking fish-man was waiting for the bus. It gave him a strange look as they walked by. They turned the corner and nearly bumped into a sphinx, the large lion-headed beast apologizing to them. The werewolf smiled a little at the awed puppydog eyes on her date. It wasn't much longer before they arrived at the apartment complex she called home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unlocked the door and guided Matt inside. The other coats in the hallway immediately made it clear she wasn't living alone. What was also very clear was that none of her housemates believed in hygiene either. The wall of stench that hit him was eye-watering. Sweat, stale burps, unwashed clothes and a general animal funk hung in the air. He hung his coat up and walked into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaid out on the couch was a large horse-man. He was watching tv until the human entered the room. He hoisted himself out of his slouched position and raised a curious eyebrow. He wore some tattered shorts and a sweat-stained shirt with the logo of a band on it. He looked muscular, broad-chested and probably easily able to bench-press a small car. The monster's skin was most curious of all. It looked like short gray fur, but it moved in ways that seemed almost liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro, you're Wendy's date, right? Nice meetin' ya. I'm Buck.\" He said, holding out a hand and giving Matt a toothy smirk. It let the human see that this horse-man had some long, sharp fangs along with his usual chompers. Before he could shake the strange monster's hand though Wendy came in and batted Matt's hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off, Buck. Matt, Buck here is a kelpie. Their skin is like super glue for anything that's alive.\" She chided, staring daggers at the horse man. Buck just laughed to himself, putting up his hands. \"We've got glue remover around, but I don't need my date held up by his sticky fingers.\" Wendy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No touching the horse, got it.\" Matt thought aloud, following her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The towering werewolf smiled and gestured for Matt to follow her deeper into her apartment, \u201cCome on. Let me introduce you to my other roomies. Trust me, they\u2019re way better than Buck.\u201d The Kelpie groaned, \u201cNo they\u2019re not.\u201d Wendy took Matt\u2019s hand and walked deeper into the apartment, \u201cYes they ARE!\u201d Alongside their bathroom, there were four bedrooms\u2026 one for Wendy, and three others. Wendy pointed a claw at one door, \u201cSo this one\u2019s me.\u201d Then to another, \u201cThis is Cindy\u2019s. And Petra\u2019s\u2026 and last one is Levi\u2019s.\u201d Matt looked up at Wendy with a look of confusion, \u201cWhere does Buck sleep?\u201d The werewolf chuckled, \u201cOh, yeah. About that\u2026 he bunks on the couch, we were barely scraping by on rent for a while until he needed a place and all we had was a fold out couch\u2026 but he likes it\u2026 and he\u2019s been a good friend\u2026 although a bit of a trouble maker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy turned her attention back to the doors, knocking her huge paw on one, \u201cI hope everyone\u2019s home. I\u2019d love for you to meet my closest friends. They\u2019re all really intrigued by humans.\u201d Opening the door was a large and muscular Cerberus woman, with bulging, muscular arms that looked as thick as Matt\u2019s body was wide. She had large breasts, a prominent six pack, and wore a torn white t-shirt and cargo shorts\u2026 she also had noticeable body odor and stained fur. The three heads that sprouted from between her shoulders groaned as she opened the door. The middle head spoke, \u201cOh, come on Wendy, I was napping-\u201c The dog woman stared down in surprise as she noticed the nervous human standing before her, \u201cIs that a human?\u201d Wendy grinned, proudly beaming at her friend, \u201cHe\u2019s also my date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devil dog woman grinned, \u201cOh, you\u2019re quite the lucky little human.\u201d Matt blushed under the canine\u2019s gaze. Petra started chatting up her roommate, \u201cSo, where are you two cuties going tonight?\u201d Wendy giggled, \u201cWell\u2026 maybe The Wrecker, the old punk club tonight. Or\u2026 just around. Matty here has never been to the Monster World so it\u2019s all new to him.\u201d The devil dog smirked, \u201cYou\u2019re in for a wild ride if this is your first night here, little human.\u201d She smirked before returning to her room. Wendy happily knocked on the next door, it being answered by a huge, muscular dragon, \u201cHiya Levi. This is my new boyfriend. He\u2019s a human, his name is Matt.\u201d The towering, green-scaled creature was dressed only in boxer, barely covering up his bulge, aside from that he was a pretty muscular guy despite a chubby bear belly, \u201cUm\u2026 hey. Can I eat him?\u201d A chill shot down Matt\u2019s spine. Wendy\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cNo. No! No! At least\u2026 I mean\u2026 not right now. It\u2019s his first night here. Plus, he doesn\u2019t even know you, at least get to know him and ask politely first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Matt was a bit on edge as he was faced with a dragon who clearly looks like he\u2019s a fan of food, candidly talking about putting him in his belly. Matt was fully aware dating a werewolf would probably result in them discussing monster\u2019s more\u2026 predatory leanings towards humans at some point\u2026 he was just hoping it wouldn\u2019t come up on their first date. Wendy pushed Matt towards Levi as the human shrunk beneath the big lizards gaze, \u201cSay hi, honey.\u201d Matt quivered, \u201cUm\u2026 Hi L-Levi. I-I like your um-scales.\u201d The dragon smirked and chuckled, \u201cHey, thanks bud. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t eat you. At least not yet. Let\u2019s get you comfortable around monster first.\u201d He winked before retreating back to his room. The last door Wendy led Matt to was Cindy\u2019s room. Wendy obnoxiously slammed her paw against the door, teasingly yelling, \u201cHey bitch, get your pale ass out here. I got some for you to meet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was soon answered by a pale vampire chick, dressed in a similar punk rock get-up as Wendy. The vampiress eyed up Matt and smiled, \u201cWendy, you shouldn\u2019t have. You always know when I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Her jaw dislocated, opening wide enough to easily fit Matt. Her long, pointed tongue drooped off the side of her cavernous maw, as her arms outstretched to grab her human meal. Wendy smacked her friend in the head, \u201cNo, dumb ass. This isn\u2019t food, this is my date. This is the human guy I was talking about, Matt.\u201d Cindy\u2019s mouth closed up and she gave Matt another once over, \u201cOh ok. Heh, sorry about that. I skipped lunch is all. I\u2019m Cindy, nice to meet you Matt.\u201d She outstretched her arm and a shaken Matt accepted it in a handshake. Wendy smiled widely, \u201cCindy\u2019s been my best friend since I was a wolf pup. We\u2019ve done everything together. So you\u2019ll probably get to know her the most out of my roommates.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little nervous about this whole ordeal, Matt looked up into Wendy\u2019s eyes, \u201cI-Is she gonna eat me?\u201d Cindy giggled and answered, \u201cAt some point probably. That comes with the territory of dating a monster. But don\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t be harmed. I know it may be hard to wrap your head around, but a human going into a monsters belly doesn\u2019t exactly end the same way\u2026 lets say a steak turns out when it goes into your belly.\u201d Matt was a bit shocked by this, but he didn\u2019t have much time to filter through all this information as the vampire prodded the couple, \u201cSo what are you guys doing tonight?\u201d Wendy shrugged, \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know. We floated the idea at going to the club\u2026 or maybe we could just stick around the apartment and we could all get to know each other together\u2026 or\u2026 whatever really.\u201d A comforting paw rubbed Matt\u2019s shoulder as Wendy smiled down at him, \u201cWhat do you think, honey?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure I can handle a whole club full of monsters of all shapes and sizes.\" Matt said sheepishly. Both Wendy and Cindy giggled loudly at his innocence, the werewolf quickly hoisting him off his feet into another crushing hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, isn't he the cutest?\" She coos loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure is.\" Cindy nodded. \"It's okay, little man. I'm sure we can throw our own little party in here.\" She spoke with a sickeningly sweet voice. She then addressed her friend in a more formal tone. \"Just give me half an hour to finish up what I was doing and I'll join you two. Unless you want to be alone for your 'date'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, the more the merrier.\" The werewolf guffaws, before looking over her shoulder. \"Except for Buck, maybe.\" The two giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can <i>hear</i> you.\" He yelled from the living room, laughing at their teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy carefully patted Matt on the head before closing her door to get to work again. Wendy carried him over to her room, stopping at each door to ask if the occupant of the room was interested in joining in. From Levi's room they could hear a strange wet squelching. The dragon just gave her an absent-minded \"I'm busy!\" The werewolf shrugged, not spending another thought on what he could be doing in there. Matt wondered if the large green-scaled beast was tending to that bulge in his boxers he saw earlier. Monsters have needs too, right? There wasn't much more time to wonder as his date walked over to Petra's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna have some fun with the human in my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I?!\" They heard three voices speak in unison, followed by some quick thumps of the devil dog's footsteps. The door swung open and a very eager Petra followed closely behind as the werewolf took Matt to her room. When she opened the door it was clear she was the messiest of the lot, a new wave of stench hitting the man in the face. The distinct notes of clothes that have been mired in sweat and left unwashed for months hung heavily in the air. In the corner sat something that resembled more of a den or a nest than an actual bed. A large heap of clothes, pillows and other soft things, covered in loose fur and stains. The rest of her room was a disorganized mishmash of furniture, unwashed dishes and empty food containers. In the other corner of the room stood a relatively unscathed looking couch. Wendy practically threw herself at it, landing on her belly with a big splash. Matt was the only thing softening her impact and the heavy werewolf slamming into his back drove the air from his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops, sorry babe. Got a little carried away.\" She chuckled, Petra providing three more amused laughs. the werewolf turned around and propped herself up, sitting on the couch with Matt in her lap. He would complain more, but she let her large chest rest on his head and frankly that felt fantastic. The cerberus sat down beside her, giving him a trio of smiles. Right next to the couch, strategically hidden under a stack of pizza boxes and some tattered old clothes, was a small fridge. Petra leaned over towards it and took out a six-pack of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now it's a party.\" Wendy cheered. The devil dog handed her and Matt a can. The werewolf drove a clawed thumb through the top of it and, realizing her date wouldn't be able to match that feat, opened his beer too. He was handed his drink and the first thing he noticed was the heft. Both monsters here stood several feet taller than him and everything around him was built for their size. The cans had to be a full liter each at a minimum. Hopefully they understood if he stuck to only a small number of them. His jaw nearly dropped as he saw Petra open up two cans. Her left and right head each closed their eyes and chugged a can a piece whilst her central head looked more visibly tipsy by the second as she stared at him. He gently sipped from his own drink, the monster beer leaving the weirdest aftertaste in his mouth. Best not to wonder what was in there. Above him Wendy let out a satisfied belch, having finished her drink already.</span></div></div>",

Wendy looked down at Matt with a triumphant smirk, \u201cWelp, we\u2019ve got the whole place to ourselves tonight. We could do whatever we want.\u201d The towering wolf woman dove onto the couch, getting comfortable. She turned to Matt and grinned lustfully, gesturing him to come closer with a claw. Soon enough the human was in the wolf woman\u2019s embrace, sitting on her lap with her muscular arms wrapped around him, her breasts pressing into the back of his head. Her furry body felt particularly warm and comforting. Her wet nose nuzzled the human\u2019s hair, \u201cSo sweetheart. What would you like to do together tonight?\u201d</span></div></div>",

His seat shakes as the werewolf laughs loudly. She tightens her embrace for a moment before giving him an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, you're funny. We don't really sort movies that way, but I guess you could say that. Honestly we just watch what you guys make most of the time. For all your weird little quirks and weaknesses, you humans know how to make good entertainment. But just one thing. I like my movies violent, none of that sappy romance bullshit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, no to those indeed. Wastes of time.\" Matt agrees, nodding fiercely. \"You pick something.\" He suggests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy uses the remote to select a movie and soon enough they're both watching some no-name action vehicle celebrating it's R-rating with gratuitous showers of blood and explosions. Matt was having a good time, but Wendy seemed almost entranced by the gory spectacle. She knew this movie would be up her alley, but she hadn't seen it before and she had no idea just how perfectly it matched her tastes. Every new scene was a feast for her eyes, her smile growing with every henchman savagely dispatched on screen. Matt suddenly felt something wet on his shoulder, looking up to see the werewolf staring intently, a strand of saliva dripping onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I guess you like the movie?\" He says awkwardly, making her realize she's drooling on her date. Wendy quickly wipes away the spittle from her maw and gives him a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, this is my kind of action. Do you like it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, it's got great pacing and they really go all out.\" Matt nods, feeling his date squeeze him a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's giving me... ideas.\" She said, leering at him with an unsettling glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...\" He mumbles, looking a little afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf uses the remote to pause the movie and holds her date firmly, she shifts herself on the couch, laying down along the length of it with the human draped on top. She guides his body upwards, his chest pushed against her breasts and his mouth up to her muzzle. She gives him a loving wink before she starts to lick his face. Matt squirms and sputters, trying to resist the sudden slobbery assault, but the wolf woman was showering him affection almost literally. When he opened his mouth to spit out some of the drool that had seeped in she plunged her tongue inside, turning it into an impromptu French kiss. Matt was overwhelmed by the sudden and intense moment. He tried to fight it, but Wendy loved a bit of struggle in her dates. Her strong arms easily held him down as she ravaged the inside of his mouth with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she finished up, pushing the man away to inspect the results. His face was shiny thanks to the thick coat of werewolf drool and he was breathing heavily. With a satisfied smile she lowered him enough to have his face hang over her breasts before letting him drop down. His head was wedged into her cleavage, held down with minimal effort as he was simply too tired to keep fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, a proper kiss. You just take it easy and recover, because if you keep being this cute I'm gonna want more than a kiss next.\" She said, smiling from ear to ear. Matt just let out a muffled groan, unsure whether he was regretting his werewolf date or whether this was awakening something in him that compelled him to stay and see just how crazy this might get. Wendy unpaused the movie and watching the remaining 20 minutes or so with Matt held down against her. As the credits roll she turns off the TV. The blood-soaked climax of the film put an enthusiastic glint in her eyes and she was ready to share this enthusiasm with Matt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Truth be told, deep down, Wendy wanted nothing more than to rip off Matt\u2019s clothes and ride him until the sun came up. However, she knew humans don\u2019t work like monsters do. Thanks to the Monstr forums as well as some complimentary brochures about human culture and dating habits, Wendy knew enough to understand humans were less \u2018up-front\u2019 as monsters. A few days ago, after getting back from a concert, she felt nervous about her upcoming date. Wanting to impress Matt, she went on a thread in the Monstr forum called \u2018Botched Dates - What Monsters Can Learn From Failed Dates With Humans\u2019. The failures were bountiful and filled with different varieties. A Naga woman accidentally hugged her date too hard and sent him to the hospital. Roleplaying as a dragon and a knight, a dragon man accidentally went a bit overboard with his role-play and swallowed his date, even after barfing her back up and apologizing profusely she still hasn\u2019t called or replied in-app for weeks. An especially frisky knoll woman, wanting to tease her female date, pounced on her and started pulling off her clothes with her teeth which resulted in her date elbowing her in the nose and yelling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Wendy wanted to do was be a tone-deaf, big, stupid monster who takes things way overboard. Maybe they could get rough next time, after giving Matt fair warning of course. These humans were a bit weird, and very prudent, but the werewolf couldn\u2019t deny enjoying her date so far. As the credits started to roll, Wendy made up her mind, she\u2019d still have her fun with Matt, but she\u2019d play it a bit cautious\u2026 see how he reacts. As the stunned human laid across her werewolf date, Wendy smirked down at him, showing off her big teeth and giving him a whiff of her monstrous breath, \u201cHey, babe. That left me feeling a little\u2026 frisky, if you know what I mean.\u201d Wendy giggled as she gently pushed Matt down towards her thighs so she could sit up on the couch. She smirked down at the man as she slowly pulled her shirt off, letting her large breasts bouncing in her bra. She sensually ran her tongue across her black lips, as she moved her paws to her back, unclasping her bra and throwing it at Matt\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Matt pulled the bra away, he was presented with Wendy\u2019s large bouncy breasts and erect, pink nipples. Matt was shocked as Wendy smirked at him, and sensually ran her claws over her watermelon-sized perky breasts, \u201cYou like them?\u201d She moans as she gropes her breasts, \u201cGo on, babe. Give them a feel. We monsters are a pretty frisky bunch, and I\u2019m more than happy to treat you.\u201d She laid back, allowing Matt to do whatever he liked, she just wanted to make sure her date could get into this foreplay himself. As Matt laid there, he could feel a warm, wet patch against him chest, it stunk too. It seems that Wendy was getting pretty turned on. Following Wendy\u2019s suggestion, the human sat up and reached forward, groping her huge breasts in his hands. The feels of the soft, furry orbs was lovely, and made the werewolf groan, \u201cMmm, now we\u2019re talking. You enjoying yourself Matt?\u201d The nearly hypnotized, drooling human snapped out of his trance upon hearing her voice, \u201cW-what? Oh, of course. Typically a girl doesn\u2019t go topless on the first date though.\u201d Wendy giggled, \u201cDo I look like any of the girls you\u2019d typically date?\u201d Matt chuckled, shaking his head. Wendy smiled, \u201cWell, let\u2019s get a little closer, shall we?\u201d What does the werewolf do now?</span></div></div>",

Wendy bit her lip, wanting to wholeheartedly agree with his statement, but she had a different plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of? But you should be aware, this monster loves being on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single fluid motion she sat up, her breasts pressed into Matt's face. She grabbed hold of him and scooted a little backwards to make sure her next move would fit on the couch. It wasn't much of a move, more the werewolf simply letting herself slump forward, calmly carrying her date along as she laid on her belly with Matt underneath. If there were any protests, her breasts were silencing them completely. But Wendy had the sneaking suspicion the man wasn't raising a fuss with his head buried completely in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grunted a little as he felt her weight settle on top of him. It was far from painful, but quite overbearing. Though it was hard to argue with the incredible feeling of having his head smothered so thoroughly between those soft globes. The thick fur made them even more comfortable than he ever thought possible. The rest of his body too felt like it was covered in a warm, weighty blanket. Wendy wiggled a little bit, her fluffy underside tickling him gently as she let out a soft moan. He wondered if his joke was closer to the truth that he had thought. Part of him was curious to see what it would be like to have her pull out all the stops, but he feared that might well end up with him in the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy finally lifted her torso up, propping herself up on her arms to look down at her date's face. He was all misty-eyed, staring dreamily at the gently swaying chest above him. She gave him a wide, toothy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well someone's having fun. But don't you think you should be putting in some work to return the favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"going by the moaning, I'm pretty sure I already am.\" Matt said with a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get lazy with me human. I'm more than happy to continue this conversation with you in my belly.\" Wendy said playfully. Matt had a hard time trying to distinguish whether she was just joking.</span></div></div>",

This was starting to have been a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, mother always said, 'Never devour your date until after you mate,'\" Wendy said. \"I suppose she would know - she and father love it when they devour each other after having sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your parents do that often?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy nodded. \"They tell me that it's much more intimate than sex itself, having absolute control over the other, who has placed their complete trust in you.

That would give you a level of control of how much of you is actually inside of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckled nervously. \"I'm still unsure about all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" said Wendy. \"We could work on it for our next date.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy rummaged in her room for a couple of minutes while Matt and Buck waited outside in the living room. The two were most silent until Buck chuckled and turned his attention to Matt, \u201cSay, if all goes well between you and Wendy, at some point could I eat you?\u201d Eat him!? Matt didn\u2019t know how to respond. He\u2019s never been eaten before and certainly was never asked so politely about it. Wendy roared from her bedroom, \u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend Buck, paws-off!\u201d Soon, Wendy emerged from her bedroom with a few touch-ups to her appearance, some gothic, runny, black make-up across the fur on her face and some extra chains on her attire, \u201cOk, I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s go to The Carcass!\u201d Wendy grabbed Matt\u2019s hand in a blood-flow-constricting grip and dragged him out of the apartment with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were soon back on the street, walking towards the establishment. The cool night air blew against Matt\u2019s skin and through Wendy\u2019s fur. As they walked, Wendy started some small talk, but Matt was still very interested in the Monster World around him. Wendy smiled, \u201cBy the way, thanks so much for going out with me tonight Matt. I really appreciate it. I\u2019ve always wanted to date a human, you humans are so cute, and I\u2019ve always wanted a human guy to cuddle with.\u201d Matt chuckled, \u201cHey, it\u2019s no problem at all. I\u2019m having a great time. I never thought I\u2019d date a werewolf, especially one as pretty as you.\u201d Wendy grinned ear-to-ear, she had to hold herself back from delivering a back-breaking hug to Matt. But she knew their date would end pretty poorly if they had to spend the night in the ER of a Monster Hospital. She bent down and delivered a loving lick across his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time they had arrived. Once they were I.D.-ed by a tattooed minotaur bouncer they were inside, Matt was given an \u2018X\u2019 stamp on his hand, signifying he couldn\u2019t drink. The place was humid from the dozens of warm bodies packet into the Punk Club. Much like a normal club that catered to punk lovers on Earth, there was graffiti on the walls, a \u2018dirty\u2019 abrasive aesthetic to the decor, and tons of patrons of all different species wearing make-up, adorned in tattoos and alternative clothing. As the couple tried to squeeze their way between sandwiched bodies they heard a high-pitched squeal, \u201cWENDY! Oh my god, you\u2019re here!\u201d The couple were approached by a giddy shark woman, with some piercings on her snout, a crop-top vest, and tattoos on her exposed thighs, arms and breasts. The two monsters gal hugged each other, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you Matilda. How\u2019s things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giddy shark replied, \u201cGreat! My band is doing really well, we\u2019re going on tonight actually. I found this really cool dating app, I think you\u2019d like it, it\u2019s called Monstr and-\u201c She paused as she noticed Matt, \u201cHey there! You look tasty.\u201d This put Matt off a bit as the looming shark licked her chops, \u201cFunny you should say that Tilda\u2026 because I actually found this little morsel on Monstr. He\u2019s super cute.\u201d Matilda put her hands on her hips and sized-up Matt, \u201cI\u2019ll say. Well, maybe we could hang out after our set. And perhaps Matt here could give me some tips on approaching humans, especially human ladies.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckled nervously, \u201cYeah, sure. I could help.\u201d She smirked, \u201cThanks. I think you\u2019re gonna love being with Wendy, she\u2019s one of my best friends, and if I were a human, I couldn\u2019t imagine a better monster girlfriend.\u201d Wendy smiled, putting her paws on her chest, \u201cTilda! You\u2019re too sweet.\u201d The shark shook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, but I gotta go get ready.\u201d Matilda scooted her way through the packed bodies back towards the Club\u2019s green room. Now what do Wendy and Matt decide to do?</span></div></div>",

He followed along as best he could, squeezing between the various monsters. Some were his size where others stood much taller. After being dragged along someone's sweaty belly he finally popped free from the mass and stumbled up against the bar. Wendy lifted him up a little onto a stool. The barkeep was a gruff looking minotaur and Matt's glance shot back to the entrance and then to him. He looked identical to the bouncer, straight down to the tattoos. He's sure there'd be some subtle differences, but he didn't get time to look further before the bull man talks to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll it be, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, whatever this gets me.\" Matt showed him the stamp on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thought so.\" He rumbled, leaning down and retrieving a bottle of cola from the fridge before putting it down in front of Matt. He turned to Wendy and smiled. \"The usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, bring it on.\" She said with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barkeep went over to the other side of the bar to grab the things needed for her drink, allowing Matt to ask her a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bullshit, I'm old enough to drink. Why did I get this?\" He said, pointing at the mark on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can handle alcohol, but what they serve here has some extra spice that humans aren't known to handle very well. It can do all kinds of things to ya. Like make you shrink or grow or melt you into a sentient slime. Sometimes you just explode. In the end it generally makes a mess so humans are cut off. Don't worry though, if you really want to get buzzed I got some human-friendly drinks for you back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, alright.\" Matt pouted. Couldn't she have picked a bar that'd let him drink too? He sipped his cola and turned to watch the bands perform on stage. They went by surprisingly fast. He paid some extra attention when Matilda got on to the stage. Wendy cheered and hollered loudly for her friend and Matt soon found himself joining her. Not just because his date was doing it, but because Matilda had a beautiful voice. The shark woman bellowed each song with vigor and spirit, barely needing the mic to amplify her words. Other patrons were cheering and dancing, overall the mood was great. By the end of her set she was met with raucous applause and cheering from the whole club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next band got on and after a few minutes Matilda was down at the bar, sliding into the vacant seat next to Matt. He felt surprisingly safe with a powerful monster sitting on either side of him, even if they both stood several feet taller than him. Matilda reeked a bit of fishy sweat, her time in the spotlight definitely having had an effect and the shark seemingly unbothered by the smell. Wendy had already bought her a drink and enthusiastically handed it to her. \"Great job, Tilda. You blew the roof off this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight. One of these days I'm sure I'll make it big.\" The shark woman said, staring dreamily at the stage. Matt smirked a little seeing the woman that was so confident on there be such a dreamer behind the scenes. He didn't really know how to gauge monster music but in his world her performance would be considered pretty great. Though humanity probably wasn't quite ready for a music star that could swallow people whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the conversation turned to him, with Matilda jumped straight onto the most important question on her mind. \"So did you two... you know...\" Her broad grin nearly made Matt spit out his drink. Wendy just laughed. \"Hah, not yet, but maybe if he's in the mood he'll get some tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you tease.\" Matilda giggled before turning to the human. \"Little tip for ya, Matt. If she starts growling, just snarl back at her, it's a real turn on for werewolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt just smiled awkwardly. He had no idea if the shark woman was genuinely trying to help him or just messing with him. Either way, the two monsters each ordered another drink before Matilda announced that she had a back room available for the three of them. A somewhat less noisy place where they could talk normally seemed like a good thing to Matt, who could tell that the shark woman had so many questions on the tip of her tongue for him. Wendy mutters something to the barkeep that her date doesn't quite catch and the two get on their feet. They both take one of Matt's hands, holding their drinks in the other and pushing through the crowd and into the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not much to look at. Some dim lights, a ratty couch and some equally flimsy-looking chairs, all of which far larger than furniture Matt is used to. They were meant for monsters even taller than the two he's with. The walls were covered in band posters and the door creaked as Matilda closed it behind them. The music could still be heard thumping down the narrow hall, but it gave them some room for conversation. Moreover, it gave them some privacy.</span></div></div>",

Of course, when you make a friend back when you were younger, and leave for a few decades, only to come back to visit them, they tend to look like they're in their forties or fifties, while you have the physical fitness of a human in their mid twenties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Matt. \"Um, what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia chuckled. \"Don't worry, I'm only twenty. We'd at least have a few good decades together. Can't say I'd be strictly faithful to you for longer than that, but as my grandmother always said, 'Make sure to visit the good ones in their final days.' Guess she would know - she was there for most of her lovers in their final days, including my grandfather come to think of it. So has my mother with those prior to my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, am I your first?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to see on that one,\" said Felicia. \"I'm new to dating myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckled nervously. \"Don't blame you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get started,\" Felicia said.</span></div></div>",

Then, she grabbed him, and placed him in her breast pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Matt screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking us someplace better,\" said Felicia. \"Much more fun too!\" She pointed at his motorcycle. \"Small Down.\" The bike became toy-sized, and was placed in a pouch. She got out her pen-sized broom. \"Enlarge.\" The broom became full-sized. \"Enjoy the ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Matt was forced into the bottom of the pocket, as she took off into the air.

It was hard to place where it came from precisely, but it distracted him just long enough send a shiver down his spine. \"I don't need this, I got a hot babe waiting to meet big Chad...\" He mumbles to himself, turning his attention back to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the f...\" He stammers as he suddenly sees another figure standing behind him in the mirror. She was roughly as big as Chad, but her skin was a deep purple and she had two short black horns growing out of her head. A slim tail could be seen whipping around behind her. But what stood out most was her outfit. She made strippers look modest, wearing a few strings and scraps of cloth held together by little more than wishful thinking. It did nothing to hide her enormous rack. But even with those beauties staring right at him he couldn't muster more than a shocked yelp at seeing them suddenly appearing in his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snaps around to look at the intruder directly, but the room was empty. Was his mind playing tricks on him or did this girl put a spell on him already? Suddenly something grabbed his shoulder and Chad nearly jumped out of his skin. Leaping away from the mirror he looks back to it to see the girl step through it like it was a portal. She giggles loudly and reaches out her purple hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, I'm Lily. Are you Chad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man scrabbles back onto your feet, refusing to take her hand until he's back up again. Finally he shakes it, trying his best to look charming. \"Hey babe, that was one hell of an entrance. You shoulda told me you would come through the mirror, could've cleaned it real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins from ear to ear. The cocky ones were always more fun to play with. She spoke softly, her words sweet as honey. \"So Chad... what convinced you that dating a demoness from the circle of lust was a good idea? Or was that just 'Big Chad' that swiped right?\" She shot a salacious look at his crotch before looking him in the eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... I wanted to date someone that could keep up with me...\" He stammers, still trying to sound cool. Finally recovering from the initial shock of standing in front of an actual real succubus Chad gives her a sly smile. \"Think you could handle a challenge like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy, you've got no idea of the things I 'handle'.\" She scoffed, widening his smile further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn I love a woman with confidence. Always like to see them sputter and tap out.\" He adds, thrusting his hips. Lily didn't dignify that statement with a response and just laughed loudly. She then put on her most serious glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay big man, you think you're all that? How about a little challenge then? If you can make good on your claims and prove too much for me to handle tonight I'll let you visit the circle of lust. You can make your every lewd desire a reality with no consequences. No act too perverse and an unlimited supply of demons ready to join in at your beck and call.\" Chad's eyes widened at the mere thought of such a reward. Lily raised her finger. \"But. If I can handle everything you've got and still ask for more, you're coming with me to the circle of lust to be my boytoy for a month. It'll be mostly the same, only I will be in charge of what happens to you.\" Her long slim tail cracked like a whip. He'd never felt this aroused in his life. She held out her hand, waiting for his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" He said proudly, shaking her hand. Lily smirked, whispering under her breath. \"Like stealing candy from a baby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, you want to start by ordering some food, maybe cozy up a little? Or shall we get straight to action?\" Chad offers. The succubus ponders her options for a moment.</span></div></div>",

She held down his arms and straddled his waist, staring into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You invite a demoness from the plane of Lust and you start off by asking stupid questions like that? Little man, you've got lots to learn. But I'm sure I can teach you a thing or two over the next month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>fuck</i> yes.\" Chad gasped as he felt her loins warm up. His own responded in kind. Lily got off of him and both of them rushed to shed all their clothes. He was nearly done when she'd finished, barreling back into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this.\" He said boastfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? With that?\" Lilith snapped back, rubbing his still only semi-erect shaft. The succubus' touch surged through him and with incredible speed it pumped itself to full mast and then some. Chad didn't know it was possible to get this hard. His thoughts became single-minded. All he wanted was to fuck her brains out, and judging by the look in her eyes she was eager to receive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon rose up, hovering her drooling pussy over his groin and plunging his manhood inside with ease. It was impossible to describe. Spacious enough to handle him with ease yet somehow also tight enough to maximize his pleasure. He grabbed the mattress and bucked, Lily giggling as she was bounced up and down. Her lithe figure made it easy. She was practically weightless to him. She barely had to do a thing as the sex-crazed man went berserk. This must've been one of the easiest seductions in her life, and she'd had some real chumps before. As a small surprise, he actually wasn't half-bad either. A bit desperate, but no less entertaining. She quietly wondered how many rounds of this he could provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad's mind was hazed. Normally he'd demand to be on top, but right now the sheer pleasure coursing through his body made it impossible to do anything other than fucking her harder. He'd show her just why he resorted to inviting a literal sex demon to keep up with what he had. By the sounds of her lewd moans he was doing well. Good to know he met hell's standards at least. Now he'd set a whole new bar for them. When he gets done with her, Lily won't be able to find satisfaction anywhere else. And when he's given free reign in her home he would show off a hedonistic streak that would etch him into every demon's mind. His boundless bravado came to a head as he cried out in a powerful climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily felt him spurt inside of her, a potent stream for a human. But with her seductive prowess driving him wild she wondered how many more of those he could muster. For now she just cheerfully showed off her next trick. As his dick went soft her inner walls took hold of it. The weird pulling and rubbing sensation drew a curious glare from the man, but it felt far too good for him to protest. By the time she released his manhood it was completely clean. Her inner workings had absorbed every last drop he gave her. His energy was potent, a delicacy to her senses. And below her was a sweating, panting man ready to give her more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for Chad to stir back into action. His body seemed to have forgotten the previous romp and he eagerly starting bucking again. Lily gave him an amused smile. She barely had to lift a finger for this chump to empty himself inside of her. Most of her victims at least had an inkling of an idea that what she was doing would probably be bad for them. Draining their energy as they shot it all into her pussy. Or whatever other hole they preferred, she didn't discriminate. She was so wrapped up in her daydreaming she barely noticed her date erupting inside of her a second time. Only when the rush of his absorbed power hit her did she let out a lewd moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour she coaxed four more orgasms out of him, milking his manhood for every drop it could muster and sapping away at his life. It wouldn't be much longer now. She smiled from ear to ear as she felt his humping grow erratic. All that boastful arrogance and he couldn't even last two hours. Some part of her quietly hoped he'd have a second wind kicking in to provide her a little more fun up here, but really she couldn't wait to get this formality over with. Once he'd be in the plane of Lust with her the show would begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not quitting on me, are you?\" She teased, urging the man to keep up the pace. Chad tried to maintain the rhythm, but he struggled. Her pussy was starting to squeeze and massage his wilting shaft more fiercely, working to keep it erect. A weak little spurt was all that could be milked from the moment, Lily frowning on the paltry offering. But her grimace soon turned to one of malicious glee as she saw his eyes rolling back into their sockets. He let out a last gasp before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe, like stealing candy from a baby. And eager, loud, arrogant baby.\" She mused, leaning down to lay her body on top of his. The touch of her smooth skin and supple tits did nothing to stir the man back awake. How could he, after 'donating' so much of his stamina to her? She planted a kiss on his lips, returning some of what she'd taken to Chad. Wearily he woke up, staring right into her yellow, demonic eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whahappened?\" He stammered, before the pieces in his mind started to fall together. He'd passed out. He gave this bitch his everything until he passed out. And that smile didn't bode well. But instead of sorrow he felt outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You cheated. You used your demon magics to make me pass out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily looked shocked, but this was far from the first time she'd heard that excuse. \"I had no need for magics. You gave me your all and I took it with ease. Honestly, the way you were mouthing off about your capabilities I expected more. But don't worry, you'll have plenty of time to improve as my little boytoy in hell. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" He stammered. \"You were serious?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I was, dumbass. Don't get cute with me now or the first lesson will involve me growing a dick so large I can skewer you on it.\" Lily laughed maniacally at the thought alone as she walked back to the standing mirror, touching it to open up a portal back home. Chad stumbled behind her, pulling his boxers back up. She shot him a deadly glare and her pointed tail whipped between his legs, rending the boxers into useless cloth scraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you'll be needing any clothes where you're going, bitch-boy. You and I are going to have a lot of fun together.\" She said, stepping through the portal and beckoning for him to follow. Chad was uncertain about everything right now. Did any of this really happen or was it all some elaborate dream? He thought about shattering the mirror to break the portal, but before he could act Lily had gotten impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I haven't got all day, get in here!\" She yelled. Chad shrieked in fear as her tail re-entered his room. But this time it was gigantic. The sleek, dark purple mass curled and coiled like it had a mind of its own. The signature little demonic spade on the end was as big as his whole body. Before he could turn and run it wrapped itself around him, squeezing his midsection firmly as it yanked him off his feet and through the mirror. It unfurled just as fast and shrank back down to its normal size, leaving Chad dazed and confused. Lily is standing before him with a broad grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the plane of Lust. Don't mind the smell.\" She teases, stretching her arms to show off the endless cityscape stretching before her. Chad could scarcely believe his eyes. A jumbled mess of buildings and strangely organic structures, each seemingly throbbing and bursting with unearthly pleasures. There was nowhere he could look that wasn't covered in some level of profound obscenity. Every river and canal in the city seemed to run with milky white waters, no doubt a vile amalgam of sexual fluids. Each moment he saw some new aberation or depraved act of sex and slowly it began to sink in that Lily had plans to do all of this and more to him. Most cruelly though, the sheer presence of this demonic hellscape was enough to unwillingly put his manhood at full mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... Mercy...\" He pleads weakly. Lily just laughs in his face, not dignifying his groveling with an answer. She simply guides the whimpering man to a nearby building and entered. It looked fairly standard, but once they enter the upstairs bedroom Chad's breath caught in his throat. The walls of the room are littered top to bottom with racks and racks of toys. Small, large, smooth, spiked. Some of them look more like torture implements than sex toys, but there are no doubt demons down here that'd get off with them. In the middle of it all is a large bed. It looks clean, but under a blacklight it would glow like the sun. Lily pushes her date onto the bed, standing before the cowering man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you've had your fun, it's time for me to have mine.\"</span></div></div>",

Us succubi have a pretty good sense for what turns someone on and your mind provided me so much to peruse. Seems like you've got some... interesting kinks in there.

I'm gonna be the last figure around here to judge someone for their... preferences. To the contrary, it seems we've got quite a few in common...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled from ear to ear, a vicious toothy grin that sent a shiver down Chad's spine. The horny demon stood back and hunched over, grunting and groaning. Suddenly a loud squelch echoed from her as her back sprouted an inky black tendril. It glistened with oily slime as it coiled and whipped around in the air. Soon more followed, Lily gasping and moaning as she felt the appendages erupt from her back. It was a feeling no human would ever be able to relate to, but she felt thoroughly turned on by it. By the time she regained her composure a dozen tentacles writhed and hovered above her. One of them dragged itself along the man's cheek, leaving a thin film of black goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to escape the tentacles in your fantasies. Are you ready to experience the real thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P... Please...\" He stammered, his voice shaking with fear... and something else. The swirling mass of tendrils was scary and arousing in equal parts. He wanted to blame the succubus' foul nature or being in the plane of Lust for his slowly building erection, but there was no escaping the truth. All those amazing hentai scenarios with a girl wrapped up and fucked senseless by tentacles. He was about to receive it first-hand. He never thought it'd be possible. Or that he'd be assuming the role of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attaboy.\" Lily cooed, seeing Chad's manhood twitch. She gave him one last cruel grin before getting to work.</span></div></div>",

The tentacle began to change a little, the pointed tip thickening, becoming stubby and round. When a small slit appeared it became clear to him. She'd turned the tentacle into a fleshy dildo, possibly just an incredibly long dick. It was hard to tell where the limits were in this place and its denizens, or if there were any limits at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I think this will go up the backdoor quite nicely.\" Lily cooed smugly, making the terrified man shake his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? Why not?\" She spoke like a predator toying with its prey. Suddenly a devilish glint shone in her eyes. \"Of course, you're right.\" She said, putting her thumb in her mouth. She blew her thumb hard and Chad's eyes nearly bulged out of his skull as he saw the cock-shaped tentacle double in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it, thanks for spotting it.\" Lily crowed, swaying the tentacle back and lowering it between the man's legs. If it would've been hard to take before, she'd made it close to impossible now. But that wasn't about to stop his horny tormentor. The demon leaned in, the slimy tip of the cock-shaped tentacle pressing against his ass. Her aim was true, but it would take more than precision to fit a shaft this wide into a pucker that clenched. With a guttural growl she provided the strength needed, plunging the oversized member deep into Chad's ass. He winced and whimpered as much as the tentacle probing his throat would permit, his pathetic struggles a source of great amusement for Lily. Several other tentacles wrapped themselves around his body and limbs, more for show than because of any practical need. With what little thought wasn't occupied by the pain and discomfort Chad realized his manhood responded by firming up to full mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See. Down here we all have a good time.\" Lily taunted, seeing his erection. </span></div></div>",

She withdrew the slimy appendage from his throat, letting him gasp for air. She giggled and wrapped the tentacle around his neck. There was no need to squeeze it now, but perhaps it could be fun later. She's fairly sure there was a bit of breathplay in that long list of interests of his. As she pondered she noticed Chad wearily looking over to her, his vacant stare pointed straight at her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Something caught your eye?\" She says, swaying her hips. He nods weakly. Or shivers in disgust. Lily didn't really care which. She turned away from him to give Chad a generous look at her ass. She shimmied closer until the smooth, purple skin nearly touched his face. The moment it did his manhood twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, you like that, don't you? Well, I'm going to be the last demon down here to deprive you of a closer look.\" She added smugly. The succubus clambered on top of her date and let her ass hover over his face. Chad was a little concerned she'd take a seat right away. He'd barely had time to catch his breath and recover from her last attack. His throat still ached from the tentacle's forceful entry. Lily sees his fearful look and smirks, waving her butt from side to side. If he thought it was breathtaking already, she had a surprise in store for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus blows on her thumb again, but this time it was her ass that got larger. The jiggly masses doubled in size, making Chad gasp in horror. She let him stew in his fears for a moment before slamming her ass down on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, you've got a face made for sitting on.\" She coos, rubbing her rear back and forth and getting comfortable on top of Chad. He squirmed and flailed, her tentacles restraining any effort to escape or push her away. She wasn't all that heavy, even with her expanded backside, but she more than made up for it in strength. And giving the cock-shaped tentacle lodged in his rear a small twist proved an excellent way to subdue any further attempts to free himself. There would be only one way out of this: Complete obedience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, settle down. If you want some of that precious air you'll have to earn it. Start licking, Chad.\" She commanded, barely hiding her excitement. It felt great to wedge his head between her cheeks. Hopefully he had been broken in enough to follow orders. Then again, if he was resistant she could show him all the horrid ways her butt could dispense punishment. Maybe she'd punish him either way. What was he gonna do about it?</span></div></div>",

He only graduated high school a year ago, but instead of all of those sheep who went off to college to get suffocated in debt, he had built a huge internet following with his Deadman\u2019s Debunked brand; what was once an urban exploration Youtube channel, where he and his high school friends stupidly and dangerously did urban explorations in dilapidated and crumbling \u2018haunted\u2019 hospitals, prisons and the like, had turned into a paranormal debunking channel after he unmasked a local ghoul to be a disgruntle school janitor. With the catapulting popularity of his channel he capitalized on it by shifting his content more towards paranormal debunking, whether he was traveling with friends to haunted and paranormal locations, or debunking paranormal tv shows from the safety of his \u2018studio\u2019 (aka, apartment bedroom). Still, the ad revenue he was generating was quite impressive for someone for his age and he couldn\u2019t complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis week started like any other, he was hunched over his desk, looking through his notebook filled with video ideas, from making fun of witches and wiccans, to debunking SCP and cryptid sightings. Carl ended up scrolling through some paranormal internet forums until he came across a chat-thread entitled \u201cNew \u2018Monstr\u2019 dating app hits mainstream platforms, says you can date real monsters! Bogus or Real?\u201d. Carl scrolled through the thread that almost unanimously said it was stupid, with a few users egging others on to download the app and try to get laid with a harpy. This new app would be easy pickings for Carl. He\u2019d get a great series of videos out of him dating the various \u2018monsters\u2019 on the app. At best they were just normal people and at worst adamant, socially awkward cosplayers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl quickly downloaded the app and started writing some scripts for his new videos based on the app. Once Carl opened the app for the first time he noticed a screen that asked him to distinguish himself as a human or monster. He filled out all of the appropriate personality traits, physical descriptions and interests before looking for a match. Soon the app created his profile and brought up a list of female monsters in his area looking for a guy like him. These profile pictures for these monster chicks were fairly convincing\u2026 then again, photoshop can do wonders. There were a few that caught his eye quite a bit. There was Palisades, a western dragoness with turquoise scales, a fit physical physique and a similar interest in video games. There was Mandy, a kitsune woman deeply into spirituality who works as a local healer and nurse. And there was Katrina, a vampiress, who loves horror movies and humans who aren\u2019t afraid to share a coffin with her. There were still a few more pages worth of monster matches, but will Carl continue to look for a supernatural date or pick one of these lovely ladies?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>/Some time between the moment Chad 'right swiped' Mandy and the time of their first meeting/</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garden behind a high wooden fence, situated behind a little house in the suburbs, looked like something that, if a script writer were writing a scene that called for a \"small, peaceful, Japanese garden,\" would be the kind of place used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small brook running through the backyard with a wooden bridge crossing it. The shrubs were carefully sculpted, and the small trees lovingly tended to and shaped. There were golden koi in a pond that who looked up at any passerby, hoping for a treat between their regular feedings. Even the colors of the transplanted local wildflowers blended into the traditional garden, adding to the serenity of the setting. Though the house that backed up the garden was built along traditional western lines, the back of the house looked like a traditional Japanese one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the garden two red foxes, both about two feet long (not counting the length of their tails), were carefully circling around, watching the other carefully. There was a seriousness in their gazes, but there was a hint of mischief about the pair as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the foxes made a feint to draw the other one out. The other fox fell for it, then tried to draw back in, but it was too late. Suddenly there was a tumble of foxes, with one fox ending up on top of the other, with the other fox on its back. The fox on top took a little nip at the neck of the fox who was on its back, licked the other fox's nose, then scrambled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of light, and suddenly the two foxes were replaced by two very beautiful women. One of the women was East Asian, wearing an outfit that was tradition in the middle of nineteenth century Japan. Her face was freshly scrubbed, her long hair was loose and hung down to her waist. The woman was laughing, and it was delightful, musical sound to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman was a fair skinned redhead who looked Northern European, and was wearing tight, ragged jeans and a shirt that showed off her flat stomach. The shirt bore the message \"Don't make this ginger snap.\" Like the East Asian, she was also laughing, though there was a rueful note to her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their obvious differences, both women had a lot in common. They were both young, beautiful, and had trim bodies with firm, very large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were also both about two feet tall, and had fox ears instead of human ones. Both were also sporting bushy fox tails. The redhead's ears and tail wear a brighter red, while the East Asian woman's ears and tail wear a duller road,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, cousin,\" the redhead said, embracing the other woman. As the two broke the embrace, the redhead added, \"Though I could have done without the lick on the face,\" the redhead added, wiping her nose the fingers of her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just showing that I didn't mean anything personally,\" the East Asian woman answered, still laughing. \"You're still the better fighter. I just got lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of getting lucky, Manami, are you ready for your date tonight?\" the redhead asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of consternation appeared on the East Asian woman's face. \"I don't know if I should go through with this, Sorcha. This is something someone like you should do. You're a yako, after all. I'm a zenko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good person who needs to get out more,\" Sorcha answered. \"All you do is travel between that clinic of yours and home. And the occasional run through the fields with me. If you're going to interact with humans, you need to interact with them.\" Sorcha said the last part with a suggestive waggle of her eyebrows. This brought a pretty blush to Manami's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I interact with plenty of humans at the clinic,\" Manami answered. Which was true. The clinic Manami worked at (where she was known as 'Mandy,' an Anglicized version of her name) was holistic in nature, and employed both humans and an array of monsters(though the 'monsters' at the clinic were monsters in name only, with all of them being benign and dedicated to healing).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't interact interact with humans,\" Sorcha insisted, which was true. Manami had been asked on dates more than once while at the clinic, but always begged off. She insisted that it was because she didn't want relationships outside the clinic to interfere with her work at the clinic. Which was true. But Sorcha also recognized Manami's fear. The other woman wanted to remain in the comfortable shell her life had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Sorcha got Manami to put up a profile on the Monstr App. She even had Manami put the profile under her nickname Mandy, to make her seem more approachable. The picture on the profile was one where Manami/Mandy looked completely human, while her profile info downplayed the fact that Mandy was a kitsune, focusing on her spiritual qualities and the fact that she was a healer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorcha thought that was the best way to keep the furries at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of interacting,\" Sorcha said, looking at the clock, \"It's probably time to start getting ready for your date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy took a deep breath and nodded. In a flash, both women were five foot seven inches tall. Both their tails had disappeared. Sorcha now had human ears, but Mandy's fox ears were sticking out through her hair. Sorcha cleared her throat and pointed at the ears. Mandy reached up, felt them, and giggled. \"Sorry, Nervous about this date, I guess.\" The fox ears disappeared, replaced by human ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what kind of outfit should we put you in for your date with this Carl?\" Sorcha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorcha, would you like to come along as a chaperone?\" Mandy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorcha replied<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But there were more potential candidates that caught his attention. One of them was Mira, a giant spider. From the pictures on her profile it looked like someone had put their pet tarantula on a number of miniature sets to make it look enormous. Carl chuckled when he imagined how much effort it must've taken for someone to set all those shots up. They looked remarkably convincing too. It seemed almost sad to go for something this easily disproven, but it'd make for a nice quick piece to put on his channel.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of the ladies that Carl had found and chatted with was a vampiress named Katrina. She was supposedly a few centuries old, but she appeared to be in her early twenties with chalk-white skin, short black hair, fiery red eyes and a set of fangs as your typical vampire would have. She was a bit chubby in all the right places, fairly well-endowed, and despite dressing in very dark, gothic clothing her profile stated she had a very bubbly and upbeat personality, enjoying pop music and romantic-comedies. Her profile also states despite some incorrect vampire lore, she isn\u2019t harmed by the sun, and she actually quite enjoys basking in it, summer being her favorite season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s also a very charitable vampire, volunteering for the Red Cross, for no other reason than to get closer to humans and get to know them better. Many staff and other volunteers find it a bit weird she has an almost photographic memory of the human circulatory system and almost sickly pale skin but she just tells them she has a skin condition and they mostly buy it. Unfortunately, before Monstr, Katrina had tried to use her volunteering as a way of hitting on humans, but every time she\u2019d reveal herself to be a vampire they\u2019d either run away or some of the bolder ones would try to kill her. Needless to say, she was elated that there\u2019s now an app she can use to find humans who are more than willing to date a vampire. Katrina was giddy on her trip over to Carl\u2019s apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly got out of her cab as she made her way towards the door of his apartment. She knocked on the door, grinning ear-to-ear, showing off her fangs. She was dressed in fish-net stockings, a black bikini bottom  and t-shirt to match, with blood-red lipstick. Soon enough, Carl answered the door, \u201cHey, you must be Katrina.\u201d The vampire nodded, \u201cYep, that\u2019s me. I\u2019m so happy to meet you. I don\u2019t get to date a lot of humans who are interested in vampires. Most are afraid of me.\u201d Carl chuckled, \u201cWell come right in.\u201d He gestured for Katrina to come in, as she stepped in she noticed Carl\u2019s video set-up with a desk, green screen, lighting and an expensive camera. She eyed it up with amusement, \u201cW-what\u2019s this? Do you make Youtube videos?\u201d Carl chuckled and rubbed the back of his neck, \u201cY-yeah, I do. That\u2019s actually why I asked you to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina stared back with a look of confusion, \u201cW-what? I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m camera shy. I wouldn\u2019t even show up, being a vampire, I don\u2019t show up in photos or videos sadly.\u201d Carl retorted, \u201cBut you\u2019re not a vampire.\u201d Katrina\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cW-what!? Of course I am. It said my species in my profile and everything.\u201d A sour lump of worry dropped into Katrina\u2019s stomach, was this some kind of misunderstanding? Carl continued as he pulled out a wet wash-cloth, \u201cI\u2019ve gotta hand it to you, you did a really convincing job with your costume, but this site isn\u2019t real. It\u2019s a fraud, you can\u2019t date monsters cause monsters aren\u2019t real. I mean\u2026 heh-heh, maybe a nine year old would think this is real, but anyone who\u2019s potty trained could tell this is at best a site for cosplayers, and at worst some kind of credit card front.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina wasn\u2019t exactly sure what all of this meant, but she knew that Carl didn\u2019t seem to actually want to date her, \u201cW-wait so\u2026 you don\u2019t want to go out with me?\u201d Tears weld up in Katrina\u2019s red eyes. Carl didn\u2019t reply and instead took the wash clothes and mashed it against Katrina\u2019s face, trying to wash off her \u2018make-up\u2019, of course\u2026 nothing came off, she was as bone-white as ever. Carl grunted, \u201cWhy won\u2019t it come off?\u201d Katrina snarled, \u201cCause I\u2019m really a vampire you moron!\u201d Carl replied, \u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d Having been fed up, Katrina grabbed his arm and sunk her teeth into it. Carl yelped, more in surprise than fear. Katrina gulped down some blood before letting him go, Carl stumbled back, clutching his arm as Katrina licked her lips, \u201cMmm, you\u2019re Type A-, that\u2019s my favorite flavor!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl fearfully backed up, \u201cG-get away from me.\u201d Katrina smirked, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not done with you.\u201d As the human tried to back away, Katrina pounced on him, opening her mouth up nice and wide. Carl\u2019s world grew dark as he passed out from fright. What felt like hours later Carl awoke, only this time he was in complete darkness, her could hear wet squelching all around him, and it was hot, humid, wet and cramped. The human tried his best to move but he was curled up in a ball with fleshy walls all around him. The air in here was also humid a smelt/tasted disgusting, he gagged. Fearing for his life, Carl whimpered, \u201cW-where am I?\u201d He was answered by a thunderous belch and his prison shaking, \u201cBBBBBWWWWWWOOOOORRRRPPPPP!\u201d Katrina laid back on Carl\u2019s desk chair, sitting at his computer desk with his Youtube channel on-screen. Her belly was bloated into a bulbous dome with her date wiggling inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina giggled as her stomach came to life, she teasingly poked her big belly, \u201cHey there. You\u2019re awake. Enjoy you\u2019re nap?\u201d Carl asked with fear in his voice, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d Katrina ripped another unlady-like belch, \u201cAh, I love the taste of humans. You\u2019re in my belly silly.\u201d Carl freaked out, struggling in her fetid stomach, \u201cYOU ATE ME!?\u201d Katrina giggled, grabbing her belly and sloshing it about, \u201cWell, humans are a vampires favorite. I don\u2019t know what to tell ya\u2019. I was hungry, so I had dinner.\u201d Frustrated and filled with horror, Carl replied, \u201cYOU ATE ME CAUSE I DIDN\u2019T THINK YOU WERE A VAMPIRE?\u201d The vampiress rolled her eyes, \u201cWell, not exactly. More that you set me up to embarrass me, or expose me. I\u2019m fine with dating humans who don\u2019t know I\u2019m a vampire right away, I have problems with humans who think I\u2019m a joke and want to take advantage of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina snarled, giving her belly a slap, letting it slosh about like a waterbed. She scrolled through his videos as a grin grew on her lips, \u201cYa\u2019 know, you\u2019re quite the photogenic guy Carl, you\u2019ve got a real good eye for cinematography and shot composition and color, plus you look cute\u2026 it\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t use that talent for more\u2026 noble pursuits. I can\u2019t imagine making debunk videos is something you wanna do at 80, what with you humans and your pathetically short lifespans.\u201d Carl just punched and kicked and wiggled in her belly, \u201cAre you going to let me out now?\u201d Katrina chuckled, standing back up, watching her gut slosh about, \u201cHah! Nope! Unless you\u2019re sorry\u2026 and I mean genuinely sorry, I think some well deserved punishment is in order.\u201d Carl struggles some more in her belly, \u201cY-you can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m a human being.\u201d Katrina rolled her eyes and put her hands on her wide hips, \u201cUh-huh, and I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Katrina lounges in his place for a little while longer, rummaging through his Youtube channel and actively making fun of his videos with Carl as a captive audience. Eventually, Carl starts to soften, realizing his mistake and apologizes, asking Katrina if they could forget about all of this and continue with a real date this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: If Carl likes debunking monsters so much she\u2019ll give him one hell of a case to debunk. With Carl still trapped in her belly, Katrina returns to the monster world and decides to still have their \u2018date\u2019 but educate Carl on monsters and the monster world. Perhaps he\u2019ll have a better respect and appreciate for monster-kind after spending some time in their world\u2026 and possibly in some of their stomachs. If Carl has a change of heart, maybe this date wasn\u2019t such a waste after all\u2026 but if he remains stubborn she could always just burp him back up in his apartment after some \u2018fun\u2019 and shenanigans and look for a kinder, more understanding human boyfriend.</span></div></div>",

Someone had gone through a lot of effort with this and it was a prime opportunity to debunk something for views.

'She' spoke like many other girls, albeit with occasional grisly details like talking about devouring a deer in the forest. After a few days a date was agreed upon. For obvious reasons she didn't want to show herself near any human spots. People were afraid enough of spiders as is, one of her size would cause a panic. Carl chuckled and played along, agreeing to meet her near her home in the forest. Not a word was mentioned about him making a video about this date, as he didn't want her to get cold feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe packed his recording equipment, already having a plan of action for this. Going by the photos on the profile, this beast would have to be the size of an elephant. There was no real way of recreating that with animatronics or an elaborate suit outside of involving a whole movie studio. So their tactic was probably to scare him so badly that he would turn tail and run before he'd get a chance to reveal that it was all fake. He'd been there before and it made for some of his most-watched videos. Staring down the horror and pointing a camera at it for a few seconds would often have the illusion come crashing down, followed by some folks either scurrying off or getting belligerent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of his head one scary thought did crop up. What if she was the real deal? Carl wasn't afraid of spiders, but one that big would definitely give him pause for thought. Nah. It was biologically impossible for a spider to be that big. He couldn't remember exactly why, but he's certain he watched videos about why bugs aren't bigger these days. Despite all that there was a noticeable pang of dread in his gut as he drove to the forest. What if he really had stumbled upon the genuine article? He laughs it off, parking at the forest's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a camera in one hand and his phone showing directions in the other Carl sets off. The coordinates she had given him guided him along a narrow trail only a few hundred meters into the forest. Dusk was already setting in and the trees around him seemed to get spookier by the minute. He shook his head, trying to stay focused on his recording. Any moment now there'd probably be an elaborate jumpscare and shortly thereafter Youtube gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dim light ahead and the forest cleared. Carl was as ready as he'd ever be. Several trees were covered in large webs, the strands glistening in the fading light. Smaller branches had been partially snapped to further give the impression that something huge had done this. It was a very impressive effort he had to admit. But the one thing yet unseen was Mira herself. Were they hoping this scene alone was enough to send him running? They'd have to do better than a well-dressed stage to scare him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A lot of work had gone into making this little glade look like the home of a giant spider, but what stood out most to Carl were the webs draped all over the trees. They shimmered and glistened just like oversized spider string would. He struggled to imagine how the people behind this trick managed to get them all the way on top of these trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm here, but so far not a giant spider in sight. But if you look closely, you'll see that these webs are just made of clear rubber or some other plastic. They look super real, but that ain't gonna fool me.\" He spoke to himself, commenting for his video. He walked up to the most central tree, eager to demonstrate his cleverness. He grabbed one of the thick threads of webbing and raised an eyebrow. \"They've even covered the lower webs in some sort of slime to simulate the stickiness. I'm impressed.\" He chuckled haughtily. He'd seen through this illusion with ease. But when he tried to pull his hand free the webbing barely yielded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Glue?\" Carl's voice gained a tinge of panic as he tried to maintain his composure for the video. Right now it felt like a prank gone wrong. He tried to let go of the sticky strand, but his hand was stuck. Thinking fast, the man puts his camera down and grabs his pocketknife to cut himself free. But the webbing proved immensely tough. The blade struggled to cut through it and Carl was getting visibly upset. He'd probably have to go to a hospital to get this shit removed from his hand. If he ever found out who was behind this sick joke he'd have some very pointed words for them. He grumbled, cutting through the strand on the other side of his hand. He was nearly free when he slipped, the knife flying from his hand and his arms getting caught in several more strands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" He cursed, trying to free himself. But at this stage he was hopelessly trapped. His camera was still on the floor, pointing up and recording. \"Well, whatever sick bastard came up with this had better come on out before I take this to the fucking police!\" Carl shouted into the trees, his temper fractured. His blood ran cold when he heard an ominous hiss in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned his head as best he could, restrained in the sticky webs. From the corner of his eye he could see something large moving. Heavy taps on the floor came closer. The fading light of dusk made it hard to see but the long, chitinous limb approaching him was clear as day. Carl fought hard not to panic, holding on to his beliefs that this was all some elaborate trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like 'Mira' is finally here. Maybe 'she' can help me get out of this crap.\" He joked. But the limb did actually seem able to cut through the thick strands with ease whilst not getting caught on them. One arm was freed, but instead of releasing the other she pushed her date around, shoving his back into the webs, flipping him over so he could see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's heart skipped a beat as he looked straight into the eight unmoving eyes of a gigantic spider. Her huge body covered in a rigid brown carapace. Elaborate markings covered most of her. Some might have even been drawn on as her version of make up. Her jaws moved intricately, large fangs gleaming right in front of him whilst all the other twitchy little parts dripped with some sort of saliva. Every detail was there. From the tiny scratches and scuffs on her exoskeleton to the strange bobbing and moving of her body. More and more the thought began to intrude that this might not be a trick. Maybe, against all odds, he really was looking at a spider the size of a bus. And he was caught in this monster's web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well... You must be my date. Carl, isn't it? Do you call all your potential girlfriends 'elaborate tricks' before you've even introduced yourself, or was I just lucky?\" She spoke bitterly. Carl's eyes nearly bulged out of his skull as he struggled to grasp that this huge spider just talked to him. Worse yet, she didn't seem very pleased with his commentary so far.</span></div></div>",

'Ooooh, she's a giant spider, she must be fake.' Meanwhile every pair of tits on that damn app gets ten times the attention, no matter how little sense it makes.\" Mira grumbled loudly, saliva splattering in Carl's face. With the hesitation in his voice hidden as best he could, the trapped man finally stammers out a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you better be sorry. You know what happens to humans that get lost in the woods and never seen again? <i>I</i> happen to them and right now I'm tempted to let you experience firsthand what happens next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Please don't eat me...\" Carl blubbered, trying not to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing what might be a pang of guilt in the sad looking man Mira leans back. She takes a deep breath before swaying forward, her face closer to him than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's try this one more time. I want you to be completely honest with me. Now that you know I'm really a giant spider and not some prank gone wrong... Would you still go on this date? Or did you only text all those sweet things to me to get a video out of it? You're probably in over your head at this point, so I'll begrudgingly understand if you're scared off by all this. I'll be sad about it, but I'll take you to the forest's edge if you'd rather go home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze was unflinching, but somehow Carl could see the disappointment in her eyes. Was he really the only one that had reacted to her? All this time he thought he was chatting with some pranksters. He remembered some of those messages. And now the girl he'd sent them too had to learn now that he wasn't serious about them... In spite of being trapped in her web, he couldn't help but feel sorry for the giant spider. She made her existence in these woods sound really lonely. And he'd gone and made her feel even more undesirable, writing her off as a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit though that she was completely right about one thing. He was in over his head in ways he couldn't imagine. Faced with the thought of actually having to go on a date with a spider the size of a bus and the risk of being eaten very real and present. He wanted to lie to her and say he was okay with it, mostly out of guilt. But honestly, her offer of letting him walk out seemed tempting too. She wanted him to be honest with her, but he didn't want to risk hurting her feelings even more. Should he put up with this date just to save his skin? His inner conflict boiled over until Mira finally interrupted his train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... what will it be? Are you willing to give this date a chance or is it better for us to part ways?\"</span></div></div>",

He spoke as clearly as his fear let him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm fully honest, you're right. This went to places I couldn't have imagined and I never thought I'd be facing a real spider of your impressive size. I'm struggling to imagine what a date between us would look like. What can I even offer you romantically? So I don't think it'd be fair to you for me to keep pretending like a date is a good idea. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.\" He let out a weary sigh afterwards, feeling a burden slide off his shoulders. Now he could only hope Mira would honor her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed too, lifting a slender leg and swiping it towards the trapped man. Carl let out a panicked yelp before realizing he was unharmed and the webs binding him were cut loose. Some of the sticky silk still clung to him, but at least he could move again. The giant spider turned around and pointed at a narrow trail amidst the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go. That path will lead us back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl didn't need to be told twice and with a brisk pace they set off. His nerves were still tingling, the man trying to keep his composure as her heavy footsteps thundered around him. Even eight legs did little to mitigate the weight of her step. After a little while he slows down and turns to her. Hesitantly he asks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was I really the only one to contact you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Mira snaps back, pausing before she elaborated. \"We aren't exactly sought after by monsters outside of our own species. And humans tend not to want to hang out with even tiny spiders, so ones that could eat them like snacks probably aren't the most desirable either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man felt even more ashamed. He'd really gotten her hopes up only to reveal that he thought this all to be an elaborate prank. When the forest began to thin out and the edge approached he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing?\" Mira asked curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you to be lonely tonight because of me. A date might be a bit much, but would you be willing to just... hang out for a bit? Maybe get something to drink?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If the giant spider had eyebrows they'd be raised by now. She still wasn't fond of the little man that had tricked her, but he seemed genuinely regretful of what he'd done. Not many humans would even contemplate an offer like this, especially to someone like her. It tickled her curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very kind. Alright, little morsel. But I think it's better I pick a place to get these drinks. I don't think many human bars are gonna serve me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, only because you'd be able to down their whole supply and only feel a little buzzed.\" Carl jokes back. She chitters in a way he'd not heard before. Was that a laugh? The giant spider calmed down and with a cheery voice she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna put you on my back though, otherwise it'll take forever to reach this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl tried to remain calm as two long limbs extended towards him, taking hold of his torso and lifting him off his feet. The idea that a spider of all creatures had this kind of strength over him was terrifying. But he made a promise and Carl Hessen is a man of his word. He was set down on top of her large abdomen. It was covered in thick spine-like hairs, which he grabbed hold of. Mira set off into the woods towards her destination. He could scarcely believe how fast this monster could run. The trees seemed practically non-existent in her path as she effortlessly scurried over and around them. Before long an exceptionally large tree began to poke out from the forest's canopy. He was surprised to never have seen it before. But by now he was also deep into the forest. When he looked around he realized that there wasn't even the most distant glimmer of light of any city to be seen. There was a strange beauty to just how far removed from civilization he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira arrived at the base of the tree, revealing that it was a large gathering spot for all manner of mystical forest creatures. A few of them gave her a polite wave. Carl was awestruck, timidly waving back. Before today he'd thought oversized animals like Mira were a trick, but now he was surrounded by them. Mice the size of horses, a deer as tall as a house. Several fox spirits lounging in a corner busily chatting with eachother. Numerous half-animals like centaurs, harpies, nymphs and more everywhere. Surrounding the base of the tree was a bar, staffed by satyrs. It looked grown out of thick vines, topped with flat river stones for a fitting natural aesthetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The usual?\" One of the bartenders asked the giant spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it a double. And a tiny one for my friend.\" She pointed a long limb up at the human on her back before picking him up and setting him down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satyr leaned over the counter to the little man. Though the bar was small for someone the size of Mira, it still stood too tall for the human to even look over the counter. The bartender spoke an eldritch command and gave him a smile. Suddenly vines sprung from the ground, forming a seat beneath Carl and lifting him up. It shaped into a bar stool, even adding steps for an easy way down later. The man was impressed, giving a thankful nod. The bartender responded by putting a mug of ale in front of him. A large minotaur bartender came around to put a large vat of beer down for Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers.\" Carl said, raising his drink. Mira responded in kind before downing the entirety of the vat in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer second vat was already on the way as the man tried his own brew. It tasted very sweet, distinct notes of honey and fruit tickling his palate. He saw the bartender nod knowingly at him, the joy in his face clear to read. He turned his attention back to the giant spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't know spiders were so fond of beer.\" He joked. He'd not even gotten halfway through his drink before Mira had downed the second vat, ordering another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, there's a lot you humans don't know about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chat back and forth about their lives. Mira has a few hearty laughs as he explains his occupation. Listening to the stories of fake monsters being uncovered and how clumsy some of these illusions were. In return she regaled Carl with all the times she'd subtly guided lost wanderers back to civilization. She also guided many into her belly, but she left that part out. After some time and more beer the two finally felt done at the bar. </span></div></div>",

After what he put her through, this was the last thing he'd expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For keeping me company. I'm no stranger to heartbreak, but there aren't many humans out there that would do what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't mention it.\" Carl blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cards on the table, I really thought about eating you back there. That tasty little body of yours in my jaws...\" She salivated a little at the idea, oblivious to the now very nervous looking man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was desperate to spin this story away from her eating him before she got any ideas. \"I think you've had quite enough to drink. Maybe we should be heading home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmyeah, any more and the hangover will be monstrous.\" Mira said, chittering at her own pun. She paid their tab, Carl's part of the bill barely a fraction of hers. She then leaned in towards the human, her beery breath washing over him. He tried to shuffle away on his seat, but she just got closer until her weird looking spider mouth bumped against his cheek. It was the weirdest kiss Carl had ever experienced. He prayed to whoever would listen that this was just a kiss, especially after her talking about eating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm gonna head out then. I'll see you around, Carl.\" She said, standing up and skittering away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira! Wait!\" Carl shouted after her, but the drunk giant spider didn't hear him. The man gulped. He'd just been left here, with no way back to civilization. Suddenly it felt like all eyes were on him. A lost human, helpless and alone. More than one of the patrons gave him a predatory leer. He dreaded to think how many of these people made a meal out of humans like Mira did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, looks like you're stranded.\" The barkeep mused aloud with a sly grin. He poured Carl a pint and put it down in front of him. \"Here, this one's on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Carl replied, taking the drink and sipping on it. Hopefully Mira would realize what had happened and return. But as the minutes ticked by it became increasingly unlikely. There would be nothing else for it. He was going to have to find his way home and he would need to rely on the strangers around him for help. He was too deep in the woods to ever make it back alone. But which of these spirits and half-animals could be trusted? Some looked as likely to guide him into their belly as they did to guide him back home.</span></div></div>",

A large bear woman licked her chops and gave him a big toothy grin when their eyes met. The man blushed a little. She looked ready to take him with her... in her belly. Probably best to skip her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few tables over a gruff looking centaur chugged down a small keg of ale. He seemed kind of lonely, sighing deeply as his drink emptied. The handful of empty kegs near him getting another member added to their ranks. His whole body was chocolate brown with a few stray spots of white. He looked capable of getting him home, but Carl had heard all kinds of stories about what centaurs got up to in the woods. With so many different versions of them it was hard to tell if he would be a benevolent forest spirit or the brutal molest-all-humans type. It was risky, but at least he didn't look so eager to do strange and possibly awful things to anyone as the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly Carl's attention was caught by a pair of what can best be described as fox ladies. They were human-sized, but their heads looked distinctly vulpine. Narrow, tapered muzzles, a fiery orange fur coat matching the rest of their bodies. Behind each them swished a big, poofy tail. They chittered back and forth, occasionally shooting him a glance and bursting into giggles. When he caught one of them stealing a look she turned her head and winked at him.</span></div></div>",

They looked even prettier up close. Their piercing eyes and pointed muzzles were strangely cute. Most other days he would've thought sitting opposite literal fox women would be weird, but after what happened with Mira he had to accept that this was really possible. They both wore matching short skirts and a cute little top that provided an unsubtle and generous look at their breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you, Carl. I'm Katja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Suzie.

Also, we only guide souls I'm afraid. You look a bit too much on the living side for us to help you.\" She smirked. He knew she wasn't being completely honest, but he was way too far out of his depth to even begin to guess what part of her words was false.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you could say hi to Matroska over there. She's been looking at you like she'd love to take care of that scrumptious little body of yours.\" They giggled as he shot a glance over his shoulder, only to see they were talking about the bear woman. She blew him a kiss and a big wink. It was unnerving, almost as much as hearing the foxes describing him as 'scrumptious'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you make an exception just this once? Please?\" Carl pleaded, giving the foxes his best impression of puppy eyes. They giggled loudly before Katja let out a long performative sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellllll, I guess we could try to help him, what do you think, Suzie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I suppose we could...\" Her words lifted Carl's mood right away. \"...for a price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Carl's turn to sigh. He should've seen this coming a mile away. Of course the fox ladies would be tricksy, but they still sounded like they were his best bet. Hopefully this wouldn't cost him too much. For now the best path was to play along with them. He looked at them pleadingly and spoke up. \"But I've got nothing to pay you with. My cash is worthless here according to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed for a moment before Suzie explained. \"Silly man, we know you're broke. We weren't talking about money. In order for us to do you this favor, you will have to do us a favor too. And I don't know about you, Katja, but I can think of a few things already.\"</span></div></div>",

Take off your shirt, human.\" Suzie cooed, smiling from ear to ear. Katja nodded fiercely, agreeing with her friend's proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uhm... Won't that get me in trouble with the staff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a bore. Half of them don't wear shirts either, you'll be fine. Now come on. Unless you don't want us to guide you back home of course... Couldn't blame you. Out here you get to chat with two cute foxes.\" Katja replied, giggling as she leaned in for no clear reason other than to give Carl an even better look at her cleavage. He swallowed his doubts and with a small sigh he removed his shirt. Both Katja and Suzie gasped a little, but nobody else in the bar seemed to have much of a reaction. He wonders why these two seem so enamored by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... It's so... smooth.\" Katja reached out and put a dainty hand on Carl's chest, making him giggle a little. The fur on her fingers tickled his skin. She was mostly correct in her observation. Bar some barely visible peach fuzz on his chest his body was devoid of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kat, you can't just feel up the human like that...\" Suzie chided, but her playful smirk belied different intentions. \"...not without offering him something in return.\" She added. taking hold of one of Carl's hands and putting it on her chest. The man blushed brightly as she seemed to invite him to fondle her tits. Not wanting to overstep his bounds, he held the soft-furred breast in his hand, only rubbing it ever so gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should take this someplace a little more... private?\" Carl suggested, but the fox ladies wouldn't hear any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get shy now, Carl. This is nothing compared to what usually goes down here on a busy night. So long as we don't break anything we could fuck on this table, here and now.\" Katja cooed with a seductive voice, making the man's face turn beet red. She made it sound like they were only minutes away from making those words a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany thoughts ran through his head at the same time. First of all, these ladies were being very intimate out of seemingly nowhere. They'd only met five minutes ago. Was there some ulterior motive at play? Carl has been a sceptic all his life and this just rang all kinds of bells in his head. But moreover the thought came to mind that if it really went as far as they suggested, he didn't find himself too opposed to it. He wouldn't dream of doing it in front of all the other patrons and staff in the bar. But Katja and Suzie were very pretty, he couldn't deny that. A threesome with this pair of hotties was just about the last thing he'd expected when setting out into the woods tonight, but it wouldn't be unwelcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I interrupting something?\" Suzie asked, smirking at the man's empty stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he's thinking about us. At least he better well be.\" Katja added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty.\" Carl threw up his hands and smiled, making the pair laugh out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say he's done his part, Suzie. Shall we do ours and take him home as promised?\" Katja offered with a sly grin. \"Orrrr, we could stay here a little longer and get to know eachother more.\"</span></div></div>",

You're both very pretty and I would love to get to know you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja lets out a deep sigh. \"I suppose you're right. I'll go pay our tab. Suzie, can you prepare the guy for the trip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\" The other vixen replies, shooting Carl a lustful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... what do you mean, 'prepare' me?\" He stammered, feeling very uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we go back to the city at your speed it'll take a full day. No offense, but you humans aren't exactly fast. And we can't just put you on our backs either. Not like this at least.\" She mused, an ethereal second voice echoing along with her words. \"Don't worry, I guarantee that you'll love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans in, pushing her muzzle against Carl's cheek and planting a cute little kiss. The faint smell of alcohol on her breath couldn't distract him enough from the eerie tingling he felt radiating out from the site of the kiss. She scoots herself closer and puts a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax. This is going to be a little weird, but I'll make sure you're safe. I wouldn't let anything bad happen so someone as cute as you, little Carl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to give her a bemused look. He wasn't that small, especially compared to them. But Suzie looked a fair bit taller all of a sudden. Carl didn't know what was going on, but he had a bad feeling about this. He looked around and confirmed his fears. He was shrinking. The spirit had put some kind of spell on him and he was rapidly losing height. Mercifully his clothes were shrinking with him. He didn't like the idea of going back home naked. He threw a glance over to his shirt. As expected, that remained unaffected. Suzie grabbed it and folded it up, fitting it in the small satchel hanging on her chair. The man resigned himself to never seeing it back again, sighing a little that he had fallen for something as obvious as this. As he lost more height, Carl began to get increasingly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how small are you making me?\" He asked, a little annoyed by the fox's trickery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small enough to do this.\" She said, reaching down. She put her hand out before the little man. He stood at a tenth of his former height, barely half a foot tall. With a clear sense of trepidation he approached the large furred hand before him. At least she didn't just grab and manhandle him, he thought. Suzie's grip was gentle, he wasn't the first small delicate critter she'd held. She brought him up to eye level and cooed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww, you're so cute. I could just...\" She paused, letting her tongue hang out. Carl had just a moment to grasp what was coming before the wet muscle dragged along his head. Her grip might be gentle, but it also rendered him powerless to react. One lengthy lick later the fox woman blushed brightly. \"I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja returned to the table and joined her friend in squeeing over their tiny companion. The other patrons in the bar barely seemed to raise an eyebrow at the shrinking and the two leaving with their tiny human. The pair bid everyone a cheerful goodbye and left the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on tight now, little man. This is going to be the fun part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl rolled his eyes. \"Fun for me or for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For both of us!\" She cheered, bringing the man to her chest. Carl's thoughts were a little too occupied by fear to take notice before, but at this scale her tits were enormous. He stared dreamily at her cleavage, wondering if he could get lost in that endless valley of softness. Suzie was on the same wavelength, letting the little man's dreams come true. She stuffed Carl feet first between her breasts, holding him in place and wedging him deep enough for only his head to remain visible between the soft-furred globes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl watched the forest race by as these ladies cruised through it with remarkable speed. Mira was probably still a fair bit faster, but Katja and Suzie were incredibly nimble. All the while the movement of the fox carrying him made her breasts jiggle, providing him with a sensual massage as they squeezed his body between their soft, yielding mass. After a while they stopped. There was still no sign of civilization, yet Suzie fished him out of her breasts already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't be fair if I had all the fun.\" She mused, handing him over to Katja. Carl chuckled a little at her remark. She wasn't wrong and how could he say no to another journey like that? The sly fox holding him was thinking much the same, but she hadn't yet decided where to let the little man ride on her body.</span></div></div>",

She gave Carl a good look at all his options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could stuff you in my tits like Suzie did, but I'm thinking you might like the backdoor too.\" She mused, holding him near her butt. It was covered by her skirt, but he could tell it would be every bit as large and soft. To be stuffed in there would probably be a bit overwhelming though. He wanted to tell her as much, but she wasn't done yet. She brought him around to the front of her skirt, suggesting something far more unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you'd like to get really intimate with us. I'm sure you've been wondering what it would feel like at this size. Trust me, it's a real trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl went beet red at the idea of being put in her panties like that. He looked up to the vixens who both carried lewd smiles. Alarms began to ring in the back of his head. These two had him shrunk down and at their mercy in the middle of a forest. He could consider himself lucky if he had any input at all in this. But he wasn't being shoved anywhere just yet. They seemed to be waiting for an answer from the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uhm... I reckon that's a bit much. We met like an hour ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Katja stated flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Kat. I bet he's more of an ass-man anyway. I mean, he did roll in with Mira, she's got the largest butt of all the creatures here.\" They laughed at Suzie's corny remark and Carl realized that perhaps he should be a bit more forward in this before the foxes would make all the decisions for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's okay with you, I'd love to be a little closer to that cute face of yours, held by those soft breasts. I bet they're just as comfy as Suzie's.\" He said, feeling a little awkward to make suggestions like that to someone he only just got to know. Katja gave him a sly grin in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where you're wrong, little man. My tits are way more comfy than hers.\" She snickered as she raised him up to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if.\" Suzie snapped back, smiling from ear to ear. Some scheme was brewing in there, but Carl paid it no mind. He was far too occupied with Katja stuffing him in her cleavage. Much like with Suzie he went in feet first so he wouldn't need to worry about air. But in her efforts to one-up her friend, Katja pushed him in even deeper, his face barely sticking out from between the soft mounds. There was just enough of a gap to let him breathe, but his whole vision was dominated by the soft-furred walls of her breasts. They had him firmly pinned as the two set off on the second leg of their journey. He shook and bounced a little between the jiggling masses, Katja's chest providing the same soothing massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity to the blissful man they arrived at the parking lot with his car. It was late and not a single other vehicle was left at the remote strip of dirt. Katja smirked a little at the sight of Carl's vehicle. \"You humans and your machines...\" She mused, fishing the little man from her chest. He was happy to see his car again, but a little worried. He might've gotten back to his starting point, but there was still one small little problem to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now what? I can't drive when I'm this small. When will this wear off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wear off?\" Suzie said with a devious smile, the man's eyes going wide at the implication. Did these vixens shrink him permanently? He felt a helpless fit of rage come in, but the fox woman was already a step ahead of him. \"Well, usually it takes a couple of hours, but we can undo it right now for you if you want us to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes, please.\" Carl said happily. As fun as it was to be carried around by the pair, he'd prefer to be back at his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... that sounds like a favor. And we'll want something in return.\" Katja said, grinning wickedly. Carl sighed. Again with the tricks and again he walked into them like a complete tool. He wondered if there was still time to go back to the bar and just let the bear eat him, it seemed a far less complicated way for this madness to end. He lets out the deepest sigh and looks up at the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, what do you want?\"</span></div></div>",

He thought about just hiding whilst they were distracted, but that might just turn them more predatory. Best to avoid that when he's snack-sized. After some deliberation they finally turn their attention back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to come with you.\" Katja stated proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" He stammered, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want you to take us with you in your car. We both love traveling so we wanna see a little more of your part of the world. And who knows, we could have some fun at your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl really didn't have the stamina or patience to deal with much more of this, but what choice did he have? If he refused he'd remain tiny for several more hours and he strongly doubts these two will just leave him alone. They had him in a corner and for a moment he felt the pangs of dread usually reserved for prey animals. He let out the deepest of sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess you can come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Suzie cheered, reaching down and snatching up the little man in a big hug. She pulled him back just to plant a large kiss on his face, her lips smothering most of his head. Katja then took hold of him, already feeling him return back to normal size. She gave the little man a big cuddle before setting him down. Several seconds passed as Carl found his perspective shifting rapidly to match the pair and then rise above it slightly. He breathes a sigh of relief. He was no longer just a morsel or plaything to them, though he feared they could change that at a moment's notice. For now he just retrieved his car keys and unlocked the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja and Suzie piled onto the backseat, giggling up a storm as they'd succesfully coerced the human to take them along. Their cunning was unmatched. Carl just put on a fake smile and fastened his seatbelt. He looked over his shoulder to see the childlike wonder in the two foxes' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seatbelts please, don't want you to get hurt.\" He stated flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, don't worry about us, little man, we're tougher than we look.\" Katja said, putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, no bothering the driver then. I didn't survive an encounter with a giant spider and a bar full of potential predators just to get in a car crash tonight.\" He said, sighing wearily as he was almost convinced they wouldn't be able to listen to that. Katja and Suzie just giggled in response, sitting back and pretending to be disappointed. He rolled his eyes and started driving.</span></div></div>",

Not only did he not get any material for his next video about the strange dating app and the monster spider he thought would be a trick. He now had two strange magical fox women in the backseat of his car. The whole thing seemed so surreal, like he was dreaming. Though why he would dream up Mira first and not these two babes is anyone's question. As much as he didn't like being tricked by them, he had to admit Katja and Suzie were very pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Carl, do you live in a big house?\" Katja asks, stifling a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, not really. It's just a simple appartment.\" He replied, keeping his eyes on the road ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you silly humans. Rooting yourselves in place like that. Caring only about the things you have.\" Suzie chided teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, those are the things that keep me alive and comfortable, so I'm gonna call that worth it. And before you get snarky with me, do I look like the kind of creature that'd be able to go out into the wilds and just hunt and forage together my own meals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you ancestors did, but I see your point about the comfort. It is nice to have a roof over your head and a bed to call your own I guess. I mean, we've crashed in many a guest room or hotel, but it's not quite the same.\" Suzie muses, causing Carl to get curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotel? You mean there's other places like that bar deep in the woods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got no idea what's going on deep in the forest. Out there, monsters are everywhere.\" Katja said with a spooky voice, before falling apart into giggles near the end. Carl let out a small laugh too. He followed it up with a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know a bit about me, but what about you two? Tell me a bit about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where to start? You already know we're spirit guides, and beyond that we're two good friends that go everywhere together. We've traveled up and down this world so many times in our lives, giving guidance to those in need and having a lot of fun along the way. We also like playing little pranks on unsuspecting humans and monsters, but last I checked you weren't objecting to that.\" She said with a naughty smirk. Carl just sighed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope the other monsters out there will be like you two then, you seem nice enough.\" Carl replied, making both of them burst out into drawn-out cooing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you're so sweet.\" Katja said, leaning in. The man suddenly felt a wetness streaking along the back of his neck. He let out a sharp \"hey!\", causing her to back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no bothering the driver.\" He grumbled. He tried not to think about why she was trying to lick him. Hopefully their comments about his sweetness were not literal. He's already had to talk himself out of getting eaten by Mira tonight, it'd be nice to come across a monster that didn't think of him as a meal. Katja sat back in her seat, annoyed the human wasn't up for fooling around even a little. Suddenly Suzie leaned into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, he's probably right, we shouldn't pester him too much.\" She said, draping an arm around Katja's shoulder and pulling her in closer.  She knew what her friend was up to and she was more than eager for it too. In mere moments they fell over, vigorously kissing eachother. Their muzzles interlocked, their tongues dancing around one another. They moaned a little as they surrendered themselves to the sweet bliss of passion, wrapping their arms around eachother in an intimate embrace. Their lengthy and intense kiss seemed to last forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was shocked at how sudden that happened. Moreover he couldn't help but think it was incredibly hot to see them go at eachother like that. He struggled to keep his eyes off of them until he felt the car veering off, snapping his attention back to driving. He kept his gaze on the road, but he couldn't ignore the sounds coming from behind him. Soft moaning and wet, sloppy smooching as they passionately kissed. He worried for a moment they'd step it up to having full on sex on the backseat, but thankfully they stopped before it got to that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead the foxes stared in awe out of the window as they entered Carl's hometown. For a duo that doesn't have a home to call their own, seeing all the lights and buildings must be quite the unique experience. He got the impression monsters, or at least the forest-dwelling ones, didn't really seek eachother out or live together. It was a bit surprising that they hadn't wandered into town themselves if they were all about traveling. Maybe the roles had switched and they believed they'd need a guide to traverse the city, pinning the job on Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of driving he finally arrived home. He let the pair out of the car and opened the trunk. The realization suddenly hit him. His camera and things were still in the forest, right were he met Mira. He let out an annoyed sigh. That equipment was too expensive to just abandon, but it should be durable enough to last a night out there. It seemed unlikely anyone else would stumble upon it. He closed the trunk and locked the car, walking over to the front door of his appartment complex. The two foxes eagerly followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walked through the building, wowed by the size of it. Carl was just happy it was late. He didn't feel like having to explain to anyone why two fox women were with him. They reached his appartment and when he opened the door the pair scurried inside, eager to see how he was living.</span></div></div>",

All in all, it's taken a lot out of me.\" He tries to force a smile on his face. Saying it all out loud barely belied just how crazy the day has been. The mere sight of Mira was one he wouldn't soon forget. Mercifully the two foxes seemed understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two keep it down you can watch some tv or something, I think I'm going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja and Suzie let out a disappointed 'awwww' in unison. \"But we only just got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it's also like two in the morning and I'm barely able to stay awake.\" He said, yawning loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie shot a glance over at the clock on the wall and gasped a little. \"Wow, you're right. We were in your car longer than I thought. Maybe we should get some rest too then. We can always have more fun tomorrow.\" She said, Katja nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, help yourself to the couch, it's pretty decent.\" Carl mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, buddy.\" Suzie huffed. \"You have got a bed for us, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place isn't exactly big enough for a guest room. The couch is all I've got. If you wanted something better prepared, you shouldn't try to hitch a ride at the very last moment.\" Carl snapped back. These two were getting on his every nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll be sleeping in your bed. You can take the couch if you want, but you're more than welcome to join us. We're used to huddling together with others for warmth.\" Suzie gave him a toothy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uhm...\" He stammered. He wasn't about to be shunted from his own bed, but her offer confused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, don't tell me you've not been daydreaming about what it would feel like to share your bed with two full-size living plushies. You already know how soft we are.\" Katja added, making the man blush brightly. The foxes knew their appeal and seeing the man stumble on his words made them giggle. He went even redder as they started to take off their clothes, getting ready to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's the bedroom?\" She asked seductively. Carl just motioned for them to follow him, opening his bedroom door and sitting on the side of the bed. He took off everything but his boxers. Mercifully they didn't seem too eager to get frisky with him right now. He's not sure he's got the stamina left for that. He pulls back the blanket and the moment he lies down he's already half asleep. With half-open eyes he watches the two foxes take off every last bit of clothing on them before sliding into the bed. The blanket seemed superfluous with him sandwiched between their warm bodies. Katja and Suzie murred a little with delight, enjoying the smoothness of Carl's body against theirs. The bed was large enough for all of them, but not by a big margin. They plant a gentle goodnight kiss on each of his cheeks before smirking to eachother as the cute man falls asleep between them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two foxes let out a yawn each before closing their eyes and sleeping as well. But only two hours later Suzie wearily stirs awake. Katja follows not soon after, looking at the alarm clock behind her and smirking. That was a good night's rest with their adorable human friend. But Carl still seemed fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey wakey sleepyhead. Get up.\" She whispers in his ear, but he doesn't respond at all. Suzie is quick to point out the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you dumbass, he's not like us. He needs like, three times as much sleep.\" She hisses under her breath. Katja looks a little shocked by the revelation and then blushes, lowering her voice to a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Carl.\" She breathes in his ear, Suzie rolling her eyes at the cheesy gesture. Katja turns her attention back to her friend. \"What are we supposed to do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Suzie shrugs, looking over to the sleeping man. Suddenly a smile curled up on her face. She didn't want to wake him, but does that mean she should just leave him alone entirely? She reached to his chest and began to rub it gently. Carl shivered for a moment, then hummed happily in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Katja whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's sleeping, doesn't mean we can't make him comfortable, right?\" Suzie replied with a grin. Her smile jumped onto her friend and soon the two foxes were looming over Carl, thinking of ways to give him a pleasant night's rest. He looked so quiet and innocent now. Not wanting Suzie to have all the fun Katja soon lowered her head and gave him a sly little lick across his chest. She murred with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are just the tastiest little man.\" She mused to herself, making the other fox giggle. \"And to think we almost just would've swallowed you at the bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be too harsh on yourself, he looked so helpless and innocent I'm shocked we got to him before anyone else stuffed him in their belly. If only he knew how lucky he is to have met us.\" Suzie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I think he knows.\" Katja smirks, her eyes darting over to the man's crotch then back to Suzie. She soon picks up on what was going on and shoots a glance over there too. A conspicuous bulge was twitching inside his boxers, the two foxes were enthralled with curiosity. Neither of them wanted to make the first move, afraid that touching it would wake Carl up. After some more fidgeting and staring Suzie finally leaned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really likes us, doesn't he?\" She muses, her warm breath making the little bulge twitch again. Carefully she hooks a clawed finger in the waistband of his boxers and ever so slowly she pulls them down. She went as calmly and gently as she could, delicately unwrapping a precious treasure. Katja stared breathlessly at the whole process. This was far from the first time she'd seen a dick, but a human one was rare. And seeing Suzie take so much care not to wake him was kind of funny. She stifled a laugh as it finally sprung free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox women lean in closer, catching a whiff of the slightly muggy smell radiating off Carl's manhood. They exchanged smiles before letting their tongues hang out and giving the tip a gentle lick. The man moaned in his sleep, his cock twitching a little at the sudden attention it received. They backed off immediately, fearing they'd woken him up, but when his eyes remained closed the breathed a sigh of relief in unison. Playing with his dick poked at their instincts in a strange way. It was a game to them, but it strangely felt reminiscent of stalking prey in the forest. Staying unnoticed until the time to strike. Hopefully Carl would be up for what they wanted out of him. For now they amused themselves by teasing his manhood.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After his exhausting day Carl could sleep through a thunderstorm. The two foxes' playful actions with his manhood didn't register deeply enough to wake him and after another hour of teasing Katja and Suzie got bored again. Pitying the silly man they left him alone and snuck off to the living room. They inspected the contents of his fridge and helped themselves to most of them. Among the goods was some beer too, though a few sips of it was enough for them to leave it. Human beer was very different to what they're used to and not in a good way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Carl yawns loudly, stretching his arms. He had the strangest dream. Two weird fox girls had hitched a ride with him and slept in his bed tonight. But as reality set in he grimaced uncomfortably. It wasn't a dream, no matter how much it felt like one. The loose bits of shed fur on his bed were one indicator. More alarming was his exposed manhood, gleaming with what seemed to be drool. No wonder the latter half of that dream went to such pleasurable extremes. He cleaned himself up, shuffled into some clothes and entered the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is. Good morning, sleepyhead. I hope we didn't wake you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't... surprisingly.\" Carl muttered, his tone calm until he sees the state of his kitchen. It wasn't the cleanest before, but it looked like a bomb went off. \"Well, I see you managed to find the food.\" He seethed. Half-opened everything strewn about everywhere and even his beer had been touched. Were these two curious or just alcoholics?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, human food is weird. Don't worry, we'll make it up to you. Here, I made you some breakfast.\" Suzie said cheerfully, pointing Carl over to the small table near his kitchen. He sat down and to his surprise she put a plate in front of him with a completely normal looking sandwich. He took a tentative bite and though he couldn't shake the idea that there was some kind of catch to this he had to admit is was a tasty sandwich. Before he took another bite he did feel the urge to satisfy his suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't involve me having to return any favors, does it? Or did you sneak in some weird wild magic?\" He said slyly. Katja laughed from over on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, he's catching on quick. Nah, this one's on us, no tricks involved. Just enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl ate his sandwich whilst the two foxes rummaged around his home. They seemed enthralled by his homely little place, though some questions arose once they found a lot of his recording equipment stacked on a shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it you do during the day?\" Katja asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I record videos of me debunking monster stories and sightings. Usually it's some local prankster or some guys trying to start a new myth to sell merchandise. Given the way you're talking about how common real monsters are it seems like a miracle I've not bumped into one before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that why you went into the forest after dark? To find a monster? Well, that's definitely one way to do it.\" Suzie mused with a grin. Stalking the lonely and the lost was always fun for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually was there because I was supposed to meet one, yes. You've seen her too, right? The giant spider. I've been chatting with her over Monstr.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Monstr, that new app thing? There's humans on there?\" She says, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's the whole draw of it. It pairs monsters with moro... people interested in them.\" Katja adds, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I figured a giant spider would be easy enough to debunk. Imagine my surprise when I'm faced with the real thing. Not gonna lie, that got a bit more intense than I planned.\" Carl chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say, I'm surprised she didn't eat you. That's how most encounters between her and humans end.\" Suzie giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm lucky.\" Carl shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing as you've got two hot babes instead I'd say lucky is a good way to describe it.\" Katja replies, winking at him. The man just grinned and blushed, finishing his sandwich. The moment he was done Suzie sidled up beside him and pulled his chair back a little. Carl wasn't given time to react before she twirled around and sat down on his lap. In spite of being almost as tall as him she weighed surprisingly little. She leaned in a little, her fuzzy chest filling most of his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that you've got us here, what to do...\" Suzie muses seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, maybe he can take us for a date instead.\" Katja suggests, walking up behind Carl and pushing her chest against the back of his head. Suzie leans forward, smothering the man's face with her soft breasts. \"Or maybe we skip the dating and get straight to the good stuff.\" She whispers.</span></div></div>",

I only met you two last night. I don't know how romance goes among monsters, but with humans it's normally not this fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja and Suzie both giggle a little. \"Well, it depends on the monster really. Some are into the same courtship and rituals you humans are. Arranging for gifts and meetings and all that. It's kinda cute to be honest.\" Katja muses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Others just drag whoever they fancy into the bedroom, rip their clothes off and get busy.\" Suzie adds with a toothy smirk, making the man feel even more nervous. To his surprise she then got up, stepping away from him and seemingly entertaining his request. Her long, fuzzy tail burshed along the side of the head. \"But I understand if you're a bit overwhelmed. Not many men get to see these and those that do have told me they're quite impressive.\" She says smugly, showing off her fuzzy breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humble as always...\" Katja sighed before turning her attention to the man. \"Maybe I can make things more interesting. You mentioned last night that you left some of your stuff in the forest, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's expression soured immediately. He just remembered the camera kit. It had spent all night in the forest. Given how remote his meeting point with Mira was it's unlikely someone else will have come across it. But that's still quite a journey to get there and those items are too expensive to just abandon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja saw his foul grimace and smiled. \"Well, what if I could reach through the veil and retrieve them for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's eyebrow shot up. \"You can do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as it's got your scent I can find it.\" She replies proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been using that stuff for almost a year now, I'd say it smells like me alright. But hold on. What is it you want in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja and Suzie pouted a little. The human really was starting to catch on to their ways. Brashly, Suzie piped up with an answer. \"Well, I was thinking that in return I could go and retrieve the stick you've got up your ass so we can have some fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was taken aback by her attitude, but when he weighed his options the answer seemed obvious. It'd save him a long trip to the forest and the two foxes would reward him with some intimate fun times. It seemed almost too good to be true. His better judgment called for him to decline the deal. There's something these two aren't telling him. Some catch or trick. But as Suzie leaned in and filled his vision with her soft globes again he had to be honest with himself. He could feel his manhood reacting, praying to whoever would listen that she didn't notice it when sitting on his lap before. But the way she was throwing herself at him, she knew. She had to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, how bad can it be?\" He answered, his tone a little weary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two foxes erupted into giggles. Katja leaned in and took a deep sniff of Carl's face and hair, attuning her keen senses to his smell. Her eyes started to glow softly as she stepped back and started to look around. Her gaze was locked onto something distant and when she reached out to grab it her hand became shrouded in mist. The man sat back in awe, watching her casually employ real, proper magic. It was happening in front of him and still he could only think about how this could be done with smoke machines and trickery. But when she pulled his camera kit from seemingly thin air he stopped trying to understand it. He happily took the kit from her and stashed it with the rest of his equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to find both Katja and Suzie looking at him with an almost predatory leer. It was time to uphold his end of the bargain. What did these two have in mind for him?</span></div></div>",

He could practically hear the thirst in her voice. Was he really that appealing to them? Or was he just dumb enough to keep agreeing to their deals? It seemed to make little difference to these two. Though maybe the malice behind it all is just in his head. After all, why couldn't they just be looking to have some fun with him? He pulled up his shirt and removed it, making both foxes squeak in delight. It was nothing they hadn't seen last night, but seeing the man finally get on with it was worth celebrating. Carl walked past them, leading the two back into his bedroom. He sat down on the bed and discarded the rest of his clothes. Then he gave them a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who gets to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja and Suzie stared at eachother, blushing a little. He'd found the one part of their plans they hadn't thought about yes. Neither of them wanted to go second but before they could start a heated discussion or a fight Carl offered a suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a coin here, let's flip it. And no magical gusts of air to influence it, you two keep an eye on eachother.\" He said jokingly, but the foxes were only giving him a small grin, both still staring daggers at the other. Suzie picked heads, Katja chose tails. One coin toss later it was decided. Suzie was to go first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" She cheered. Carl had already laid down on his back, the fox women looming over him now. Suzie leaned in and gave his soft manhood a lick from base to tip, making it rise up with excitement. A few more strokes from her hands and he was at full mast. It was almost embarrassing to the man how eager he was to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good man.\" Suzie teased as she straddled him and prepared herself to sit down on his groin. Her pussy was eager to take in his throbbing mass and both Carl and Suzie gasped as they felt eachother's warmth intimately. Katja wasn't about to just sit idly on the sidelines though. His dick may be occupied, but there were more ways to have fun here. She climbed up on top of him, taking a seat on his chest. She didn't weigh all that much, but it was distracting all the same for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks a bit hungry, don't you think Suzie? I'll take care of it. Can't have him conk out before we're done.\" She muses, her friend giggling behind her inbetween lewd moans. Katja's words weren't as cryptic as she thought, but there was little Carl could do to stop her from acting on it. She shuffled forwards until her womanhood loomed over his mouth and slowly sat down. He gave the wet snatch a cautious lick and was surprised to find out it tasted sweet. Like honey almost, but with a strange, tart extra flavor beneath it all. He needed no further encouragement to eat her out, his tongue pushing in as far as it could. Katja joined her friend in moaning loudly as the man beneath them pleasured both of them at once.</span></div></div>",

Her moans were getting quicker and louder as his eagerness brought her to new heights of pleasure. She was close, he could feel it. Her body tensed up and the meager offerings turned into a flood. The man didn't waver, drinking it all up. The sweet release warmed his throat and in the aftermath of humping his face for so long Katja finally remembered to let him breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie was not too far behind from her friend, riding his rock-hard shaft. She'd taken charge, bouncing herself up and down. It wasn't too difficult to keep pace with her, even as Carl put his attention mostly towards Katja smothering his face. But now he was free to give Suzie the ride she desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh! Oh yes! Bigger!\" She moaned, making him raise a curious eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, I don't think humans are supposed to~\" Katja tried to add but Suzie interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, don't care. This one is and I want more. Don't stop, Carl.\" She pieced together her sentences between lewd moans. Slowly it began to dawn on Carl that the sexual fluids of magical fox women might have a few side effects. And apparently one of them was making his dick grow. Fortunately Suzie seems ready for such an event. It'd get awkward real fast if she got stuck or hurt herself in some way. As he got over the initial weirdness he began to realize he could feel it too. He could feel her warmth around his shaft. Already it felt like the tip was bouncing somewhere near her stomach. How she was able to handle it without injury was probably explained by the same magic that gave Katja's juices these strange properties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rode his cock like there was no tomorrow and as Carl was reaching close to his climax he couldn't help but wonder if this was all some strange dream. It felt so surreal. The gentle brushing of her fur against his thighs. Her whimpering moans as she slid him deep inside her. That long, fluffy tail swishing around excitedly behind her. And her friend, who had taken to cradling his head in her lap, playing with his hair and cooing gently as she felt him nearing the conclusion too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped the mattress until his fingers turned white and bucked as hard as he could, driving himself inside and unleashing a torrent of cum unlike any he'd ever felt before. He could feel it rushing through his enlarged manhood, a palpable sense of power behind it. Suzie gasped as she felt the surge of heat enter her, erupting into her own orgasm. Any instructions she might've tried to give him devolved into begging for more. Carl eagerly obliged, pumping his cock until his balls felt hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja ruffled his hair, watching his eyes glaze over as he basked in the afterglow of some of the most mindblowing sex of his life. \"Awww, he's all tuckered out.\" She cooed, before looking up to see her friend's expression was much the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I guess that makes two of you.\" She giggled a little before guiding her friend to lie down on his chest. She looked about ready to fall over, only propped up by the man's shaft inside of her. Suzie and Carl almost instinctively wrapped their arms around eachother. Katja slid down and laid herself on the other side, the two foxes sandwiching Carl between them. Without another word being said they agreed a nap was desired to recover from what just happened.</span></div></div>",

He jerked awake as he discovered it was his bed that just got destroyed, the sudden if short lurch downwards waking both himself and the two fox women. But as he looked around his perspective felt weird. The strangeness of the situation came to a head when he felt something touch his foot. Something that felt strangely like the doorframe of his bedroom. But he was in his bed and the door was on the opposite side of the room. And he knew his room wasn't the biggest, but he's fairly sure it's not supposed to be this small. Finally his brain kicked into gear and he put all the pieces together. He'd grown taller. Much taller. His room only barely fit him anymore, his shoulder nearing the ceiling and his feet touching the doorframe. The loud crash had also woken up the other two, now looking adorably small to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooow, you look good.\" Katja said, surprised to see their efforts yielding such a dramatic result. She'd been vaguely aware something like this might happen, but to see it with her own eyes was something else. Her excitable tone didn't shift Carl's mood, who was quick to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I look trapped. I'm too large to leave this room now. Not without tearing down the freaking walls.\" He replied snarkily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh calm down, it's not all bad.\" Suzie chimed in. She'd slid off his manhood during their nap and was now stood next to it, admiring its size. Feeling that thing go to town inside her was incredible and seeing how much he'd grown even she wasn't quite sure how she made it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is. Can't you change me back?\" Carl added with a touch of fear in his voice. Explaining the fox women to his neighbors would've been a challenge. Getting them not to freak out as he broke through the wall would be a lot harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, I guess we could...\" Katja mused. \"But that sounds an awful lot like a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl let out a grumbling sigh, reaching out and swiftly grabbing both fox ladies. Their slim figures were narrow enough to wrap his hand around and with a surprised squeak from both he brought them to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you return the favor instead. You know, for all the fun we had earlier? Because let's be honest, this mess is all on you.\" He said, straining to maintain his patience with the two tricksters. There were seemingly unfazed by his size advantage. If he had to hazard a guess, they could probably shrink him down to a mouse with little effort. Threats aren't going to work, but there was something else quite curious going on. Maybe he read their expressions wrong, but were they getting turned on by this? He tested it by giving them the slightest squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh.\" Suzie moaned before realizing that Carl might be on to her. She regains her calm demeanor and puts a hand on his wrist. \"Easy Carl, let's make a deal. We help you get back to your usual size and in return you come on a date with us. In the forest this time, where you won't have to worry about getting big and we'll be able to have all the fun we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl gave her a knowing smile. \"Why wait? I could give you some more pleasure right now?\" He said in a sultry tone before bringing her close. He opened his mouth, letting warm breath wash over her. The fox woman squeaked with excitement as he let his tongue hang out, bringing her closer still. Suddenly she gasped as the slippery tongue pushed aside her legs and pressed against her crotch. The fox woman moaned loudly, practically hitting her peak with just a single oversized lick. The short fur left a weird taste in Carl's mouth, but he could feel her shiver with delight as he sealed the deal with a second wet stroke of his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja didn't get time to protest before she was given the same treatment. With both of them brought so effortlessly to these heights of pleasure they felt it only fair to give the man what he wanted. They beckoned for him to bring them closer again and placed a gentle kiss on each of his cheeks. There was a strange warmth radiating from where they kissed him, but surely enough it felt like the two were getting larger. He wasn't able to hold them much longer, setting them down on the ground as he quickly shrank back down to his familiar stature. It was a little disorienting, but as he sat up in bed he saw Katja suddenly holding his phone. She looked up to see his perturbed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, I'm just adding our numbers. Because Suzie and I gotta go soon and I think I speak for all of us when I say that we should meet again. Thank you for your hospitality, Carl. It's been a lot of fun.\" Katja seemed genuinely saddened to leave, but Suzie wasn't so dour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not gone yet though. There's still time for some action before we hit the road.\"</span></div></div>",

But he couldn't help but remember how much they seemed to like him being large. \"Well, I believe you two were very enthusiastic to have me grow big. But there's only so far that can be taken in this room. Now I know you can shrink me, but can you shrink yourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair looked at eachother with smiles a mile wide. The idea of building up the size difference by shrinking themselves hadn't occurred to them yet. But Katja was quick to test Carl's motives. \"Oh yes, make us all puny and small, so you can have the power, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What power? The power to reduce me to the size of a bug in an instant?\" He joked back. He knew that no matter how small those two got, they'd be able to make him smaller still. And in spite of all their trickery, he was enjoying their time with him. Satisfied with his answer the foxes gave eachother a hug and a kiss. The magic didn't need long to work. Carl sat on his bed in amazement as he watched them go down to only several inches tall. He held out his hands in front of them. Though there was a cautious pause from Katja and Suzie, soon they let the man pick them up and bring them up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, what have we here?\" Carl said theatrically. \"A pair of little mice scurrying around my bedroom. You two sure look tasty.\" He boomed, sending a shiver of concern down the foxes' spines. He pursed his lips and gave each of them an overwhelming kiss. Judging by their excited squirming and muffled moans they were loving it. He opened his hands, leaving them on all fours on his palms. Their heads and chests were matted with drool but their expressions couldn't be clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatja was the first to be given a more thorough taste, her body bowled over and pressed flat into the large hand as Carl's tongue came down on her like a soggy steamroller. She squirmed and squeaked with delight as it ran along her crotch and chest, providing stimulation beyond measure. Carl wasn't fully certain, but he believed there was an orgasm in there somewhere. He could see Suzie smirking with anticipation and soon provided her the same treatment, going even slower to ensure no part of her would be left untouched by his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are tasty, but I think I'll keep you for some fun instead.\" He announced, lowering the two to his crotch. Their matted tails wagged quicker as he brought them to his dick. He was already feeling excited from playing with the two foxes, but when Katja snuck in a quick kiss on his tip he groaned. His erection doubled in size, now at least three times taller than the fox women in his hands. They moaned and squealed as they were pressed against the hard, throbbing pillar. Carl pumped it slowly, not wanting this to end. Their squirms were amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at you now. So thirsty for me.\" He joked, shuffling Katja and Suzie into one hand before continuing to rub them against his shaft. With his free hand he grabbed the glass of water on his nightstand and emptied it. The fox spirits let out a small yelp of surprise when he put them in the empty glass. Soon their eyes widened as he brought the glass to his twitching tip. He was ready to blow and they were getting front row seats. \"Carl! Wait!\" Suzie cried out, but they got on this wild ride and he was going to take it all the way to the finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a stifled moan he reached his climax, spraying a potent jet of cum into the glass. Several more thick ropes followed, the little blessing from the foxes growing not just the size of his shaft. Instead of the usual spoonful he managed to fill the glass halfway, leaving Katja and Suzie up to their waist in his seed. He held them up, smiling at the result of his handiwork. \"Heh, will this satisfy your thirst?\" He asked with a broad grin on his face. He expected them to play around in the goopy slime for a bit, but Katja and Suzie sat down, nearly submerging themselves in his cum. There was a subtle glow pulsing from their bodies before they got up again. He was curious to know what that was about, but they suddenly turned and addressed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for all the fun, Carl. We've gotta go now. As for that...\" Suzie pointed at his groin. \"...it should get back to normal in an hour. So play with it while it lasts, right?\" She chuckled a little as his eyes darted to his cock, then back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope we see eachother again soon.\" Katja added. He blew them a kiss before they let themselves sink down into the pool of cum, disappearing beneath the surface. He wasn't about to test it, but somehow Carl knew that they had left his home. Because of course they'd be able to use a glass of cum as a portal. After everything else they'd done to him, that just seemed normal now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs some days passed he wondered what to do. Not just with the footage of meeting Mira, but his channel in general. How could he record himself boasting about all monsters being cheap tricks or pranks after the things he'd experienced? He was going to have to rethink his strategy on it when suddenly his phone beeped.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl found himself in the shadow of a large bear woman. A stocky frame, thick arms and legs and yet a distinct feminine touch to it all. She gave him a warm smile, pulling her hand back after startling the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to freak you out. I couldn't help but notice you sitting around looking a little nervous. Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was low and strangely melodic for such a hulking creature. Carl fidgeted in his chair, intimidated by her sheer size. He twitched a little when she reached out a paw again. Her large claws were on full display, looking like they could effortlessly tear him to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try again. My name is Matroska. I'm a singer here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm Carl... I'm.. stuck here.\" He stammered back, his nerves finally beginning to calm themselves enough to form a sentence. He was still too shocked to respond to her outstretched hand, the bear pulling it back and blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I figured as much when I saw your spider friend leave.\" She muses. \"Well, I reckon I can help you with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's spirits lifted a little. But he still wasn't able to feel at ease next to the bear woman. It was starting to get a little embarrassing. How was he ready to stay calm next to Mira of all things and now he couldn't do the same for someone who frankly looked a lot less scary? \"Well, I would be very appreciative if you could help me get back home... If that's okay with you of course...\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you poor thing. Come, let's go. Matroska will take care of you.\" She walked to the forest's edge and motioned for him to follow. With limited options available to him Carl steeled himself and hopped off his seat. He quickly walked up to the bear woman, following her into the woods. Before he left he threw one last glance over his shoulder. The patrons seemed indifferent to his departure. Only the two foxes took notice, their eyes a little wider. But they soon got back to chatting and giggling among themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a solid half hour of walking the path the bear created with her large frame they arrived at a cave. She motioned for him to follow her inside. With some apprehension he entered, shocked by what he saw. Tucked away in the back of the cave was a wooden wall with a door. It was built to Matroska's scale, the bear entering her home. Carl followed her inside and his jaw nearly hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah...\" He gasped, looking at the interior of what felt like a quaint little cottage. A small table, some worn recliners, a little kitchen in the corner. The only thing that was missing was a log fire. Though her dense fur coat probably kept her more than warm enough in here. And though it all looked cozy and rustic, every piece of furniture was big to him, giving the whole interior a weird undercurrent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis amazement and curiosity were brought to a halt when he suddenly heard the door close behind him. Matroska slid a heavy beam in, blocking the door, before turning her attention back to the nervous little man. She squatted down a little to look him in the eye. And in her big bear eyes Carl could see she was feeling... </span></div></div>",

But the ones I always like retelling are the ones about how gullible you are. Or did you think that following a literal bear into the woods was going to end differently?\" She said, laughing and flashing her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran down Carl's spine. Was she just trying to spook him or did he really far for the world's most obvious trap? Whichever it was, he knew that it'd take being on her good side to get out of here. If for no other reason than him being unable to lift the wooden beam locking the door. With a sly grin he gave her an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me. Bears don't usually talk or live in cozy little houses. For all I know you're about to burst into a song and dance routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, at least you're honest. But that doesn't solve my problem.\" She mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl wanted to ask what her problem was, but a loud gurgling rumble filled the room. The bear's belly made it chillingly clear that it was eager to receive the man. Matroska took a step closer, opening her arms to corral him into a corner. His heart raced, he tried to think of something, anything he could do to avoid her. If he dashed now he could probably give her the slip, but it would be pointless as long as the door was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure I can't cook you up something nice with whatever you've got in the kitchen?\" He stammered, desperate to please her in whatever way possible to avoid his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, little guy, my belly has decided it wants something warm and wriggly.\" The bear woman said with an amused chuckle. Carl didn't fully grasp what she meant with 'wriggly' until she'd lunged forward and wrapped her arms around him. The overwhelming hug delivered by her fuzzy arms was painful, squeezing the fight right out of him. She wrangled the man onto the dinner table and put a paw on his head. A sudden spike of pressure finally got him to stop fighting back. Carl felt the heavy paw getting close to cracking his skull, the bear woman holding back just enough to stop herself from killing him outright. Far worse was the hot breath washing over him. It smelled awful. For all their pretense of civility, brushing teeth was clearly not something that had been adopted yet. She roughly tore the clothes from his body, leaving him completely naked and exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shivered in the cold air, the bear letting out another chuckle. \"Oh you poor thing. Let me heat you up.\" She fought back another outburst of laughter as she opened her maw wide. Carl felt his feet get enveloped by her jaws, quickly shoved right down her gullet. Matroska didn't waste any time, gulping greedily on his legs. Before he knew it his waist was sinking past her lips. Even with her great size, swallowing him whole took some effort. If he fought back now she might just be forced to spit him out. But seeing those fearsome teeth made him decide otherwise. If he got too fighty there was no doubt she would bite down and that's a mess he definitely wanted to avoid. The precious moment he wasted overthinking this saw most of his belly sink into her gullet. Only his upper torso, arms and head were still free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatroska swallowed as hard as she could, drawing in more of her meal. She relished the feeling of the puny man trying to squirm in her throat, but his actions were far too little and far too late. Finally his head entered her maw, her tongue giving him a playful lick across his face. He was every bit as tasty as she hoped for and with one final gulp he was sealed in. She looked down to see her belly having grown a fair bit. Even for someone of her stature, an entire human was a considerable meal. But the subtle sensations of him squirming around in her stomach made the whole venture worth it. She slumped down in her recliner and rubbed her swollen gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaah, that's the stuff. Now be a good little human and wriggle as long as you can.\" She mused, feeling drowsy after such a large meal and a long day at work.</span></div></div>",

No hit or kick was able to elicit a response and the man began to fear this would be the end. Bubbling away inside a bear's belly. But as he grew despondent, Carl noticed something. The stomach had gone from its vigorous squeezing and undulating into something far more placid. It barely moved at all. Given how sleepy Matroska looked moments before gobbling him up, could it be she had fallen asleep? If so, this might be his only shot at survival. Waiting much longer wasn't an option. He already felt the bear's stomach juices tingle on his skin. Digesting alive was not on his plans for today and with all haste he begins to search for the exit. The narrow sphincter upwards proved difficult to distinguish in the pitch blackness, but eventually Carl managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little diligence and a lot of panic he pushed himself up, surprised to find the narrow passage yielding. Crawling up through her gullet was uniquely gross, but anything was better than staying in that horrid stomach. Eventually the first sliver of light can be seen at the end of the tunnel. How this wasn't waking Matroska up would be a mystery, but he wasn't about to second-guess this miracle. Her sleep seemed close to hibernation, the man able to push himself up into her maw and out past the jaws onto the ground. The heavy, wet splat his slime-soaked body produced didn't even stir her, through he still held his breath, every terrifying second stretching into an eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl lifted his arms up high in celebration, cheering without making a sound. He might've escaped her belly, but he was far from safe. First things first, the tingling gunk covering his body. He carefully snuck to the kitchen area of Matroska's den and toweled off most of the goop with an old tea towel. Next was the front door. The heavy wooden beam that locked it would be far too much for him to lift. He had to think of something. If she woke up now he was certain the bear would provide him another trip down her gullet. But this time she might chew a little first to dissuade any more escape attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thinking was further hampered by a chilly breeze. In spite of its tucked away location in a cave there was a bit of a draft going on and his bare form made it very clear. He looked over to his clothes but the torn scraps weren't worth salvaging. He would have to make the arduous trek back wearing nothing at all. It seemed so suicidal he contemplated waking Matroska up with an apology and a request to just kill him already. But before he could act on these gloomy thoughts he heard something. Footsteps, coming from outside the house. Was someone here to save him?</span></div></div>",

They were also <i>fast</i>, like there were multiple people approaching. And every time he thought they must be right outside the door by now the steps kept getting louder too. Suddenly things clicked for him as the steady patter came to a halt and a familiar voice whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carl? Are you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira?! Oh my god, I'm so happy to hear you.\" He hissed back, trying to keep his voice down for the sleeping bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry I left you there. I completely forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Just please get me out of here. The door is locked and I can't open it. And if she wakes up I'm history.\" He tried to keep his composure, but the despair in his voice was clear as day. Mira thought fast before giving Carl a very simple instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from the door. I'll bash it in. Once it's broken, run to me as fast as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to be told twice. The man leapt out of the way and covered his head to protect against any flying debris. Outside the house Mira reared back on her four back legs and prepared to free her date. She swung forwards, four large spindly limbs coming together to deliver a mighty blow to the door. With a deafening crash they forced the door open, shattering the wooden beam. Miraculously the door itself seemed mostly unscathed. The noise shook Carl, but he knew he had to run now or Matroska would catch him, the bear shuddering away with a snort. As fast as he could he bolted out the front door towards the giant spider. Even now there was a pang of hesitation felt running towards the giant monster. But after the journey into Matroska he knew there were bigger monsters around and Mira wasn't one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant spider was taken aback a little. She expected the little man running towards her, but she didn't expect him to be completely naked. He also smelled kinda weird. But there was not time to get into that as a loud roar boomed from the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the FUCK?!\" Matroska yelled as she stormed out the door. But all she saw was Mira's huge abdomen racing away, a stream of \"Sorry.\" echoing into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl had been grabbed and placed on the giant spider's back, hanging on to some of the spiny protrusions as she went full speed away from the bear's abode. Once they were sure it was safe and there were no angry bear women following her Mira slowed down to a crawl. Finally there was time for some emotions and Carl was the first to act, leaning down and giving the huge abdomen an awkward hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for coming back. I was this close to becoming bear food.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do smell like you've been through something. I went back to the bar and they told me you'd left with Matroska. So there was no time to waste. I don't know how she does it, but that bear has a bigger appetite for humans than anyone else in these parts. Even I don't eat that many.\" Mira replied calmly, sending a shiver down Carl's spine. It was a none too subtle reminder that his date wasn't shy about eating people either. He wondered if tonight was going to just end in her belly instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that also explains why you're naked. Hope it wasn't too drafty just now.\" Mira continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, if I wanted to be warm and toasty I would've stay in that bear's belly. But you're a spider, can't you use your silk to make me some clothes?\" He asked, a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a spider, Carl, not a tailor.\" She replied, a little annoyed. He gave a short laugh. \"I know, I'm only joking. I think there's a set of spare clothes in my car, but I haven't got the foggiest clue where that would be from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira thought about the situation for a moment, then an idea sprang to mind. \"Oh, if I take you to where we met, could you find the way from there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl barely had to say yes before the giant spider was off again. It was remarkable how quickly she could move among the trees, skittering up, over, around and through them to maintain a tremendous speed. It didn't take very long for them to arrive back at the webbed up site of their first encounter. Mira gave a weird, nervous noise at the sight of all the trees covered in silk. Hopefully the man wouldn't realize that this was the work of a very anxious spider eager for a date. She set him down to let him find his bearings. He took the opportunity to also quickly retrieve his camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think it's that way. Near the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah, that one.\" Mira nodded, hoisting him back up and completing the final leg of the journey in record time. The winding forest path he had to follow turned out to be no more than a minute away from his car at giant spider speed. He got down on all fours and reached underneath it to find the spare set of keys he'd hidden away for emergencies like this one. He popped open the trunk and dug around, pulling out some ratty looking clothes. He was more than happy to put them on, finally cutting off the chilling breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess this is goodbye?\" Mira said, giving a creepy spider version of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so. Though if you're up for it, maybe we can go for another date?\" Carl stammered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, really? After everything that happened tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's be honest here, I was in way over my head when we met. But you saved my life, I think that warrants at least one real date.\" He tried to sound confident, but Carl let out an involuntary yelp when Mira's long legs swept him towards her head for a weird hug. She planted her best impression of a kiss on his chest before he returned the favor and kissed her on where he thought her cheek was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl got into his car and drove away, watching Mira's towering figure slowly slink into the horizon as she lifted one thin limb up high and waved at him. Today had been a rollercoaster and though there was still something deeply unnerving about her, a part of him couldn't wait for their next date.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of all the choices, one stood out in particular. Hel was a tall bear woman with fur as white as snow. She proclaimed herself to be a warrior spirit that would test those worthy of entering Valhalla. If they could stand against her without fear in their hearts, they stood a good chance. Those that could defeat her would enter legend. When Stephan jokingly asked why that was such a feat she gave him a short video of her picking up a car and folding it up like a piece of paper. It showed not just her immense strength, but also that she would stand a good seven feet taller than him. The thought of dating a woman the size of a literal polar bear intrigued him. Her fierce spirit all the more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir chats continued for a few more days before she suggested they met up somewhere. Stephan offered some ideas for a nice place to get a drink, but Hel had other plans. She told him of a gym on the outskirts of town set in an old warehouse. It was apparently used by monsters and a few humans brave enough to work out alongside monsters. He jokingly asked if their first date was just gonna be a fight. Hel said she wouldn't mind a round in the ring with him to see how much he could handle. Wouldn't want her love to put him in the hospital after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling up to the challenge he agreed to meet her at the aforementioned gym in a few days. In the interim he looked up some basics of wrestling. Stephan took care of himself and was quite fit, but he lacked the knowledge. Then again, what good was that gonna do against someone of her stature? Better than nothing. At least he could show her some moves before she'd throw him around the ring. By the sounds of it the main test would be if he was brave enough to step into a wrestling ring with her to begin with. A daunting task, he had to admit, but not one he would shy away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her instructions the man soon ended up in a large industrial lot, checking his phone as he walked by the warehouses. Finally he came across one that didn't seem to have any company logos on it that matched the description she gave him. He walked around the back and was greeted by Hel, who was waiting at the entrance. She wore some loose trunks and a baggy shirt, looking ready to hit the gym. He was still in his regular outfit, but he'd brought a sports bag with some more appropriate clothes in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stephan.\" She waved at him, recognizing him of the pictures he'd sent earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hel.\" He responded in kind, approaching the large ursine woman. He grabbed her large clawed mitt and they shook hands. She guided him inside, showing the gym and several strange monsters using workout equipment of all sizes. After some small-talk she gave him an opportunity to change. A few moments later he was ready and she pointed him to an oversized wrestling ring that managed to make even her look small. It was set up for ogres and half-giants, but smaller folk were welcome to it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surreal experience to climb into such a large ring for Stephan. It felt like he had shrunk. In the opposite corner stood the bear woman. Her toothy grin showed an eagerness to wrestle the man half her size that felt almost unsettling. But if he was gonna embark on this romantic adventure, he couldn't back out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we get started?\" She said, giving him a sly wink.</span></div></div>",

Part of her hoped he'd be able to show a little bit of talent in the ring, but it looks like he'll have to be taught. A smile grew on her face. This was going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready or not, here I come!\" She announced grandly before barreling across the ring. She stood tall over her date, looming menacingly with her claws and teeth out. He surprised her by not only standing his ground against such an intimidating sight, but actually lunging towards her. He grabs her leg and begins to twist it. Hel's eyebrow is raised. Did he know she was just gonna play around or is he not taking this seriously at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan feels the impossible happen as the tree trunk leg starts to topple. He pushes as hard as possible until he looks up to see her letting herself drop onto the mat. It was a bit too crazy to be true that he could have that kind of impact on her. But she didn't just drop herself onto her back. Her other leg was quick to close in and soon he was locked between two thick ursine thighs. They gave him a little squeeze, making the man keenly aware they could crush his spine with a little effort. But as Hel was clearly holding back all he walked away with was the sensation of how soft her fur is. She parts her legs and gets down on her knees, putting them at a slightly more even level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready, here comes the bear hug!\" She shouted, opening her arms wide. He grinned, fully expecting a terrible pun to follow up. He stood firm and tried to dodge her hug, but those big arms have a lot of reach. In an instant he finds his whole torso wrapped up in their muscular embrace. Hel lifts him off his feet with ease, pulling him into her chest and letting him stare at her toothy smirk as she gives him a gentle squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof.\" He grunts as even when she tried to go easy on him her strength was still overwhelming. It was unnerving how easily she could crush the air from his lungs, only to back down and let him struggle to catch a breath again. After a few squeezes he manages to slip free an arm. Hel raises a curious eyebrow, surprised he had the dexterity to free his arm. She was even more shocked when he didn't try to fight back but instead put his arm behind her head and pulled it down towards him. She didn't try to fight it, caught off guard by the brave little man. He didn't stop until her big ursine muzzle was close enough for him to plant a cute little kiss on her nose.</span></div></div>",

He was more than a little surprised by her reaction, but judging by her smile this was all part of the game. She let him slide from her arms, stumbling back onto the mat as the polar bear woman regained her footing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mighty blow for someone as scrawny as you.\" She complimented in a goofy tone. \"If you manage to sneak in more of those you might just win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan gave her a hearty laugh in response. With his victory condition set he would show this big brute just how dangerous he could be. He charged towards Hel and lunged at her leg, but she moved it out of the way, leaving the man grasping at thin air and falling flat on his face. He landed with a light thump and tried to get on his feet again as fast as possible. But when he rolled himself around onto his back his eyes widened at the spectacle looming overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel had come down on all fours, her chest hovering over his face. In an instant she brought herself down, careful not to slam her full mass into him all at once. He stood no chance, practically disappearing underneath her as she smothered him with her body. His little wriggles were an absolute delight, but it didn't take long for her to feel something even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was wedged between two breasts fighting to escape the restrictive sports bra Hel was wearing under her shirt. But even in this oppressive hold he would not let her win. It took considerable effort just to twist his head into place, but finally he'd turned it far enough to pop a kiss onto the side of her chest. Hopefully she noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" She yelled theatrically. The polar bear woman recoiled, letting herself tumble onto her back alongside the man. Stephan was nearly carried along in her acrobatics. He quickly got onto his feet to avoid getting smothered like that again. When he saw Hel taking an exaggerated amount of time to get on her feet he seized on the opportunity immediately. She shot him a knowing smile as he leaps up onto her, crawling up to her head and planting another kiss on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... you...\" She said with a haggard voice, pretending to be exhausting from this intense 'fight'. Stephan grinned, struggling to believe she was letting him win so easily. But before he could get too cocky her hands closed in, grabbing him by the waist and lifting him into the air. Hel made it terrifyingly clear just how much stronger she really was by throwing her date to the ropes. The large elastic bands caught him and reversed his momentum with ease, sending him rocketing towards the polar bear woman. She had taken the time to prepare herself for her next move. She squatted down a little and presented her large butt, waiting to feel the little man slam into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan collided with the soft mass with a loud smack. He tried to hold on to it, but his whole world tilted as Hel revealed her next move. She was simply going to sit down, using him as a cushion. Fears of being crushed shot through him, but there was nothing he could do. Hopefully she'd take it easy. In an instant he was buried up to his neck beneath her butt. The polar bear had leaned forward enough to spare him the majority of her bulk, but the pressure was still uncomfortably heavy. Her gym shorts did little to conceal the sheer volume of ass flattening him and he knew there would be only one way out of this. With a pang of reluctance he puckers his lips and plants a kiss on her left asscheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel shot up like she'd been stung by a bee, freeing her date from his third pin in as many minutes. But before Stephan could enjoy his victory he was met with her leg sweeping into his side. It knocked him back down and again he saw her looming over him. This time she crashed down with far less ceremony, seemingly more confident in her ability to play it safe around the fragile little man. The other thing that changed was her position. This time her chest landed somewhere near his feet whilst his face was pinned beneath her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you now!\" She said triumphantly, waiting for him to do what she was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan blushed brightly as he realized that her shorts were the only thing between his face and her pussy. The stretched cloth barely concealed the distinct shape and did nothing to hold back the smell. An overwhelming feminine musk radiated from her nethers. Paired with the strangely damp sensation of her shorts he concluded that either she'd worked up more of a sweat than he thought or his date was getting aroused by this. Granted, all the close encounters with her breasts and butt made it hard for him not to have a tentpole in his shorts too. There'd be no other way out of this. Not that he was looking terribly hard for an alternative anyway. He puckered his lips and planted a big kiss square in the center of her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large paw dug underneath and held the man pinned to the polar bear's body. Hel rolled herself onto her back, letting the little man 'pin' her. But she wanted more. Stephan tried to get up, but the hand shifted to the back of his head, joined by her other hand. She pressed his face down against her crotch, rubbing it a little as she pretended she was about to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not like this. Will the mighty Hel finally meet her match in the ring? I don't think so.\" She exclaimed loudly before bucking her hips and rolling onto her side. She let the little man flop onto the floor and rolled him onto his belly. A large hand pressed down on his back whilst she counted down. After all that Hel still had to assert her dominance in the wrestling ring, easily defeating her opponent. Stephan could only smirk goofily. He didn't expect this to end any other way from the moment he stepped up to face a polar bear woman three times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this date is of to a great start.\" He mused, Hel nodding her head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay miss champion... What's next?\" He gave her a curious look whilst the polar bear woman pondered her options.</span></div></div>",

It might just be the intimate encounters in the ring, but he couldn't wait to spend more time with her. In mere minutes he was back in his regular outfit. Hel didn't bother to change clothes, still smelling quite musty from the exercising she did before meeting up with Stephan. She wouldn't normally leave the gym like this, but the polar bear woman had plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Stephan, I want to get home a little faster than at human walking pace. So if you don't mind...\" He held out a large furred hand. Stephan cautiously grabbed it and was immediately pulled off his feet. She threw the man around her broad shoulders, the shirt and fuzzy padding below proving strangely comfortable. She then started jogging to her place. Though nowhere near her top speed Stephan had to concede this was considerably faster than he could ever hope to manage outside of maybe a short sprint. Though he expected her to turn towards a residential district soon it quickly dawned on him that none of those houses would be able to deal with her size. In hindsight it was probably a good idea he didn't invite her over to his place. As a follow-up he realized all these warehouses could potentially be secret monster housing. He wondered just how many of these buildings were even used as warehouses at all. Before long they arrived at Hel's home. It looked unremarkable on the outside, but the moment he was ushered in it was like night and day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior of Hel's abode looked a lot like an old log cabin. The sturdy wooden walls were densely decorated with all kinds of small paintings and various random items. The warrior spirit theme was strongly present as there were multitudes of weapons among those items too. Axes, shields, swords, all of them far too big for him. Further along the wall some human-sized swords, some of which warped and dented. No doubt trophies from good battles to remember. Centered in the middle of this collection was a beautiful battle axe. Every square centimeter of it was covered in a fine pattern of runes and a sheen of red could be seen near the edges. There was no doubt in his mind this thing had seen a lot of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, impressed?\" She chuckled, watching him stare at the walls. She grabs the battle axe and poses with it. Seeing her wielding it so easily was awe-inspiring, though the fact that she was still in some baggy sports gear somewhat undercut the epicness of the scene. Hel put the weapon back on the wall. She motioned for Stephan to drop his sports bag in the corner.</span></div></div>",

Stephan doesn't show much of a reaction, afraid to offend his date. He silently agreed though, she'd worked up a sweat and stank like a pair of unwashed socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come.\" She motioned for him to follow, causing Stephan to raise a curious eyebrow.

Suddenly she burst into laughter. \"Hah! Don't tell me you're afraid... You've got enough stones to get into a wrestling ring with me, but a shower is too much?\" The polar bear woman kept giggling, tears welling up in her eyes. She motioned for Stephan to follow, undeterred by his hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he managed to scrape together enough words to form a retort. \"Isn't this a little... quick?\" His voice trembled a little. He realized just how utterly ignorant he was to how any of this would work with Hel. Thankfully it seemed like his bumbling was more amusing that offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy, there's monsters out there that would've thrown you on their bed and ripped apart all your clothes by now. On the whole we don't waste that much time before getting to the good stuff. So calm yourself down a bit and get the lead out, I'm not gonna keep waiting for you.\" Her tone was beginning to turn a little impatient, but her words were strangely comforting to the man. It looked like he wouldn't come of as creepy for any of this. He burst into a little sprint to keep up with the polar bear woman as she entered the spacious bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was luxurious in size and carried the same rustic motif the rest of her house had. In the corner was a large showerhead mounted to the wall. Opposite the shower stood an enormous jacuzzi. A sink with cabinet and various other elements were all present, making the whole thing look remarkably similar to a normal bathroom. The only real difference was the scale of it all. It made him feel smaller than ever. Hel marches over to the shower and turns it on. Whilst it's getting up to temperature she takes off her clothes. Stephan did his best not to stare, but she made it a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thick, white fur formed a beautiful flowing landscape, accenting her assets in all the right ways. Every part of her body carried a little bit of pudge, but she was far from fat. He knew that beneath that cuddly appearance lay a core of strength no man could ever hope to match. Having felt just a sliver of her potential he felt in awe just looking at those powerful arms and legs. Of course his gaze couldn't keep away from her hefty bosom. With her restrictive sports bra removed they were free to entice his eyes. Hel giggled a little, breaking his entranced stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? You gonna shower with your clothes on? I'm fairly sure you humans aren't <i>that</i> silly.\" She goaded, making Stephan blush. He quickly undressed, making Hel nod appreciatively. She liked what she was seeing, even if there wasn't a whole lot to see. Compared to the huge white-furred beauty before him Stephan felt almost painfully bland. She didn't share his sentiments as she gave him a sly wink and motioned for him to get closer. When the man was in arm's reach she grabbed his shoulder and pushed him alongside her, walking under the stream of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAaaaahh, that's the stuff.\" She cooed, relaxing under the warm shower. Stephan caught some of it too, but standing next to the gorgeous polar bear woman had him anything but relaxed. The last thing he wanted was to embarrass himself by having a boner right now. But she looked so amazing that it felt nearly impossible not to have any kind of reaction. Hel pays him little attention, washing the grungy sweat from her arms, chest and waist. She sways her hips a little during that last segment, bumping into Stephan. He blushes brightly, making Hel laugh. She reached down and grabbed him with both hands. The ease with which she could just pick him up like a doll was unsettling to the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouted insincerely. \"You really aren't feeling comfortable in this, are you? Well, I know just how to ease you up a little.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hel moves her date around in her hands, cradling him like a small child in just one strong arm. He is held close to her large chest, blushing a little as she pushes him against the soft surface. With her free hand she grabs the bottle of soap and deposits a generous amount of it on his chest. The cold soap sent a shiver down Stephan's spine, but Hel was quick to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there, let mama bear take care of you.\" She cooed, smiling from ear to ear. Stephan pouted a little at being treated like this, but he couldn't deny that it felt great to have her large hands rubbing the soap into his body. She wasn't too thorough, but soon though it became clear she was just playing around. Her hand ventured along his legs, only to return and pause at his groin. He looked up at her, distress in his eyes. The pressure alone was enough to make his manhood react, throbbing a little against her furred hand. There was no way she didn't notice that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? Are you getting turned on by me?\" She said, feigning surprise. Stephan shivered a little as she leaned her head close to his, giving him a small, toothy grin. When her muzzle nearly touched his nose she whispered to him. \"Because I sure am feeling something getting aroused there.\" She paused briefly to make him squirm. \"That makes two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan looked at her with surprise. It was hard to keep it in his pants at the sight of her powerful, naked form. But him? What was so special about him that got her all hot and bothered? She could apparently see the confusion in his eyes, because she kept close, whispering more into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the will to not only chat up a literal bear of a woman over the internet, but to accept a date with her too. And when she suggests you wrestle her, you step into the ring knowing she could tie you in a knot with one hand behind her back. You're tenacious, polite and above all, you really know how to please me. Those little kisses, even when you're flattened beneath me. Do you know how hard I had to resist the urge to take you there and then? But now, it's time I make you feel as good as you've made me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan was shocked. Did those little things really mean that much to her? He didn't have more time to think about it as his mind was soon overloaded with pleasure. Hel slowly rolled his manhood under her large hand, massaging it with as much gentleness as her size and eagerness allowed. His breath caught as he let out a small, whimpering moan. The bear woman smiled, knowing she was on the right track. She could feel the pulsing cock in her hand harden. It grew fully erect and she was ready to take this a step further. The man was almost seeing stars when her felt her pursed lips plant a little kiss on the tip of his dick. But when he felt her warm breath washing over it he became less certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel opened her maw, her hot breath bathing the twitching little cock in warmth. She didn't pay any mind to the worried look on Stephan's face as her teeth came near his manhood. She closed her jaws around it, carefully sealing it in the moist cavern. Her tongue took a quick interest in the musky little pillar, slathering it in drool and making the man's whole body shiver with delight. The size and dexterity of the large muscle let it slither and coil around his shaft in ways he didn't think possible. Whenever the polar bear woman suckled just a little she could feel him ready to blow. Not wanting this to be over too soon she eased off on the relentless stimulation, keeping him on edge for a minute as she enjoyed his increasingly frantic mewling. There wasn't a comprehensible word coming out of him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she pressed his cock against the roof of her mouth, her tongue running up it's length to milk him dry. In mere moments Stephan moaned loudly and bucked his hips, his cock erupting. Strands of cum were launched all around the large maw, Hel eagerly swallowing his little offering. The man in her arms was breathing heavily, his body suddenly releasing all the tension built up within and going limp in her arms. She held him close to her chest, letting him recover for a minute whilst letting the shower clean up the aftermath of the best blowjob of his life. When it looked like Stephan had regained his bearings she gave him a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it as good as it looked?\" She said, failing to hide her pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hel yeah.\" He answered, giggling a little at his cheesy pun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hel wrapped the little man in a one-armed embrace, reaching out to shut off the shower with her free hand. Soon the soaking wet bear woman stepped out, holding on to her date and letting him enjoy her soft, warm body. Stephan sounded a little disappointed when she set him down and went over to the cabinet near the sink. She retrieved a hair dryer from it. It was built to match someone of her stature and the moment she turned it on she gave the little guy a goofy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brace yourself, Stephan.\" She mused, pointing the device at him and unleashing a hurricane wind. The force was tremendous. Stephan could barely stay on his feet as the hot air rushed past him. No part of his body escaped the intense gust as Hel dried him off in mere moments. Just as it looked like his footing might fail him she points the hair dryer to herself. With the sudden rush gone the human almost falls over the other way, no longer needing to compensate for the powerful winds. Now he was left standing there, completely naked, whilst she tended to herself, her wet fur taking considerably more effort to dry. He didn't mind though, it let him admire her size and beauty all the longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel smiled, seeing the little guy in corner of her eye staring dreamily at her. She was ready to make those little daydreams come true, but first she had to finish this job. It was hard to look seductive when dripping wet, doubly so when you have a thick fur coat. A few minutes passed and finally her overpowered hair dryer had completed its task. Every strand of fur on her body stood on end, a subtle crack of static electricity coursing through them. She knew just how to spoil the little man in front of her. Two large paws reached down and picked him up. She then wrapped the man in the softest, warmest and most comfortable plush hug of his life. Her smile doubled in size as she heard him stammer out a little moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe what he felt. It was like hugging a cloud. So unimaginably fuzzy and warm. He ran his hands through her long fur whilst she carried him back into the living room. She offered to make him something to eat, but the man didn't answer. Stephan was too busy picturing his date as the world's biggest plushy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, suit yourself.\" Hel mumbled to herself, walking to the kitchen. She held him close to her chest with a single arm, taking a side of cooked ham out of the fridge. She tore through her little snack with gusto, her powerful jaws unconcerned with any bone that might be present. Not as good as freshly hunted boar or freshly mauled arrogant contenders for the afterlife, but a tasty meal all the same. She returned her attention to her date. By now he'd held on so long she wondered if it was just static cling. But as she set herself down on the couch she finally pulled the little man free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan was beside himself with joy. He'd had some trepidation about this date, but so far things had gone much better than expected. Hel seemed to have a lot of fun too. He cleared his throat before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T... Thank you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. But are you really going to tell me you dated a big 'ol bear like me just because you wanted a hug?\" She said, her smile turning a little creepy. She brought him closer until her muzzle was right next to his ear. She whispered as softly as she could, her melodic voice carrying an almost hypnotizing quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what you really desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan went bright red. He didn't imagine even alluding to this for at least a few more dates, but she seemed so eager to play. He wouldn't let her down now. He swallowed his doubts and with a shaky voice he answered the question.</span></div></div>",

You just can't get enough of this big bear booty, can you?\" She said with a sly grin. Before the man could shamefully admit she was right the warrior spirit was already a step ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that can be arranged.\" She stood up and gave Stephan a good look at her beautifully round and fluffy rear. When he was on the verge of drooling on the couch she turned around and grabbed the couch pillows, laying them out like a small bed. \"Let's make sure you get a bit of extra... cushioning. Wouldn't want to hurt you now, would I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan shook his head, shuffling over to lay down on the pillows and let Hel make his dreams come true. But the polar bear woman wasn't gonna make it that easy for him. She hovered her vast ass over him, teasing him relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh, you've got to earn it, human. Give them a good rub and maybe they'll be tempted to smother you.\" She said playfully. No sooner had she finished talking as she felt two hands against her rear. His gentle touch and smooth hands were a blessing, rubbing every inch of fuzzy asscheek they could reach. After a few minutes of bliss she returned the favor by fulfilling Stephan's wish. Gently she sat down on the man, carefully shifting her weight to not overwhelm him. She took great care, knowing the devastation her size could provide. More than a few contenders had been laid low simply by her crushing them beneath her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan felt in heaven. The warmth, the softness, the comforting weight. It was all there in spades. It felt even better that all the times he was daydreaming about her. Her large butt was wide enough to press down on his whole body. Barely a narrow slit of light was still visible between the furred cheeks and the pillows below him, just enough to keep him breathing and murring happily. He couldn't believe she was actually letting him do this. It seemed so weird and off to ask for something like this on the first date. She'd assured him that monster dates tend to be a little faster, but she'd already given him a blowjob and now this. Whatever he'd done to deserve this, it couldn't have been enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel smirked as she gently sat back. More and more weight was piled on the wiggling little man. Her plan with the pillows worked flawlessly and soon her full mass was bearing down on her date. \"Are you having fun down there?\" She asked with a cheeky giggle. Some muffled words came out from under her rear, but she couldn't make any out. He sounded happy though. \"Would you like me to grind my ass on you, little man?\" She offered. This time only a single word followed. Even muffled she could understand that being a resounding yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shuddered with joy as much as the overbearing mass permitted. The plush cheeks pressed and rolled over him in ways he struggled to describe. He was far too occupied enjoying every moment of them. He could feel his manhood harden again but he vowed not to cum. He wouldn't ruin the freshly washed pristine fur on Hel's ass, not in a million years. He felt her grinding more and more heavily until she finally stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear woman looked down at the result of her efforts and giggled. Stephan had been pressed firmly into the pillows, his face contorted in pure bliss as he barely even reacted to the weight lifting. To nobody's surprise he was rock hard again, but at this stage she felt like it was her turn to experience some pleasure. She grabbed him and sat him up on the couch, leaning down to speak softly in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think it's time this momma bear gets some love?\" She mused. He nodded enthusiastically, but then a concern sprang to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where do I start?\" He said sheepishly. He had no idea what things might please a monster woman like her. Thankfully Hel was ready to help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on your knees in front of me.\" She said, taking a seat on the couch. Stephan gulped. Hopefully he would be able to provide what she desired. It seemed only fair after she did all this for him. He nodded and got on his knees before her. She looked fearsome and confident, his head on the same level as her thighs right now. The polar bear woman parted her legs and instantly it became clear to the man what she wanted. Spread open in front of him was her drooling pussy. He clearly wasn't the only one getting aroused by that bit of buttplay. She scooted forward a little, the damp love tunnel getting closer to him. The overpowering feminine stench punched him in the face, singing his nostrils a little. The smooth surface of the thick lips was an inky black, glistening with arousal already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave me waiting.\" Hel said, half-moaning already at the mere thought of what he might do to please her.</span></div></div>",

She moaned as his lips made contact with her sensitive clit, planting a gentle kiss. His careful approach was endearing, but she'd have to encourage him to try some of the games she had in mind. Thankfully he was already working to provide some more in-depth stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan could tell his date was already happy with the attention she was getting, but he knew her tastes to be bigger than this. He would not let her down. He lowered his face, his nose poking between the soft folds and eliciting a small moan. He made her gasp when he stuck out his tongue, dragging it all the way along the length of her pussy. He could feel her whole body shudder with joy as he completed the short journey, quickly going down to repeat it. Several more licks had the polar bear woman breathing rapidly. She was sitting on the edge and it was time to push her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... hmmm... Stephan... deeper.\" She managed to stammer out between moans. He gave her a subtle nod. On the next lick he pressed his face into her pussy as best he could. His tongue delved new depths until he passed a hole. The entrance to her love tunnel. His mission was clear. He stopped and pushed his tongue in as deep as he could. Most of his face was now mashed into the slimy folds of Hel's pussy. Were she a little larger he might just be able to pop his whole head inside, but that seemed impossible for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel would prove him wrong, putting both hands on the back of his head and pushing him into her snatch with all her might. The pressure made Stephan squirm but with a loud <i>schlop</i> he was shocked to find himself traveling deeper into his date. Only his head would fit but that was more than enough. He licked enthusiastically at all the parts of her sex that were within reach of him. Never before had she experienced such intense pleasure, especially not with a mere human. Where had this curious little guy been all her life? She watched as he put his hands on her inner thighs and began to pull himself free. She saw the opportunity for a game and her pussy took hold of his head as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan realized the inner walls were bearing down on him. This must feel amazing, it's no wonder Hel would seek to prolong it. But he was only human and he still needed air, of which there wasn't much inside her love tunnel. He knew she was probably just playing, but this wasn't a game she could win. He had her most intimate pleasure centers within licking distance. His tongue probed and explored. Once he'd found the spot that drew out the loudest moans he planted a firm kiss on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AaaAAAH\" Hel moaned loudly, an ursine rumble alongside her. She cried out with unabashed joy as she hit a powerful climax. With what few scraps of self-control she had left she put a hand on Stephan's shoulder and pushed, freeing him before he'd drown in her release. With a wet pop he came free, a river of slime following him. His head was utterly soaked in her love juices, but his smile couldn't be wider. That was the single most intense session of eating his date out that she had ever experienced. She dragged him onto the couch and with barely a spoken word they just sat there, coming down from their intense adventure. </span></div></div>",

It was without a doubt the single most intimate thing he'd ever experienced with a woman. To be so utterly enveloped by her womanhood was a fantasy he'd never thought possible. It was so wet and warm and the strange smells just made him want to do it again and again. And the best part of it all was that in spite of their size difference, Hel looked every bit as pleased as he did. This was a rare treat for her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah indeed, little man. That got a little out of control. Sorry if I scared you.\" She said, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared? I loved it!\" Stephan said, half cheering and half soothing his date. It widened the smile on her face. But there was something else to focus on. He let out a yawn and looked up in her big, beautiful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But uhm... It was quite exhausting. I don't know how late it is, but I'm ready to go sleep. Maybe I should be heading back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, you can stay here for the night.\" She retorts, looking over her shoulder to a nearby clock. \"Wow, it is late, I guess we got a little carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yeah.\" He chuckled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on then.\" She got up on her feet and motioned for Stephan to follow. The man shuffled off the couch and onto his feet, following the large polar bear woman. She pushed open a door to reveal her bedroom. Compared to the densely cluttered walls of her living room it was much more spartan. A dresser, a sink with a mirror over it, a few weapons and pieces of armor leaning against a sturdy chair. But the majority of the room was taken up by an enormous bed. It was large even by Hel's standards, probably a model for bigger monsters. But given what she had in mind next it would be perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan let out a short yelp as he was lifted off his feet and thrown onto the soft bed. He tried to be polite, even if he knew Hel had this all planned out already. \"Uhm... Have you got a guest room somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're adorable.\" Hel replied, crawling onto the bed on all fours, hunched down like a hungry predator. In the low light of the bedroom it was almost scary to see her leering at him like this. She flashed him a toothy grin, sending a chill down his spine. He scrabbled backwards a little, but soon she was looming over him ominously. Stephan laughed nervously as a low rumbling growl came from his date. But as sudden as it started she dropped the act and with her usual friendly tone she whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets have a little fun first.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Stephan could even ask what she had in mind, the bear woman wrapped him up in a tight hug, throwing herself onto the bed and only barely making sure she didn't crash her large form right down on top of him. He wheezed as she forced most of the air from his lungs before finally telling him what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you've been aching to get another chance to try and wrestle me into submission. Well, now's your chance. Hold nothing back.\" She said cheerfully. Hel threw him across to the far corner of the bed, getting down on all fours to prepare for his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man slowly regained his bearings. It felt like he'd been tackled by a steamroller and seeing Hel this eager for another bout of wrestling was a bit unsettling. If the intense bear hug was anything to go by, her enthusiasm was boundless. But without any clothes protecting her his 'attacks' would be more effective than ever. He surprised her by charging forward, running as best he could on her bed and throwing himself at her. He swung his arms around her neck and propped himself up just enough to plant a big kiss on her surprised lips. Hel almost forgets to act, but when she does it's not the recoiling in fake pain he expects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead two large paws cover the back of his head and hold him down as she returns the favor. Her tongue shoots out, dancing in his mouth and even dipping itself down his throat briefly. He squirms in the overwhelming passion but soon the invading tongue eases off enough for him to get into it as well. For what feels like an eternity the two kiss passionately. With a wet smack their lips part and Hel shoots him a sultry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A powerful blow, little man, but I'm more than ready to return those now. Show me what you've really got.\" She said in a seductive voice. Her eyes darted down to his groin and back up to meet his. There was only one way for him to be victorious here and they both knew it. He let go of her, landing on his feet and rolling himself forward underneath her. She barely gave him a chance before letting herself flop down onto the bed. With him nowhere close to reaching his goal Stephan's progress was brought to an abrupt halt by the overwhelming wall of bear now smothering him beneath her. He was disoriented, but judging by the warmth and softness encasing his head he hoped it was between her breasts. He resorted to the only thing that would save him here and planted several sloppy kisses on the thick fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Hel cried out, lifting herself up and throwing herself on her back. She watched the little man recover from the brief squashing she gave him and climb up on her belly. With all the grace of an explosion he threw himself towards her crotch. But she wasn't about to let him win that easily. Before he could align his manhood with her pussy the bear woman brought her strong legs together, pinning the man between them. He grunted and squirmed, Hel slowly raising the pressure. She knew what she wanted to feel next, but Stephan wasn't as quick to catch on. Though his cock might not be able to reach her snatch, he could still reach down to it and give her what she desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some more time and squeezing before the penny dropped, but when he realized she wanted his lips on hers he was quick to dart down and give her everything. Hel gasped when he not only pressed a kiss down on her most sensitive region, but slipped his tongue in there too. It immediately brought back the memories of the fun they'd had on the couch not an hour earlier. But this time she would let him do what they've both been dreaming off since they started talking on Monstr. Her legs parted, releasing their dominant hold on him and letting him finally crawl up enough to stick it in. Stephan gasped, barely able to parse just how amazing it felt. Their size difference seemed non-existent as she moaned loudly, her pussy eagerly taking in his full length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel bucked and squirmed, both hands holding down the little man and making sure he was never anything other than balls deep inside of her. She could feel every excited throb from his manhood and her inner walls responded by bearing down on the little guy with all the fervor she could muster. Not a legible word could escape either of these lovers as they fucked like there was no tomorrow. Finally, with a crying moan, Stephan came, shooting a volley of his seed into Hel's depths. She let out a deafening roar, her rush of release smothering his completely and soaking his groin in pungent sexual fluids. Finally the intense motion came to an end, the man laying draped on top of her as the bear woman relaxed. Neither of them spoke until finally she broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable... You beat me...\" She said, smirking from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, we both won.\" Stephan replied, his smile just as wide.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So tell me, little man... How did it feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...\" Stephan stammered, raising a curious eyebrow on the bear woman. \"I lack the words to properly tell you how amazing that was. All I can say is that I hope to be lucky enough to ever experience it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's so sweet. But luck won't be a factor here, little man.\" She coos lovingly, before adding to it with a mischievous tone. \"It will be a matter of endurance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan was about to compliment her when his words were scrambled into a surprised \"whoah.\" Two large hands took hold of his ass, playfully squeezing his little cheeks before dragging him back to where he was. His manhood was only semi-erect, but the moment it was dragged along her pussy it slipped in and within moments he was back to full mast. Either he underestimated his eagerness or her musk has some extra properties to it. He didn't care. It was time for round two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel bucked her hips a little, as though she hadn't fully engulfed his cock yet the moment he stuck it in. Her date held on as best he could whilst she moaned for more. It took longer the second time around. Stephan was deliberately trying to avoid ending the action now, but against the sexual onslaught surrounding his dick there was only so much that could be done. Hel claimed his second orgasm after a few minutes of steamy sex, letting out a victorious roar before devolving into more moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't even get to pull his member from her love tunnel now, her firm hold on his rear keeping him down. He didn't mind that much, it felt really nice to have it surrounded by those warm, slick walls. Though it did make him wonder how much more Hel wanted from him. He could go for a round three or four, but after that he wasn't sure. Even with her doing the bulk of the work he could feel fatigue setting in and his balls could only produce so much before he'd have nothing left to orgasm with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mere minutes of downtime Hel began to buck again, her pussy greedily squeezing and pulling on his manhood. The amount of movement he felt around his cock was impressive. Even without him able to move she could elicit a powerful response. He was rock hard again and she moaned as his shaft pushed in all the right places. As a reward she upped the stimulation to even more excessive levels, making him scream out in pleasure as she milks him of another orgasm at record speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, let's switch it up a bit.\" She murmured, surprised by how quickly that went. Her hands let go of his butt, finally leaving those thoroughly kneaded buns alone. Instead she wraps her arms around him and holds him to her belly as she flips herself around. Hel took care not to just roll over and squash the man, releasing him so she could catch herself, but now he was on his back on the bed with the bear woman on all fours looming over him. His fears get amplified when she sits up, towering over him as she straddles his much smaller body. Her looming pussy hung over his groin. It was very clear she wanted to be on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I'm not sure how much of that I can handle.\" Stephan stammered. Ever since he started texting with Hel through Monstr there'd been little moments that sent a pang of fear down his spine. The videos of her casually crushing cars with her bare hands, the invitation to wrestle her at the gym. The strength with which she threw him around the ring and even her pussy able to engulf his whole head for a moment. But none of them gave him a sense of dread like seeing her prepare to bounce those enormous hips on his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, I'll be gentle.\" She mutters, leaning in and patting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, this fear of impeding doom did nothing to stop his cock from standing up straight, hard as ever. Or did the risks attached cause this boner? Stephan was not given time to think as she slowly descended herself onto him. Hel went calmly at first, but once his tip had entered her she let herself drop, swallowing up his manhood in a single quick squelch. Stephan let out a strained \"oof!\" as her weight crashed down on him, but it proved surprisingly bearable. What came next was a lot harder to deal with. She began to bounce, lifting herself up a little only to let gravity bring her down again. Each hump was a little closer to painful than the last until Stephan was wincing with each bounce. Mercifully she sounded like she was on the edge so with all his remaining strength he bucked forward as she came down and drove himself in as deep as physically possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncing stopped as Hel let out another earsplitting moan, flooding his groin with her juices. She closed her eyes, absorbing every sensation of this amazing moment. The little shaft inside her, belonging to a man brave enough to let her do all of this. She'd always dreamed of finding one, but many didn't have the strength or the willpower to see it through. She felt his body twitch beneath her, his own surge of pleasure no doubt. This date had been greater than she'd ever hoped for. Her heart was pounding in her chest, it's feverish pace slowly returning to something sensible and as a calmness washed over her she looked down at Stephan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're all tuckered out. Well, I suppose four isn't a bad start.\" She mused, giving him a toothy smile. He just raised a wobbly arm and gave her a thumbs up. Even if he was too exhausted to show it, he enjoyed the night so far greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we keep meeting I'll train you up and you'll be able to handle a dozen each night.\" She said it jokingly, but in her mind it was a very reachable goal. He offered a wry smile, hoping only that she had sated her desires enough to not try and squeeze another orgasm out of him. Stephan was spent. Enduring the bear woman bouncing on top of him had taken the last of his stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you've given it your all. Rest now, little man. You've earned it.\" She spoke with a voice of authority, Stephan just rolled his eyes, already half asleep before she'd even finished talking. But she wasn't just gonna sit there. She got comfortable, laying down beside him and holding him close to her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stephan smirked a little. He didn't think this would be how their first date was going to turn out. Held in the arms of a sleeping warrior spirit like some kind of reverse teddy bear. And after everything that preceded it too. It felt like sex on the first night was something common among monsters. She'd been so nonchalant about it all, even if he was hesitant. In a way he kind of liked it. It felt freeing not to go through some elaborate social dance when they both wanted what was at the end of that road. All that mattered was how they made eachother happy. And going by her pleasant humming in her sleep, Hel was one very happy woman. He closed his eyes and prepared to dream of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rustling of cloth barely registered before the man felt his world shift. Hel had rolled onto her belly and he found himself trapped between the soft mattress and her soft body. It was strangely pleasant, though her weight was more than a little overbearing. It made it difficult for him to move at all. Hel didn't help either by tightening her grip on him whenever she thought he was trying to squirm away. Eventually he resigned himself to sleeping beneath her, trying to get some rest himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning broke and Hel sat up with a loud yawn. She looked over her shoulder to see the aftermath of what had happened last night. The little man, laid flat on his back. He was motionless, but stirred to life after she poked him a few times. She laughed as he groaned, batting away her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you to, Stephan.\" She mused, leaning in to wake him in a more pleasant way. Her lips found their way to his and with a big smooch she helped him open his eyes and smile. He squirmed a little under this sudden slobbery assault but when he realized what was happening he leaned into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stretched a little as he got up, a dull pain echoing through his body. It was fiercest near his groin and legs, where the polar bear woman had been bouncing last night. Hopefully she didn't intend to repeat that right now. \"Ow...\" He lamented as he straightened his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, still sore from last night?\" She chuckled. Humans were so very frail and maybe she'd gone a little overboard last night. But that smile didn't lie. She knew he'd be up for more in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little, but worth it.\" He replied, confirming her suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have something for that. Come, let's get some breakfast.\" She commented dryly, hoisting herself on her feet and leaving the bedroom. Stephan groggily followed her, slipping into his clothes first. When he finally joined her in the kitchen she was preparing some kind of herbal drink. It was steeping in boiling water and after a few more plants were added, none of which he recognized, she presented him with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite foul, but it aids with recovery.\" She said, he took a small sip and struggled not to spit it out immediately. The powerful acidic, grassy taste was unpleasant. He fought through and swallowed. She seemed to expect him to down it all. He hadn't disappointed her yet and that wasn't about to start now. With strained gulps he worked his way through it, his face unable to hide his disgust. The strange tincture made him feel funny. An unusual buzz resonating through his body. He drank the last of it and handed her back the cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleh, you weren't kidding.\" He said with a strained grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but you'll be needing it if you plan on having more dates with me. Because I'm sure as hell not gonna wait a month for you to recover after every night of passion with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I suppose asking if there's room for more dating is a little superfluous at this stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephan, if it were up to me then you and I would be seeing eachother every day at the gym. I'll help you gain the strength and stamina needed to go all night long. And when we're done with that we'll make love in the locker room. And every weekend we will drive eachother wild with passion in the bedroom.\" Hel said, beaming with joy. He gave her a broad smile in return, but some doubts were beginning to show in the back of his head. Was he really going to be able to endure all this? His whole body ached after just one night with her and now she wants to make that a weekly thing along with no doubt intense training every weekday. But at the same time last night had been the most incredible night of his life.</span></div></div>",

Certainly not the kind of journey he'd usually go for, but at the same time he found it hard to reject her offer. As a matter of fact, he just spawned an idea of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think I could do you one better.\" He muses aloud, making Hel raise a curious eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're going to be spending so much time together, why don't I move in with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. I hadn't even thought of that yet. But if you're going to be living with me in my house, you'll be following my rules. They're really easy. Rule #1, if momma bear wants some loving, she gets some loving. Rule #2, people who break rule #1 get disciplined in the bedroom.\" Hel's voice thunders with authority. It made Stephan gulp a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do still have to work and all that, and so do you I presume. This place is about as far from my job as my current home, so that's not a problem. But I can't just drop what I'm doing and get back home whenever you're feeling frisky.\" He stammers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel lets out an insincere sigh of disappointment. \"Ugh, fine, I guess that can be the exception. But if the first thing you do when you get home isn't running over to hug me I will punish you.\" She replies, flexing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I guess I gotta find a way to get all my things here then, I've got a buddy with a van, I suppose he would probably not scream and run if he saw you, but~\" Hel stopped him with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a friend that can cast portal magic.\" She grins smugly, seeing the man roll his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do...\" He sighs wearily. Something told him he was going to learn a lot about monster life and that he probably wouldn't be ready for most of it. But there was no use second-guessing himself now. If he's brave enough to face a large polar bear woman in both the wrestling ring and the bedroom he could handle whatever their life might throw at them next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been a week and Stephan marveled at how quickly he'd gotten used to his new daily routine. He'd wake up, take a shower with Hel, maybe get a little fun in there too. Then some breakfast and off to work. All the strength and endurance training they did together made it a lot easier to finish work without even feeling all that worn. He'd throw himself at her when he got back and from there they filled the rest of the day with training, love or relaxation. The polar bear woman's initially suggested strict roster proved far more malleable than he thought and promises of hugs, kisses and other intimacies were often enough to make those plans change. With him around more often she would go a little easier at night, making sure he didn't feel quite so steamrolled in the morning. Though she still delighted in making sure he wouldn't forget how much stronger she was. Friendly bearhugs, wrestling, all that good stuff. Things were looking to settle down in his new life when Hel mentions something unexpected.</span></div></div>",

He hung up his jacket, dropped his pack and ran over to her, leaping into her arms. She hoisted him up, wrapping him into a firm embrace. His head was pressed against her chest and he let out a long sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I needed that.\" He mused, making the bear woman giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cooed softly in his ear, whispering sweet nothings as she felt his body relax in her arms. It didn't matter how worn he was from work, she would always made his worries melt away like snow in the springtime sun. But she had more on her mind today than just cuddling with her boyfriend. And he seemed to be aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how've you been?\" He asks innocuously, hoping he wouldn't need to pry further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done a bit of working out, not much going on really. But Stephan, I was wondering something...\" She smiled naughtily at him. \"Would you be opposed to a threesome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis comfortable squirming in her arms came to a sudden halt as he craned his neck to look her in the eye. Was she joking around or did he just really hear her say that? The bear woman seemed surprised by his sudden reaction, but was quick to piece together what might be wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess it's less casual among humans. Basically I've got a friend who's very eager to meet a human like you. You know, the kind that doesn't scream and run for the hills when faced with a warrior like myself? And well, let's just say she'd like to do a little more than just say hi. I'm completely fine with it, but I figure you might want a moment to~\" Hel didn't get to finish her sentence before Stephan had a reply ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of monster is this friend of yours? I mean, it's cute that she's interested and stuff, but I don't want to sign up to something that'll get me hurt. No offense to her.\" He stammered nervously. The warm embrace around him shook as Hel burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha. It's okay, Stephan. I'd never let anyone near you if I thought they'd hurt you. Inge is a warrior spirit just like me. I mentioned you to her and she seemed really curious. So, big man, you think you can handle two bears in the bedroom?\" She smirked at him, but a sudden thought popped into the back of Stephan's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a trick? A test of some kind to see if I'm faithful?\" He asked, smiling nervously. Hopefully his eager response earlier wasn't about to get him into trouble. But mercifully Hel just laughed again, so hard this time that she was unable to form a coherent reply for a while. Finally she scraped herself back together to respond in earnest <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Stephan, you're adorable. No, this is just me wanting to know if you would mind a threesome with two warrior spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take the man long to answer.</span></div></div>",

And frankly, he still wasn't quite sure he'd be up to the task to satisfy two polar bear women. But it sounded like an adventure too good to pass up. Hel gave him a broad smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, she'll be delighted to hear the good news.\" She mused. He was a little surprised to see her make no further effort to inform her friend at all. Catching on to his puzzled expression, she grinned. \"I'm sure she'll be here in about an hour or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you were just gonna go ahead with it anyway, no matter what?\" Stephan said, sounding alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? No, no, not like that. She was gonna come visit already. I wanted you to meet her. The threesome bit is something that just came to mind. Just wait until she hears the good news too.\" She chuckled, imagining the excited reaction already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan and Hel kept cuddling together, watching some TV until finally the doorbell rang. He hopped up from her embrace to go and get it. The huge front door was heavy, but not impossible for him to handle. With a bit of grit and elbow grease he pushed it open to reveal Inge. She stood tall and mighty like Hel did, but there were a few tell-tale differences. For one she seemed less concerned with the gym, looking a little less muscular than his girlfriend. But she was no less intimidatingly tall, Stephan having to crane his neck to meet her eye. More impressive was that her slightly wider frame boasted an ass that put even Hel to shame. He blushed brightly, worried he'd been staring at it, but neither of the warrior spirits seemed to notice. To distract he reaches up and introduces himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, my name is Stephan. I'm Hel's new boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInge seemed surprised by his forwardness, reaching down and awkwardly shaking his hand. \"I... uh... Inge... Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped aside to let her enter and closed the door behind her. Inge joined Hel on the couch in the living room, leaning over to whisper in her ear. Stephan was close enough to hear it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygod, he's so <i>cute</i>.\" She squealed, her voice high-pitched with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I told you.\" She mutters back before directing her attention to the human again. \"Come here, Stephan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly paced up to them and Hel hoisted him up into a comfortable hug. Inge seemed nervous at first, but seeing her friend be so casual around the weird little man put her at ease. Stephan tried to encourage her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, This is probably a little weird. But I'm not afraid of you. Well, maybe a little, you are still so big and strong. But you're all so kind and sweet.\" He stumbled over his words, strangely making Inge feel more comfortable knowing she's not the only nervous one in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C... Can I hold him? I promise I'll be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Hel and Stephan said in unison, snickering a little while she released him from her embrace, letting him take a few shaky steps over to the other polar bear woman and entering a similar world of comfort. Inge's fur was even softer than Hel's against all odds. Her hug was a little tighter, not being quite as accustomed to handling his small frame, but overall he loved the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Inge, I popped the question to him and you won't believe it, but he said yes.\" Hel mused with a seductive tone. Immediately the hug doubled in ferocity as her friend bounced up and down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Woohoo! Awesome.\" She cheered, squeezing Stephan into her chest. She pulled him away from her embrace and sized him up, giving him a dreamy stare he didn't expect to happen until much later in the day. Hel gave him a knowing smile and leaned in to whisper into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you should know, this man has a taste for ass.\" She gave him a toothy grin, both Stephan and Inge blushing brightly at the suggestion given. But he was quick to throw up his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I best give him what he wants then, shouldn't I?\" Inge replied, standing up and setting the little man down in the crater formed by her butt in the couch. Stephan struggled to produce a legible word as he was given a good look at Inge's rear. It was enormous, beating Hel's backside with a handsome margin. Hopefully all that added mass wouldn't cause trouble because he couldn't wait to get his hands on it. Inge swayed from side to side, leaning in closer every second until the soft fur brushed his nose. Hel looked on with a smile from ear to ear. The silly awestruck look on Stephan's face was so precious. Hopefully he was prepared for what would come next.</span></div></div>",

He pushed like he feared for his life, but the giggles coming from down there suggested he was just fooling around. She could only imagine what it must look like from his perspective. The inevitable descent of the huge white-furred wall coming down to dominate him. She finally sat down fully, smothering him completely under her hefty rear. It didn't stop him from trying to resist, squirming and wiggling madly. Though for all his efforts, he didn't seem to actually be going anywhere. Was he just that puny or did he only wiggle about down there for her entertainment? Whichever it was, the polar bear was a big fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he squirms so much under there.\" She commented to Hel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a gentleman like that, always making sure everyone's having fun.\" Hel gave a small laugh, looking at the huge smile on Inge's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure he can handle this?\" She asked, still uncertain about the issues her size might cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I've put him through far worse.\" Hel put a comforting hand on Inge's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we wouldn't want him to think we're going easy on him, right?\" She gave her friend a sly grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan couldn't make out a word of what was being said up there. All he knew was that the immense avalanche of asscheek was smothering him into the couch. The warmth was intense, the weight even more so. Inge was a fair bit heavier, or at least her butt was. But his time with Hel had prepared him for this. He was determined to keep squirming as much as possible. It was going well until it felt like the immense ass doubled in weight. Inge was leaning back, putting more of herself on top of him. The pressure was immobilizing, verging on the painful. But mercifully it was not lasting. It was merely a precursor to Inge getting back up, allowing some light to reach him and for Hel to burst into giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInge's ass had made a sizeable crater and in the middle of it was the puny man, laid out like a cartoon. He was smiling broadly, happy to see his girlfriend again. She pulled him from the couch, chuckling as he almost felt glued to the leathery surface. But instead of wrapping him into a hug or some other gesture of comfort she set him down on the couch. Both polar bears now stood up and towered before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" He stammered before they put whatever plan they'd discussed into motion. Both of them got back on the couch, sitting on each side of him. Next they suddenly turned away from him, leaving the man to stare at their backs and more importantly, their ass. They even leaned forward a little to let him get a better look. But before he could admire those big butts like they deserved the two polar bears pushed themselves towards eachother. He was permitted no more than a happy \"Wow.\" before they came together, enveloping him in softness. In an instant things went dark for Stephan, surrounded by soft fur as Inge and Hel sandwiched him between their butts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right, he does love it twice as much.\" Inge joked, feeling the happy little squirms from Stephan against her backside again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, we're really spoiling him.\" Her friend replied. The two ground their butts against eachother, squeezing and rolling the trapped man between them. He had nothing to say about what was going on, but those cute wiggles didn't lie. He was enjoying this every bit as much as they were. So much so that Inge suddenly realized she felt something strange happening in there. Stephan's front was pressed into her and around his loins she could feel a distinct warmth along with something... poking her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, he's getting turned on by this.\" She said, surprised and amused by the turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. There's nothing that gets him going more than playing with some big bear butts.\" Hel giggled, putting a bit more pressure on the little man by way of 'punishment'. Only after what felt like an eternity of the two bears having him at their mercy did Stephan finally get another glimpse of light. He fell to his knees, rubbed and squeezed sore by the two polar bear women. His smile couldn't be wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, look at the state of him. I hope we didn't wear him out too much. We've not even gotten to the fun part yet.\" Inge lamented, but Hel knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry, he'll be just fine when the time comes.\" She grabbed him and slipped the man underneath her, burying him up to his neck under herself again. His head was allowed freedom as the two bears watched some tv, taking turns to sit on the man. He just complimented their lovely behinds, chatting casually with them as though the weight on his back wasn't even there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time flew as Stephan was steadily squashed into the couch whilst calmly chatting with the two bears. He came to learn a bit more about their jobs too. Turns out that in spite of her less well-trained look Inge is every bit as fierce of a warrior when she needs to be. The stories of fighters underestimating her only to be taught a painful lesson were numerous. Apparently it wasn't common practice, but she made a meal out of many of them. \"How else do you think all this happened?\" She joked, patting her belly. She even talked about crushing them into submission with her ass. Stephan could hardly believe it, lying underneath that magnificent heavy butt. Who would protest something as nice as that? Inge blushed brightly at his compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel looked over at the clock and back to Inge and Stephan. \"You know, I think it's high time we take this little adventure to the bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInge nods and stands up, peeling the man off the couch and cradling him in her arms. Hel didn't mind, simply chuckling at the cute gesture. The three of them entered the bedroom and Inge immediately threw herself onto the bed. Stephan found himself encased between her pillowy chest and the soft mattress. He murmured with delight, but any noise he made was muffled beneath the rustling of two large bear bodies onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan let out a small gasp as those huge, smothering tits finally left him. His training with Hel included holding his breath and it didn't take a psychic to see he would need it tonight. Laid out in front of him was Inge. Every curvaceous inch of her body was covered in soft fur. It was hard for him not to immediately leap into her embrace. But there was another contender for his eager attention. He looked behind him to see Hel almost mirroring the other bear's position. Her more athletic figure looked enticing, but before he could make a move she asked him with a voice sweet as honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want to start? Me or her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he didn't want to sound cocky, Stephan could only think of one appropriate answer. \"Come now, don't be shy. Let's have both of you at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel and Inge exchanged a glance. They knew how to overwhelm this bold request in just the right way. With a quick shuffle they closed in on him, their thick arms guiding the man a few steps north until he was stood between their heads. Stephan giggled as they closed in and gave him some gentle kisses. This soon grew into longer and deeper kisses, the man frequently turning to ensure both bears would get an even share of his attention. But when Inge reared back a little for her next smooch he could tell something was up. She closed in again and suddenly opened her big maw wide. At the same time the hairs on his neck stood straight up as Hel's hot breath washed over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time for him to react as Stephan found himself in the middle of one huge kiss. He shuddered as he felt a stray tooth rub along his neck as the two bear women locked lips with eachother, catching the man in the middle. Both Hel and Inge assailed him with their tongues. They lapped and slobbered like he was a living lollipop, eager drench him in saliva and take in all the subtle notes of his flavour. Inge didn't usually eat people outside of work, but this one made it really damn tempting. The intimate kiss seemed to go on for an eternity, Stephan again thanking his lucky stars for his increased stamina. Finally they parted with a soggy, wet smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You suuuuure you wanna handle two of us at once?\" Hel cooed teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed the worst of the saliva from his face and gave her a smile. \"I didn't train for nothing.\" He added, the bears loving his bravado. They shuffled closer to eachother, shrinking the gap until it was nearly impossible for Stephan to move. Their bellies were a strange mix of sensations. Inge's soft pudgy mass was a stark contrast to Hel's hardened abs. They tried to undermine his footing to smother them man completely between their bodies, but Stephan proved to be a worthy contender in their little game. Soon the three of them were panting with excitement, taking a quick minute to recharge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you'd be able to keep up. Impressive, for a human.\" Inge commented with a naughty grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, couldn't have done it without Hel.\" He replied, rubbing her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope she's trained you well for the next part, because I think it's about time you get to work.\" Inge teased.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The polar bear woman sat herself down in front of Stephan, her belly jiggling a little as she did. She leaned in close and whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel about deep-throating?\" Her voice was dripping with lust. He was almost surprised she was still asking him instead of just doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like sticking your tongue down my throat?\" He gulped a little, trying to imagine that thick slobbery muscle going down his gullet. She could probably almost reach his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" She giggled. \"I mean sticking you down my throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan's eyes shot wide open. Did she just ask if she could eat him? Inge was quick to catch on to his fear and gasped a little, realizing what he must be imagining. \"Oh no, not like that. I mean Hel holding your legs and you going down my gullet. Don't worry, you won't see the inside of this belly unless you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wasn't sure which part was weirder. Her idea of deep-throating or the open invitation to go into her stomach. But he had to admit, the former did sound like a bit of kinky fun. He looked over to Hel, who seemed to be on board as well. With a quick nod of approval the bears sprung into action. His world turned upside down as his girlfriend grabbed him by his ankles and dangled him between the two. They exchanged a sly glance. From his new viewpoint the man got a generous look at Inge's breasts. They looked impossibly soft and plush. They also looked to be getting closer fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft <i>bwoompf</i> Inge and Hel buried the man's torso between their chests. He squirmed and wriggled in such delightful ways. Inge couldn't wait to feel those squirms inside of her. After a little more mammary massaging they parted the gates of that fluffy heaven and held him a little higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, whose got the best tits?\" Hel said teasingly. Even with his brain overwhelmed with desire Stephan knew he should probably pick his words carefully. He gave her a wicked grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not answering that. Because frankly making me choose between you two is just plain evil.\" He stated flatly. Both bear women giggled at his response. It was hard to argue with his position. Inge laid herself down in Hel's lap, shuffling onto her back and opening her maw wide. Only now did it really sink in with Stephan what he'd signed up for. The pink cavern was lined with rows of fearsome teeth, off-white spikes that could rend a man apart in seconds. And at the back was a gullet eager to swallow him whole. He was given a second to ponder which fate would be worse, chewed up of swallowed alive and enduring the stomach. He let out a small yelp as Hel suddenly accelerated his descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head dropped into her maw and stale breath was the first to enter his senses. Next was the sounds of her heavy breathing. Already the whisper of a moan could be heard in there. Lastly he forced his eyes open and watched the undulating flesh ahead. Why the hell did he say yes to this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small splat echoed in the damp cavern as his face made contact with the ravenous hole. It opened wide and Inge leaned forward a little bit to take in Stephan's entire head. Hel carefully lowered him as her friend gulped loudly, sending more and more of him down her throat. She could feel her neck bulge a little as the scrawny man filled it. Her practiced breathing remained steady as she enjoyed every second of this amazing sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan felt the greedy insides of Inge's esophagus take hold of him. Every muscle in the long tube tried to force him in deeper. Were it not for Hel's strength he'd be rocketing down into that stomach by now. Hopefully this wasn't some sort of trick. Though knowing his girlfriend, this wouldn't be the kind of prank she'd pull. In a way, the squeezing walls felt kind of nice. Like a really weird, wet full-body hug. And he wasn't alone in enjoying it. Between the slightly strained breaths he could hear Inge moaning. Or well, it sounded like one would expect a moan to sound with a full throat. And he couldn't deny that it felt great for him too. The warm, saliva-slickened walls had his manhood rising up fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel's grip was tight on his legs and soon her arms bumped into the edge of Inge's snout. This was as deep as her cute little boyfriend would go. At least for now. Her friend shot her a tempting look, almost daring her to let go of the man. But Stephan trusted her to be his way out of that ravenous gullet.</span></div></div>",

Physically, the two looked nothing alike - Sam looked like a Jock, and Carl looked like a Nerd. But, D&amp;D had fostered a friendship that would be hard to break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where and when?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl chuckled. \"If you're interested, I'll pick you up Saturday, at 8 in the morning, and take you there. Bring you back Sunday, at 5 in the afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a Marathon game,\" said Sam. \"Any girls playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl grinned. \"A few of them. Although I will say this, this group's version of D&amp;D would make Matt Mercer and those other D&amp;D guys jealous, especially the special effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Sam. \"Count me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Sam was waiting, with an overnight bag. He watched as Carl pulled into the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got your stuff?\" Carl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change of clothes, and my books,\" said Sam. \"We are playing 5th Edition, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less,\" said Carl. \"Although you probably won't be able to use any magic-users.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A No-Magic campaign?\" Sam asked, throwing his bag into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl grinned. \"Quite the opposite. In this guy's campaign, your character's based off of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you got the wizard role?\" Sam asked, sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl chuckled. \"Dexterity-based rogue.

Then he sighed as he recalled the reason Carl always drove - Carl was the one who had a license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl slapped his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"This is a good group. They don't pull shit like Tommy's group did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me,\" said Sam. \"I'd rather never touching the dice than to play with them again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guy wasn't the one they robbed and threw into a hole, just because of their race,\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but my guy objected to it, and was killed for it,\" said Sam. \"The Assassin stabbed me in my sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this group's different,\" said Carl. \"We all help each other out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Sam said. \"Guess one game won't hurt. But, if I don't like it, I'd like to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let Zorzar know,\" said Carl. \"He's a good DM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam followed his friend, as Carl went into the house. First thing he saw was a human-sized dragon, with a sheet of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mrs. Slirzim,\" said Carl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you,\" the dragoness said. \"Is this a friend of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is,\" said Carl. \"Everyone else here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down in the basement,\" said Mrs. Slirzim. \"Mind taking these cookies down? The steaks will be along in about half an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Carl said, as he took the sheet. \"Sugar cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bought the mix from that Walmart place,\" said Mrs. Slirzim. \"Hopefully it should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl picked one up, and bit into it. \"Slightly burnt, but it's not bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want your steak cooked, right?\" the dragoness asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and my friend would like his cooked as well,\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get on it.\" The dragoness went back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooked steak?\" Sam asked. \"Why did you have to tell her that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of these people like their steak to be <i>extra</i> - rare,\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, steak for a game?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cut into pieces you can pick up with your fingers, and just put into your mouth,\" said Carl. \"No fork or knife needed, and you can still roll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, steak?\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These sessions will cause you to burn more than a few calories,\" said Carl. \"You'll need every bite.\" He walked up to a door, and opened it. \"Come on! You're going to have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, Carl and Sam were down in the basement, and Sam saw the other players. Sitting at the head of a table was another human-sized dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zorzar,\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Carl,\" said the dragon. \"How's my mom's cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than her last batch at any rate,\" said Carl. \"Little less flame, and it might be right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any milk to wash them down?\" a minotaur, with a female voice, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought water for that,\" said Carl. \"Thanks for the offer though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked at Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl chuckled. \"The last batch of cookies was charcoal. Needed something to wash them down with. By the way, this is Butterfly. Butterfly, this is Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur chuckled. \"Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked, and saw a lion-like guy, a goat-like woman, some crow-like person. There was a cat-like woman, some sort of fish-dude, an orc-looking fella, some sort of elf-like person, an elephant person. There was a lizard-person, and human-like person with green skin and long pointy ears, with multiple earring piercings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl pointed them out. \"Huntor, Clip-Clop, Clicky, Pouncer, Shuom, Ripsnout, Clover, Kel, Usk, and Kalo. Of course, easier to think of them in D&amp;D and other such terms where their respective races are concerned - Leonin, Satyr, Kenku, although he can actually talk and not mimic voices, Tabaxi, Triton, Orc, Drow, Loxodon, Lizardfolk, and Verdan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Verdan?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More fitting than one of the Gith subraces,\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalo chuckled. \"I like the idea of using earrings to pin my ears together to keep them from flapping in the wind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sam said. He then sat down at one of the open chairs. \"So, any special rules for stat creation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorzar chuckled, and looked at Carl. \"What have you told him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told him that the character's based off of himself,\" said Carl. \"That, and you use very good Special Effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one way of putting it,\" said Pouncer. \"Better than the miniatures you guys seem to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start the session,\" said Huntor. \"He can find out first-hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Zorzar. He got out what looked to be character sheets. \"Take yours and pass them around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched as the table turned into a forested landscape, and as each person accepted their sheet, a character that resembled them appeared on the table. He also noticed that each person that had accepted their sheets seemed to go into a trance. Eventually, Carl turned to pass him a blank sheet, and Sam looked at his friend - it was if the lights were on, but no one was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked at the table. The party looked like they were waiting for someone. He looked at Zorzar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you playing?\" the dragon asked. \"It's perfectly safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gulped nervously, and carefully took the sheet from Carl, ready to drop it if need be. To his amazement, the paper lit up, and filled itself out, and he found himself in a forest, wearing armor, carrying weapons and supplies. He looked over, and saw Carl, who looked a lot like the typical rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time was a shock for me too,\" he said. He walked over to his friend, flipped his right hand, palm up, and whistled. \"Nice stats by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked at his wrist, and saw his character stats - high constitution, strength, good dexterity, and mental stats, as well as his various abilities. More importantly, he found out that he was a - </span></div></div>",

He was wearing Full Plate Armor, which ruled out Ranger and Rogue, as well as Barbarian, and he had a longbow, a longsword, and a shield, which was plain with no obvious Holy symbols, ruling out a Paladin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A longbow, in addition to a longsword and shield?\" he asked. \"Thought that a strength-based fighter used javelins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl chuckled. \"Normally, but as you can see, your Dexterity is fairly good. Also, you got the Archery Fighting Style. Makes up for the dexterity compared to your strength difference. Also, guess the sheet took into account that you had done some Martial Arts stuff. You've got Tavern Brawler. A d4 for those punches and kicks as opposed to the normal 1 + strength Mod. You also got Athletics and Acrobatics for being an Athlete, Nature as your Human skill, as well as Intimidation and Survival. Not too shabby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, intimidating?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be scary when you're protecting those you care about,\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grinned at the memory of when he first encountered Carl, and drove off the bullies that had been bothering him. \"I remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly, you lack the Charisma to be a Paladin, but at least you have no negative modifiers,\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good,\" said Sam. \"So, how does all of this work? I mean, how do I Roll for Initiative and other such things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a quick Demo?\" Carl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well,\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl grinned. \"Think that you can take on a Barbarian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked over at the orc, Ripsnout. \"Would that be him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl chuckled. \"He's the Wizard.\" Carl pointed at the cat-lady. \"Pouncer's the Barbarian.\" He waved her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the issue?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam noticed that she wore very little in the way of clothing, and figured that both her Constitution and Dexterity must be very high, in order for her to be confident enough to not bother wearing <i>any</i> armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend needs a sparring session to warm up,\" said Carl. \"Want to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer grinned, her teeth being revealed. \"Sure.\" She looked at Sam. \"So, other than not killing your guy, any restrictions? No Magic Weapons? No Magic? No Innate Racial Abilities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt an actual foe would be fair to me, so let's just say, No-Holds-Barred,\" said Sam. \"Hit me with everything you've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer looked at Carl. \"This might be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's make it somewhat fair and have him roll for his four items first,\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Items?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zorzar gives us a magic item every two levels, and one for starting out,\" said Carl. \"Since we, and you, are level 6, that's four items.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that work?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's no limit to Attuned Items for one,\" said Carl. \"As for the other, imagine that you have a regular d10 as well as the d10 percentile in your left hand, shake it a little bit, and toss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam imagined he had the dice, shook his hand - to his surprise, he heard then clanking together - and tossed them, getting a 29 to appear in front of him. That was when his bracers changed, and he saw arrows appear as part of the design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bracers of Archery,\" said Carl. \"Nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had to grin. \"Better archer I guess.\" He rolled the dice again, and his armor became decorated with fish and shells. \"Mainer's armor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a third swimmer,\" said Usk, as the lizard person came over. \"What's the next item?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rolled again, and his armor had a strange sheen to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he fudging his rolls?\" Usk asked. \"Mariner's armor <i>and</i> Adamantine Armor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer grinned. \"This is going to be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last roll buddy,\" said Carl. \"Let's see what you've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rolled again, and an amulet appeared on a necklace around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a Periapt of Wound Closure,\" said Pouncer. \"No worries about Death Saves with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, good with Archery, good swimming speed, Critical Hits don't bother me, and I'm good on the Death Saves,\" said Sam. \"Cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer chuckled. \"Still got a few tricks up my sleeve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you do,\" said Carl. \"Still, this will be a fun match.\" He looked at Sam. \"Are you sure about the No Restrictions part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Carl. \"Try not to lose. Pouncer likes to torment her prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer chuckled. \"This <i>will</i> be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" said Carl. \"Same general idea for rolling the dice for the items applies to your attack rolls and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl and the rest stepped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer pulled a great-axe from a scabbard on her back. \"You're going to have a hard time hitting my AC. Between having 20 Dexterity, and 20 Constitution, I got that Sweet 20 AC, and that's without a shield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got 16 strength, and my proficiency bonus is +3,\" said Sam. \"I figure, if I roll at least a 14, I should hit you. Also, Critical Hits, those will do extra damage to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got 18 in my Strength, so that means I only need a 13 to hit you,\" said Pouncer. \"As it is, you only have a 16 in your Con. I got twenty more hit points than you. Further more, you're a Champion Fighter. Extra chance for a Critical hit, plus some nice stat bumps. Thing is, I took Totem Warrior, starting with Bear, meaning less damage while raging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled nervously at this. \"Good choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there's my racial abilities,\" said Pouncer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat claws, right?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer grinned. \"It's a bit more than just the ability to scratch you. Also, I also have plenty of magic items. Some of them require a saving throw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun,\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roll for initiative,\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shook his left hand, and noticed Pouncer doing the same. They threw out their hands, and watched as a number appeared before them, and then their modifiers were added in.

I'm ready for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer looked over at Carl. \"Worth a shot.\" She looked back at Sam. \"Cat's Prey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in that moment, Sam <i>knew</i> that he'd made a Big Mistake. As he looked at Pouncer, he felt like he was afraid of her, as if he was a mouse being hunted by a housecat. He also realized that attacking her would be useless while he was afraid of her. \"I'm going to Hold my Action,\" he said, drawing his sword. \"I'll Attack if you get close to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just fine,\" Pouncer said, with a smile. She tapped her great-axe. \"Ensnare Prey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVines shot out from the great-axe, and bound Sam's arms to his body, preventing him from moving. As he struggled to get free, he heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you struggle to break free, you have some trouble with your footing.\" The voice was that of Zorzar. \"Make a Dexterity Saving Throw with Disadvantage, due to being Restrained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shook his left hand, and released it. He watched as a 15, and then a 9 appeared before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sam,\" said Zorzar. \"One off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam fell Prone, on the ground. He resumed struggling as Pouncer walked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All nice and bound,\" she said. She grabbed a vine, and lifted him back to his feet. \"I like looking into my Prey's eyes though. Cute face. I won't scratch it if you let me kiss you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gulped. \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer chuckled, and kissed him on the lips. \"There. Not so bad now, was it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded - situation not withstanding, the kiss was a nice one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Pouncer grinned. \"Of course, the fun's not done, <i>little</i> one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's eyes bulged, as he soon found himself the size of a mouse. Worse than that, his sword and shield hadn't shrunk with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer looked down at him and chuckled, as she pulled off what looked like a sliver of flesh from her lips. \"Only 18 AC. Much easier to hit. Enhanced Potion of Diminution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam pulled out his bow, and started running. On the plus side, he still had 30 feet of movement. On the bad side, his attacks would, more than likely, do even less damage than that of a regular Reduce spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a d6 for the Damage Reduction,\" Pouncer said. \"On the plus side, being shrunk to mouse-size gives you Advantage on a Stealth Check. Should help you out a bit by canceling the Disadvantage from the Heavy Armor! You still have Disadvantage on Attack Rolls due to being frightened of me though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam got under the base of a bush, where he could enjoy a bit of cover. \"In that case, I call a Shot on your Eye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer grinned. \"Let's see if the Dice Gods are with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shook his hand. With Modifiers, and his Fighting Style, and his Proficiency Bonus, he needed at least a 14 on the dice roll to hit her 20AC. But, with Disadvantage, the odds of getting both over that were against him. He threw the dice. One was a 20, which would have been an Auto-hit if not for the Disadvantage.

The needle was actually a rapier, that was black in color. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sprites and Pixies call it Tiny Death,\" said Carl. \"Adds 2d10 Necrotic Damage when you first attack someone with it, and regular 1d8 piercing damage afterwards. We took it off of a particularly Evil Sprite that had a nice sized bounty on his head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't sneeze at a thousand gold,\" said Butterfly. \"We were allowed to keep the sword as loot. Not really useful in a fight for someone of humanish size, but when you want to interrogate someone by threatening to ruin their eye forever, it has its uses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the sprite that used to own the sword?\" Sam asked, as he placed the sword around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suffice to say, they were sentenced to Death for their crimes,\" said Carl. \"Pouncer volunteered to be the Executioner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer grinned. \"That was fun. Tore his wings off first. After that, tied him up with strips of leather, covered him in bacon grease, and he slid down my throat real easy. Took him half an hour in-game to finally pass out and drown in my stomach acids. After than, he was just another piece of meat.\" She held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That brings up a good question, what happens if we die like this?\" Sam asked, as he stepped onto Pouncer's hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl chuckled. \"Roll up another sheet then. Maybe you'll get a slightly different character - different class, different background - but still based off of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to have something of the basics needed for the class in order to become that class though,\" said Ripsnout. \"I've actually been learning about magic, so ending up as a wizard, that was possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I play a lot of football,\" said Sam, as he got onto Pouncer's shoulder. \"I also do a lot of bow hunting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explains a few things,\" said Pouncer, as she and the rest resumed walking, having picked up Sam's normal-size longsword and shield. \"And the Tavern Brawler feat seems to indicate that either you get into fistfights, or you were into Martial Arts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrestling and some Karate,\" said Sam. \"Kind of wanted to do Mixed Martial Arts, but my older brother was big into football, and well, I wanted to be like him. Funny how that ended up leading me into playing D&amp;D with Carl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that happen?\" Butterfly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pack of bullies were picking on me, like usual,\" said Carl. \"Knocking my books out my hands and that sort of stuff. Then comes this big muscular guy, who sees four others harassing me, and he grabs the biggest one, spins him around to face him, and says 'Four on one isn't very fair, unless you're taking on someone bigger.' Better than that, a couple of the other football players showed up. Those bullies did some calculating of the outcomes for that encounter, and decided to leave. I mean, the other football players might not have cared about me, but they'd at least back up their teammate. After that, Sam helped me pick up my books, noticed what the were, and asked if he could learn how to play, and if there was a club on school. We tend to have fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except with Tommy's group,\" said Sam. \"Worst batch of Psychopaths one could ever run into. Make the average Murderhobo seem friendly by comparison. I mean, we've dealt with Min-Maxers, Roleplayers, Powergamers, Rules-Lawyers, and others - I mean, all players have a touch of all of these sorts, but not only did these guys just kill everything, it was like they embodied all the worst aspects of all bad players. They also cheated, and Tommy let them get away with it. I mean - kill a shop owner, and there should be guards or someone after you, unless you're clever enough to hide the body somehow - but these guys never faced the consequences of their actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Killed my guy for being of a 'different' race just to get his rare gear, and killed his for objecting to that,\" said Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like one of those Horror stories on that one site,\" said Huntor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have about given up playing had I not heard about your group,\" said Carl. \"I know I've enjoyed my time in this group. I hope Sam does too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say that I've had much fun though,\" Sam muttered. \"Kind of stuck in a reduced state at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should look at the advantages,\" said Pouncer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good way to lose your virginity without actually losing it,\" said Butterfly. \"Carl knows about that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked over at Carl, who was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell my mom,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Sam. He looked at Pouncer. \"Um, any rules about those sorts of things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're a Good-Aligned party, getting Consent would be a very good idea,\" said Pouncer. \"Good idea in general, even if we were Evil-Aligned, as there's some Rules that Zorzar has, with No Rape being one of them, followed by No Cheating. Of course, if one's just messing around with one another, such as a No Restrictions fight, Zorzar is willing to lift that rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's eyes bulged at the implications of this. \"Would you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer grinned. \"You're of the right size to fit inside of me. That being said, you would have been fine. Maybe you'd even like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled nervously. He wasn't sure what kind of pickup line that was, but it was an interesting one to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the group stopped for a rest, and sat down under some trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked around. The scene was rather nice. He would have liked it better if he was full-sized, but the view was nice enough, with them being near the bank of a steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never did ask,\" he said. \"What is the Quest that the group is supposed to be on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, one of the Usual ones,\" said Pouncer.</span></div></div>",

I can swallow human-sized prey, and bring it back up, or let it pass out my anus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you done that before?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In-game, yes, when we caught this human bandit captain, about three sessions back,\" said Pouncer. \"We weren't rolling high enough to get him to talk the conventional Nice Guy, Nasty Guy manner, so we decided to get creative, and I used Cat's Prey on him, which I'd just learned, and I decided to give him a tour of my intestinal system. He had enough HP to make the trip, and he was very eager to talk afterwards, on the threat of me doing it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was Carl playing then?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer grinned. \"Freaked him out when he saw me do it, along with the other part. Still, it's on my Character sheet.\" She held up her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Swallow - Can  makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside Pouncer, and it takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of each of Pouncer's turns. Pouncer can have only one Medium-sized target swallowed at a time, but can have two small targets or eight tiny targets inside of them, and remain mobile. If Pouncer losses consciousness, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by them and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.'\" Sam looked at Pouncer. \"Is that a common ability?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer chuckled. \"In general, yep. Scales up even, sort of like a Monk's Martial Arts ability or some damage-dealing Cantrip. Idea is that you're supposed to do it to someone really tough to wear them down. That being said, there's another lovely section that can be applied to it.\" She pointed to another paragraph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stomach Protection - While in her stomach, Pouncer can protect up to 8 targets from acid damage. Requires Concentration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useless when I'm Raging of course,\" said Pouncer. \"Outside of that though, me and other Predator types can keep our would-be meals safe from harm. Useful for interrogations, or transporting through terrain that would give others issues, like crossing a raging river, when the Predator is someone like Usk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Sam. \"So, this is a <i>fair</i> ability?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, although Carl was surprised to learn about it, as I mentioned,\" said Pouncer. \"Seems only certain creatures have the ability to swallow others in your version of D&amp;D.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we all have our own takes on things I guess,\" said Pouncer. \"Still, you got lucky - combined Mariner's and Adamantine Full Plate Armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Acquisitions Incorporated</i> had the Mithral +1 Armor, which removed disadvantage from stealth checks, and added 1 to the AC,\" said Sam. \"Not really used except as a special item in that book's quest, but could serve as justification to combining various special conditions that don't require Attunement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we don't have that rule, unless the object forms an actual attachment to you,\" said Pouncer. \"Useful if you locate, or get, items that don't fit your guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Sam. \"So, what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouncer looked at him, and chuckled. \"Depends.\"</span></div></div>",

She had exchanged pictures before but Simone still found herself flustered and surprised to see him in the flesh. Chester was a werebear, a freakish mix of human and ursine features. He stood just a little taller than the door frame, his broad chest and slightly pudgy belly covered in thick brown fur. His arms and legs still seemed mostly human, but his feet were thickly padded and clawed. Similarly his fingers were tipped with fearsome black claws. He didn't wear any clothing bar some tattered briefs, covering up his crotch. It gave her plenty of thickly-furred, muscular bear body to admire. One of those strong hands held a modest bouquet of flowers. With a nervous shuffle he handed them to his date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" She says slowly, feeling somewhat relieved this wasn't all some elaborate joke. The bear man just chuckles. \"Hehe, I don't get that a lot from humans. It's mostly screaming and running for their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Running? From a handsome, kind fellow like you?\" Simone jokes, beckoning him to enter as she leads the way. Chester ducks down a little to fit through the door, his large frame only barely allowing him to squeeze through. He knew this was going to happen and with a kind, patient smile he followed her into the living room. The werebear carefully stepped on the carpet, trying to make sure his claws wouldn't inadvertently damage the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room was candle-lit and she gestured towards the couch. Chester slowly sat himself down, not wanting to break her furniture with his weight. \"It's okay, if it can handle two of my fat aunts, you should be fine.\" She says with a giggle. He lets out a sigh of relief. Something tells the woman this has gone horribly wrong on a previous date for him. \"Just relax for a minute, I'll get the food and put these away.\" She points at the flowers as she wanders into the kitchen. A minute later she returns, holding a large serving tray with two plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester laughed as he saw the uneven portions on the plate. Simone had cooked a whole chicken, but only put a single leg on her plate, letting the werebear have the rest. She also replaced his cutlery with a chef's knife and a large table fork to accommodate his oversized paws. \"Figured you'd appreciate something a little bit more your size. Besides, wouldn't the regular silverware cause problems for you or is that only werewolves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werebear let out a thundering laugh. \"Haha, those stories are a bit exaggerated. First it'd have to go into my bloodstream so you'd need to stab me with the silverware, and I don't think this is that kind of date.\" She laughs in response. \"Second, it's more like an allergic reaction. If I get to a hospital I'll be fine. but enough talk for now, this food looks absolutely delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushes a little at his compliment and prepares to dig in.

Simone was a little curious what he was up to, but seeing his hungry gaze made it quite evident what was about to happen. Chester carefully lifted the plate and opened his maw wide. Rows of gleaming, pointy teeth lined around a dark gullet. It was a frightening sight for her, but she knew he'd never think about using them on her. The chicken on the other hand, was not so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester tore in to his food with the fevered zeal of a starving animal. His big maw effortlessly chomped through the cooked bird, undeterred by bones or other things Simone might opt out of. In 10 seconds flat he'd wolfed down everything on his plate, looking up to see the look of mild shock on his date's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... oh my... I'm sorry. It's just that it smelled so nice and... I just got... uhm... carried away.\" He smiles awkwardly, embarrassed by what he'd just done. Thankfully Simone was willing to defuse the situation with a polite laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I'll take it as a compliment to my cooking.\" She ate some of her own plate. She had nailed the recipe, no wonder Chester went feral on that chicken. She was half tempted to grab her leg of chicken and tear into it herself as a joke. \"Yeah...\" He just stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, it's okay.\" Simone said, putting down her plate. \"You're still my gentle soft cuddle-bear.\" She leans in closer, brushing up against his densely furred side. She had only talked to him through the app before, where he boasted about being like a big, living teddy bear. Now she was finally laid against the werebear's side and she had to conclude that he was grossly underselling just how soft he was. She expected it to be a little coarse and bristly, but it felt like he had taken a bath in conditioner before, his fur was soft and smooth as velvet.</span></div></div>",

She's been on more than a few awkward first dates. Suddenly she feels herself shift as he lifts her on top of him. Her head is resting on top of his broad chest and his body makes for a very comfortable soft-furred pillow. He gently lays his arm around her to stop her from falling off and softly whispers in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it? I hope I'm not too forward, but you seemed to enjoy the fuzz a lot.\" He stammers nervously. \"I did tell you I'm like a big teddy bear, didn't I?\" Chester adds with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... If nothing else, you were underselling it.\" She responds, giggling at his awkwardness. \"Now relax. Give me a big fuzzy hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to be told twice and wraps his arms around the human laid against his chest. He took her into a firm embrace, letting her enjoy the endless landscape of soft-furred werebear. Chester closed his eyes and felt her warmth against his body. He could even softly feel her heartbeat. As he hugs her tighter it increased. She must really like the bear hugs. If so, he would not disappoint her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone feels his arm shift and grab the back of her head. He pressed it face first into the smooth fur of his chest. At the same time he also increases the intensity of his hug. His strength easily overpowered her and struggling was made nearly impossible in this firm embrace. Her arms were pinned to her sides and she couldn't open her mouth to call out to him. She heard Chester murr happily. Was he deliberately trying to hurt her or did he forget his strength again? As the hug got tighter she felt pain radiating through her chest. There seemed to be no end to the werebear's power, the pressure increasing by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester happily hummed and hugged his date. He feels her heartbeat rising quicker and quicker, imagining Simone utterly in love with his heavy cuddly embrace. After this he might work up the guts to ask her for a kiss. He was completely oblivious to the damage he was doing, hugging her ever more tightly. When he opened his eyes again he finally realized what had happened.</span></div></div>",

The look of pain and fear in her eyes was one he wouldn't soon forget. He gasped in horror and pushed her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester didn't know what to do. He looked around in a panic, burning up with embarrassment. He could think of only one thing to do and ran for the door. \"Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!\" was the only thing coming out of his mouth as he attempted to get away from this ruined date as fast as possible. His heavy footsteps echoed through the house. By the time Simone had regained her bearings he was already near the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" She cried out, hoping to catch up with the werebear before he left. His hug had done a real number on her, but it had stopped before any permanent damage could be done. Granted, it didn't feel that way when she was being squeezed that hard, but she didn't want him leaving thinking he'd injured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up! I'm okay!\" She yelled.

Chester's sorrowful expression slowly turned into a timid smile as he wrapped his arms around her. His hold was a little more shaky, but the werebear was determined not to go overboard again. Simone cracked a smile as she felt him practice his restraint. She didn't anticipate his hug to evolve into sweeping her off her feet and cradling her in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me.\" He said, his voice a low rumble. He saw her stumble before. As much as she was trying to play it off, he was still feeling a little guilty about putting her in such a state. She felt light as air in his arms as he gallantly carried her back to the couch. Chester sat down, keeping Simone in his arms. She snuggled up a little closer to his broad chest, showing no signs of taking a seat next to him. With a smile and a shrug he let her sit in his lap, happy to see her comfortable with him. \"Let's continue where we left off.\" He added, putting his arms around her. He gave his date a gentle squeeze. This time he'd make sure her face wasn't blocked so she could call out if he got too overbearing. But the pleased little hums and moans suggested the exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he was a little shaken from what had happened so far, the werebear was still unimaginably soft. Simone enjoyed herself greatly. But she had more in mind than just cuddling with her date. She pulled an arm free and reached up to his head. Carefully she guided it down to her own. His breath wasn't too pleasant, but that cute fuzzy face of him was yearning to be kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester was a little confused by the gesture. What was she trying to guide him into doing? He looked around the room, panicking a little. Thankfully a clue was there on the salon table. Simone had prepared a movie to watch and the box showed two humans kissing. It looked weird to the werebear. She was eager for a kiss, closing her eyes and waiting for him to react. His kind didn't really do this sort of thing. There were similar gestures of affection though. He couldn't just leave her hanging, he had to do something.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chester panicked and resorted to the most common sign of affection he knew. With a wet slap his tongue hit Simone's cheek before dragging all the way across her face. She tried to reel back, but the werebear had gotten a taste in. He would show her love so clear that it was impossible to miss. Lick after lick streaked across her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone didn't want to open her eyes, lest they become victims in this slobbery assault. The amorous werebear seemed intent on showing her a good time, but this wasn't quite what she signed up for. She loved his handsome looks and his strong embrace, but it hadn't occurred to her that monster habits might differ more strongly than she thought. In hindsight she should probably consider herself lucky their ritual didn't involve anything painful to her. She was still a little sore from his accident earlier in the evening, she dreaded to think what he'd be able to inflict intentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost a full minute of ceaseless licking Simone's face was plastered in a layer of drool. Chester relented long enough for her to wipe the worst of it from her eyes. She looked at him with a mix of confusion and frustration. The werebear knew right away that he'd messed up again. His ears drooped and he gave a small sigh. Maybe he shouldn't have tried to get romantic with humans. They're just so different. He couldn't stand to meet her gaze any longer, but as he was wallowing in self-pity the werebear felt something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone watching her date's expression turn to sadness and acted in the only way she knew for sure would lift his spirits. She leaned in and though she had to overcome a sense of weirdness and revulsion she stuck out her tongue and gave his nose a cute little lick. Hopefully this would let him know she was okay, though she prayed he'd at least pause and ask before unleashing a second drool-soaked barrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... Are you okay?\" His voice quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright you little scaredy-bear. If I was gonna get mad at every little thing, it'd be a rotten date anyway. But maybe we just have to communicate a little better, since I think it's clear by now that we approach love in different ways. I bet we can find some common ground though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone didn't mean for her thoughts to immediately leap to the lewdest suggestion, but in the back of her mind she did wonder what that big tongue might feel like on other parts of her body. Though she was betting that big date of hers was also imagining naughty things, judging by the way he was running his hands along her body. It struck her that he'd probably never dated something without a fur coat. Was he drawn to her smoothness in the same way she loved his fluffiness? She blushed a little at the thought, remaining in his embrace for now.</span></div></div>",

Only once he opened his eyes did he see what he had done. His savage strength had crushed his date. Tears flowed from her eyes as she was barely clinging on to life. Chester's eyes shot wide open. How could this have happened? How did he not notice sooner? What had he done? He shifted nervously, drawing a pained gurgle from Simone. Was there anything left he could do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... I'm so sorry Simone... I never should have done this...\" He muttered, terrified and sad. He'd never dated a human before, how was he to know they were this fragile? His expression hardened as his thoughts turned to what he would do next. The woman in his arms was in pain. The damage done was too severe and Chester gulped as he realized there was only one thing left for him to do. He would make Simone's final moments as happy as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully the werebear cradled his date, guiding her lips towards his. They met in a passionate kiss. Chester tried to justify Simone's lack of movement by thinking he'd take charge. But it didn't stop the whole thing from being bittersweet. He'd killed the woman who loved him. Now he would make sure it would be painless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone was barely able to discern what was happening anymore, her consciousness fading fast. She felt her date's kiss. It was strangely nice, but got lost amidst the rollercoaster of emotions she felt. All at once she felt angry at his clumsiness, betrayed by his monstrous nature and saddened that his brute strength had caused him to do this. Topping all these feelings was overwhelming numbness, the intense pain suppressed by her adrenaline. She was no medical professional, but she could tell no hospital would be able to save her. Chester held her close to his chest before giving her the last kind gesture he could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werebear grunted, flexing his muscles and ending his date's suffering. It took no more than a second to snap her spine with a dull crunch. He let out a sigh of relief, happy that her agony was over. He felt embarrassed, guilty that he couldn't control himself. Now his human date was dead. This wasn't supposed to have happened. He'd pictured them living happily together. But if she was this frail, perhaps it was better that he didn't grow too attached just yet. He sat for minutes, feeling Simone's body go cold whilst his inner turmoil played out. At the end of it he set her beside him on the couch and with a weary sigh he prepared to leave. Hopefully future dates wouldn't end this badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over his shoulder to Simone one last time. Right at that moment his belly rumbled. The dinner she cooked was nice, but hardly enough to fill a big werebear like him up. And the way she was sitting there, she did look awfully appetizing. It'd be a shame to let her go to waste. \"It's what she would've wanted.\" He muttered to himself as he approached his love one last time, drool leaking from his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester left Simone's house with an awkward smile, patting his somewhat swollen belly. He slipped into the dark, pulling out his phone and loading up Monstr. Better luck next date...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simone smiled, looking at her phone. This guy was certainly a character. A self-proclaimed pirate, he even put some of that corny pirate-speak in his texts to her. What was more interesting is his claims to have his own ship to sail the world and a desire for a strong woman by his side. Something exotic and dangerous, so why not a human? It made Simone feel a strange kind of special. It helped that he was quite easy on the eyes too. Handsome, tall, muscular. The thick, bristly fur and hyena-like muzzle were there too, of course. But the gnoll was a sexy beast in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her attention was drawn to the front door, loud knocking echoing through her house. They had agreed before the date that she'd be wearing something casual. Something that she didn't mind getting damaged or wet. Those instructions alone had her fantasizing about what this Seafang might do to her in the bedroom, or captain's quarters as he'd said. More knocks followed as it seemed her date was an impatient one. She opened the door to find several gnolls waiting for her. None of them looked like the dashing one she'd been getting pictures from though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, madam.\" The lead gnoll spoke with a growly voice. English did not come easy to the beast, but it tried to sound polite all the same. More distressing was the smell. She had few illusions about gnolls being clean, but the piercing stink of sweat radiated of them like a vile aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The captain has requested we escort you to our beautiful vessel. She be close by in the river. If you would please follow us. We'd hate for this to get... unpleasant.\" The others cackled with that last word. Each of them was a foot taller than Simone and twice as wide. They seemed almost disappointed when the woman simply nodded, grabbed her coat and closed the door behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, gents, lead away.\" She said cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would the lady care to be carried?\" The lead gnoll offered. With a cheeky grin Simone nodded and in a flash she was hoisted off her feet and thrown over the gnoll's shoulder. She gave a sigh, not sure why she expecting any different. Doubt set in as the sweaty smell was even worse up close. The other gnolls chuckled at eachother, some of them using the opportunity to try and sneak a look up her skirt. Thankfully the beast's broad shoulder was comfortable enough. She stayed calm as the pack made way for the river, making small talk with the gnolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long have you guys known Seafang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arr, he found us all as pups, raised us like his sons. Instilled within us a love of the sea, raiding and plundering. He inspires us all and each of us would follow him into hell if he ordered it.\" The lead gnoll said, sounding surprisingly emotional through his snarling voice. The others all quietly nodded along. \"This crew, she be one big happy family.\" The beast continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we all drift across the endless waters, our home ever with us.\" Another crewmember added, earning his own round of agreement. Their chat didn't last much longer as they had arrived at their destination. Simone was set down as gently as the lead gnoll could muster and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avast, me datey!\" A boisterous voice called out. His first line to her was a dad joke. Simone instantly knew the story of Seafang raising the other crew had to be true now. But as she saw him she was more than convinced a bad taste in humor wouldn't dampen this date one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeafang stood tall and proud, a toothy smile on his face and an outfit that had to be seen to be believed. A long, ornately detailed duster that looked straight out of a pirate novel. Gold trimmings, fine leatherworking and a scabbard to its side for a large broadsword, he had it all. His face looked as ruggedly handsome as ever. If there were any signs that he was older than the crew, his appearance didn't show them. He wore a stained white undershirt and his fingers were coated in large golden rings and jewels. His pants matched the duster coat and his large boots were shining as he struck a powerful pose. Simone was certainly impressed by the captain, but his ship was quite a sight too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gnoll pirate ship looked awe-inspiring and terrifying in equal measure. A rusted hulk, patches of crudely fitted metal covering holes from bow to stern. It looked like an old navy warship. The cannons were still there, but they had been loaded with what could only be described as giant grappling hooks. Gnolls were going about their business everywhere, scurrying across the deck. Most of the ship's doors had been removed and the holes crudely cut bigger. These beasts looked like they would struggle inside a regular vessel. It made Simone all the more curious to see what they had done to the inner workings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All aboard! The sea, she be waiting.\" The captain announced grandly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone followed the crewmen that carried her here up the gangplank and with a loud, rumbling blast of the horn they set off. Seafang came down to greet her more personally. To her surprise he didn't reek as badly as the others. There was still a very distinct smell of unwashed gnoll in the air, but she had worried that he had gotten his rank by being the smelliest gnoll of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome aboard the Slavering Raider, miss Andrewson. I be Seafang, in case that wasn't clear yet. I look forward to this date. Be assured, the crew has been informed that you are not to be harmed or harassed in any way, lest they meet my wrath. Though if you warm up to these cute little puppies I am sure you'll find us all more than happy to share your love.\" He explained with a toothy smile. Simone breathed a sigh of relief, knowing how some of the crew were leering at her. But before she could get comfortable the captain leaned in, putting a hand on the wall behind her and breathing heavily in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you hurt any of my beloved family... There will be no safe haven in the world that can protect you.\" He growled threateningly before catching himself intimidating his date and stepping back. She gulped. But Simone didn't start texting this gnoll through Monstr because she was afraid. She steeled herself and turned her attention to the captain's first mate. He'd been standing idly, seemingly waiting for orders of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I don't think I'd ever be able to hurt a big, strong beast like you.\" She said seductively, reaching up to scratch him behind the ear. The first mate's tongue lolled out the side of his maw as he panted happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Breach, do you not have a place to be? Go and make sure the crew are ready for our next adventure.\" Seafang commanded sternly. Simone just gave him a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting jealous already, are you? I just want to show you I appreciate your crew too.\" She said, her voice drenched in sugar. \"But I'm not here because I appreciate them. I'm here because I <i>want</i> you.\" Simone put a finger on the gnoll's chest. His heart went aflutter as he felt his love for her be reinforced by her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you shall see that Seafang leaves no-one wanting. Come, my treasure, the men have prepared a feast for us all.\" He extended an arm and she took it. Together they walked along the deck of his warship towards the bridge tower. She was curious to see where this would lead, but she hadn't expected to see anything like what the gnolls had done to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the steel hull had been almost completely gutted. Only a framework of thick, metal pillars was still left to keep the place from collapsing under its own weight. There looked to be just one lower deck left, a furred frenzy of crewmen moving around. At the front and the back of this cavernous metal hall were holes in the floor, gnolls jumping in an out. Probably the storage hold. Up above she could see the interior of the gutted comms tower, only a few crewmen staying on their posts to steer the ship and keep a weather eye out for opportunities. The back of the tower had still been left somewhat intact, forming the only real separate room within this large shell. It was even more remarkable because it had an actual door in it, not just a crudely torn hole. It was probably Seafang's personal quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost time for dinner and the crew had set up a long table in the middle of the room, covering it with stained tablecloths and preparing an elaborate meal. The food turned Simone's stomach a little as it was very clear gnolls didn't bother with such fineries as cooking their food. Chunks of raw, bloodied meat were stacked on dirty dishes. Seafang could see his date's discomfort and spoke calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fret not, I had mister Breach prepare you something more to your tastes. You'll have to forgive his cooking skills, he tries his best.\" He surprised his date by hoisting her off her feet and hopping down, landing with a heavy thump and setting her down beside him again. \"Sorry about that, the Slavering Raider isn't the most... human-friendly vessel in these seas.\" He mused, prompting a chorus of suppressed giggles from the crew. The first mate emerged again, pointing the captain and his date to their seats and serving them both a roasted meal. Simone was pleasantly surprised. It looked a bit crude, but edible. What surprised her more was the captain being served a similar dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not be sitting here and letting you feel all awkward being the only one to eat cooked food. Anyone got a problem with that, my boot is more than ready to listen to their complaints.\" He said brashly, putting a smile on her face. Of course there were limits to what the gnolls would do to accommodate her and cutlery was probably a bit too much to ask around here. Striving to fit in with the beasts she picked up the roast and dug in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the first bite it was clear that for all the effort made to cook her something, these foul beasts had still given it their own personal flair. It tasted like it had been stewing in the first mate's armpit for an hour. It was nasty, but she knew there would likely be repercussions if she already started acting prissy around the gnolls. Seafang especially seemed to look intently at her, gauging her reaction. Was he trying to test her? After she ate a few more bites and put on her best fake smile he seemed satisfied. He opened his maw wide and tore through his dinner with great ferocity. She might've had a headstart, but he finished much faster than her. As she finally completed her meal she looked over to the captain. He gave her an almost silly grin and motioned for her to look behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone turned around to see the first mate standing next to her, an expecting look in his face. He wanted to know how he did. Should she be honest to him as part of the test? Hurting his feelings might not be smart. Splatters of blood were still present on his jaws from his own dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well, mister Breach. Maybe next time we can cook together...\" She said calmly, hearing a slightly perturbed huff behind her. \"...if the good captain permits it, of course.\" Simone added, looking back to Seafang who'd calmed down and sat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T... Thanks.\" He stammered, trying to stay calm in the eyes of the captain. \"I... I didn't have any spices to I had to improvise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's okay. Next time you raid a ship, I'll plunder the kitchen for spices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, she's already gettin into the pirate life. I knew you were the right choice for ol' Seafang.\" The captain yelled boisterously. \"Three cheers for miss Andrewson.\" He announced, the crew howling and yipping along. The cheers got even louder as he extended his hand and pulled her in the moment she grabbed it, planting a big, slobbery kiss on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone blushed brightly, held in the gnoll's strong arms, spittle dripping down her cheek. She could only think of one way to make this moment even better. She reached up to Seafang, who was hyping up the crew., and guided his face down to meet hers. With pursed lips she pushed forwards, planting a big smooch right on his stocky muzzle. The captain didn't need to hesitate before accepting this invitation. If she wanted the full experience he would show her that gnolls were monsters in so many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thick tongue entered the scene and danced around in her mouth. Simone felt her legs turn to jelly as the powerful beast took charge, delivering a passionate kiss unlike anything she'd ever experienced. Though the taste was still nasty, she was alarmed by how little she seemed to care about it. All that mattered to her now was extending this kiss for as long as possible. The crew cheered even louder in the background, standing up to clap, dance and go wild. Finally it was brought to an end and the captain gave her a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been all my years?\" He asks, his voice barely audible over the crew's noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting for a strong, powerful man to sweep me off my feet and take me on an adventure.\" She responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And an adventure this shall be.\" The gnoll declares proudly. \"Mister Breach, give the command to weigh anchor immediately! The call of the sea shall be answered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first mate barely needed to say a word as the crew were all there to hear the captain's orders. A deep thrum boomed into life as the ship's engines fired up. Some stragglers stayed behind to stash the dinner plates whilst the captain gave his date an amorous look. \"Ya best be getting comfortable with the Slavering Raider, miss Andrewson.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Simone.\" She replied quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, miss Simone. Are ye ready for pirating, plunder and pleasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes and <i>yes</i>.\" Simone gave that last yes a seductive tone, putting a hand on the gnoll's cheek.\"</span></div></div>",

We got one on radar!\" One of the gnolls up in the comms tower called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full speed, let's reel 'em in!\" The captain ordered. Gnolls scurried back and forth, some now brandishing crude tools. Simone was surprised not to see any of the beasts carrying weapons. Only the captain seemed to be equipped with a sword. Was it just for show? He reached out to her, offering to take her back up to the main deck. She gladly took his hand, letting him wrap her up in his muscular arms. With one mighty leap they were out of the hold and on the main deck. Here too there was a flurry of activity, the main guns creaking and turning. In the distance she could see their target, a cargo ship. It didn't look like much, but it was getting closer fast. The Slavering Raider had some serious engine power and relatively little weight, making it alarmingly fast for something this big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be knowing the drill, men! No witnesses, no survivors!\" The captain cried out to a chorus of yips, howls and cheers. Simone gulped a little. She'd expected the beasts to overpower the human crew and hold them hostage. But the captain's words, brutal as they were, held a measure of sense. She'd not heard of the gnoll pirates before and this was the only way to keep their secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith less than a kilometer between the ships the cannons let loose a thunderous volley. Anchors sailed through the air, carrying iron chains with them. They crashed into the cargo ship's hull and deck, lodging themselves in the shattered steel. Several small crews of gnolls began turning a large mechanical contraption to reel in the chains and pull them closer together. When the iron ribbons were pulled taut another order was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Runners, introduce yourselves!\" Seafang bellowed. Simone looked in awe as some of the gnolls got up on the chains and ran along them towards the cargo ship. Maybe their monstrous nature made it easier, but the woman's jaw nearly hit the floor at seeing this feat of agility. They were met with the crack of gunfire as the ship's desperate crew tried to fight off these inhuman invaders. But either they were terrible shots or the gnolls were bulletproof, because it didn't seem to faze them in the slightest. When a bullet whizzed close to her and the captain he quickly pushed her behind himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Those beasts would dare shoot at you? If we weren't merciless sea dogs already I'd order the men to kill them all.\" He said, snarling a little at this affront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone was quietly happy to hide behind the captain's broad figure. For one it would spare her the sight of what the gnolls were about to do to those men. The screams and roars on the other hand were still clear as day. All the while the Slavering Raider was still reeling in the other ship. This went on until they met with a loud, dull <i>CLANG</i>. The shock nearly sent Simone to the deck, but Seafang was quick to catch her. The remaining gnolls jumped across to assist in slaughtering what was left of the crew. But cargo ships aren't known for large crews and the runners had already dealt with most of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the screams went silent Simone dared look from behind Seafang. It looked as harrowing as she thought, sprays of blood coating the cargo ship's deck. the men laid strewn about, most of them savagely mauled. Simone looked away, but the captain took hold of her and jumped across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone paid as little attention to the carnage as she could, following the handsome gnoll up through the narrow corridors of the cargo ship. It put his broad physique to the test as he had to squeeze through doorways made for humans. Finally he entered the bridge. There was one man inside, sat kneeling between two gnolls. Each had a paw on the man's shoulder, holding him down and giving him a painful squeeze whenever he tried to resist. They'd kept him alive for Seafang, but what did the gnoll have planned for him?</span></div></div>",

Simone froze up for a moment. Did he really expect her to commit murder on the first date? And what was he hoping she would do? Kill a man with her bare hands? This was starting to get a lot more intense than she could've imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. Can't the great Seafang find it in his heart to spare this poor man?\" She cuddled up close to him, giving the gnoll puppy eyes and hoping he'd have a change of heart. It was a long shot, but it felt like her best way out of this situation. Mercifully the monster laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, isn't she the most lovely treasure in the sea? Very well, we'll take our leave. This vermin is beneath us anyway\" He spoke grandly, guiding Simone back to the Slavering Raider. But before he left the bridge he signaled to his men to ensure there would be no witnesses. They quietly choked the human captain whilst Simone made a quick stop in the ship's kitchen to take some spices along with her. Seafang gave her an amused nod as he watched the small woman pillage the kitchen like a seasoned pirate. He'd work on her bloodlust some other day, for now it would be regular lust that was on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later Simone and Seafang were back aboard his ship. She had handed the spices over to a crewman to bring to the kitchen and the remaining crew was busy tearing open cargo containers and hauling over anything of value. Fancy electronics, medical shipments, anything that looked like it could sell well according to the quartermaster. Simone caught little of this as the captain was more interested and showing her more features of his own ship. Frankly, she was getting a little bored by it all. As endearing as the proud father routine was, she wanted to get into the things they'd talked about over text before this date started. As he was about to gush over some part of his ship again she put a finger on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a better idea. How about we go to the captain's quarters and start exploring some of <i>your</i> features.\" The way she spoke, her sultry voice. The gnoll had to stop himself from tackling her to the ground and ravaging her there and now. With haste he lifted her off her feet and practically dashed across the deck, leaping up to his quarters and closing the ornate door behind him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seafang smiled as he gently set down his date in an ornate chair. It was in good condition compared to most things on this ship. The captain turned around and excused himself to his bedroom for just a moment. He emerged again without the longcoat on. His sword was missing too. He carried a glass of what looked to be wine and handed it to Simone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She said, raising a small toast to the handsome beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you just sit back, missy, and I'll show ye the goods.\" He spoke softly, trying to add a seductive growl to his words. It didn't have much effect, but she was thoroughly entertained all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst to go was the loose shirt he was wearing. It flew across the room, allowing the gnoll to show off his muscular chest. He flexed a few times, seeing Simone stare enamored at those big fur-coated muscles. Already she seemed eager for them to take this to the bedroom, but he would have her soaking wet before even setting foot in there. He took off the boots and threw them into a corner. With a sigh of relief he splayed his clawed toes. The gnoll didn't linger on them for too long, knowing what the woman opposite him really wanted to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he unbuttoned his pants, Simone's eyes drawn to his groin. With each of the four buttons Seafang undid, something was trying to push itself out. A distinct bulge, formed by his package. The smell of gnoll musk began to fill the air. She had expected to have to deal with it at some point, but he wasn't even naked yet and the stench was already eye-wateringly powerful. If he was as well-endowed as he'd bragged about on Monstr, she would be ready to muscle through the smell for some fun, but the scope of the challenge before her was now made clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little further teasing he slid the pants down his strong legs, leaving only some dirty shorts remaining on him. Simone's eyes widened as she saw the size of his package. Hopefully it was already half-mast or she was going to struggle taking it all. Seafang let out a rumbling laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me eyes be up here, missy.\" He teased, snapping Simone out of staring at his crotch. She was breathing a little heavier already, but it didn't take long for her to catch on to his expectant glare. It was then she realized that whilst he was down to his underwear, she was still fully clothed. That kind of injustice wouldn't stand for long! She jumped up and quickly began to undress herself. Seafang was a little disappointed with the lack of showmanship, but he could appreciate her fine, delicate curves all the same. He began to drool a little as she removed her bra, letting those perky tits fly free. He was panting like a playful dog by the time she'd gotten down to her undergarments too. Simone smiled, wondering what intimate thoughts ran through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't say this to just anyone, but ye be my finest treasure. And Seafang takes good care of his treasures.\" he said, approaching Simone and extending a hand out to her. She took it and the gnoll pulled her into his embrace. The soft fur was slightly damp and smelly, but she didn't mind it. His physique wasn't quite as chiseled as his crew, but by any human standards he was still an absolute tower of muscle, something he gladly showed off by carrying her into the bedroom. As he did, he brought his big muzzle close to hers, closing his eyes. Simone took hold of his head and guided her lips to meet his. They kissed, the gnoll letting his date get a good taste of what was to come as he overwhelmed her with passion. He could feel her body shiver as his tongue was playing with hers. He shot a quick look towards her panties and smiled internally, seeing his mission be a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom was a fairly simple affair, dominated mostly be a large bed. It looked sturdy enough to handle four gnolls and dirty enough to make Simone wince a little. The rest of the room featured a dresser, a chair, some pegs on the wall holding his coat and sword and some other weapons strewn about in a corner. But the only weapon she had eyes for right now was the one in his shorts. He carefully set her down on the bed before sliding on himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seafang crawled on all fours towards his date. This was the moment they'd both been hoping for. Simone had been quite transparent in her texts about what she'd hoped to get from the date and the gnoll eagerly agreed, his love for this unusual woman only deepening. Her smooth body was laid out before him, unblemished and perfect. Her smile could melt steel as she checked out his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe this was really happening. Since the moment she discovered Monstr she'd been apprehensive about how real it could be. But now she was in a gnoll's bed moments away from having sex with a genuine monster. It seemed almost comical to her. How would she ever explain this to her friends? She met a gnoll pirate, went on a sea journey with him and banged him every day? Nobody was going to believe it. But that wasn't about to make what's coming next any less mindblowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if ye were a gnoll, I'd pin you down. There'd be some biting, clawing. Honestly, it's as much fighting as it is fucking. But I be getting the impression that violence isn't your turn-on.\" He gave her a broad, toothy grin. Simone just nodded, curious to see what Seafang had in mind. \"So let's see if we can perhaps make this a little more interesting.\" He said, leaning down and letting his large tongue hang from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnoll dragged the slobbery muscle across Simone's chest, giving her breasts a big lick. The slightly rough surface of the tongue proved intensely stimulating, a moan letting Seafang know he's doing well. He smirks, licking her a few more times before suddenly feeling her hands on his chest. They were pressing against his large pecs, massaging the toughened hide. He shivered, unable to grasp how that could feel so good. The gentleness of her touch, the smoothness of her hands. He felt his limbs go wobbly the more he thought about it. When his mind tried to imagine those hands around his manhood he collapsed, his arms and legs giving out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" They said in unison, the large beast flopping down on the comparatively small woman. The bed absorbed most of the impact and Simone couldn't help but enjoy the fuzzy blanket of gnoll smothering her. The musty, sweaty smell was a bit unpleasant, but after some time on this boat full of gnolls she'd grown used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Seafang muttered to his date. But when he tried to lift himself up he felt her arms wrapping around his chest. Did she enjoy being down there? He made a mental note of it and let Simone have her fun. He gave a grumbling moan as she rubbed his back and shoulders. Her arms weren't long enough to reach all of it, but the soft touch was more than enough to make the tough beast feel like putty in her arms. He was surprised this would feel so good. Normally sex and foreplay revolved about getting the female gnoll in the mood by whatever means necessary. But here this woman was, smothered beneath his body and still trying to make him feel good too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally relented he pushed himself up, curious to see how she was doing under there. The gnoll was met with a woman smiling from ear to ear. She loved his fluffy embrace, crude as it had been. He arched back, his head looming over her groin. Seafang shot her a suggestive wink before letting his large tongue drag along her womanhood. Immediately she moaned loudly, the slick appendage feeling heavenly. Before he can lick her again she speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna make me blow my load too soon, you insatiable beast.\" She teased. \"How about you instead show me your... 'captain's log'.\" She smiled, trying to hide her mild disdain for the silly nickname he'd given his member in their texts. But hearing the otherwise powerful and masculine beast squeak with glee was worth it. He rose up a little, revealing to her that he was every bit as eager to go. His dick twitched with anticipation. Though Simone had never seen one this big before, she was confident in her ability to take it.</span></div></div>",

With a toothy smirk he lowered himself onto her. The pointed tip of his cock poked against the inside of her thigh, lining itself up with her eager pussy. The moment Seafang found his mark he let out a short victorious growl and plunged himself in. Simone gasped with shock and ecstasy. The gnoll's manhood already looked impressive, but it somehow felt even bigger. He gave her only moments to adjust to his girth before he began to gently rock back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... You're so soft and calm.\" He mumbled, smiling broadly. Simone couldn't add too much in return as she was overwhelmed by the pleasure he provided. His large, furry chest slowly got closer too, the gnoll laying himself down to smother her in love. It was so different from dealing with a female gnoll in bed. She didn't try to bite, punch or claw him at all. She was just calmly and submissively moaning while he railed her. Hopefully she wouldn't be too mad about the surprise at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman managed to get a word out between lewd moans. \"Faster.\" Seafang could barely hear it from under his chest, but he was eager to show her everything a gnoll lover could bring to her in bed. He picked up the pace, his cock sliding back and forth inside her with renewed vigor. It slapped and squelched as pre leaked out from his cock, mixing with the copious volumes of her arousal. His fuzzy body brushed against hers, adding an extra dimension of comfort and excitement to the intimacy. The smell of his unwashed chest had been completely replaced by the carnal scent of sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it felt like Seafang's cock doubled in width, Simone's pussy aching briefly as a wet squelch prompted Seafang to let out a howling moan. She could feel his orgasm, seed rocketing into her depths. The gnoll came over and over again, his cock producing a stream like a firehose. After a few more seconds of this intense climax he relaxed. Simone felt him slump down onto her, his every muscle relaxing. She also felt his cock still fully erect inside of her. It was in deeper than ever before. Lastly she could hear his shallow breathing. He'd really given her his everything. No small feat for a brute like him. And it had felt even better than she could've possibly hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope ye be feeling as good as I am. Because I dare say there's not a happier gnoll in the world right now.\" He said, panting loudly and hoisting his chest up a little to give her space to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck yes.\" She said, still breathing awkwardly after the intense experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be honest with ye, Simone, I'd expected the knot to be a bigger deal than you made it. But ye just took it and moaned. Are all humans that loose?\" He kept smiling, but Simone was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The knot. You know, the reason we'll be stuck together for a couple hours. I tried to warn you, but you were so eager for me I figured you already knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the strange widening made sense to her. Simone had read about this, but that was in dogs. Weren't gnolls more like hyena's? Was there even such a link between an animal and this handsome beast? Flustered, she tried to play it off. \"Oh... Right... That's what that was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, maybe we should've started smaller. Get ye a bit more comfortable around me. But seeing you that eager... How could I hold back on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the same Seafang that said he'd throw me on a table and mount me if I let him? Or were those texts from a different gnoll pirate?\" Simone teased. Seafang chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, careful missy. Ye still be stuck with me for a few hours. And if ye think I've only got one round in me I clearly gotta provide you with some more lessons about gnolls.\"</span></div></div>",

Asking a gnoll to be more forceful isn't something I think I've ever heard a human request. Most want the opposite. But for one as pretty as you I'll gladly show it.\" He mused softly, a low growl accompanying his voice to add a sense of menace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone gasped as he reached down to grab her shoulder and twist her around. Feeling the large cock inside her act as a pivot was uniquely arousing, but Seafang had so much more ready for her. She tried to look over her shoulder to see what he was doing, but he put his hand in her face, pushing her head down against the bed. Slowly he was starting to pump himself up and down, making her resistance intensify with futile squirming. She tried to accommodate the beast inside her, but he was eager to explore even deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt him grab her arms and force them down alongside her body, wrapping his own powerful arm around her to lock them into place. His fuzzy forearms flexed and bulged with muscle as he tightened his grip on her. She knew he'd have to hold back, lest this little bearhug would start doing more damage than she could handle, but she was nowhere near prepared for what he did next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeafang leaned in close, feeling the human struggle in his grip. Did she think he would permit such resistance? A small squeeze put her in her place, but only for a moment. He loved every second of it and opened his maw wide. Foul breath washed over her, the beast smiling as she winced a little. His warm, stinky gnoll breath got closer and closer until his tongue touched the back of her neck. With as much gentleness as he could muster he closed his jaws, pointed teeth prodding against her throat, but never pushing hard enough to draw blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone froze, filled with fear and excitement. Those were his jaws around her neck. One bite and this date would come to a sudden and bloody end. Seafang had stepped up his game and then some. In the back of her head she still held firmly that he wouldn't hurt her, but she didn't expect him to get this close. His nasty breath didn't help things either. But above all things she could feel his hips maintaining their rhythm. That massive shaft was still pounding away and she had never felt more aroused. Her orgasm was drowned out by his as the gnoll let out a growling moan. It sounded a little off due to him trying to keep her neck in his jaws, but she could feel it where it really mattered. A surge of heat entering her body. She responded in kind, but the slight pain from his tight squeeze and the little pins in her neck from his teeth were far more present in her mind. As he finished pumping his load into her depths Seafang finally released his powerful grip on her, leaning back and giving her a toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the stuff...\" She muttered, gasping for air after such an intense experience. Her neck was soaked in gnoll saliva, a little more leaking onto her back from his jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think, this only be the first day o the journey.\" He mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait for the rest.\" She said seductively. She tried to slide off to the side a little, but the large knot lodged in her pussy quickly reminded her of its existence. Seafang whimpered a little at the sudden tug on his shaft. \"Oh, sorry. I forgot we're stuck together.\" Simone said hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It be you whose carryin the captain's log inside ye, I'll be fine.\" He replied with a sly grin. \"Now, let's get some rest. I've got important news for everyone tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, no round three later?\" She teased him, but the gnoll gave her a big laugh in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, best be savin your energy, missy. You're gonna need it.\" He wrapped his arms around her again in a gentle embrace and before long the two of them were sleeping. Seafang didn't make it easy for her, his growling snores putting a chainsaw to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Simone was happy to discover his manhood had wilted down and vacated her pussy overnight. It was impressive just how subtly it had gone. She really expected the departure of a cock that big to be more noticeable, even in her sleep. But it didn't matter. She found herself alone in the gnoll's bed. Quickly she got up and put on her clothes. As she did Seafang entered the room, smiling brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ye be awake. Quickly, follow me.\" He motioned, Simone quickly pacing up to him and joining his side. When they went through the door she was surprised to see the whole crew. They were waiting in the lower deck as Seafang prepared to hold a small speech from the rickety platform just in front of the captain's quarters.</span></div></div>",

Though more than a few were surprised to see Simone in relatively good shape beside him. She didn't quite understand their expressions yet, looking down at the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are gnolls! We take what we can and we kill anyone in our way! But we be more than mere savages. For those special few that find their way into our hearts, there be nothing we wouldn't do. And today we be in the presence of such treasure.\" Seafang continued, receiving a chorus of hollers and cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she be a rare one indeed. For when I showed her the ways a real monster makes love, she said I could be a little rougher. Can ye imagine that? After seeing what we be doing to those other men earlier in the day she asked the bloodthirsty gnoll to be a little rougher. Were it not for the smooth skin and kind smile, I could mistake her for a gnoll.\" More cheers erupted from the men, Simone blushing brightly as the captain praised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now that I be done seizing my share of the 'booty', it only be fair that ye be given yours!\" He concluded, making Simone look up in surprise. Seafang smiled and put and arm around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gnoll tribes have no dedicated relationships. There's some deep running connections, but any two members of the tribe that want to fuck can go right ahead. Then there be the slaves. Anyone wants a go at those, they're free game. That's usually where any captured humans end up. But you, you don't deserve such a lowly station.\" His rumbling voice was unsettling as Simone tried to grasp the implication of what he just said. Seafang meanwhile rose up and addressed the crew again. \"For her valiance she shall be an honourary member of the crew. Any who would treat her ill are to be reminded of their mistakes... harshly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone wasn't permitted another moment to think as Seafang pushed her off the platform. She let out a surprised shriek as she fell into the crowd of gnolls. A mass of raised hands caught her and gently lowered her down, but now she was stood amidst a large, smelly pack of slavering gnolls. Many of them were eyeing her up but none moved a muscle. It almost seemed like they were caught off guard as much as she has. The beasts seemed to be waiting for one of them to make the first move or for Seafang to bellow orders. After an awkwardly long pause the gnolls finally seemed to have figured out their desired approach.</span></div></div>",

She can't help but feel a terrified shiver running down her spine amidst the ocean of predatory leers. She looks up to Seafang who seems entirely comfortable with the situation. He's standing confidently on his platform, arms crossed and a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closest crewman takes a cautious sniff of her, like they hadn't been able to smell her before. The slightest of smiles creeps up on his face too. If only the poor woman knew what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to break the tension Simone awkwardly waved at the gnoll, the beast not reacting in any way to her gesture. \"Ehm... hi everyone. So... now what?\" She chokes on her words, fearing that a wrong step would end up with her getting savaged by the crew. But as her fears ate at her a revelation struck her. If mauling was their goal, she'd be in pieces on the floor already. It was her bravery that got her accepted among them. She couldn't flinch now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft murmuring rose up from the back of the crowd as she raised a hand and did what she could only hope would be appreciated. She scratched the crewman's chin. He wasn't a dog, but was it close enough to give her the same appreciation? The crewman froze up, giving her a puzzled look. But he couldn't maintain his facade for long before he wordlessly sat down on his haunches, leaning in to let her continue. His big tongue flopped out and like an oversized puppy he started panting. The others watched with rapt attention, still slowly closing in on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone looked behind her in shock as her other arm was suddenly grabbed. A fearsome gnoll stared at her, his piercing gaze boring straight through her. He looked older, his arm carrying several long scars from battles past. But as firm as his grip was, he loosened it, seemingly concerned he'd hurt her. Carefully he guided her arm to his head until he'd placed her hand behind his ear. His look changed. It went from trying to burn a hole through her to a pair of pleading puppy eyes. She gave him a warm smile and scratched him behind the ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she found herself fully occupied by the needy crew, everyone wanting to feel her dainty touch giving them scritches like a horde of eight foot tall puppies. All of them crowded around her, patiently waiting their turn. In the center of attention Simone kept going, the blissful smiles on their faces putting a grin on her own. The combined stink of their breath as they panted in her face and their general body odour was less pleasant, but if she could handle being around Seafang all day, this would be a challenge to overcome as well. Her arms grew tired of handling all these friendly beasts, leaving Simone to wonder what the rest of the day would be like.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the crew seemingly appeased Simone regained her courage and spoke up. \"I guess the captain doesn't want you standing around all day, so let's get to work. Is there anything I can help with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnolls all scattered to get back to their tasks, only a few remained. The haggard veteran motioned for her to follow him. He took her to a selection of boxes, all of which looked like they were haphazardly looted and thrown in a pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the good-lookin stuff from last haul. Gotta find out what's worth keeping.\" He rumbled, sitting down beside the heap. Simone followed suit and pulled a box close. The gnoll grabbed a reinforced box, gave the lock a quick look and tore it open with savage strength. Inside were a wallet and some clothes. He put the wallet aside, checked again for other valuables and threw the clothes and ruined box aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone took a small box herself and inspected the contents. It seemed like random mechanical bits and pieces, but a glint in the corner drew her attention. A jeweled ring. She began to wonder who packed these boxes, but shrugged off the thought and placed the ring next to the wallet. She then held the box up to the gnoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know the ship, does random scrap like this have any use?\" She asked, the gnoll giving her a toothy smile. He gently took the box from her hands and threw it onto the junk pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, we got our stops for repairs. Just find the valuable things, chuck the rest.\" He tried his best not to sound intimidating, but the natural rumble in his voice was powerful all the same. Almost all the gnolls seemed to have it. Only Seafang was able to suppress it to a degree. Simone got back to her task, sifting through box after box of junk, fishing out assorted bits of jewelry, money and the like. It made her wonder what the beasts were doing when pillaging the ship. Judging by the contents of these boxes they had simply taken everything that wasn't nailed down. When she found a little personal safe she cheered a little, happy to have found something that would likely be full of valuables. The gnoll smiled along, extending his hand towards her. Simone quickly realized the safe was locked and handed it over, the beast making quick work of the metal box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she came across a box with a distinct red cross on it. She inspected the contents and put it in the pile of items to keep. This seemed to draw a mystified look from the veteran. \"What are you keeping that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's medicine, for if someone gets sick. Sounds valuable to me.\" She defended herself, making the gnoll burst out into laughter. He put a large hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, you poor, frail humans.\" He mused, giving her a toothy smile. \"I guess we'll keep it in case something happens to you, but rest assured that outside of a few bandages we won't need much of that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a hand on the scarred arm. \"So I see.\" She replied. The gnoll blushed a little at her gesture of pity, quickly boasting about how he earned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, this one was a hell of a battle. I was surrounded by five humans with knives. But if you think these scratches are bad, you should've seen how they looked after the fight.\" He held up a clawed hand, smiling proudly as he relives the memory. He stopped himself before he got into the grisly details, but Simone counters him with unexpected compassion. \"Aw, you poor thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe veteran wasn't sure how to react to her, blushing even brighter. Together they got back to work, Simone rifling through the various boxes and handing any locked containers over to the gnoll. Soon they had a small heap of precious items and a mountain of discarded scraps. In the hold of the ship it was hard to keep track of time, but Simon could scarcely believe she'd spent all day on this. The stories she exchanged with the veteran were pleasant, even if his tended to devolve into recounts of past glories a lot. Other gnolls occasionally butted in for small talk or to beg for a scratch behind the ear. The lingering smell of unwashed gnoll body odour was becoming ever more faint. Slowly Simone began to get accustomed to the stink, focusing on the task at hand instead. It was hard work made easy in good company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another loud feast for dinner the crew was beginning to turn to their sleeping quarters. The veteran gave Simone a look and she was surprised to see all of the cloth they'd discarded earlier had found its way down there. Apparently it wasn't as worthless as she thought. It lined the floor of what looked like a large den. There wasn't a bed in sight, but in one corner several sleeping gnolls were huddled together. The veteran explained that they were the night watch before asking Simone an unusual question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you... like to sleep here with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I don't think the captain would approve of that.\" She responded nervously. She didn't want to let the gnoll down after all the help he'd offered today. He just gave a short chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, don't worry about that. I'm pretty sure the captain will be joining us soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, the bedroom, his quarters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are for when he wants some private time. Don't worry, you'll love it with us.\" He hopped down and held out his arms to catch her. With some reluctance Simone jumped down as well, the veteran catching her with ease. Almost as a reflex he gave her a small kiss on the cheek before pulling back and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're making her feel right at home. Excellent work, mister Nightly.\" Seafang's voice rumbled from right behind her. There wasn't a hint of sarcasm or anger present though. He genuinely didn't seem to mind the veteran's little indiscretion. \"As for you, my treasure, I'll leave the choice to you. Would you like to go up to the captain's quarters or shall we join these happy lads as one big family?\"</span></div></div>",

Bellowing hyena-like yips and chuckles echoed through the empty hull until the captain finally regained his ability to speak. \"Hahaha, that's a good one. I don't think I've ever heard anyone refer to you as sweet, mister Nightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a first indeed, cap'n.\" The veteran nodded along, but Simone wasn't so easily thrown off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, that's kinda sad. You've never had any gnoll women in your life tell you that?\" She replied teasingly, making the two beasts share another amused chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, gnoll women aren't really into all that sappy stuff. If you can't wrestle them into submission they ain't interested.\" The veteran explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you ever just want a hug or something, I'd be happy to help. That is, if the captain is on <i>board </i>with it.\" She drew out her pun, making unflinching eye contact with Seafang. The gnoll pirate's expression melted into one of complete adoration. His date was catching on to their mannerisms so very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're monsters, not morons.\" Mister Nightly smirked, but as he tried to follow his sentence up the words died in his throat. He couldn't push himself past the embarrassment of asking her for a hug. He didn't quite know why it was so difficult, but he was nothing if not pragmatic. He simply opened his arms wide and put on his best puppy eyes, conveying his wants to Simone clearly. She gave him a quick scratch under his chin before wrapping her arms around his broad chest and pressing herself into him. The coarse fur and nasty smell weren't very nice, but the way she felt all the tension simply leave his body was close to magical. It made her wonder how many of these crewmen had never once received a hug in their lives and how much they might quietly yearn for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the weight fell from his shoulders, the veteran finally draped his strong arms around the slender human. He took the greatest care to watch his strength around her, holding her like she was made of fine porcelain. The lengthy, rumbling sigh of relief might've made him blush any other day, but this felt too good to let such petty things weigh him down. As their hug concluded he simply muttered a quick thank you and jumped back up out of the sleeping pit to resume his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might just be exactly what this ship needs.\" Seafang stated, a big toothy grin on his face. \"And especially what I want.\" He added, stepping in to give her a hug back as thanks for her efforts. They chatter a little more back and forth until the captain announces it's time to sleep. No sooner was the order given than the first gnolls came leaping down, landing on the floor with a dull thump. They were a little weary of the captain and Simone being there, but soon found themselves at ease, looking for a spot to sleep. In mere minutes the whole crew had gone in, their yips and chatter slowly making way for silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone watched her date slide out of the heavy captain's longcoat, folding it up into a makeshift pillow. He nestled himself between two resting crewmen, motioning for her to join him. She laid down beside the beast, shuffling up close into his embrace. His broad, fuzzy chest was warm. But as she got comfortable she felt another warm body push against her back. A crewman had shifted a little in his attempts to sleep, ensuring she was sandwiched between the gnolls. Whether she liked it or not, this was going to be her bed for the night. The collective stink of the gnolls was unpleasant, but Simone felt more accustomed to it by the minute. It faded into the background compared to the warm, loving embrace of Seafang.</span></div></div>",

The blonde young woman finally scored a date with one of the monsters from that new Monstr dating app. She was happy to hopefully meet someone she could rebound with. Sure, they\u2019d look radically different from her last boyfriend, but maybe a bit of change would be a good thing. It had only been a few days after graduation, and she still felt sad about leaving high school, leaving all of her friends\u2026 her cheer-team\u2026 and having her ex break-up with her during her final prom really left an especially sour taste in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had made sure to set-up her date on a night on a weekend when her parents would be away on a business trip, she was fairly certain her parents were unaware of both the existence of monsters and the app. She wasn\u2019t sure how they\u2019d react to her going from bringing a cute, buff soccer-player with dimpled-cheeks and a charming quiff, to a ten-foot dragon-guy or a werewolf. Just after she tied her hair in a bun she heard her phone vibrate again her bed, she picked up the phone and squealed\u2026 it was her date! She was so excited to meet them face-to-face\u2026 or\u2026 face-to-snout? She got her things and rushed down the stairs, quickly opening her front door to lock eyes with the grinning monster before her. Who exactly was her date?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles the Manticore - A bit of a jock, with a large ego, Miles stands at an impressive 11-feet with a very intimidating lion head, a muscular body, fearsome claws, and a massive wing-span. Miles loves to show off to his friends, professors, parents\u2026 and now his new girlfriend. He\u2019s particularly excited he\u2019s been able to \u2018nab a human\u2019. Considering his ego, it can be a bit difficult to get personable with Miles, but he is very loyal and kind, if a bit self-absorbed. Hopefully their date won\u2019t just be Miles showing off his laundry-list of sporting awards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina the Snake-Lady - A humanoid serpent, a bit taller than your average human, with a lengthy and muscular tail sprouting from her rear end. Sabrina is a bit of a prankster, with a passion for comedy\u2026 even if her comedy is a bit \u2018hands on\u2019. She\u2019s very boisterous and loud, and loves to tell jokes or test out her routines with her friends and loved ones. Considering she is a humanoid snake creature, she loves using her swallowing abilities and overall place above humans in the food chain as a way to \u2018prank\u2019 them by gulping them down, hunting, and teasing them. Despite her odd taste in humor, Sabrina is a very cuddly and sappy early 19-year-old snake woman who\u2019s very excited to have a human date. She\u2019s also quite thick and chubby considering she is a very big eater, with a muffin-top belly, tree-trunk limbs and large assets.</span></div></div>",

Dalango usually has  twelve tentacles, also covered with fur, and each limb approximately four meters long and five centimeters in diameter, tapering off at the end. Each limb is quite strong, and Dalango can operate each limb independently. Dalango can morph the ends of each tentacle to tiny mouths, which he uses to speak and feed. (Dalango strictly eats shrimp and small fish in the water. On land, he loves vegetable, but even the sight of his dates eating non-fish meat makes him nauseous). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalango is a very gentle, shy sort, but very playful and tactile one he gets to know someone (his people are reminiscent of otters in their behavior). He can cause his tentacles to merge or split a needed. On land he uses his tentacles for a sort of rambling walk, but in the water he is very agile and quick. He has never really interacted with a human before, so he is both excited and nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Saxet the Titan</b></u> -- The fifteen meter tall male giant may look like a giant dark haired Adonis, but in reality he is a giant nerd (pun intended).

Possibly the best example of how one of Wahasha's people look is the Beast from the Beauty and the Beast. Ironically, the transformed Prince Adam behaved nothing like one of Wahasha's people would act. They are a tribal people, fiercely loyal to family, friends and clan, and taught from an early age to behave in very polite ways at all times. It would not do, however, to mistake Wahasha's kindness for weakness. Wahasha's people are know for their ferocity in battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWahasha stands more than two meters tall and is solidly built. His fur is always washed and brushed, and he typically wears well kept and well fitting clothing one might expect an eighteenth century well to do Englishman to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>James</b></i></u> -- James is a ghost. Maybe. He can communicate, sort of, with half whispered words and projected emotions. He can sometimes touch so that if feels like a human being, and sometimes just like the hint of a soft breeze. How he got on the Monstr App, no one is really sure. Maybe it summoned him from beyond the grave, or from the Spirit Dimension. Maybe he wants to move on, or maybe he just wants to get laid. No one is sure. But whatever his motives, he's sure to make an interesting and  memorable date!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Teritus \"Dawg\" Milicai</b></i></u> -- Teritus is a six foot six, leanly muscled anthrowolf/snowboard hound. Something of a loaner, he continually migrates to stay in wintry conditions where he can pursue his main passion, snowboarding.Teritus is an easygoing sort who never pushes himself on anyone. If you like him, he's happy. If not, your loss, and he's moving on to the next snowboarding tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Quartus Milicai</b></i></u> Teritus' older brother, he is the more serious, responsible brother. Where Teritus is happy to hook up, Quartus wants a longer lasting romantic relationship. Of the two, Quartus is actually the more athletic, but pursues more martial oriented sports. Quartus tends to be more serious than his brother, is taller, and has more scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was about a foot taller than average, and though he wasn't dumb, he was a bit sow compared to other giants. So when the time came, he was one of the few of his friends who didn't go to university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hugo's secret shame was that he was a pervert. At least by Giant Standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, although most Giants \"liked it rough,\" Hugo was the gentle sort. Maybe this was a reaction to the fact he was was always bigger than the other giants, even when he was growing up. Most giants would naturally give in to their bullying instincts. But for some reason, Hugo's reaction was to go the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo didn't have much luck with giant women either. He had the looks and the equipment that attracted giant women, but Hugo much preferred \"rubbing\" rather than \"penetrating.\" And Hugo's inherent gentleness was a complete turnoff to potential giantess lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hugo was secretly sexually attracted to human women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost giants detest humans, least of all because of their long history of being on the losing side of any and all conflicts with humanity. If a human was found in the land of the giants, the human was firmly escorted out of giant land. No harm was ever done to the intruding human, for fear of a human retaliation. But most giants liked to pretend humans didn't exist, unless forcibly confronted with their reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not Hugo. Hugo had been fascinated by humans ever since learning about them in elementary school. And when Hugo started going through puberty, his fascination became sexual fantasies about human women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo had the good sense not to share his fantasies with any other giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the MONSTR app came along, Hugo wanted instantly to download it. Unfortunately for him, the app was almost immediately illegal in giant land. It took him forever to get a pirated copy of the app,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he did, Hugo put in for a two week vacation at work, explaining he would be going on a backpacking trip to a remote region of Giant Land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, most of his co-workers could care where he went, and probably wouldn't notice if he never returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo eagerly started going through the app, and when he came across a dark beauty named Donna, he immediately swiped right, And to his surprise and delight, Donna indicated she wanted a date with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here he was, on her front lawn. To a curious onlooker, no one would see anything but an empty lawn. The app projected that illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo knelt down in front of the door and gently tapped on it. Moments later, Donna stepped out of the door, looking even more beautiful than even her picture. He admired how her dark, straight hair hung past her shoulders, how her brown eyes radiated warmth, how the loose T-shirt didn't conceal her prominent breasts, or how the jeans revealed a firm butt and slightly narrow but still womanly hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo was so enraptured by Donna's appearance that she had to repeat herself twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" Hugo asked, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said it was very nice to meet you, and I would invited you in, but...\" Donna gestured at her parent's living room and then at Hugo's height. Hugo laughed, suddenly feeling more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay. We can just start on our date,\" Hugo answered. \"So where did you want to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna answered, \"I was thinking we could go to </span></div></div>",

What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarv looked, and saw both Steve Scapali and John Jameson enter the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's talk business,\" said Steve. \"Seems you owe quite a bit of money on this shop, Marline. I'm willing to take this debt off of your hands, in exchange for the shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only my mother and teachers were allowed to call me Marline,\" said Marv. \"You're not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My agency will collect one day, or another,\" said John. \"After that, the shop will be sold. This might be your last chance for a peaceful solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's a threat, I can report you to the Better Business Bureau,\" said Marv. \"In fact, if you're working together on this, I can report you both for Conflict of Interest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve chuckled. \"Try it.

She looked at the two feline-like beings. \"Um, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah smiled. \"Not a problem, miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarv then saw Hank peek his head into the doorway. \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I couldn't help, Marv,\" Hank said, looking embarrassed. \"They just pushed past me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hired you to fix cars, not play security,\" said Marv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whomever your date is, they've got serious money,\" said Hank, as he came in, stepping around the bodyguards, carefully. \"They showed up in a stretch limousine, the kind that allows for twenty people in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pelor, and his family are, <i>indeed</i>, wealthy,\" said the lion-man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he can help out,\" Hank said, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if he sends those who need their cars looked after,\" said Marv. She looked at the bodyguards. \"Um, how many are with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us, another bodyguard, and the driver, who does a good job in a pinch, and yourself and Pelor,\" said the cheetah-man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Marv said, as she walked to the door. \"Hank, clean and close up shop for the night. See you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me if you need a ride,\" said Hank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarv looked at him, and chuckled. \"I'll keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marv stepped outside, she was surprised to see the stretch limousine. The price on it was certainly easily a hundred thousand dollars. She had to admit, the grease monkey in her wanted to pop the hood and check the engine out. \"If he ever needs a mechanic, I hope he has me in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bodyguards chuckled, before escorting her to the limousine.

To be honest though, I'm surprised at the horrors humans can do. Demons have <i>nothing</i> on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarv thought about the things that had been invented during wars that did a lot of damage, death, and destruction. \"I hope you're not going to say that elves are superior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelor scoffed. \"Hardly. We can be just as much of an asshole as a human can be. Same with any other monster race. Of course, most try to be decent, as it's much easier to get what one wants when they don't act like a douchebag over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarv had to blink. \"You're certainly not talking like I'd thought than an elf would talk. Then there's your choice of vehicle - this thing probably takes a lot of gasoline to keep running. Not exactly environmentally friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Language is quite infectious, and English seems to be the most commonly used language, along with this one Chinese dialect called Mandarin,\" said Pelor. \"That being said, we're still working on how to improve this thing, so that it can use something that's easy to produce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Marv. She looked, and saw, sitting about five feet from her, the lion-man and the cheetah-man. Then, there was the partition, and she saw sitting in the driver seat, something that looked like a human-sized bird, with a human-sized lizard sitting next to them. \"If you forgive me, but this reminds me of something out of those <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movies. That or <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelor laughed at this. \"Good movies, and that game is fun. D&amp;D5e has a lot of options. Can't wait to see how they handle different elf-mixes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Marv asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that there's some truth to the various subraces those games like to do,\" said Palor. \"My own father could have been the inspiration behind the Drow known as Drizzt Do'Urden. As for my mother, Arwen from the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> books could have been based off of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> was written during the 1950's,\" said Marv. \"Are you saying that your mother is over eighty years old?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalor chuckled. \"Try three hundred, and you're getting closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me that you're less than fifty,\" said Marv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty-seven years,\" said Pelor. \"We live for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that you're of Legal Age then,\" said Marv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelor chuckled. \"Everything's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Marv. \"So, where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelor grinned. \"I think you might like it.\"</span></div></div>",

But as his home faded into myth and legend the amount of human visitors slowly decreased to nothing. Not that it made all that much difference. The only humans he ever came across ran away screaming. After all this time though, there was finally hope. An app that could get him in touch with someone who wouldn't run at the sight of his 12 foot tall half-man half-bull figure. Tim was a little hesitant at first, but to his surprise it didn't take long to find a match. Nervous as all hell, he waits at the entrance of his labyrinth to receive his first visitor in centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnaw the gnoll wrestler. Infamous in the village for his skills in the ring and his knack for using his unwashed body to dominate opponents, he's had a wide choice of gnoll ladies fawning over him. But secretly he was looking for something a bit harder to get. Being a 7 foot beast with a big paunch and muscles for days was standard for all gnolls, but he felt himself drawn to something wildly different. Something soft and tender. A waifish little human girl for the gnoll to cuddle and spoil all day long. What few humans were around didn't have a lot of status in his village. They were mostly servants and treated like dirt. But that wouldn't be the fate of the girl he met through Monstr. Gnaw would treat his new girlfriend like a princess, and woe betide anyone who would dare hurt her. Hopefully she wouldn't mind the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTinkle the pixie. Who'd have thought that being a magical faerie could get this dull. The same old 9 to 5 routine of mischief in the forest and doing menial nonsense like collecting teeth for some weirdo to make children believe in her. It didn't really matter to him anymore. He'd found the app and immediately Tinkle knew this was a way to get closer to those humans. Being with someone ten times taller than him sounded like the exact kind of thing that could help overthrow this monotony. Not to mention how turned on the pixie was whenever he got near them. He put on his shiniest enchantment to avoid any 'accidents' and flies down to his date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim Clemson. A pudgy frog-man with a temper nearly as foul as his smell. He's lived peacefully in his swamp for many years. Every few months he might bump into a hiker, but most of them just end up pissing him off. And when Slim gets mad, his belly gets hungry. For all the headaches they cause, those hikers were at least a tasty treat squirming around in his gut. This changed when he met a young woman who didn't immediately scream in his face or try to fight him off when he crossed her path. She was surprisingly understanding of the strange frog-man and the two of them sat in the middle of the swamp chatting happily for hours. He even helped her get back to her car when it was starting to get dark. She told him about the Monstr app, where he might find other friendly humans. She even promised that if he made a profile she'd try to find it so they could learn more about eachother and maybe meet again. </span></div></div>",

Now the endless maze of halls echoed with heavy footsteps. Timothy, or Tim as he had started to call himself on Monstr, was on his way to the entrance. It would take a human lifetime to learn to navigate this place, but he'd been around for over 2000 years. One of the benefits of having a divinely spawned bull for a father, apparently. A pity it also cursed him with this monstrous body that got him locked in here. A powerful binding kept him from ever walking out the door, but nothing stopped him from inviting others. The tall bull man was expecting his visitor to arrive soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached the entrance and straightened himself up one last time. Hopefully this girl was ready for him. It would be the first time in his very long life that he'd be face to face with a woman that didn't run away screaming. He wasn't sure such people even existed, but after a few weeks on Monstr he learned that they weren't just there, they were eager to meet him. A few minutes passed and suddenly there was a knock on the door. The minotaur was startled, but quickly composed himself. He put on his friendliest smile and opened up the large, wooden door. He looked down to see an awestruck woman staring up at him. She was just under half his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome.

Part of her wanted to cry out in shock, but she'd not spent days chatting back and forth with this guy just to lose her cool now. She eyed him up and down laboriously, almost salivating over what she say. 12 feet of muscle covered in a chocolate brown short fur. Alice liked her boyfriends on the taller side and this was more than she could have ever hoped for. She stammered out an awkward greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... Hey. Wow... You look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim flinched, feeling a wave of regret set in. It was probably too much to ask for some human girl to be able to feign interest in him. Maybe it was better if this didn't go any further. But before the minotaur could doubt himself further, she took a step forward and finished her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look incredible. The stories I've heard don't paint your image well.\" She gushed before composing herself a little. The woman felt somewhat nervous. Firstly because compared to him she felt very overdressed. She wore a dainty silk dress with some stylish flats whereas he didn't get further than a ragged loincloth. Though he'd told her that his options were limited when locked in a giant maze. Still, it left little to the imagination and allowed him to showcase every inch of his muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... thank you. Please, come in.\" The bull-man replied with a smile, reaching out a large hand. Alice laid her arm in his palm and for a moment he froze. He gently grabbed her arm and simply held it, overcome with emotion. This was the first physical human contact he'd experienced in 2000 years. She played along for a while, giving the minotaur a strange look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... could I have my arm back?\" She asked jokingly. Tim realized how odd that must've been and quickly lets go. He tries his best to shrug off the revelation he'd just experienced and tries to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... It's just been so very long. Please, follow me. And stay close. Many humans have lost their lives in this maze.\" He motions down a hallway and begins walking. Alice follows closely behind, trying to hide the fact that she's staring at his ass. She had a hard time keeping her mind out of the gutter with such beauty in front of her. To break the ice she tries to joke with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that? Some scary minotaur killed them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! Because you could spend a hundred years wandering these passages and still not see every room. I rarely find what's left as anything more than a decayed skeleton.\" He sounded hurt and Alice struggled to grasp why. Wasn't this all just sort of part and parcel for monsters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, didn't mean to assume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. It's hard to get to know what's really going on with me when most people would die trying to reach me. Every few years some foolhardy explorer comes in and they always get lost. I guess there's a silver lining though. The most recent casualty had a smartphone, so I was finally able to free myself from complete isolation. No idea how it still had any charge in the battery, but I guess it's for the same reason there's light in here when we're underground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nodded, still trying to hide her oggling his body. She hadn't even given a moment's thought to how there was light in here. \"Yeah.. I guess. So I suppose that whole eating people thing is a load of bullshit too? No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, none taken. And yes, I've never eaten any person. Though since everyone who set foot in here so far has died, I can see why some might come to that conclusion. So how about you? What possessed you to try dating monsters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shuffled nervously, blushing a little. \"I've always loved being with someone bigger than me. Being the tiny spoon, having a big man tower over me and protect me. I know it probably sounds really lame, but... I like someone who can just wrap me up in a hug and make all my worries go away.\" Tim smiled and nodded, but he had a followup question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me then? I'm sure there's some proper mountain giants on Monstr. As far as big goes, I'm on the shorter end of the monsters out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... your picture on Monstr looked really cute and to be fair I'm afraid those really big guys would accidentally hurt me. You seem careful enough not to let that happen.\" She said, her whole face bright red. Alice wasn't a star in this romantic crap and she felt more embarrassed than ever. She was so busy overthinking every second that she hadn't noticed Tim was no longer moving. She nearly walked right up against his ass, stopping herself before things got weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've set up a little sleeping quarter down this hall, close to the entrance. It's not much, but it's as close to home as I can offer.\" The bull-man said nervously. Alice blinked and nodded. She realized she had already lost count on the number of halls they passed. Or have they not gone past a single one yet? The maze was playing tricks on her, she was sure of it. Thankfully the best solution to her problem was staying nice and close to her handsome date. They soon arrive at a small room. Small by Tim's standards at least. In the corner was an improvised bedroll and most of the room was decorated with scraps of cloth and old weapons and armor, no doubt leftovers from others that went in to explore this maze.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't sure what to make of any of this, but her curiosity was thoroughly tingled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of it, yeah. Though most of these are actually offerings left by people. They'd just dump it in the entrance. The few notes that came with all that stuff told me it was apparently some sort of appeasement. Y'know, in case I ever got out and started to do monster things to them.\" Tim responded, chuckling at first before becoming a bit more downbeat. It felt painful to think about. These people gave him gifts because they were deathly afraid of his wrath. And though he'd have a few choice words for the cruel king that locked him in here, he had no intention of ever harming anyone. Alice could see the minotaur's somber expression and hastily changed the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that reminds me. You mentioned in your texts that there was something you wanted my help with? But you didn't want to say it over text. What is it? Why didn't you want to just tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim felt flustered at the sudden barrage of questions. Not the least because of the painful reason he didn't dare put his concerns in text. He felt his face redden and with the best awkward stammer he had the minotaur tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're the first person I've talked to for more than two sentences in... ever. I was hoping you'd be willing to... teach me some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What kind of things?\" Alice asked inquisitively. Her date swallowed his doubts and finally spat out what was on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C... Can you teach me to kiss someone? I know it sounds stupid but-\" The bull-man found himself interrupted by Alice as she raised her finger. The woman had to fight to subdue a chuckle at his situation, but it didn't seem that strange when she thought about it. This poor guy hasn't had contact with anyone for decades. How was he supposed to ever gain any experience kissing a girl if he's never met a living one before that didn't scream and run?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I reckon I can, big guy. Firstly, I need to get a bit closer to that pretty face of yours. Can you get down?\" She beckoned, but the minotaur had different ideas. He remembered how much she liked to feel embraced by a stronger man. Carefully Tim wraps his hands around his date's waist and slowly he lifts her off her feet. She gasped with surprise, but the fear soon made way for a childlike smile of wonderment. She was so light and fragile in his powerful grasp. With all the care he could muster the bull-man brings Alice close to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you know how to impress...\" She mused to herself, fluttered by this display of strength. He picked her up like it was nothing, but now it was time for the next step. \"Right, back to the kiss. It's not really that complicated. You just kinda purse your lips a little and plant them on me. Try a tidy little kiss on the cheek first.\" She suggested, pointing at her right cheek. The minotaur briefly pictured himself taking her suggestion out of context and kissing her asscheek, but such silly thoughts were quickly banished. He did as his date instructed and planted an awkward kiss on her cheek. It felt weird to do, but strangely pleasant. For Alice it was surprisingly nice too. A bit forceful, but the minotaur managed to quickly correct himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a natural at this. Now let's step it up a bit. A French kiss is more of the same, but you kiss me on the mouth and let your tongue play with mine.\" The woman spoke with thinly disguised glee. She already imagined his thick, bovine tongue playing with her. Tim did not disappoint, following her instructions with gusto. He felt her take hold of his head to prolong the event, beaming with pride that his first time was worth extending. Alice's dreams came true as his large tongue danced around in her mouth. The taste was completely irrelevant as she struggled to keep up with the beast's sheer size. After several more passionate kisses the minotaur finally set his date back down on the ground. She felt flustered, possibly even aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had talked at length about how far they were willing to take this date. Both were ready to go all the way if the mood allowed it. And whether it was Tim's beautiful, strong body or oafish charm, she felt ready to take this much further. The woman shot him a seductive glare so over the top even he couldn't miss it. The minotaur approached, standing in all his towering, muscular might before his date. Where did she want to take this next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmmm... I think you and I both want the same thing...\" Alice mused seductively. Tim wasn't entirely sure what she was alluding to, but it clicked the instant she began to take off her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you don't waste any time with this. Is that normal for a human date?\" He asked sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted and turned, trying to get her fancy dress off. The damn thing had been a nightmare to get into. She just stammered an awkward laugh, failing to respond with anything more than an annoyed grunt. Tim was quick to the rescue, offering her a strong arm to lean on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon dammit, don't ruin this moment for me.\" She hissed under her breath when finally the zipper of her dress flew into motion. In one smooth move the silk came free and fell to the floor. Alice looked up to see Tim's eyes widen with amazement. Beneath her dress all she wore was a white lace negligee. It left almost nothing covered, the dainty straps and patches so thin they were practically imaginary. Seeing her date this cowed by her naked body felt great, but her curiosity was drawn further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had been thinking about this long before they met up. Through their texts she'd floated the idea before, but Tim had no frame of reference to provide a good answer. If he stood twice as tall as a man, would that translate to his endowment too? And what extra length would being a mythical beast add? She was eager to find out as she took a step closer, standing face to face with the bull-man's shaggy loincloth. He seemed a little confused at what she was doing. Suddenly she put a hand near the top of his only garment and ran it down along the length of it. She giggled a little when she felt what it was concealing. It was clear that his divine background had not skimped on the important parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's my turn then...\" Tim said with as much confidence as he could muster. He felt out of his depth compared to the small woman taking charge. But if she wanted to see what was behind the curtains, he would gladly blow her mind. His baritone voice was enough to make Alice's legs feel unsteady already. Just wait until she got a look at his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood enraptured as he pushed the loose waistband down, letting the loincloth flop to his ankles and stepping out of the little heap of cloth. There wasn't a thread of clothing anymore on the minotaur and his package swung freely in front of his date. It felt wrong to expose himself not even an hour after inviting her into his home, but the look on her face told him she wasn't going to complain. Seeing it hang there made Alice feel even smaller than before. It was thick, dark brown bordering on black and topped with a flared tip. A heavy musk filled the air. She raised a hand, curious to touch it before realizing how weird it must look for her to be so fixated on his groin. She looked up into his big bovine eyes and stammered out her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... It's huge... Can I... touch it?\" The woman blushed brightly. Tim just shrugged, pleased to see she was impressed by what he was packing. She put her hand at the base, running her dainty fingers all along the shaft. It drew a subdued moo from the bull-man, causing her to look up and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry...\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" She said, patting his cock again. This time it throbbed with excitement, twitching a little and slowly starting to grow erect. Alice took off her skimpy underwear, standing every bit as naked as her date. She knew she wanted to show him the dizzying heights of an orgasm, but how does she go about pleasing this beast of a man?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice blushed a little as she imagined what was about to happen next. First though, she felt obliged to get Tim as aroused as she was. Without a hint of fear she grabbed hold of the shaft with both hands and began to rub it. The large minotaur's whole body shivered as he was overwhelmed by the sensation. He didn't quite understand why this felt so great. Being alone for millennia meant he helped himself from time to time, but her dainty little hands provoked things from him he'd never experienced before. The floppy mass grew quickly in her hands, the woman only encouraging it further. If she wasn't careful he'd blow his load before they even got started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmpf... Isn't this... a little quick... for a first date?\" The shy bull-man asked, grunting and huffing as he was awed by the vigor with which his date was polishing his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably?\" Alice replied. \"But this isn't exactly a normal date anyway, so who cares, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't fault her logic, even if he worried about embarrassing himself in front of her. After a few minutes she slowed her pace and looked at him proudly. The minotaur's cock stood rigid and erect, twitching a little with desire. Alice naughtily brought her hand down to her own groin and began to rub it. The small amounts of Tim's pre that leaked onto her fingers from before served to lubricate her action. After mere moments of this pleasure she looked Tim in his big eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on. Do it. Make love to me like only a big, strong beast of a man like you could.\" She said, half-moaning already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? I'm way too big for that. You'd get hurt. I don't want to hurt you.\" Tim said, staring with concern at the increasingly horny woman. Alice wasn't about to take no for an answer though. She'd fantasized for too long about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me. Let's just say I've got experience with large men. I'll be fine. Just go slowly and enjoy it. I'll let you know if it's too much.\" She said, her voice a mix of reassuring and thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur hesitated for a moment, but he trusted her. Carefully he picked her up again, holding her with both hands and bringing her up close with his cock. The tip twitched as it dragged along her belly and down towards its destination. Alice moaned as she felt the thick, flared tip press against her pussy. She could feel the bull-man's heartbeat with each subtle throb. Tim was still hesitant to continue, but the look in her eyes told him she was dying for him to get a move on. And something about feeling the wet warmth of her most intimate region pressed against his manhood was certainly arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooh...\" Alice moaned as she felt the pressure between her legs mount. He was really going to do it. That monster cock was going to penetrate her. She'd been reassuring before, but now that she could feel it actually enter her doubts began to spring up. Her worries were suppressed when the minotaur entered her, sending a powerful rush of pleasure through her. She felt like putty in his big, strong hands. His gentleness was greatly appreciated, as she savoured every new millimeter of his shaft burrowing into her. He took the greatest care to be slow and methodical, letting her feel in control even as his massive cock was slowly exploring her nethers. It filled her so completely it was impossible for him not to hit all the right spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was shocked to see her moaning lewdly even after sliding himself halfway into her. He'd expected some form of protest or simply a barrier as he'd reach the maximum depth, but this woman seemed damn near bottomless. More and more of his manhood was enveloped by her love tunnel, bathing it in an eerie warmth like he'd never felt before. Could this strange woman really take all he had to offer? Were all human women able to handle beasts like him that stood twice their size? It felt so good, he definitely wasn't going to stop her from trying.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice moaned loudly as she felt her insides being probed by the massive manhood of Tim. He was everything she could dream of and more. And judging by his heavy breathing, he was thinking much the same about her. Though there was still concern in his eyes, she did the best she could to reassure him between the waves of pleasure overwhelming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim steadily pushed the woman down, letting more and more of his length be surrounded by her warmth. She'd already taken on far more then he ever thought possible for any human woman and there still was no end in sight. How much longer before the tip would start pushing up her neck and out her mouth? Finally he was met with the eerie sensation of her ass pressed against the base of his dick. She'd pulled off the impossible and taken it all. His throbbing shaft was buried completely inside of Alice and all he could think about is how good it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the limit still not found the bull-man gained some confidence, pulling himself back a little before plunging his mass in deep. He'd been carefully exploring at first, now it felt like he could fuck her in earnest. His grip on her body tightened and his smile widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice realized that her minotaur date was about to kick things up a gear and all she could think of doing was whisper \"Do it.\" up towards him. She felt the thick mass of his cock slide partway out only to drive itself back in to her. It was amazing. Both her pussy and his cock were soaking wet, a few dribbles leaking onto the floor with each thrust. It slickened the process, making it easy for Tim to up the tempo, steadily pumping in and out. His heavy, near feral breathing only aroused her further. They were so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more vigorous thrusts the dam finally burst. Tim let out what sounded like a mix of mooing and moaning and Alice joined in. A wave of heat entered her, his member spraying a huge load into her depths. She felt practically aglow with his seed whilst her pussy clenched around the meaty pillar, desperate to keep it inside for as long as possible. The minotaur kept on releasing more and more inside of her, the excess beginning to leak out. The small dribble turned to a flood the moment he pulled his wilting manhood out, making a mess on the floor. He pulled her close to his muscular chest, exchanging his awkward grip with a powerful hug. Alice quickly returned the favor, wrapping her arms around as much of his torso as she could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the first to speak after this intimate moment. With excitement in her voice she complimented her date. \"That was something else. I knew this night would be unforgettable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim gave her a pleased grin in return. \"You can say that again. What even happened just now? I'm not sure that was supposed to be possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Alice replied coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you able to handle all of me? You're less than half my size. Or are humans just ridiculously well-endowed for their body sizes?\" He sounded frustrated, unable to make sense of it. Alice pitied the poor monster and finally revealed her secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, a normal human would've probably been badly hurt by that big package of yours. But I didn't want you to have to hold back. So I may or may not have met with a different monster earlier. And they might have given me a little 'help' in handling things far too large for ordinary humans.\" She didn't know how he was going to react. At first his embrace seemed to loosen, letting her crane her head far enough back to look into his big eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did that... for me?\" He asked, still a little incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Alice said with as much confidence as she could. It wasn't just for Tim, but she didn't want to spoil the moment. She almost wished she had as the bull-man showed his gratitude by tightening his hug, those strong arms now squeezing her so badly it became hard to breathe. She was pressed fiercely against those rock-hard muscles, feeling a whole new wave of arousal coming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his date was daydreaming in his arms Tim sat down, still holding her against his chest. It seemed like this strange woman was an exception from normal humans, but he was just happy to have someone to share this moment with. After so many centuries without any kind of contact, he almost wished she'd never leave his side.</span></div></div>",

I've not got much for you to sleep on, but~\" Tim was interrupted as she laid a finger on his lips. She patted his muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got plenty for me to sleep with.\" She whispered seductively, making the minotaur smile. He held on to her tightly as he laid himself down, preparing for some pretty ridiculous level of spooning. It felt more like a teaspoon and a soup ladle, but neither of them were deterred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\" She mused, puckering her lips and expecting a good night kiss. Tim smiled and responded in kind, his baritone voice sending a delighted shiver down her spine, followed by his big lips pressing up against hers. They shared this passionate moment with closed eyes, their tongues dancing around one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minotaur laid down to sleep he raised an arm and snapped his fingers. The strange, ambient lighting around them dimmed, allowing the pair the darkness they needed to rest in. But it didn't take long for Alice to notice something odd. Her head was nestled against his pecs and she listened to the heartbeat inside. Where she expected a calm, steady thrum it was instead racing far faster than she would have imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim? Are you okay?\" She said, keeping her voice low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yeah...\" He responded absent-mindedly. It's a good thing it was dark, or she would've seen him blush bright red. He didn't want to tell her, but he was daydreaming about all the intimacy he'd felt today. Almost inevitable this stirred up something in his loins too. The next hint he gave Alice was a whole lot less ambiguous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the warm tip of his cock bump into her leg and suddenly it clicked for her. She clambered up a little to get closer to his head. With a slightly smug tone she whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still horny, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Uhhh...\" Tim stammered, feeling embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I.\" She added before lowering herself down along his body. Tim's embarrassment turned to lust as he wanted nothing more than to please this wonderful woman. And now he had her permission to do it he wouldn't keep her waiting. His strong hands took hold of her hips, navigating them towards the tip of his cock. The darkness only added to the intimacy as Alice held on to his strong body, ready to let him ravage her again. She moaned as the broad tip pressed against her pussy and cried out with pleasure as it took the plunge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim felt more confident, knowing the woman he was making love with had no limits as to the amount of cock she could hold. But he had no interest in just fucking her and being done with it. He would take things slow and steady, just to draw out the intense pleasure. His powerful thrusts drew a small moan from her every time, more and more of the thick shaft sinking into her bottomless pussy. He could feel her twitching and thrashing in his embrace, spasms of intimate joy wracking her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... YES...\" Alice moaned, feeling his girthy mass intruding in her body. She was fearless, knowing her preparation would protect her against his size. Whenever he slowed down too much she bucked her hips, practically forcing herself down on the veiny shaft. His deep voice made the grunts in the dark sound menacing, but his comforting hold on her made it had to feel anything other than aroused and safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the rush of hot spunk came and the bull-man held his lover down firmly. Not a drop would be spilled onto the bed. She moaned alongside him, feeling this fresh batch join the previous one deep inside her. Exhausted by another intense round of sex the two simply laid motionless, the minotaur's wilting cock still lodged inside of her. Even flaccid it felt enormous. Alice moaned softly, begging him to leave it there.</span></div></div>",

He gave a tired shrug, leaving her stuck on his manhood as she desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice rested herself against her date's belly, smiling as his large arms wrapped around her to provide further comfort. Everything seemed to be just right. The bull-man's soft body, his kind embrace. Even the gently throbbing mass embedded inside of her felt great. She closed her eyes, drifting to sleep and dreaming vividly about her encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the other, they shared the same lewd dreams. In it they were having sex like before, but the size difference was even more skewed. Tim's manhood was bigger than Alice's body, but this didn't deter them from going at it like their lives depended on it. Her body stretched around his cock like a novelty condom and all she did was cry out for more. Almost on command the bull-man grew, the scenario verging on the comical. Finally they reached a shared climax, crying and moaning with pleasure. All around them the world seemed to fade until the sheer, raw joy was all that was left in their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice woke up first, discovering her dream was only partially a dream. In his sleep, the minotaur had not only gotten hard again. He'd blown another load inside of her, her belly feeling heavy with his seed. Though the labyrinth provided no visible way to tell how much time had passed, she knew it was morning. She rubbed her date's belly, hoping to gently wake him up too. She got more than she bargained for when Tim yawned loudly, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah.\" rang out from between his legs, the bull-man looking down to find he'd dragged his date along on his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... sorry.\" He mumbled, wrapping his hands around her waist and finally freeing her from this lewd impalement. She moaned as the girthy shaft pressed against her most sensitive points upon exiting. But as this heavy cork was popped, a flood of gooey cum was released with it. It made Tim blush to see how much he'd pumped into her, but all Alice could do was laugh, easing his nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sleep well?\" He asked, still a little concerned he might've made her uncomfortable last night. Alice gave him a reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. I dreamt about you.\" She winked shyly.

With each passing second more of the dream faded from his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were so... hard...\" She returned, giving him a suggestive grin and running her hand along his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim blushed, getting up onto his feet. Alice wasn't so quick to follow though, staying seated on his bed. The minotaur turned around and gave her a curious look. She gave him a mysterious smile before speaking up.</span></div></div>",

Last night was the best night of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim turned beet red hearing this woman gush about him and his sexual prowess. He didn't have much of a frame of reference, but he could honestly admit that living with her might not be the worst thing to happen to him. It seemed like the least he could do to reward her for ending his imprisonment. Not to mention that last night was pretty damn epic for him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you say? Are you ready to leave this maze behind and come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur struggled to keep it together. Part of him wanted to hug her so much she'd snap in half, but for now he contained his gratitude and nodded. He swept her off her feet and cradled her in his powerful arms. Alice giggled as he walked briskly down the corridors towards the entrance. The steadily hastening rhythm of his footsteps belied his excitement, putting an even wider smile on her face. The bull man stopped near the front door, setting his date down. She walked outside and beckoned him over. Cautiously he took a step out of the front door. The oppressive force coercing him back was there, but something felt different. He pushed on and to his amazement he could feel the resistance peter out. What few last vestiges were left soon faded away. She had done it. The first human to meet him in millenia and she had freed him from the labyrinth. Tim felt like the luckiest minotaur in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice watched him take his first cautious steps before seeing her date practically glow with joy. It made her next question an easy one to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, you're free. But now that you are, have you considered my offer? You and I would live together long and happily on my farm. I'll introduce you to all my friends. But I understand if you want to go out and see more of the world than just my little home. I can't expect you to trade sitting in one place all the time for sitting in another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could make more excuses Tim reached down and put a finger on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've spent thousands of years cooped up in here, I can handle a few decades with you.\" He said calmly. The sad truth was that in his millenia-long lifespan, the time he'd spend with her would be brief. But if last night was any indication, it would certainly be memorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice squealed with glee, hopping around and reaching up to request a hug from her date. Tim leaned down further and pulled her into a big, loving kiss. His bovine charm turned her legs to jelly as he passionately made out with her. She guides him to a parked van, apologizing for having put him in the back. He awkwardly nods, folding himself into the relatively small vehicle. By some miracle the suspension didn't buckle under his weight and soon the two were off. Alice's farm was several hours away, which they spent chatting about the world. Tim was eager to see more of it, but above everything else he was eager to show his gratitude to Alice. They occasionally exchanged a lengthy kiss, Alice having to park first since the experience made it impossible to pay attention to anything other than Tim. That thick, bovine tongue dancing around in her mouth was her own personal slice of heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they arrived at the farm. It was large and remote, the farmhouse looking a bit disheveled. She guided him to the barn, which had been mostly stripped out. She hadn't gone and furnished the place much, not wanting to feel so presumptuous as to expect him to automatically say yes to her invitation. Tim gave a calm laugh. He'd make this place a home quick enough. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a day or two, but with some hard work the minotaur had fancied the barn into a home. Some improvised furniture here, a floor not made of straw there. It wasn't as finely detailed as the farmhouse Alice lived in, but it was already a step up from the meager shelter in the labyrinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie, can you help me with this?\" Her voice rang out near the door. He pushed it open to see Alice standing alongside a strange machine. Tim was a little confused what she was planning, but she quickly filled him in. \"This is a milking machine I've had built for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large cow-man blushed. \"Uhm... Alice... I'm not a cow. I don't have udders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice burst out in laughter. \"I know, silly. There's a reason this thing only has one tube on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt quickly dawned on Tim what kind of 'milk' she was referring too, making him turn beet red. But just as quickly a question arose. \"But why though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's no secret I like to dabble in making potions and tinctures. It's how I was able to enjoy our night of passion without any fears of you hurting me. And my books tell me that your cum has all kinds of interesting properties. I mean, a divinely spawned bull for a father tends to mess with one's genetics.\" She mused, smiling at the minotaur's broad chest. \"So, do you want to give it a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" He said, looking nervously at the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I'll help you get in the mood and the moment you want to stop I'll take it off.\" She cooed reassuringly, but something felt a little off. She seemed almost impatient. Tim didn't think on it any further, sheepishly nodding. In a way he was a little curious to see what was going to happen next. He grabbed the machine whilst Alice walked up to his couch. It was a large stack of straw bales in a sturdy wooden frame covered in thick cloth. Tim sat down and she slid up beside him. The bull-man blushed a little as she pushed away his loincloth to reveal the bovine pillar waiting underneath. She was quick to put her hands on it, rubbing the flaccid pole and feeling it awaken. Once he was at near full mast she reached over and flipped a switch on the machine. It hummed calmly, warming up whilst Alice warmed her boyfriend up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped playing with his manhood before he'd spurt too soon and grabbed the cup from the machine. It was a clear plastic tube with a hose attached. The open end that was supposed to slide over his cock was covered in a soft, rubber ring. He mooed a little in surprise when the flared tip of his cock made contact. It felt strange, but not unpleasant. There was a strange pulling sensation that quickly dispersed as Alice carefully slipped more of his manhood into the cup. Next she reached down and massaged his balls. Time had never had anyone play with him like that before. He grunted and moaned as she sensually kneaded the two huge orbs. She could practically heard his half-divine seed sloshing within. With little further warning Tim let out a bellowing moan and erupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine was forced to work at full force, pumping the flood of cum down into its storage tanks just fast enough to stop the white geyser popping the cup off like a bottle rocket. Alice observed the process with quiet glee, seeing the gallons of white ooze blasting out of Tim's cock. It seemed nothing short of a miracle that she'd been able to ride that pole and take on an orgasm of such immense volume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim felt his whole body relax after that powerful climax, slumping back on the couch and panting deeply. He watched Alice carefully detach the cup from his shaft, giving the wilting length some appreciative strokes. But where he expected flirting she seemed more eager to inspect the machine's efforts. With a mechanical click the large canister holding his cum detached from the rest of the device. She tried to drag it, but the sheer amount of cum harvested made it almost impossible. Instead of asking Tim for help handling his 'milk' she looked around and grabbed a hand truck, hauling her prize away. She muttered something about needing to get it stored fast, but Tim found that hard to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days pass by she manages to smooth over the strange interaction by engaging in some more straight-forward one on one passion without any silly machines involved. But when days turn to weeks Tim was starting to notice she'd replace more and more of this sex with just milking him again. What was she doing with it all? By now she was pumping him for enough cum to practically bathe in the stuff. His shy nature stopped him from prying too much, moreover because he felt she had earned it by freeing him from the labyrinth. But several months later he couldn't help but conclude that the love he'd felt for her during their first date was gone.</span></div></div>",

Her expression becomes a little upset and she steps up to the large bull-man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim wasn't shocked in the slightest by her appearance. By now she'd practically made it a routine to use her machine once in the morning and once in the evening. He began to feel like a regular cow instead of a person and her increasingly cold indifference towards his desires didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Alice. I've thought about this for a while. I'm ready to go out there and discover more of the world. It's been fun here for the last few months, but I don't want to coop myself up here when there's so much more to see out there.\" He said cheerfully, trying not to be confrontational about what he really felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to hide her sneer, but she could tell Tim was going to be uncooperative. \"Is that the thanks I get for freeing you from that labyrinth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim rolled his eyes. \"I think the swimming pool's worth of cum you've been milking from me is more than enough gratitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice huffed indignantly. Her near literal cash cow was about to walk out the door. \"You can't leave. How do you think the rest of the world is gonna react to you? They'll hunt you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact an app like Monstr even exists tells me that it's not gonna be so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she lost her temper. \"I won't let you leave! The wards I've put up to protect you will keep you in here until you learn some respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim shot back a fierce glare. \"Respect?! Like meeting a guy and helping him just so you can imprison him yourself and use him like your fucking cattle?! Maybe you're right, maybe humanity isn't as great as I thought, but it shouldn't be hard to find someone better with how low you've dropped the bar just now. So let's get one thing straight here...\" He stomped over to the milking machine and picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This shit. Ends. Now!\" He snarled, throwing the machine on the floor, shattering the glass container on the side and reducing it to a sad, warped hunk of scrap. \"Now release me!\" He bristled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice just laughed at the brutish display. \"Or what? You'll do the same to me? Thanks to the potions I made with your cum I'm practically immortal. And you can't escape the wards around this barn without my help. You're mine, and I will make sure you remember your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's rage dissipated, making way for calculated anger. He was still livid, but she was probably right. Killing her would be difficult. But perhaps there were other ways of punishing her. He looked around and saw the instruments of his vengeance in the remnants of her infernal machine. He shook the ground with each heavy stomp as he thundered towards Alice. The first step was making sure she'd not get out of his reach. The woman seemed confident in her ability to withstand his punishment. She didn't expect him to give her a taste of her own medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur pulled some loose pieces of metal from the scrap, He held her in one hand whilst laying it on the ground, putting her down on top of it. His strength easily bent the metal, wrapping it around her midsection. By her own admission he didn't need to be gentle or careful at all, making sure her hands were tightly trapped to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, you stupid beast?!\" She hissed before her face turned pale. Tim reached up and grabbed a length of rusty chain hanging from one of the beams in the barn. He fastened it to the metal band around Alice and tightened the other end to the wooden beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now we're both prisoners here. I can't force you to break your spells, but I'm sure I can wait them out. Those wards you've built probably need maintaining. I wonder how many weeks it'll take for them to fade. And I hope your potions stop you from getting hungry too, all I've got for you is hay. Oh, and just to be sure...\" He reached in and put his large hands around Alice's waist, feeling all around the metal band before exploring the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing to me?\" She cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gotta make sure you don't have some potion stashed away that'll let you escape. Be happy I don't just rip those clothes off.\" He huffed back. When he was done he walked over to the couch and took a seat, throwing a wicked smile over to his prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now we'll see who breaks first.\"</span></div></div>",

He could tell they were weakening without Alice being able to use her vile alchemy. Perhaps another couple of days and his strength would be able to overwhelm them. As for that witch herself, he stopped paying attention to her almost completely. He did give her a crude cloth gag to stop her from screaming at all hours of the day. Whatever sorcery she used canceled her need for sleep, something she demonstrated by robbing him of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning things felt different though. When he came to inspect her, more out of boredom than necessity, he saw something odd. Alice's wrists were bleeding a little where the metal band had been folded around them. He leaned in and pinched her leg. She yelped into the gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, looks like someone's protective potions have left their system. That means only a few more short days until dehydration kicks in. I really wish I could pity you, but after the way you treated me I'm fresh out of mercy.\" He taunted, pulling the cloth from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P... Please... I promise I'll let you go. I won't pursue you.\" She stammered. Tim just patted her condescendingly on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, I wasn't born yesterday. That obsession in your eyes, your inability to stop staring at my junk, even now. Part of me really wants to give it to you, just once without your protections. I bet you wouldn't even be able to help yourself and beg for more, no matter how much it'd hurt. But I'm no monster like you. So I'll make this quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim reached in and wrapped his hand around her neck. It suddenly felt so fragile and weak. He squeezed it and felt the weakened muscle put up a token resistance before it bent under his will. A small pop was all he heard as he broke her neck. He fought off the urge to do more damage and ensure she was gone. To rip and tear and let all the frustration and anger from the past weeks and months out. He discarded the body alongside those thoughts and took a curious walk towards the door. How much of those wards' strength relied on her being alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed again, surprised to find his hand barely inhibited anymore. As he took a first, cautious step outside it felt much like the last remnants of containing force from his labyrinth finally fading away. That's two prisons escaped in less than a year. Hopefully the next woman he meets will want him for romance instead of using him like cattle. He went back and grabbed the pack of things he'd prepared, including a phone. Carefully his large, stubby digits fidgeted through the options until he'd opened up Monstr.</span></div></div>",

Gnaw\u2019s opponent, an equally large gnoll wrestler was grappling with him. Fearing defeat, the desperate wrestler reared his head back and head-butted his opponent, sending him backward. As his opponent was dazed, Gnaw took this opportunity to deliver blow after blow to his enemies sides, chest, gut and even a quick jab at the throat to make him gag. His opponent ended up losing his footing and collapsed to the floor in exhaustion. A slimmer gnoll referee approach the sweaty Gnaw and grabbed his paw, raising it up, \u201cAnd the winner is Gnaw. Our local champion wins again.\u201d The crowd of gnolls erupted in cheers as Gnaw celebrated his victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the locker rooms, Gnaw collected his things from his locker. Being a gnoll, and a particularly stinky one at that, he liked to bathe in his own stink, and the sweat he worked up from his latest match would make him even stinkier. He\u2019d opt to spend the rest of the day in his sweaty, crusty, unwashed gym shorts. Gnolls typically weren\u2019t a hygienic bunch, but Gnaw took it to another level. He opened his locker and pulled out his phone, noticing there was a new message\u2026 on his Monstr dating app account. The muscular, big-bellied hyena man blushed and smiled, \u201cOh, yes! She answered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnaw had tried in his high school days to get into fellow gnoll women, but he could never click with them. He ended up finding human women to be much more intriguing and attractive. Unfortunately for Gnaw, the human ladies in his village were too lowly in status to be allowed to date a gnoll and when Gnaw tried to visit a human town last summer he got animal control called on him. Thankfully, a friend turned him onto the Monstr app and he\u2019s been flirting with humans on there ever since. But this would be his first date. He opened the app to see who had replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy - A 23-year-old boxer, wrestler and MMA Fighter. Mindy is a fighting and exercise enthusiast who\u2019s been looking for kindred spirits. She loves sparring, even with her dates, and enjoys a man who can match her strength. She loves to drink and party as well, and is described as very hearty. Although, she may not be a big fan of Gnaw\u2019s lack of hygiene, disgusting diet and perverse body odor. Hopefully Gnaw can get her to see past his stench and see him for the cuddly, loving gnoll he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany - A petite college student studying business, Tiffany is Gnaw\u2019s ideal woman. A nearly stereotypical girly girl who\u2019s an unabashed lover of all things make-up, pop music, and partying. She was a bit apprehensive of Gnaw at first, she was looking for a monster man with a bit more sophistication, like a vampire or kitsune. However, after a bit of chatting on the app she found they had a good deal in common and decided to set-up a date to see how things might work face-to-face, stench and all. Gnaw will have to do a good bit of heavy-lifting if he wants to woo his dream girl.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slim was hiking down the narrow trail, eager to meet up again with his date. She'd been sending him all kinds of teasing messages, looking forward to their date. He wasn't wholly sure what she had in mind, but he was happy to just meet someone like her. The parking lot was relatively close by, though he didn't plan to go all the way there. They agreed to meet up a little bit off the trail so any other hikers that might be there wouldn't cause a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later he heard someone up ahead on the trail. Slim quickly hid behind a few trees, his pudgy frame making it difficult to be fully concealed. Carefully he peeked to see if this was just some random hiker or his date. He'd never felt this nervous around humans before. Normally he'd just barge down the path and they could get out of the way or else. Why was he suddenly acting like this? He couldn't ponder on his little anxieties any longer when he heard a distinct voice call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slim? You out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a boulder just slipped off the frog-man's shoulders. He emerged from behind the tree, waving his arm and greeting her. \"Hey there. Good to see you again.\" Jessica didn't even seem remotely shocked to see him skulking through the woods like that. He quickly closed the distance and extended a large hand. She felt a touch intimidated as the pudgy monster stood a solid three feet taller than her, but she wouldn't show it. His skin was a little damp and remarkably smooth, surprising giving his rough outdoorsy lifestyle in his swamp. She giggled as she could tell he really held back on his handshake, not wanting to hurt her. Slim cleared his throat and finally found the words he wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jessica, shall we go to my place? I mean, we can go somewhere else too if you've got plans, but I reckon most human places might give me some weird looks.\" He got increasingly flustered by the word, seemingly forgetting he was by now holding on to her hand for an awkwardly long amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica calmly put her other hand on his and in her most soothing voice responded. \"That would be lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do... do you want me to... carry you?\" Slim asked nervously, finally letting go of her hand. Jessica blushed, thinking about the sensation of those big, strong arms lifting her off her feet. \"Only if I'm not too heavy for you. I don't want to be a burden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog-man smiles and leans down, one arm behind her back and another behind her thighs. In one seamless sweep he picks her up, cradling her like a child. He blushes brightly, giving her a reassuring look. \"You're even lighter than I imagined.\" He flexes his muscles a little, rocking his date back and forth to get her as comfortable as possible. Jessica was feeling more than a little flustered. Firstly by him picking her up with such ease and secondly by him seeming having no problems carrying her. She thought he'd give it a gallant try and set her back down after a few steps, but he really didn't mind carrying her in his arms for miles. It felt strangely romantic, the two exchanging many amorous looks on the way to Slim's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape quickly turned from the small woods near the parking space to the familiar swampland that housed the frog-man. His humble abode wasn't too much further. It was a ramshackle construction, but Slim had spent the last week repairing many of the holes in the roof and tidying up the worst of the trash. He hasn't had to give a damn about the state of the place for years, since nobody ever visited him. But now he wanted to really try and impress the woman in his arms. By his estimate he was doing a good job so far, given all the loving looks she gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way they talked about many things. Their shared love for nature, how cute dogs were and how aggravating most other hikers were. Though their methods for dealing with the worst of them did differ a little. Jessica proudly explained how she told off a few hikers that were littering. Slim responded by talking about how he followed a few litterbugs and ate them whole. His big belly grumbled a little at the memory, making his date feel nervous. He quickly reassured her though that he would never dare to eat someone as pretty as her. They arrived at his home shortly thereafter and the frog-man carefully carried his date inside, finally setting her down on his couch. Her perched his heavy rear down beside her, unsure of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

He'd heard these human fairytales too, but he had some bad news for her. \"Sorry missy, ain't any abandoned royalty in these parts.\" Jessica giggled, still eyeing him lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll guess I try the next best thing then. How good is that big tongue of yours at kissing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog-man blushed. \"It's big 'n strong enough to pull a man clean of his feet and halfway in me maw. I don't think using it for kissing is gonna end well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The woman responded, her curiosity burning intensely. \"Can you... show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it as pulling me into a big kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how big you're thinkin, but that'll put yer whole torso in me maw.\" Slim protested, but her big puppy eyes only got bigger on hearing those words. Were all humans this crazy? The frog-man shrugged. How bad could it really be? He asked her to get up as well and move away from any furniture. He didn't want her to get hurt by banging into something when he yanked her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica bit her lip, eager to see what this experience would be like. She had a mental image of him able to pull her into his lips for a massive surprise smooch. She saw him eyeing her up, preparing to land the shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here goes. Don't blink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to giggle at his silly remark, but in an instant he opened his maw wide and his sticky tongue shot across the room. It hit her in the chest with a heavy splat. Jessica didn't expect the remarkable amount of force the tongue carried. It felt like someone just shoved her. But before she could parse any of it she was flying through the air, her date coming closer at an alarming rate, his maw still wide open. She smacked into the squishy base of his maw and it slammed shut like a bear trap. His bite only pinched a little, Slim able to suppress his instincts to chomp down on his prey. Instead he pursed his lips a little around her waist and began to suckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.....\" was the only thing in Jessica's mind. She thought the 'don't blink' was just him being cute, but that all really happened in the blink of an eye. Was this the last thing most of his meals saw? And now she was stuck up to her waist in his big maw. She wriggled and squirmed a little, the heavy lips parting to let some of her out. From inside his mouth she yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I'm fine. You don't take half-measures when kissing a girl, do you?\" She laughed. Slim laughed too, her whole body shaking in his maw. He took hold of her legs to give her a more comfortable foothold and kept suckling. The large thin tongue snaked itself all over her chest and face, leaving a sticky trail of drool behind. He'd expected their first kiss to be a little more modest, but this was fine by him too. She seemed into it, judging by her attempts to grab his tongue and give it a smooch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slim and Jessica maintain their passionate kiss for several minutes. The frog-man's slimy tongue soaks her in drool and wraps around her to give her a strange squishy cuddle. She returns the favor by rubbing it, making Slim shudder with delight. Finally he leans forward and guides her feet back to the ground before opening his maw and letting her out. The woman was drenched from the waist up in thick slobber, globs of it leaking down and dripping onto the floor. But she didn't seem to mind one bit, breathing heavily from their intense kiss. She looks her date in the eye, composing herself a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog-man raised a curious brow. \"What're ya talking about? What'll do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she fell silent, looking away in shame. When Slim pressed her for answers the woman let out a deep sigh. She sat herself back down on the couch and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Slim, I haven't been 100% honest about why I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Was this all some sort of damn prank?!\" The frog-man felt his anger building. He was getting ready to show her the inside of his maw again, only this time she'd get a tour of his belly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, absolutely not. I love you more than ever. But I've got an issue with one of my exes that I hope you could help me with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, first date and already talkin' about the ex-boyfriends...\" Slim grumbled. He had soured completely on this date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to. He's an obsessive stalker and he won't leave me alone! I've tried going to the police but they won't lift a finger until he actually commits a crime. I'm begging you, please help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim looked at the woman. The fear in her eyes was as real as it could be, any monster could tell. He rubbed his temples and let out a deep, croaky sigh. \"And I reckon you want me to 'talk' to him and hopefully scare him away? You do know I like to live in a swamp because I want to avoid these kinds of confrontations, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gulped. No point hiding any more details now. \"I don't think scaring him will work. He showed up at 2am at my last boyfriend's house and spent hours shouting about how he was gonna beat him up. I'm at my wit's end with this guy. I wouldn't be surprised if he followed my car out here and is somewhere trying to find me. So I was kinda hoping you would...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim gave his date a knowing smile. \"...make sure he doesn't leave the swamp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman burned up with embarrassment. Did she really just ask someone to kill somebody? There was no doubt in her mind that he deserved it, but it still felt over the top. And what would Slim think of all this? She glanced over to him to see the frog-man milling over his options. She shuffled closer to him, brushing up to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to do this I understand. I know it's a lot to ask and I-\" She muttered but he nudged her to interrupt her, looking down at the nervous woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll do it. If all them disappearing hikers don't draw any search parties, I reckon your ex won't warrant any either. After all, the swamp's a dangerous place...\" He chuckled darkly. He expected Jessica to be unnerved by his more monstery side, but she just looked relieved. That ex of hers must be a real piece of work. The frog-man opened his arms and she didn't hesitate to accept his comforting hug. Her head was resting on his chest. Though most of it was covered in a shaggy top, she could feel the smooth skin brush against her. It was a little slippery and cold, but strangely relaxing too.</span></div></div>",

Was it too much to ask for one date without this jackass? She watched the frog-man stand up, cracking his neck and knuckles and stomping towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're in there, Jessica! Open up!\" Sounded from the other side of the door, further incensing the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim nearly pulled his front door from its hinges, putting on his most ornery scowl. Before him stood a man considerably shorter than himself, chest puffed up. His whole posture crumpled though as he stared at the frog-man. What didn't fade was his attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? She'll go out with literal animals over me?! Get out of my way, fatso, I'm here for Jessica.\" He shouted, trying to worm himself past the monster. He didn't stand a chance against the frog-man filling up the doorframe and with an angry croak he was pushed back onto the porch. Before he could open his mouth again, Slim interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen here, punk. You managed to get on my last nerve the moment I heard your voice, so I'll keep this short. The lady never wants to see your creepy stalking ass again. So you walk on out of here and leave her the hell alone or I'll make sure she won't have to worry about you anymore for the rest of her life.\" He thundered. Jessica sat on the couch, hoping that the monster's words might finally get through his thick skull, but she knew the odds were tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna go, big guy?\" the ex shouted. \"You wanna threaten ME? I'll kick anyone's ass that gets between me and my Jessica!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw a punch at the frog-man, but Slim's large belly just jiggled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're doing this...\" The frog said wearily before growing a cruel smile. He grabbed the ex by his shoulder and planted a heavy blow in his gut, returning the favor. The hammerblow had him on his knees, wincing in pain and clutching his bruised body. Slim let him get up, hoping that this dose of harsh reality finally brought home that this wouldn't be a fight, it'd be a beatdown. His hopes were shattered when the ex threw another punch, easily sidestepped by the monster and hitting nothing but air. Slim's patience had bottomed out. He'd given the ex enough chances to back down, but now it was time to show that asshole why they called him a monster.</span></div></div>",

As much as she hated that guy, she probably wouldn't like to see what was about to go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off, asshole! Why does everyone always want to get between me and Jessica?!\" The ex shouted in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're a complete creep who can't handle rejection.\" Slim replied, stepping towards his victim with his fist up in the air. He blocked the next flailing punch with ease and answered with a powerful haymaker. It only hit the ex on the arm, but it was strong enough to nearly throw him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked by the frog-man's strength the only thing still running through the man's mind was that to beat this beast he would have to fight dirty. He launched a kick between Slim's legs, but the monster stepped back, dodging this low blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's pathetic, even by your low standards.\" The monster joked before closing the distance and grabbing the ex' shoulder. He pulled the man in close before planting a heavy blow in his gut. This time he didn't permit the ex to go down though. Holding him up like a punching bag the frog-man kept on raining blows until the man coughed up blood. He let his opponent crumple onto the floor, scoffing at his pathetic efforts. \"If you know what's good for you, stay down and leave us be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Slim could turn away he felt the ex grab his leg. The monster sighed wearily and raised his other foot. He wore heavy boots and probably weighed three times as much as the man simply because of his monstrous size. Both factors meant that when the frog-man stomped down on the man's arm, it snapped like a twig. The pain made him scream with whatever air was left in his lungs, further irritating the beast. Slim growled with annoyance before stepping closer to the man and raising his other foot. The ex was given a good look at the underside of the looming boot before it was brought down hard on his chest. The heavy stomp forced the remaining air from the man's lungs as well as cracking a few ribs. A second stomp followed before Slim reached down and wrapped a strong hand around the man's neck.</span></div></div>",

While she couldn't get a glimpse of them before, in front of her face was two dodge ball sized cheeks and after feeling them up before, they were quite squishy.<br>\r\n\"You wanted it, so here's the <i>trick</i> you waited for,\" he said before slamming his butt onto her and shivered as the human lapped up and down his anus, to his balls.<br>\r\n\"I haven't done it yet, but thanks for being grateful for it,\" Fredrick said, before clenching his gut and like a slurped up noodle, Rachel was sucked into the wolf man's bowels.<br>\r\nFredrick came once more and could hear Rachel did the same as well while his butt grew a bit bigger.<br>\r\n\"Woah, that was amazing!\" She repeated, Fredrick's butt quivering in junction to her emotions and thoughts.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're now my ass!\" He said, spanking himself and his furry backside jiggled as Rachel squealed in delight.<br>\r\nHis stomach groaned and a loud burst of gas exited out of him, much to his embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I tend to get gassy after doing this, but...\" \"What do I smell like!\" Rachel interrupted him, curious about her gaseous state.<br>\r\nStartled by the human-now-butt fat, Fredrick hesitated before he took a big whiff and smiled.<br>\r\n\"Beef stock.\" \"Yuck!\" \"I happen to love beef stock!\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so? My dates happen to be asses themselves when I go out for the first time, but I never thought I would become one in the most literal sense! But it just ended after...\" Rachel said, her excitement dying as she was reminded of her pain.<br>\r\n\"Funny, this how we met the first time... I'll let you out in the morning,\" Fredrick said, any sexual excitement the two had gone and no sooner both fell asleep.<br>\r\nThe next morning, Fredrick woke up, confused where he was until his butt jiggled without any motion of his and smelt the flatulent beef stock in the air. Smiling, he went to bathroom and showered until he was clean. Once he exited and dried, he aimed his ass at the shower and pushed his lower guts. Fredrick's ass shrunk back to its original size as Rachel reemerged into the world with a long winded fart.<br>\r\n\"It's a girl!\" Fredrick joked as Rachel chuckled at this before she slapped his ass and Fredrick exited the bathroom so the human can change.<br>\r\nThe werewolf was done dressing up when Rachel came out.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I really needed,\" Fredrick said, smiling at her.<br>\r\n\"So did I. Can we... exchange numbers?\" Rachel asked, nervously as she held her arm.<br>\r\n\"My card, plus personal number is beside your clothes. So name the time and place and I'll see what we can do to meet up,\" he answered, a smile appearing on both of their faces now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree months had passed since the two met and were currently reading books at Fredrick's place. Every week, the duo would meet up, do some sort of activity they agreed on, fuck, and Rachel would spend the rest of the day as booty fat while Fredrick farted his way home.<br>\r\n\"Say, Fred, what if someone I know wanted to meet you very badly?\" Rachel asked, her head resting against Fredrick's nude backside.<br>\r\n\"Invite them then. I see no problem with it and if they have a problem with me, then screw them!\" He responded, not even looking her as he read while he sat in a way that had his bum almost 90 degrees up.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Fred,\" Rachel said, planting a big kiss on his butt and jammed her head up his bum, its mass growing.<br>\r\n\"No problem, Ray,\" Fredrick replied, pulling his tush apart as a big beefy fart exited his colon.<br>\r\nThe next day, despite what he said before, Fredrick was nervous as Rachel was bring in...</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once they retrieved their belongings, they sat down in the chair and wiggled their massive butt until they were comfortable.<br>\r\n\"So, you are Fredrick.

Almost every booth or table was full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't mind sitting with some random stranger, I guess not,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" The woman sat across from him. \"Sorry, I just had a <i>really</i> bad date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it the kind where they date you just to have sex with you and brag about it?\" Rajah asked. \"I seem to have those sorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish, at least they'd be focused on me,\" the woman said. \"More like they are focused on some other woman, or pass me onto their friends while they have their way with some other woman.

Nothing special, but it is a good one.\" He poured it into a few glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you need some courage?\" Crystal asked, picking up a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just enough to lubricate my throat,\" said Rajah. \"Are you sure you're up to this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've heard that felines have barbs,\" said Crystal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lubricant helps deal with that.\" He pointed at the nightstand. \"Looks like they got some of the good kind too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's useful to know,\" said Crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you want to do this?\" Rajah asked. \"Do you want to be on top or bottom, or would you like for me to take you like a wild tiger would a tigress, or do you want to feel my tongue on your sex, or do you think that you could swallow my maleness?\"</span></div></div>",

That was Drako Flametongue. The dragon had lived over several centuries and was very lonely because of it. Only his fantasy novels made it easier to bear with and his favorite was when there was a dragon holding a princess hostage before fighting against the knight sent to rescue her, regardless of the result. However, this only made his heart ache more and he would repeat this cycle until he heard about the app. It didn't take much to convince the reptile and he immediately downloaded the app before building up his profile. However, because he was a dragon, it made things hard for him to meet people and he eventually wondered he did something wrong before getting a ping from a Cindy Smith. The two chatted for a while and once they known each other for over three months, decided to meet up in real life with Cindy's friend, Sam.<br>\r\nNow, Drako was internally freaking out as he waited for the two and was checking the time as it came closer to the scheduled meeting time. Numerous bad thoughts came into his head and Drako tried to calm himself down with his new fantasy novel, but he could barely pay any attention to it.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but are you Drako Flametongue?\" A mousy voice called up to Drako and he looked down.<br>\r\nStanding beside him, was a mousy woman smaller than the average person and was dressed up as a fellow bookworm. A green turtleneck and jeans, as her glasses glinted through her long, blue dyed, messy hair. While she didn't look much, for the dragon, she was princess material.<br>\r\n\"Cindy Smith?\" He replied back with a question and all tension was released when she smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n\"Hard not to spot you out here by yourself,\" Cindy joked before noticing his book in his claw.<br>\r\n\"Is that the newest edition of the Dragon Hunter series?!\"<br>\r\n\"When you have plenty of gold around, it's pretty easy to get stuff like this, though a pain to convert into useable currency. Anyway, just started and so far it's amazing like its precessors. Won't spoil anything and...\" Drako said, trying to get through his nervousness and excitement about his book before a voice interrupted him.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cid, aren't you going to introduce him to me?\"<br>\r\nBlushing over her excitement about her date's book, Cindy turned towards the newcomer and introduced them.<br>\r\n\"Drako, remember Sam, the person that wanted to join us because that special clause you added in,\" Cindy said, stepping aside as a {Reader's choice} stepped forward.</span></div></div>",

Wearing a leather jacket over a white tank top, which was stretched against tits that was far bigger than her head and revealed a lot of her toned middle. Because of her wide hips, her ripped jeans could go over half of it, though Drako considered the possibility that her ass was at least as big as her breasts. With a stern look on her face, she walked around the dragon, inspecting him and the dragon was feeling far more nervous than when he was waiting for Cindy. Once she was in front of him again, she stared at him for a full minute before she broke into a shit-eating grin.<br>\r\n\"I like him, Cin! When you told me you were gunning for someone abnormal, I was worried for a bit. But you never told me he was a dragon!\"<br>\r\nSighing greatly in relief, Drako was glad he was accepted by her and turned to face Cindy.<br>\r\n\"Um, you see... she's my... childhood friend...I know it's weird... but it's... the truth!\" The nerdy bookworm stammered out as the dragon found this cute and deemed her worthy of being a princess before yelping loudly as a loud smack to his bottom sounded out, the flesh jiggling a bit.<br>\r\n\"Just had to see something. Anyway, isn't that the caf\u00e9 you wanted to go to?\" Sam said, walking towards the caf\u00e9.<br>\r\nDrako wanted to retort, but because of the cleavage shown on both sides of her, he had a hard time knowing where to look at.<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry! But she's doesn't mean any harm!\" Cindy apologized before running to catch up with Sam.<br>\r\nThe dragon just sighed and smiled at this sight before joining them. The owner was startled by Drako's appearance, but was quick to provide them seats and take their orders as they grabbed some books to read, as the caf\u00e9 was also a bookstore.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I guess it's late for introductions. Samantha Thoeart, or Sam for short,\" Sam said, taking out a hand for a shake and Drako accepted it with a fore claw.<br>\r\nThough she had no interest in literature, she was fan of the dramas and the ones of fantasy, her first being 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' by Shakespeare. Cindy showed videos of her acting and Drako was quite impressed, despite Sam stating she wouldn't survive a movie set. As they read and talk through their meal, they were able learn more each other than chatting online before the caf\u00e9 was ready to close for the night.<br>\r\n\"It's already that time? I had some fun with you,\" Drako said, happy that he was able to meet with the girls.<br>\r\n\"Glad to know that the guy I was meeting wasn't a total douche,\" Cindy said, smiling as she swore.<br>\r\n\"Say, how about we go to your place if you want to continue chatting,\" Sam suggested, Cindy panicking once more.<br>\r\n\"Sam!\" \"Why not? Night's young, and don't tell you're not curious about him! Besides, do you think he can get inside any of our houses without wrecking shit?\"<br>\r\nThe thought of Drako smashing buildings while people were screaming madly was enough to put a damper on everyone's mood.<br>\r\n\"We don't have to-\" \"Let's go! If, it's not a bother to you,\" Cindy shouted, interrupting Drako, but quickly made herself polite.<br>\r\nDrako thought things over for a bit before lowering his head and with a quick glance with each other, both women got onto his neck.<br>\r\n\"You secure back there? I rather not have to dive for anyone that falls off of me,\" Drako said, worry coming out of his words as Sam held tight onto his horns and Cindy onto Sam.<br>\r\n\"We're good!\" \"Relax, I rode a bunch motorbikes before! From the quietest ones to the meanest one, I'm certain I won't fall off!\" The women answered and Drako lifted his head, his leathery wings spread out for flight.<br>\r\n\"I'll tone it down and we'll see from there.\"<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, they've arrived at Drako's home, which is a modified cave outfitted for modern day use. As Drako lowered his head to let the women off, they scrambled off of him and began to hug the ground, Sam kissing it several times in relief.<br>\r\n\"Ride a dragon, they said. It'll be fun, they say!\" Cindy said sarcastically, trying to fix her messy appearance from the ride.<br>\r\n\"I'll apologize as many times as you want! Fuck, and this fucker was slowing down for us! Fuck! Don't to be on when he's full speed!\" Sam shouted, panting wildly.<br>\r\n\"I'm considered to be slow and it took me a minute to get there,\" Drako commented, both women's eyes widening and their faces paling at his words.<br>\r\nIt would take a while before they could move again and Drako used this time to read his book, which was in his claw the whole time. Once they were ready, he let them in and they gasped in awe at the amount of gold he had.<br>\r\n\"Fuck! You're loaded!\"<br>\r\n\"I had a suspicion but you never did mentioned you had plenty of money,\" Cindy said, hoping she wasn't too intrusive with her inquiries.<br>\r\n\"First off, you never asked; secondly, it's a pain to convert into usable money; and finally, I actually want someone who likes me for... well, me,\" the dragon answered honestly and Sam nodded her head in agreement.<br>\r\n\"I get it, even though I'm not rich. Having these had always attracted the sleazeballs,\" Sam added in, groping her own breasts and Drako looked away with a blush across his face.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I've been wondering about how freaky you guys are, seeing how the night will end up. I don't mind who or what they're into (for the most part), as long as it fun in the sack, I'm game!\" Sam said, confusing the two until it clicked and the bookish couple blushed madly.<br>\r\n\"Sex doesn't come into the first date!\" Cindy shouted, Drako shaking his head.<br>\r\n\"At least tell me what turns you on!\" Sam begged and the duo share a look for a few minutes before turning back to Sam.<br>\r\n\"I, I guess we can tell her.\" \"Sam's trustworthy and wouldn't talk to anyone else.\"<br>\r\nThe dragon sighed and faced the boisterous woman.<br>\r\n\"Sam, you see, the fetish we would like to play is...\"</span></div></div>",

She's eaten at the finest establishments and the dumpsters behind the greasiest burger shacks. Once her hunger strikes there's little else she can think about. It doesn't help that her day job for centuries has been to tempt mankind into acts of selfish gluttony. But nowadays food is so readily available for them that her help is hardly needed. With all this free time she's started dating. At first with monsters, but thanks to this new app, the elephant woman was about to go on a date with a human for a change. Hopefully he could deal with her hunger before he finds himself on the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie the naga. She's been enamored with those cute little humans for years, but her 20 foot long serpentine body has so far only yielded screams and panicked fleeing. She even chased down one to try to tell him she didn't want to hurt him. Unfortunately in her clumsy ways she tightened her coils around him a bit too tightly and he ended up dead. Now there was an app that would let the naga find willing boyfriends, which she was quick to get in on. Sadly this was going to be her third date as the previous two men she met through the app also got killed by her overly enthusiastic serpentine hugs. This time though, she was going to get it right... hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika and Katie the ogres. A towering pot-bellied behemoth compared to the men she was looking to date, but that wasn't going to stop her. Few knew of her secret crush on the little humans. They were a delicacy among ogres, but she couldn't fathom how anyone could think of them as food. Though her kind doesn't have much in the way of intelligence, she was a downright genius compared to her twin sister Katie. In spite of that, her sister was one of the few to not just know of Erika's admiration for humans, she was into them as well. Through the app they hoped to get lucky. What human would say no to a threesome with two ogre hotties like Erika and her sister? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nItsee the swamp sprite. She lived in a damp bog for her entire life, tending to the wildlife. She was only a foot tall and smelled every bit as horrid as the foulest pits of the swamp. Worse yet was that sprites like herself didn't live in villages like those fancy-pants faeries. She was out here on her own and the loneliness was really getting to her. There wasn't another swamp sprite around for miles and the local fauna seemed a bit too eager to try and eat her if Itsee got too close. The odd human that visited tended to be repulsed by her smell or just dismissed her as a puff of swamp gas playing tricks on their eyes. The sprite was over the moon when the dating app finally found the one for her. After so many years alone, she hoped her date was ready to deal with all that pent up desire as much as she was.</span></div></div>",

He knew his date was on the tall side of things, but he never quite managed to work out just how enormous an elephant woman like Rheina would be. He had to crane his neck just to look her in the eye. She kneeled down and stretched out her hand. He jerked back, afraid she was trying to grab him for a quick snack. But her hand just hovered there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I'm Rheina. You must be Francis.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook off his initial fears and placed his hand in her large grey palm. She gently shook it, well aware of how fragile he was compared to her. Francis was taken by surprise by the towering elephant woman's subtlety. He stood back, looking dreamily at all her beautiful features. She had curves for days, her plump frame and round belly giving him lots to stare at. Slowly his gaze drifted up to her hefty rack. Her low-cut dress gave him quite the view and the elephant woman leaned in a bit to allow him a closer look. She didn't mind humans staring anymore. She'd been tempting them for aeons, their gobsmacked faces when they saw her were par for the course. Instead her attention turned to the car he drove in with. It was an old beaten up pick-up truck. The flatbed trailer was nearly as long as the car, a blue tarp tied over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that you've tried to accommodate for me on your car, but I'm afraid that trailer won't be able to hold me.\" She said with an amused smirk. Francis shook himself out of his breast-induced trance and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, don't worry, dude. That trailer ain't for you. Well, it is, but not like that. Here, lemme show ya.\" He beamed with pride as he walked to the trailer and undid the bindings on the blue tarp. He pulled it back to reveal at least a dozen large trash bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told me that you'll eat just about any food, so I went dumpster diving behind some restaurants. Hope you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina's eyes widened and she wrung her hands, approaching this newly presented buffet. Her long trunk hovered over the bags, taking in the smell. Some of it had gone off, others still smelled fresh. All kinds of cuisine could be sensed. Some pasta dishes, something Asian, even a bag full of stale burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Francis. You didn't have to do that, I already ate lots before our date.\" She beamed with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry I guess? Didn't want to risk you being here all hungry and me showing up without a bite to eat.\" He blushed. \"Well, if you're already full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Important lesson about spirits of gluttony, Francis: While we might not always be hungry, we are <i>never</i> full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah, that's deep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I give this scrumptious gesture the attention it deserves. Afterwards I'll give you a fitting reward.\" The elephant woman sat down beside the trailer and licked her chops. Francis took a few steps back, not wanting to get between Rheina and her food. She grabbed a bag, leaned back and emptied it into the yawning chasm of her mouth. The spirit of gluttony happily munched away at the food, working her way through his offerings in less than ten minutes. Her date just stood and stared in awe at the speed with which she made all the food on his trailer disappear. Finally she wiped her lips clean and turned her attention back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... about that reward.\" She mused, making him blush brightly.</span></div></div>",

A shiver of fear ran down Francis' spine as he was in awe with the spirit's strength. She picked him up like it was nothing. It's a good thing she'd just eaten, because there'd be bitterly little he could do if she wanted him for dessert. Though by her own admission she would always have some space in that humongous gut for him. It certainly didn't help that he was slowly brought to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, a little smooch. Give me all you got, little human.\" The elephant woman teased, pursing her lips. Francis looked uncertain at first before an eager smile crawled onto his face. He reached out to hold his date and brought his lips to meet hers. The difference in scale was ridiculous, but that wouldn't deter him. Her breath smelled like the stale food he'd just given her, somewhat uncomfortable for the stoner. At the same time, the distinct smell of weed on him made Rheina's trunk twitch a little. It wasn't a dealbreaker for either of them and soon they met in a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say the elephant was in charge of events would be a hilarious understatement. Francis' whole head was little more than a plaything between her thick, soft lips. She smothered his face, smacking loudly as she left a huge, drooly mark on him. But his generous act had earned him more than just a little smooch. Well, little by Rheina's standards. He quickly found himself going back down, still close to the spirit of gluttony's towering body. It wasn't until he felt his feet get pinched together that the penny dropped and he realized her plan. He couldn't help but smile broadly. This was even better then what he'd imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant woman was blessed with an impressively sized rack. Each breast was easily the size of a smart car and Francis found himself slowly getting slotted in between them. The supple skin was smooth, clinging to his legs as they sank into her cleavage. The walls of flesh were warm and amazingly soft. The stoner moaned a little as his groin entered their embrace, putting a naughty smile on Rheina. She had yet to meet a human that was left unsatisfied by her rewards. She let go of his body, her boobs easily able to hold Francis in place. She pushed him down further, wedging him even more firmly until only his arms and head were still visible poking out of her cleavage. Though his mobility was limited, he slowly stroked and massaged the large grey mass of boobflesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her date on cloud nine Rheina stood tall and looked around. They were still just in the parking lot and already she was having a fantastic time. She was worried about meeting people through Monstr and them not being able to cater to her larger than life tastes. But Francis had done a wonderful job proving her wrong. The night was still young though. What does she have in mind next?</span></div></div>",

She knew the answer already, but hearing him stammer it out all love-drunk was too funny to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" Francis said, half-moaning at the sensory overload. Almost his entire body was held and massaged by the spirit's huge mammaries. His arms were still free to let him show his appreciation and rub them, but Rheina was soon looking to take this one step further. She guided him towards one of the now swollen nipples. The stoner quickly caught on and rubbed the sensitive flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little hands feel so nice. But my breasts can do something I bet you've never even thought possible.\" She teases. Her date shoots her a puzzled look. \"Oh? Awesome. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to go inside?\" The elephant woman asked seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside... You mean inside your boob?\" Francis responded, sounding both baffled and curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me show you...\" Rheina took charge and guided one of his hands towards her nipple again. But instead of just caressing it she pushed it down square in the middle. Some milk leaked out at first, but soon after Francis could feel the soft flesh yield and open. His hand sank into the nipple. He wasn't sure whether he should panic or not, but his date moaned loudly. Whatever this was, it felt great for her. There was just one little doubt left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a one way trip, is it?\" He asked awkwardly, prompting Rheina to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, no it isn't, silly. I can take you out whenever you want, and you can stay safely for days, nourished by my milk.\" The elephant woman patted him on the head to comfort him. But with his fears allayed, the stoner began to participate a lot more actively. He pushed his arm deeper into the warm embrace of her breast. His free arm was used to rub the surrounding boobflesh, soothing it and encouraging it to prepare for what would come next. Rheina took a few deep breaths as she felt her date's arm reach in up to his shoulder. With a few gentle pushes she coerced the soft mass to open up wider. Francis' whole head went in all at once, provoking another lewd moan from his date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes of aroused wrangling, but finally the last of his legs were sucked up into the large elephantine breast. Even with an entire human inside of it, the spirit of gluttony's rack looked balanced. She could feel his every movement and asked him to settle in. \"Just relax. If you want out, give me a call. But I wouldn't mind keeping you there for a little while.\" She mused. The elephant woman looked around and began to wander off. She had a destination in mind for this little cutie and now she could take him there with ease. Every so often she would rub the breast he was in, gently massaging him with the damp internals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis was sat in a shallow pool of milk. The walls around him all leaked and dripped with the stuff but the pool's level never seemed to rise. Of all the places he thought this date would go, inside Rheina's breasts was about the last he'd imagined. The soft embrace all around him was far from unpleasant though. He stroked the squishy walls, and occasionally they came down on him and smothered him in a snug full-body embrace whenever she rubbed her breasts. It felt wonderful, though he wondered what she was up to. He could feel his chamber shift and jiggle a little. The elephant woman was on the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Rheina take him?</span></div></div>",

She shook, squeezed and petted her breasts, causing Francis to shuffle around inside. He felt amazing in there and she couldn't wait to show him more tricks her body could do. But before that she wanted to take him somewhere nice. Rheina couldn't imagine many human places responding well to a guest of her caliber, so instead she hoped the other way around would work. There's plenty of humans in the circle of Gluttony where she lived. Some sent there as eternal punishment, forced to gorge on food until they could no longer do anything other than eat. Others were sent here to be food, hunted forever by the denizens of this realm and doomed to resurrect after each fatal hunt. Bringing a guest like she did with Francis wasn't unheard of, but she still had to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis enjoyed is trip a lot, even given his unusual method of transportation. He'd love to say he'd seen this during a trip once, but no amount of weed could've conjured up the concept of going into a huge elephant woman's breast. Least of all the part where she's still playing with him in here and the environment he's in feels downright pleasant. He gave the creamy milk a taste when he got thirsty, making both admire his date more and wonder just how long he'd been in there by now. It was hard to keep track of time in the slim confines of Rheina's breast, but soon he would get answers as she began to squeeze him hard, coercing him back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are again. Did you have as much fun as I did?\" The elephant woman holds her date close, smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was wicked, dude. But uhm...\" Francis' sentence fell short as he looked around. It felt like he had shrunk down. He saw a living room not unlike you'd expect in any normal house. But every piece of furniture was scaled to fit Rheina. He quickly put one and one together. \"... is this your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hope you don't mind. It's just that I fear I'll struggle to fit in your place.\" She says with a laugh. Francis can't help but chuckle at the idea of Rheina trying to squeeze herself through his front door. Probably for the best they went to her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll probably need a hand to get to most places, but I gotta ask... Am I in hell?\" The stoner looked deeply lost in thought as he began to ponder his own question. Rheina just patted him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweety, don't worry about it. Technically, yes, you could call this a circle of hell. But you're a guest, so don't worry about your afterlife. The only people that make a big deal about cavorting with demons, angels and others spirits like me are other humans anyway, so you've got nothing to fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah...\" Francis replied, the realization sinking in that he was really in hell. It all looked so... pedestrian. He expected fire and brimstone, but there was little evidence to show that this wasn't just some neighborhood for giant folks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, I  think it's best we lay down some ground rules. First and most important: Don't leave my side. Just about everyone here is driven by hunger of some kind and I don't want you to end up in a belly that isn't mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" The stoner shook his head, not sure if he heard his date say that right. Was she planning to eat him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I wouldn't digest you if you ended up in my belly. And let's be honest with ourselves here, you're dating a spirit of gluttony and I could see that curious twinkle in your eyes from the moment we met up. But I'll let you work up to that on your own. In the meantime, is there anything you'd like to do?\"</span></div></div>",

She'd nearly given him an accidental upskirt back then, and now it turns out that would've given him a direct peek at her most intimate region.

Swaying before him was an ass the size of two smart cars, jiggling endlessly. The soft surface was devoid of any mark or blemish. How something so beautiful could end up in hell was a mystery to the stoner. Though with that kind of size, merely sitting on someone sounded like a fine form of eternal torment for the damned. No sooner has he thought this when Rheina bends her knees and thrusts her enormous bottom towards him. She leans back slowly, smothering her date into the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he feared this would be the end. Pulverized beneath his date's mighty rear. But as the seconds ticked by he realized he was fine. Movement was near impossible, but his body felt intact. Wanting to keep himself that way, the stoner immediately sets about providing his date the pleasure she sought. He stretched his arms wide and rubbed as much of the smooth surface as he could. She rewarded him by shaking her butt a little, letting him reposition before dealing with the smothering mass once more. Suddenly she lets out a short fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gods, I'm so sorry Francis. I didn't mean to let one slip.\" The elephant woman blushed brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis, not wanting to ruin the moment, tried to soothe her. His words were muffled by the ginormous amount of jiggling assflesh sitting in his lap. \"It's okay babe, it's not that bad. Smells kinda funny.\" He joked, putting a smile back on Rheina's face. Of course a stoner wouldn't have problems with strange smells. With her worries allayed she got back to the action. Her huge elephantine rear shuffled and bounced on top of her date. She knew humans had come to like this 'twerking' as they called it. Though with her size she had to take it a little slower lest she hammer her date flat back there. Judging by the happy little noises escaping from back there Francis was having the time of his life. This gave the elephant an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if I could...\" She mused aloud, putting a hand on each of her large asscheeks. She pulled them apart, letting Francis stare at the immaculately clean cleft inbetween. He managed to utter a surprised \"whoah...\" before Rheina sat back down, wedging him between her cheeks. With her curiosity mounting she let go of her rear, the blubbery cheeks enveloping her date. Next she stood up, confirming her belief that she could hold on to him with just her ass. The elephant woman chuckled to herself, feeling Francis wiggling in the narrow confines of her buttcrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina gave her rear a solid rub, massaging the trapped stoner's whole body with the soft walls of assflesh. His little murrs and moans barely escaped the jiggly prison, but she could tell he was having the time of his life. Finally she leaned back, parting her cheeks again to let him slump onto the couch. With his view still dominated by her backside, the elephant woman couldn't help but want to amplify the pleasure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mmmmm... that was great, little man. You know how to wiggle just right.\" She complimented, looking at the panting stoner on her couch. Saliva began to dribble down the side of her cheek. She couldn't wait to feel those wiggles as he went inside of her. But she'd promised him to let him decide when he was ready for such an adventure, a promise that was increasingly difficult to keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis didn't reply immediately, still catching his breath from that overwhelming full body massage he received. It felt like he had been afloat amidst an ocean of supple assflesh, his every worry drifting away. His only regret is not being allowed in there longer. His smile grows a mile wide when the spirit of gluttony offers him another proposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking at that face you really seemed to enjoy that, didn't you? Well, would you like to take an even deeper look? And i'm talking all the way up and inside. It's pretty much the same, except a little warmer and even more comfy.\" She gave him her best sales pitch, eagerly hoping for a positive response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoner gave it only a second's thought before agreeing. If she was able to sit that huge butt on top of him without any lasting injury he was confident Rheina would keep him safe inside of her as well. \"Alright, babe, let's do this. I'll go where no man has gone before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina chuckled at his words. He was wrong, but he would become the first man that would probably enjoy the ordeal. She could make her insides as clean or as filthy as she desired, depending on whether she wants to give her victims pleasure or punishment. And her day job rarely involved giving humans pleasure. But Francis deserved all the pleasure he could desire for his efforts so far. Before she let him in she did have one last question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stay packed in my butt for as long as you please. Or I could send you all through my bowels and into my stomach. From there I can cough you up easily. It'd be like getting eaten, but in reverse. Wanna give that a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis mulled over his choices before giving the spirit of gluttony an answer. \"Just let me get accustomed to being in there for a little while, then you can have me travel those big insides of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina squeaked gleefully, eager to show her date just how comfortable she could be on the inside. She pulled her asscheeks apart, letting him stare at that ravenous hole. The stoner sat up, preparing himself to enter. It was still scary to see her pucker descending towards him, but he was determined to see this through. When the soft flesh connected with his head, the clenched ring opened up wide. It took the man in with no difficulty, sinking down until it hit the couch. The spirit stood up, giggling as she felt two legs still dangling from her bottom. She reached back and pushed them in, sealing the little man in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis felt his date give him the final push as the warmth surrounded him completely. The walls were clean save for a little bit of slime and the passage smelled vaguely of her fart from earlier. On the whole he was amazed by how clean it all was. Soon his thoughts would be turned to mush as the walls bore down on him, embracing him in the most thorough and deep massage he'd ever felt. How Rheina was able to do this with her rectum of all places was a mystery, but he was not about to complain. With every squeeze he was completely immobilized, but between them he rewarded her in the only way he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina needed to take a seat as the pleasurable wiggles emanating from inside her sent a rush of joy throughout her large body. She didn't know how he managed it, but Francis was able to hit all the right places. She began to rub herself as finally it was time for him to start his journey. Slowly and surely she began to guide him through her, each squeeze sliding the little man a bit further down her bowels. The smooth intestines were every bit as adept at smothering him in warmth and arousing pressure. Before long she had brought herself to an orgasm, panting loudly as she laid back to focus on the afterglow as well as her date squirming in her belly.</span></div></div>",

When he was texting with her before the date, this wasn't how he was planning to spend time 'close to her'. But all in all it was as odd as it was relaxing. He had no idea how much longer he'd be traveling through this seemingly endless tunnel, but hopefully he'd be outside the elephant woman soon enough. Almost on cue the narrow passage seemed to halt as he bumped into a closed sphincter. The muscular ring opened up, letting him slide into her empty belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I feel a morsel in my stomach.\" The spirit of gluttony mused, her voice reverberating inside her hollow gut. Francis gave a hearty chuckle and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do all your dates pass through here or am I lucky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the first human to consider himself to be 'lucky' whilst inside my stomach. Then again, most humans that go there tend to be damned souls in need of torment, not dates that need loving. Speaking of which...\" Rheina took a deep breath and grunted. Francis didn't know what she was up to, but suddenly everything seemed to stir into motion. The walls closed in and the floor shook, the stomach contracting to squeeze its occupant up into the esophagus. The next leg of his journey was a blur for the stoner. Tight coils of muscle tried to push him up and keep him down at the same time. The elephant woman clearly struggled getting him out of her belly like this. Part of him wanted to soothe her and promise to just slide out the natural way. But she was already so close. Brief flashes of light shone up ahead as he was nearing the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single fluid motion the man was forced up her throat and into the spirit's mouth. She closed her lips around his chest to stop Francis from sliding out of her mouth completely. The man was unsure of what his date had in mind, but he would soon find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dhidn'th fink you 'ere dhone, r.. right?\" She sputtered, talking with her mouth full. Francis panicked lightly as he felt those big lips slurping him back inside, puckering up around his head and giving him the strangest kiss before sucking him back into her maw. Already her large tongue had begun to lap away at his body, licking him clean of the slimy juices that coated her stomach and bowels. His body was like putty against the strong muscle, being pushed around with little resistance. She finally had her date where she wanted him and gave him the most thorough tasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the delighted murrs and moans, Rheina was a big fan of his flavor. But Francis worried that her affection might mean another trip into her belly. As much as he loved her, he wouldn't mind spending some more time loving her exterior, not just the insides.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a little more pushing him around with her tongue the playful elephant woman finally let him escape, pursing her lips around Francis' waist to slowly drop him into her waiting hands. She didn't care that he was drenched in saliva and other juices. What peaked her interest much more was the little bulge in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's having a good time...\" She cooed, giving the bulge a sniff with her trunk. \"How about you take those pants off for me, sweetie? Or should I try myself with my teeth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis gulped at the notion of those big chompers near his manhood. He sprung into action, trying to drop his pants before the impatient monster would try to help. When his fly was open she came in close, opening her maw wide and taking in his lower legs. She slurped and suckled, pulling his pants down and revealing his package. But that wasn't enough for the spirit of gluttony. She kept going until she'd removed his pants completely, taking them into her maw before sending them down with a loud gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't digest my pants... I like them and I haven't brought a spare.\" He spoke softly and only sort of jokingly, unsure of what to make of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'm just keeping them safe for you. I'll let you in to get them back later.\" She said with a giggle. Of course retrieving his clothes would involve her eating him. He practically expected it. At this stage he just shrugged and went all in, taking off his shorts and shirt and presenting them to his date. She gobbled them up quickly before letting her gaze fall back on his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the real meal.\" She mused, pursing her lips and leaning in. Francis was hesitant to let those big jaws near his sensitive shaft. Rheina felt his little struggles and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, you wouldn't try to get between a spirit of gluttony and her next meal, right?\" She said cheerily, making her date relax and resign himself to her. She quickly sent him cross-eyed with arousal as her thick lips pressed down on his cock. It stood no chance as the overwhelmingly stimulating lips played with it. They squeezed, suckled and slurped on the little shaft. It was hard to wring much goodness out of something this small, but the way he was now bucking to push it in deeper was simply too adorable. He squirted out a minute load by Rheina's standards, but she still eagerly gulped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... tasty.\" She complimented, making him blush. \"Now, would you like to try and return the favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis looked up to his date and raised a curious eyebrow. \"How could I possibly pleasure you? You're huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you already know...\" She said mysteriously. The stoner still didn't understand what she was referring to until she sat back a little and parted her legs. Suddenly her interest became all too clear and with a pang of hesitation he was lowered down to her crotch. If there was any shame left in him after that blowjob it all evaporated at the sight of the enormous elephantine pussy. It was utterly drenched in pungent slime, a small trickle leaking out like a river. She had been every bit as aroused by this as him, and likely far more to boot. Words to describe her horniness failed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been so long since I've felt a man wriggle in my bowels like you did...\" She cooed, putting him down right in front of her snatch. \"Go on, have fun. Do with me as you please.\" She fought back the urge to moan at saying those words. Francis was shocked to hear this powerful beast beckoning him to ravage her like that. It seemed almost too good to be true. But the pussy in front of him looked as hungry as the rest of Rheina. There was no doubt in his mind that it would try swallow him whole if it got the chance. Admittedly, given how survivable the spirit's insides were it might not be the worst place to be, but making her lose control further might put his health at risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd come too far to back down now. He straightened himself up and approached the elephant woman's pussy, eager to provide both of them an unforgettable experience. Rheina panted and moaned, ready for her date to blow her mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Francis put both hands on the slickened surface of her pussy, making the large elephant woman shiver with delight. She was so on edge already it didn't seem like it would take much to achieve a climax. Even someone as small as him might pull it off. But when faced with a pussy that large it was painfully clear he'd need to think outside the box. His dick wasn't going to do much. He kept rubbing the slippery folds, occasionally giving her clit a gentle massage, eliciting a moan from up above. Rheina tried to guide him, but most of her words were scrambled by waves of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing else for it. He already imagined this was going to happen one way or another. Even if her whole shtick wasn't centered around hunger of all kinds, it seemed unlikely someone as enormous as her was going to be satisfied any other way. Francis shot her a knowing smile before sitting down in front of her womanhood. He used his feet to massage the folds for a brief moment before committing to his plan. With a subtle squelch he slid them between the pulsing walls, feeling a narrow tunnel and sticking them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah!\" Rheina cried out. She didn't expect him to actually do this on his own. The elephant woman was fine with letting him play around before taking charge herself and inserting him. But this was so much better. To feel the little man working his way inside of her on his own. She leaned back, spreading her thick legs wide and giving him all the room he could want to complete his act. She moaned again when his legs pushed in deeper. It felt spectacular. By now half his body was squirming inside her love tunnel. But a spirit of gluttony is always hungry for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis propped himself up, ready to slowly slide in more of himself. Suddenly he felt the insides of Rheina's pussy stir. The wet walls bore down on him, squeezing his legs. This was nothing new, but now he could feel himself being pulled in a little with each squeeze. He tried not to spoil the intimacy by laughing, but of course even her pussy was a ravenous orifice capable of swallowing things. The stoner smiled, knowing the rest of his plan would be a lot easier now. Slowly the large netherlips drew closer as the elephant woman steadily sucked her date up her snatch. It only stopped when everything but his head was inside. Finally she had gathered enough words to form a sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, little man.\" She cooed before pulling the last of him inside. Once her prey was swallowed the elephant woman relaxed, but shortly thereafter a jolt of electricity shot through her. He had come to life inside of her, thrashing and squirming wildly. She was flush with arousal, responding with her pussy bearing down on him and soaking him in her feminine juices. Moaning loudly, the spirit of gluttony felt pleasure in ways she rarely ever got to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her first orgasm hit she cried out with unrestrained bliss, the windows in her house rattling from the volume. Her immense pussy bore down on the little man inside, pushing him out partially in a torrent of her release. He sputtered and coughed, only his head and shoulders popping out from the twitching lower lips. Rheina looked down at him, her face filled with satisfaction as well as a small pang of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh. That was amazing. But were you okay in there? You were starting to go wild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" He replied with a cocky grin. \"Nothing less is gonna do it for you, ain't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina gave him a sly smirk. Francis didn't need to guess what would happen next. He gave her a nod and in mere moments the hungry pussy swallowed him up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime after time he squirmed wildly like a struggling helpless victim in the jaws of her ravenous monster pussy. She let her snatch 'chew' on its prey before another powerful orgasm overtook her. After a while she stopped even checking in on him, knowing he was just fine with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis had a joyous smile on his face. This was without a doubt the strangest kind of sex he'd ever had. But the sheer enormity of everything around him also made it with a distance the best sex of his life. The arousing scent all around him, the soft, smooth walls. The full-body massage whenever they bore down on him. For each orgasm he felt rushing through his date he added one of his own. His overstimulated dick squirting out a mere drop in the lake of her juices. He felt the walls around him stir again, but this time they pushed him out. His head emerged from her pussy and he looked up to see Rheina, haggard and spent. She was as tired as him, but smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're amazing, little man.\" She cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you.\" Francis replied, unable to think of anything wittier to say in his current state.</span></div></div>",

If you want you can stay here for the night too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis gives her a big smile. \"I've not got anything planned for tomorrow, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay.\" Rheina exclaimed, before her expression sank down into a concerned frown. \"Small problem though, I've not really got a guest room for you. I don't get a whole lot of guests in hell after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoner wiggled a little, sending a small wave of pleasure through his date's body. \"I'm sure you can improvise a sleeping bag of some kind...\" He said with a cocky smile. She gave him a knowing look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we go to bed, wanna watch a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna stay in there?\" Rheina asked suggestively. It felt great to have the little guy stuffed in her snatch, his every movement eliciting more pleasure from her. It took the little man hilariously little time to nod in agreement, though he did have one issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you turn me around? Kinda hard to enjoy the movie when everything's upside down.\" Francis gave her a goofy smirk. She laughed and with a little effort realigned the man lodged in her pussy so he could enjoy the movie with her. She picked out a favorite from her collection, a campy horror film called Anaconda. Francis had seen it before but he was always up for some cheesy movie. It only seemed expected for him that Rheina's favorite movie was about a monster snake that swallowed things whole. But as they watched he noticed that the version she had was a little different. Many of the most gruesome scenes were drawn out even further, showing in detail how the snake feasted on the unfortunate humans. Many of the old scenes also seemed to have been redone with almost lifelike effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a director's cut or something? I don't recall this film being quite so... graphic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we tend to re-shoot some scenes down here in hell. And since we can conjure up just about anything and have an infinite supply of damned souls ready to be the victim... let's just say this version doesn't have any special effects in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis wasn't sure how to feel about it, but he couldn't deny that apparently hell had a great sense of cinema. Even a campy cheesefest like this movie could be turned into something more disturbing. As time went on though, the stoner realized there was another monster he had to contend with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina's pussy had been calm, letting the little man watch the movie in peace. But with each death on screen the elephant woman got a little more aroused. She seemed eager to re-enact the scenes of people being swallowed whole, her love tunnel pulling the man inside. The spirit of gluttony was always quick to push him back out so he could enjoy the movie, but she couldn't deny how good it felt. Francis didn't seem to mind it all that much, happily wiggling inside of her to coax her hungry snatch into releasing enough of him to continue watching. The little game slowly overtook their interest in the movie and by the time the final minutes rolled around he was quoting the villain word for word before the hungry monster swallowed him up. He thrashed around, pretending to fight for his life as the pussy bore down on him. The stoner let himself go limp, acting like the monster pussy has crushed the life out of him like the snake from the movie. It felt amazing, the elephant woman no longer able to hold herself back and letting out a loud moan. Her climax was intense enough to carry the little man halfway out, giving him the freedom to move his arms for the first time in hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used this newfound leverage to turn himself around, his legs still swirling around in her snatch. The inner walls proved unwilling to release him. It was getting late and both of them were feeling sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've not got a bed spare, but maybe you can sleep on the couch?\" She said coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you've got more options than that...\" Francis mused, putting a mischievous smirk on Rheina's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you'd say that... So which part of me do you want to sleep in?\"</span></div></div>",

But his suggestion wasn't wrong. Her round gut even rumbled a little to confirm it. She gave him a lewd smile and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, but first you'll have to free yourself from that affectionate tunnel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis smiled at the challenge laid out before him. He could already feel the inner workings of the spirit of gluttony bracing themselves to inhibit his escape. He had to act fast before she'd slurp him right back up. His feeble kicks did nothing but arouse her. That's when the lightbulb in his head finally turned on. Playfully or otherwise, Rheina had already demonstrated she could overpower any efforts to fight his way out. But he was in this position instead of fully swallowed up because she'd hit a climax. One more and he'd be free. His eyes locked onto their target. Her glistening pleasure button. He reached out to it and took hold of the small fleshy nub with both hands. Immediately it felt like he'd electrocuted his date, a shockwave of pleasure rushing through her and shaking up his world. She moaned loudly, encouraging him to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina couldn't believe the amount of sheer, unfiltered sexual fun she was able to draw from this eager little man. She'd forced damned souls to please her, but their fearful attempts didn't come close to someone who was sincerely trying to make her the happiest demon in hell. Francis' little hands worked feverishly, making it increasingly difficult to keep him pinned in place. When his lips graced her clit she knew it was game over. With a howling moan she unleashed another flood on her couch, pushing the rest of her date outside. He'd succeeded in defeating her challenge with style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you go to hell, I'll make sure you get your own personal heaven.\" She mumbled, the stoner laughing along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when I go to heaven, I'll demand the big guy upstairs let you in too.\" He added, earning a long \"Awwww...\" From Rheina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've spent the last few hours in the company of a demon, fucking her several times over.\" The spirit mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've spent the last few hours making love to the greatest woman I've ever known, providing as much as I could to sate her every need. If that's not good enough for heaven, I'll take your company in hell over that.\" He said theatrically. She reached down and picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've still got one need to sate, little man.\" She said seductively, opening her maw wide. He smiled, giggling a little as her large tongue lapped away at the thick slime coating his body. Her pleased hums let him know she was a fan of her own product. With most of her feminine juices lapped away she paid some extra attention to his manhood. The squishy tongue flicked and teased it, drawing a small spurt from him. She was impressed that he still had any left to give after being marinated in her arousing juices for hours. Finally she brought him in for the main event. Her pursed lips wrapped around his feet as she slowly and sensually slurped him inside. They exchanged one last amorous glance before he slipped past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs were already on their way down her gullet when she pressed and squeezed him lightly with her tongue. She savoured the taste for just a moment longer before a large gulp sent him halfway down her throat. A second gulp sealed the deal and she held a hand on her neck to feel her little morsel sliding down into her spacious belly. Francis landed with a splash, the slimy juices in her stomach feeling warm and welcoming. The smell was almost pleasant. Either she was working her dark trickery or he really was getting used to it after spending so much time inside his date. The large, fleshy chamber moved as she walked to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, little Francis.\" She mumbled as she laid herself down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, my love.\" He answered, unsure if she could hear him from inside her gut. As his environment came to rest he laid himself down on the soft, slimy surface. He managed to find a spot away from the pool of juices in the pit of her stomach, yawning loudly before drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Francis awoke when his 'bedroom' turned, sending him tumbling into a pool of stomach juices. It wasn't the most gentle wake-up call, but he felt thoroughly rested all the same. He was soaked from head to toe in slimy goop though. The fleshy chamber began to wobble a little as his date got up on her feet and started walking around. He could hear her heavy footfalls as she walked over to the bathroom, seemingly not carign about the ride she was giving him in there. Did she forget about him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepyhead, did you enjoy your luxury bedroom?\" She cooed, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis reached over and rubbed one of the walls, replying \"You bet, it's great in here.\" He still wasn't sure if she could hear him, but at least the gentle rubbing should indicate to her how he's feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...\" She murred. \"I'm gonna take a quick shower, you just stay put. You can keep doing that though, it's nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoner nodded, still running his hand along the slimy surface of her stomach. He could hear her stepping into the shower. The water raining down actually sounded really calming, like rain on a roof. Entranced by the strange beauty Francis almost stops, but he's brought back to reality when Rheina starts twisting and stretching in the shower to get all of her hefty form cleaned. It took some time for her to tend to her large gut, patting it once more. But it was time for her little belly prisoner to be released. She hurked and gagged and in record time the little man came flying out of her mouth, caught in two strong hands. He blushed a little as she set him down in the shower. The water was still running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go and wash up too. Oh, and before I forget it...\" She said, gagging again. She spat out a weird lump. It landed at Francis' feet, coated in yellowish slime. It took him a moment to recognize, but they were his clothes, the ones she swallowed during their date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks dude. I was worried I'd have to get new ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, anytime. Now get yourself cleaned and dressed.\" She said, leaving the bathroom to get some food in the kitchen. Francis wouldn't keep her waiting for long. The shower gave him some time to reminisce as he washed her stomach juices of himself and his clothes. He sort of expected these things to happen. She did after all mention being a spirit of gluttony frequently during their texts before the date. Mercifully his precautions put her in a good mood and the date went well. It wasn't too much of a stretch to believe he'd be digested if she wasn't so pleased with him. But that sense of danger just made her more attractive in his eyes. She was a woman unlike anything he could've ever imagined, and not just because of her elephantine features and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of daydreaming in the shower he finished up and joined Rheina in the kitchen. She was predictably stuffing her face with snacks. Though she was busily munching on them she reached down, offering him a bag of chips. Francis raised a curious brow at the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said never get between a spirit of gluttony and their food, what's it mean when one shares their food with you?\" He asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means stop overthinking things and dig in, silly.\" She replied with her mouth full. He was kind of hungry, so with a shrug he took a handful of chips, calmly munching them as Rheina emptied the rest of the bag in her cavernous maw. After her morning feast was finished she turned to him, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Francis... I believe this is the part where we part ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, I guess... But I had loads of fun here, you know. We should definitely plan another date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... uhm... I don't want to sound too pushy, but... did you have any plans for today?\" She asked, blushing brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Nah, I guess I don't. Oh hey, that means I can stay here, right?\" He jumped on the situation, wanting to save his date some embarrassment. She looked relieved not to have to ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that would be so sweet.\" She cooed. But there was more she wanted to say. The elephant woman fidgeted nervously for a second before just spitting out what was on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I invite some friends over? They'd all love to meet you, maybe even play with you if you're comfortable with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're as cute as you are, sure. Though maybe that's setting the bar too high.\" Francis replied with a cheesy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, stop it you. Or you'll be stuffed somewhere inside me before they even get here.\" She jokingly mutters whilst grabbing her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't threaten me with a good time.\" The stoner laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina giggled at her date, then called her friends on the phone. They arrived moments later, teleporting right up to her front door and ringing the bell. Francis nearly lost it when he learned that the doorbell was just a loud burp. There were so many odd little details about Rheina and he couldn't wait to learn more about her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Come in, girls, he's waiting right here.\" Rheina said joyfully. Francis tried not to gawk too much at the strange assortment of creatures that walked into the living room. First was a large cow woman. She looked incredibly powerful, muscular from head to toe. Her body was covered in short fur, save for her arms. They had not only longer fur, but fearsome looking spikes jutting out of them. She was nearly as tall as Rheina, striking an intimidating figure. Her menacing pose was only slightly undercut by her friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a small goblin-like creature. Small was relative in this house though, as she still stood as tall as the stoner. She wore a long, richly detailed coat and had a abundance of jewelry on her fingers. She gave the human a curious look, waving awkwardly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast to enter was a hefty boar-woman. Francis could smell her before she even entered the room. Her bristly fur was patchy and stained. Her tattered clothes had massive patches of grease and sweat in them. He was surprised the other two weren't reacting to her vile stench at all. He'd spent most of the last few years smelling like stale weed and even he couldn't ignore the almost visible green miasma wafting off her. Rheina followed the three into the living room and introduced all of them to her little human friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, here he is. This is Francis, the human I was talking about. We met on Monstr and we had the best date ever yesterday. And since he didn't have anything to do today he agreed to stay a little longer and meet you guys. Francis, meet Lola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow woman stepped forward and reached out a hand. But when he shook it she pulled him off his feet and into her chest. It was softer than the heavily muscled appearance would have him believe. The bearhug that followed was anything but soft though. She giggled a little, clearly holding back. Nevertheless the stoner wheezed and patted her chest, trying to tap out of the uncomfortable hold. She wouldn't let him go without introducing herself first though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cutie, my name is Lola and I'm from the Circle of Violence. Most days I beat damned souls to a pulp, but you're so adorable I just want to hug you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina saw her human struggling in the strong grip and joked at her friend. \"Hah, you squeeze him any harder and he'll pass out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Lola said with an insincere tone, setting the heavily panting man back down on the ground. Next to approach him was the goblin. It reached out a jewelry-laden hand, avoiding eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Ann'Zaquuul'Morr'Damnatus, or Anna for short. She's from the Circle of Greed. Don't let her diminutive figure fool you, she's got favors running from a lot of demons around here. We don't need bribes to help her though, we just like her a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna blushed and smiled, giving the human a quick glance. He shook her hand, all the jewels and glimmers on her sleeve jingling as he did. When he pulled his hand away he found two ornate golden coins in it. Francis held them out to the goblin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you dropped something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him, staring intently at the human for the first time. Her gaze was unnerving to the stoner, who wondered if he'd just insulted her. After a few moments of silence she answered with a raspy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? Okay.\" Francis said, shrugging and sliding the two coins in his pocket. He didn't pay them any more mind as the boar was about to be introduced. Hopefully she wasn't a hugger like the cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this here is Volka. She works in the Circle of Betrayal. Tell her what you do.\" Rheina said, stifling a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, first a succubus transforms me to look like her. Then I get some damned fool to agree to share a small home for a year. The horny bastards can't sign on quick enough. The spell drops and I make their life literal torture for a year. And we repeat that forever. They always fall for it again. But don't worry yourself, you seem nice. I don't think you'd end up in my corner of hell anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks? I think...\" Francis stammered, unsure of what to say to that. \"...I do hope that if I end up down here it's with one of you guys. You're all really friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women giggle up a storm before taking a seat. Francis climbs up onto the couch and wedges himself between Rheina and Lola, the spirit of gluttony providing a hefty, pillow-like cheek for him to lean on.</span></div></div>",

Here, you can sit on my lap.\" She cooed, grabbing Francis and pulling him free. He gulped quietly as he was set down in the large cow demon's lap. Rheina just chuckled as the human's cheeks turned nearly as red as Lola's fur. Lola draped her arms around the man, holding him in place but thankfully sparing him the painful pressure of her earlier hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demons all began to chat about work a little, regaling eachother with stories of particularly defiant damned souls being brutally put in their place. Volka's story stood out to Francis as she told the others about being able to trick her victim all the way into having sex with her before her true form was revealed. And when her disgusting self was riding on top of him, she demanded he still finish inside her in between using her fat belly to smother him to near suffocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina was quick to try and one-up that story. She told everyone of putting a defiant soul in her jaws and slowly biting down until he stopped resisting. Then she let only his head escape past her lips and commanded him to declare his undying love to her lest she'd start chewing. In a panic he did, sealing his fate. She swallowed him whole and digested him alive, but his undying love let him regenerate outside her body. The next year she ate him twice a day, making him declare his love every time until he finally had enough and begged her to just end him. She obliged and bit down hard, but had conveniently neglected to tell the guy that the eternal part of 'eternal damnation' usually meant he'd just be handed over to a different demon now. Everyone laughed, though Francis was mostly trying to fit in. Stories of torment and horror weren't really his thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon their attention turned to the little man. Rheina gushed about how sweet he was, both in personality and in taste. She made him blush, though seeing her salivate wildly just at the thought of having him in her belly again was still a bit unsettling, even if he knew no harm would come to him. Lola tightened her embrace on him, rubbing him against her muscular belly and mooing with delight. \"He's so soft too, perfectly smooth. I could cuddle you all day long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis smiled. \"That wouldn't be fair to the others. I mean, Anna looks practically green with jealousy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demons all laughed except for the goblin-like one, who just shot him a sly smirk. Francis felt a bad about his comment now. Maybe their skin color was a sore point to them. He reached out to her. \"Come now, don't be angry. You want a cuddle with the human too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile got three times wider as she reached in her sleeve and pulled out a small stack of coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to cuddle a demon? Ten of these say you won't last five minutes with Volka here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis didn't like that she tried to involve money in her interactions again, though as a demon of greed it might just be in her nature. Still, he had a perfect counter for the sly one. \"I don't need money to give Volka some attention. So how about I accept your challenge, but instead if I succeed I want a hug from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin's eyes darted back and forth, a calculating gaze. She stared him right in the eye again and nodded. \"Fine, give it your best shot. For starters, try wrestling yourself free from Lola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis simply craned his neck up to the cow demon and said but a single word. \"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola mooed with delight. \"He's so polite.\" She amped up her embrace to painful levels for a second before parting her arms, seemingly to the goblin's dismay. Francis wandered along on the large couch, getting closer to Volka. She looked increasingly eager to cuddle the man. But with each step her repellent stench also grew more foul. Francis soldiered on. He was a man of his word and he would stay true to that even in the face of this challenge.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Volka reached out a hand towards the little man. Francis had been lifted off his feet several times before already by Rheina, but he was still a little hesitant to take hold of her hand. He wouldn't be put in Volka's lap, that's for sure. It was already occupied completely by her large belly. Her shirt was a few sizes too short to cover all of it, letting him see the greasy short fur on this boar woman. It almost looked like it moved on its own, a putrid garden for whatever organisms could stand to grow in there. He steeled himself and let her take hold of his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up you go.\" Volka said cheerfully as she hoisted him up high and let him land on her chest. Her shirt did little to mitigate the wet smack he made as he landed on their soft surfaces, making the demonic boar woman giggle a little. The stench he faced was unreal. A burning garbage fire seemed like a bouquet of roses in comparison. But the stoner would not be deterred so easily. He made a promise to show this rancid beast some love and he would provide it. He got down on his knees atop the unsteady surface and leaned forward, reaching around her neck. He gave the boar woman a big hug, resulting in a chorus of 'awwww's from around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Anna cooed sarcastically. But she wasn't about to let the human win her bet so easily. \"I think the human wants a kiss.\" She offered, smiling menacingly at Francis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis blood ran cold as he imagined kissing the grotesque beast he was hugging. Mercifully Volka didn't seem keen to immediately grab him and force herself on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, can I?\" She said excitedly, looking over to Rheina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant woman chuckled and nodded. \"Okay, but just one little kiss. He's still my date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis didn't get a chance to protest as Volka's hand grabbed the back of his head and pulled him away from her throat. His eyes met hers and even her soft expression couldn't abate the sense of dread he felt. Her noxious breath washed over him as she came in for the smooch of a lifetime. Slimy saliva leaked onto him as Volka gave the puny man a wet, sloppy kiss. Resistance was futile as her powerful grip kept him in the splash zone at all times. The foul smell was atrocious, an assault on his nostrils in liquid form. It wasn't made any better by her nasty kiss all but forcing the stuff up his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wet squelch her lips finally released their victim, showing off Francis' drool-soaked head to the others. Laughs were had, but Anna seemed perturbed that the puny human was still hanging in there. Volka's tall tales of knocking men out with a single smooch might have been a little exaggerated it seems. But the cunning little goblin was far from done playing dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that he loves big bellies, ain't that right Rheina? I bet he would like you to put him in your lap and smother him under your fat gut.\" She suggested, Rheina confirming his love for her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more, human!\" Volka cheered, leaning back to hoist her belly up from her legs. It provided just enough space for her to slot the little man in, sliding him along her sweaty legs and close to her groin. The smell was given a fishy undertone and ramped up in intensity so bad Francis' nose was actually starting to hurt. The rest of his body joined in when the huge, looming belly came down on his back, smothering him in complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight was unpleasant, but nothing was more gutwrenchingly nasty as feeling her bare skin against his back. It wasn't just sweaty, it was a strange sort of slime, a foul concoction of aged sweat, stains, grease and who knows what else. It seeped into him and he was certain there wasn't a shower in the world that would ever have him smell normal again. As he mired in the stinky ooze he could hear voices overhead. After a few minutes, or one eternity for the little man, Volka reached in and pulled him free. With a cheeky grin she put him down on the couch beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"30 seconds to go, human. Can you really go back to her after all that?\" Anna cooed, her voice dripping with malice. She'd no doubt made his experience with Volka far worse. Would he be able to overcome this challenge?</span></div></div>",

His eyes widened with fear as she dragged him towards her hefty rear. But before he could collide with the smelly mass she stood up. Francis was confused until he realized he'd been dragged into Volka's seat, the residual warmth and stench barely distracting as he looked up to the nightmare he was about to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving far faster than he ever thought possible the boar demon slid down her pants, showing off her immense unwashed ass to the puny man. He only needed to last 25 more seconds, but in the face of Volka's rear that seemed like an eternity. Not wanting the human to get cold feet she quickly sat herself back down, taking some care not to simply crash onto the couch and crush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever gentleness Volka may have employed was hard to notice for Francis. He found himself pressed down into the couch by an overwhelming amount of weight. Mercifully the demon's ass was as soft as it looked, even if the greasy surface made his skin crawl. It reminded him a bit of Rheina's immense posterior, albeit it considerably slimier. The other nasty addition to this little personal hell was the boar woman's intermittent farting. Francis could feel the hot air rush past his face as Volka showed off her most disgusting habits. He tried to squirm, but she just ground her ass back and forth, mashing him into the couch a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally some light shone on his face again as the boar demon stood up, pulling up her pants. Francis shuddered and sputtered, slowly regaining his bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, get a move on. Unless you like that and want me to sit on you some more?\" Volka mused, getting ready for round two. Francis broke out into a frantic sprint, leaping out from under her before he could be smothered again. The demons all laughed at his panicked response, but the stoner was quick to compose himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw dude. I can't let you have all the fun. Not when Anna here owes me a hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin-like demon next to him turned a few shades lighter green, thinking of ways to weasel out of this. How was he still conscious? Volka always boasted about her foul stench being able to knock them out cold in under two minutes. And even after farting in his face he was still awake. What else has that boar woman been embellishing? She shot a look over to Lola and Rheina, but those two were too busy giggling at her sudden nervousness.</span></div></div>",

Rheina and Lola both watch as he stops and reaches out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay dude? If you don't wanna do this that's cool.

There was an admirable sense of confidence in her, but this felt a little silly. How bad can it be to make a wager and lose? Was it some kind of cardinal sin in her realm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya, he's a real wildcard.

Meanwhile the little man took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, if this is weighing on your mind so badly then you don't owe me nothing. And if that doesn't work for you then you can just take as long as you want to deliver the hug. I'm not gonna rush y~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that!\" She hissed. \"I'm supposed to be the one that all humans owe favors to. I've got trades running with demons of all kinds, that's normal. But you... How did you survive that? I've heard Volka talk about doing that stuff to humans and knocking them out or even straight up killing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta admit, I'm kinda curious too.\" Volka added. \"Though I'm mostly happy, 'cause it means I can do even more to ya.\" She smirked, but Rheina sighed and shook her head. She preferred it if her human didn't taste like boar demon ass forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno dudes, I guess smoking a bale of weed a year just kinda does that to ya. But I gotta say Anna, it also makes you kinda forgetful. I don't think I can remember any demons owing me anything.\" Francis hammed up the second half, shooting the demon a sly wink. He would never be able to grasp the sense of relief that washed over the little goblin. She finally seemed to calm herself down, scurrying over to Francis and giving him an awkward hug. Not because she owed him, but because she liked him. He patted her back and exchanged a wholesome smile with the other demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna hugged him a little more fiercely before whispering in his ear. \"If you ever tell anyone about what happened here I will find the biggest demon in hell and make him use you as a buttplug for a century.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis smirked and whispered back. \"I've got no idea what you're talking about, all we did was hug.\" He spoke in a dramatic tone, making the little goblin demon smile. She released him from her embrace, sliding a few coins in his pocket which Francis promptly returned. The other three demons all looked at the wholesome scene with big smiles and enamored stares.</span></div></div>",

He nodded and thought about trying to reach the large elephant woman. Lola was still in the way, but thankfully she seemed happy to help him on his journey. She grabbed the little man and gave Rheina a sly look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, little guy, I'll help you. Hey Rhei', catch!\" She called out before throwing him up in the air. The spirit of gluttony was sat right next to Lola, so she barely needed to throw Francis to her. But what his flight lacked in distance it made up for in height. He nearly hit the ceiling before plummeting down towards the loving embrace of his girlfriend. He smiled broadly when he saw the type of landing pad she had prepared for him, pushing her breasts together. He crashed into them and felt the soft mass absorb the impact with ease. The jiggly surface didn't stop shaking for a while, making him flail a little to maintain his balance. He gave the elephant woman a grateful smile, but the look in her eyes made it clear she was looking for something special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola giggled loudly at the pair sitting beside her. \"Hehehe, you two look so cute. Can I have some time with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lola, the only way you know how to express friendship with humans is broken bones. I think he's been through enough already and deserves a little break.\" Rheina muses. Francis was happy to hear her stick up for him, though he was filled with a sense of unease as well. So far things have been pretty far from normal with these demons, so who knows what their idea of a 'break' is for him. The elephant woman was quick to fill in some of those questions by grabbing hold of his head and bringing it to her pursed lips. The others cooed and cheered as she planted an overwhelming kiss on his face. Volka giggled as she saw his limbs tense up from the sudden rush of passion before the man gave in to the elephant woman smothering his face in a slobbery smooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis began to lean into her kiss when the big lips suddenly parted and his head slipped inside. Rheina effortlessly switched from kissing to suckling, her large tongue toying with the little man's head. He wasn't afraid of it anymore, but it would take a long time for this to stop feeling weird. Already he began to realize she would want more than just his head and he tried to stand up and push more of him inside. A deep giggle echoed around him as the pursed lips began to squeeze around his chest before a loud slurping drew him further into the elephantine maw. He felt the tight grip shift along his body until only his legs were left outside. Like a pair of oversized noodles there were soon sucked in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gluttonous demon swirled her boyfriend around in her maw, the others spectating with amused smiles. With each passing second Rheina began to moan a little louder, enjoying his exquisite taste. He was so calm, letting her play with him to her heart's content. Finally she let his head pop out from between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye bye, little guy. You were a lot of fun.\" Lola cooed. Anna just silently nodded, the vaguest hint of a smile visible under her finely embroidered hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can have some more fun together later.\" Volka said, winking at him and smacking her wide rear. He winced a little at the thought. But before he could say a word Rheina pulled him back inside and guided him towards her ever hungry gullet. \"Emjoyw\" She mumbled with her mouth full before a big gulp turned the man into a large bulge sinking down along her neck. With her human safely contained the elephant woman and her friends happily continued chatting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Francis lost track of time as he relaxed in the comfy warmth of Rheina's stomach. He didn't remember it being this small the last time. There was still enough room for him to stretch and get comfortable, but he's fairly sure that it was bigger the last time he was in here. Did the elephant woman have more than one stomach or could she just change it to suit her needs? It wouldn't surprise him if both were true. He didn't think on it much longer, instead trying to listen to all the sounds around him. The subtle wet squelches whenever his surroundings moved or undulated. The steady pace of her heartbeat in the distance. The vague murmurs overhead whenever she talked. He couldn't understand a word of it from within her depths, which was strange. He's certain she'd been able to talk to him before. Maybe she used some special inside voice for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis relaxation was brought to a halt when the stomach squeezed together around him, pushing him back up. He was needed outside and Francis tried his best to assist the spirit of gluttony in getting him out. In mere moments he was rocketing through her and spat out into her hands. A little weary and utterly sodden with stomach juices, but looking no worse for wear than before. He looked around and saw the other demons were still here. More curiously, they'd all shed what few pieces of clothing they wore. Even Anna had ditched the hooded cowl and ornate clothes, standing on the couch naked as the day she was spawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, hot stuff. We were about to leave and we knew you'd like to be part of that ceremony.\" Lola cooed with a wide smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Francis mumbled, unsure where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We always end our little meetings with some intimate fun. We're not in the circle of Lust, but that doesn't mean we don't like indulging ourselves.\" The large cow demon added, rubbing her pussy. \"And with you here, we've got a guest of honor. So go ahead, take your pick. Who do you want first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked up to Rheina, a concerned look on his face. She giggled a little before encouraging him. \"It's okay. You'll have a turn with all of us. I'm not the jealous type. Because I know I'll still have you when they've all left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis didn't know what to make of this. Before him were four demons, each eager and ready to let him fuck them. Even Anna was leering at him like she was fantasizing about all the ways she could bang him. It didn't take long for at least one part of him to react. He felt his manhood swell up with desire. There was no going back now. He let out a small sigh and began to mumble to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eenie meenie minie...\" He muttered, pointing back and forth between Lola, Anna, Volka and Rheina. Finally his choice landed and before he could confirm it to the others Lola had already snatched him up and pressed him into her soft chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I know you'd make the right choice. Now get ready for a pounding you won't ever forget.\" She cheered, dropping him onto the couch and looming over him. Her pussy was leaking with need already. She grunted a little and slammed her hips down on his groin. The impact was harsh, but far less painful than he'd feared. It barely hurt at all. When he wondered why he saw her hand wrapped tightly around his arm, red energies swirling around it. His confused look was enough for the eager demon to offer a quick explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm rerouting all the pain to me. Because it feels... so...\" Her sentence devolved into a lewd moan as she kept fiercely humping him. Hopefully This wasn't causing any lasting damage. It let him enjoy the moment, feeling her fiery hot insides slide up and down along his shaft. The heat would be unpleasant, but the sheer intensity of this embrace was enough to bring him to the very edge in moments. He didn't want to come so soon. Lola had barely been given a minute to enjoy his intimacy. He tried looking over to Volka, hoping that the memories of her disgusting assault earlier would help him hang on. But the other demons weren't sitting still whilst the cow demon milked his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina and Volka were sitting opposite one another, their legs intertwined and their crotches close to touching. The elephant woman dangled the diminutive Anna above them, lowering the greedy little demon between their pussies. She reached down, eager to be placed at the heart of the action. With a wet splat she was hidden from sight, utterly engulfed by two large snatches rubbing against eachother. Everyone was moaning and soon the man couldn't resist joining in the lewd chorus himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola's relentless approach inevitably got his juices flowing, his manhood spraying its load deep into her love tunnel. She let out a lengthy mooing moan, her pussy clamping down harder than ever, drawing every last drop out of him. He already felt spent. Hopefully the others would understand if he needed a minute to recharge. He wasn't the only one that looked worn out. The cow demon straddling most of his lower body appeared exhausted as well. She had to fight the urge to just slump down on him. Instead she wrapped him into a strong hug, cuddling with the man until the other three were finished with their little game.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Volka moaned loudly as the little goblin demon stimulating her pussy worked it as hard as she could. The large boar demon tried to squish her, but her efforts were brought to a halt as she cried out in ecstasy. Francis could tell that Rheina was close to reaching her own orgasm, but she held herself back. She also kept glancing over to him with a salacious look in his eye. The stoner wasn't sure what was going on in her mind, but he wouldn't need to wait much longer to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, do you see the way he's staring at us?\" She cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm? Sorry, did you say something?\" Volka gasped, still recovering from her previous release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at little Francis over there.\" Rheina replied, making the other two large demons look over to the man in Lola's arms. The cow demon was the first to catch his enamored look. The boar demon too caught on, giving him a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guest of honor didn't quite follow it, but the demons all knew. Volka reached inbetween herself and Rheina and fished out Anna. The small demon was drenched from head to toe in sticky, sexual release. She squirmed a little in Volka's grasp as she was offered to Lola. The vicious cow demon gave a deep sigh, squeezed Francis in her hug one last time and exchanged him for Anna. Volka eagerly accepted the stoner, wrapping him into a sweaty hug against her breasts. They were as soft as they were stinky, and even the stoner struggled to maintain his composure. Mercifully Rheina was there to wrap her trunk around his leg and slowly drag him to the really interesting part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boar demon chuckled and loosened her grasp, letting the man slide along her portly belly down towards her crotch. It smelled much worse up close, but Francis had a cure for that. He flipped himself around, filling his view with the elephant woman he'd fallen in love with. Her own gut was even more substantial, but as she dragged him down he came face to face with something ever greater. Her pussy made contact by rubbing firmly against his chest. Like a humongous slug it left a sticky trail of arousal along his body, lubricating him for what was to come. Volka only had to adjust a little before the man could feel her wet warmth caress him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth these demons were soaking wet already. Volka from her earlier orgasm and Rheina because she was saving hers for him. He wouldn't leave her hanging a moment longer. Though his movement was limited, he craned his head down and planted a fierce smooch on the elephant woman's clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not fa~aaaaaaaah\" She moaned, the volume skyrocketing as her words were mangled and her body couldn't contain itself a moment longer. Her pussy pressed itself against her boyfriend, coating him in her release. The flood felt like it would never end, the torrent of warm slime flowing over Francis' body soaking him to the bone. Volka wasn't quite back up to the point where she could add much to the adventure, but she knew her friend well enough to know that this was far from all she had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the action came to a close the two large demons started moving, gently massaging the man between their sensitive pussies. They squeezed and relaxed in ways he didn't think possible. Even the foul stench coming from Volka's side of the action couldn't detract from the intense experience. It wasn't long before he was rock hard again, his cock slipping between Rheina's folds. She moaned as she felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis gave a few careful thrusts, moving his body as much as the demons permitted. The overwhelming stench of sex put him on the very edge in moments, but it was Rheina's ability to clamp her enormous vagina down on his manhood that sealed the deal. Even as her flood would outperform his release a thousandfold she made him feel big. She eagerly milked the little intruder dry, gasping and moaning as though there was no size discrepancy at all. He had no idea how she could make herself feel this eager and tight, but his thoughts were thrown out the window when she pulled another potent orgasm out of him. He thought Lola had drained his tank, but apparently there was still plenty more to give.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Volka and Rheina were having the best time smothering Francis between their pussies. The slick surface of their demonic womanhood slipping and sliding along his body whilst their intoxicating juices hazed his mind worse than any drug trip he'd even been on. The heady smell was so dense it felt like he could lean on it, were his mobility not almost completely squished between them. But when a guttural rumble came from the elephant woman's belly, it was clear to him that she desired more than just his dick inside her. She was hungry for the rest of him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, message received.\" He replied with a chuckle, pulling his arms free and caressing her love tunnel with them. Rheina just gasped, happy that her boyfriend was already so in tune with her needs. She gave him just enough space and he used it to slide his forearms into her depths. Volka noticed her friend going easy on squeezing the human and realized what would happen too. She intensified her rubbing, both eager to help him inside and desperate to push herself over the edge with his 'help'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis felt the large boar woman's cunt get increasingly pushy, putting up a token resistance as he tried to make sure his deep dive into Rheina would go smoothly. The large elephantine pussy before him seemed to open wider than ever before and after taking a theatrical deep breath he plunged his head inside. Volka gave another push right on cue, helping to make most of his torso vanish into the elephant's hungry nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh, yes Francis. Feed me.\" She cooed and moaned. The delightful sensation of her little human filling up her most sensitive passage was amazing. She could never tire of it. But her friend shoving him inside made it even better. Volka got more aggressive in her motions. She was so close to her peak that it could only take a few more~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Yes. Hmmmmmm.\" She humped fiercely, slathering what was still available of him with slippery goo. Most of it was wasted, splattering onto Rheina. But the man's cute little butt and legs were soaked too. A personal little parting gift from her. Though hopefully the elephant would keep this one around for longer. Most humans were fun to toy with, but this one was special. His eagerness was unlike anything she'd ever seen. Were she not tinted green with grease and grime already she'd be green with jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like most of her ravenous orifices Rheina didn't need long for her pussy to swallow its prey. Francis soon found himself in familiar territory, the intimate passage gently squeezing and massaging him. How it could feel tight enough for his dick yet loose enough to slip inside so easily he didn't understand yet. But it made the elephant woman the happiest demon in hell, so who cares, right? He enjoyed his stay, squirming a little to send waves of pleasure through her from time to time. Overhead he could hear talking. The demons were discussing something, but he wasn't able to understand what it was. He would just have to wait until this hungry pussy released him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few squelches rang from behind him, the sound of something entering Rheina's ravenous pussy. The walls began to get more animated as the intruder pushed its way in. He wondered what it could be. Was Rheina using her trunk to fish him out of herself? Did one of the others reach in to grab him? His questions mounted as he felt something bump into his feet. It felt remarkably like a face. Soon it slid past his feet and along his legs, pausing at his butt. He shuddered as it gave his rear a quick lick before moving up. Did they have another human toy that they hadn't told him about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, cutie.\" A familiar voice sounded close behind him. Suddenly he realized that one of these demons was a lot smaller than the others. In hindsight the answer was really obvious, the stoner's smile growing as he greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anna, you come here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know Rheina. Her pussy is as hungry for food as I am for money.\" She replied jokingly, shuffling up the wet tunnel until she was right behind Francis. He felt every curve of her body as the walls all around him pressed them together. Whenever the immense pussy relaxed he squirmed, trying to turn himself around. His squirms served to arouse Rheina further, her juices starting to flow. They helped lubricate the process and before long he was face to face with Anna. The greedy demon planted a kiss on his face as a reward. It seemed that when the others weren't looking she wasn't nearly as shy about showing her affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you to these parts?\" He asked, his tone a jovial as hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone else has had a turn, now I want mine.\" She stated plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here? What would Rheina think?\" Francis was a little uncertain. It was hard to point where a demon might draw the line, but this felt like it could be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rheina suggested this. Now quit your worrying and give me what you have.\" Her arms wrapped around him and she held onto him. It wasn't possible to squeeze him closer to herself, the walls around the two already provided plenty of tightness. It didn't take long for his manhood to rise up either. Between the overwhelming scent of sex inside the elephant woman's love tunnel and the goblin-like demon rubbing herself against him there was plenty of stimulation. Anna lined herself up well and with ease it slipped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis wasn't sure what to expect, but somehow it felt both predictable and exciting. Anna's pussy was very active, squeezing, massaging and milking his manhood intensely. It was nigh impossible to offer any resistance as his orgasm was pulled from him. He came within seconds, moaning in unison with Anna. At least she seemed to enjoy the speed of it all as well. But even as his shaft wilted inside her, the demon's snatch kept going. It tried in vain to keep him inside her, but he and Anna both knew his manhood was spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little demon looked down the immense love tunnel and spoke in a language Francis couldn't understand. As if was on command Rheina's pussy began to come to life. The walls pressed the two together with renewed vigor as they heard muffled cries of ecstasy on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Francis asked, a little disturbed by what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told her I'm finished in here and we're ready to come out.\" Anna replied with a smile. There was no time for further argument as the walls chewed on their little bodies before clenching down hard. The pressure was brief but intense, the elephant woman really putting them through the wringer. It's a good thing Francis had experienced this before or he would've panicked for sure. It was more intense than last time, but the result was the same. A potent river of slime rushed down the tunnel as the walls relaxed, the man and small demon being flushed out of Rheina's pussy. It was a tighter fit this time though and they only got about halfway out, their legs dangling in the air. Almost immediately the elephant woman began pulling them back in, but mercifully she grabbed the two and freed them before her instincts could take over.</span></div></div>",

The soft globes were a welcome respite from the intensity of her love tunnel. The stoner smiled from ear to ear, happier than ever before. With this most satisfying conclusion to their little orgy, the demons all take a minute to recover. Unsurprisingly Lola was ready for another round, but the elephant woman could tell that her date was a little too worn out to handle her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs things calmed down he was permitted a look on the clock. It was getting late already. Having intimate fun with these demons really screwed with his sense of time. \"Whoah. Hey Rheina, I think it's finally become time for me to head home. I gotta work tomorrow and I should sleep early to recover from my date.\" She blushed a little. The others all chuckled along too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's a pity it has to end, but I guess it was inevitable. Just plan a long weekend for our next date, okay sweetie? I've got so much more I want to show you.\" She pushed her breasts together a little to smother him in their embrace. He returned a smile at the overwhelming affectionate gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet, babe. I gotta say, I thought going to hell would be bad, but if other demons are as nice as you, how bad can it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, ask all the damned souls that aren't on our good side.\" Volka smirked maliciously. This little guy best not get the impression that their day job was anything other than relentlessly tormenting people. She then pulled out a small scrap of paper. \"Look, I'm not supposed to bestow favors on mortals, but dammit you're too adorable. Keep this close to yourself. If you ever have someone in need or a little misery in their life, write their address on it. I'll pay that house a visit once a week and leave behind some farts that'll make anyone reconsider living there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis gave an awkward smile. He didn't expect there to be gifts, let alone such... unique gifts. Anna piped up with something more conventional thankfully. \"Here, take this. This isn't a favor, there's no strings attached, it's a gift.\" She held out a small purse, jingling with coins. He was a bit too stuck between his girlfriend's tits to accept it, so the little goblin put it on the table next to Volka's gift. Lola wasn't one to be outdone though. She produced a scrap of cloth with a fiery red rune on it. It was intricately detailed, a stark contrast to what looked like a well-used oil rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this. If your blood touches that symbol it'll summon me to your side for a few minutes. If you're ever in danger and need a violent solution, rest assured I'll make sure there's nothing left of your enemies for any law enforcement to investigate.\" She proudly cracks her knuckles, looking ready to fight right now. Francis shuddered at the thought of her living up to those promises. Hopefully that's one sight he'll never need to see. With the other demons all bestowing gifts Rheina began to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I've not really thought of something for you.\" She said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's settle for a kiss then.\" The stoner replied with a cheesy smirk. She didn't need to be told twice and that big maneating maw pursed up for a sloppy smooch. Francis would love to lean into it, but he's currently wedged between two hefty breasts. The elephant woman's kiss is every bit as overwhelming as he expected, pulling his head into her maw and suckling on it like a lollipop. Finally he was permitted to leave the soft embrace of her chest and collect his gifts. He said his goodbyes to the other demons as they all poofed away in a flash of fire and smoke. Now it was just him and Rheina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should take you back home.\" She said, sighing wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise we'll be doing this again soon.\" Francis replied cheerfully. For all the weird, overwhelming craziness that he'd experienced over the last two days, he couldn't help but feel elated at the thought of taking another ride on this rollercoaster. It lifted the demon's spirits too, returning that kind smile to her face. \"I could carry you back, but maybe we can have a little fun with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I already think I know where this is going.\" Francis teased, holding up his hands and letting the elephant woman grab him. He would be making this journey inside of her, but where to put him. Rheina pondered her options.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Francis watched Rheina's face approach, both of them smiling from ear to ear. She pursed her lips and smothered his face with a soggy kiss. But as he could've predicted, there was no wet smack as their faces parted. Instead those thick lips slowly opened to accept his head into her maw. Her tongue awoke like an ancient beast from its slumber. The intruder in the cavernous maw was quickly assailed with big licks, the elephant woman moaning softly at his taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, you'we the mohst schrumpcious date I'vwe eveh hawd.\" She muttered with her mouth full. Francis wiggled, happy to be of service. Her gullet was eagerly awaiting his presence and with a noisy slurp she dragged most of his torso inside. Once his outstretched arms reached the back of her throat things sped up. The powerful muscles clamped down around his hands and Francis was only permitted a surprised 'whoah' before both arms had been sucked inside, his face mashed against the undulating folds. The next gulp sent half his body down, his feet just passing Rheina's lips. One last heavy gulp sent him travelling into the expansive network that was her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slimy waterslide lasted longer than he thought it would, finally depositing him in her stomach. He landed with a wet splat in a large chamber. The walls were soft and calm, steadily rocking back and forth as she walked back to their meeting spot. To his surprise the stay in her stomach was a brief one. It began to cramp up and constrict, forcing him down into her bowels. She was up to something, but he couldn't quite grasp what it is. Nor could he really fight back against it. Her body was in complete control, gently pushing and squeezing him through her guts. The tiny nubs lining her intestines tickled his sides, his giggles proving infectious as the elephant woman snorts, failing to hold back a laugh herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the narrow tube expanded into a large intestine. The walls were all immaculately clean save for a thin film of lubricating slime. It helped propel him to his final destination. Already he could see a few thin rays of light shine in as the puckered hole came closer. Rheina's instructions for this part were short and simple. \"Feet first.\" He heard echoing through her innards. The man obliged and stuck his feet into the tight passage. Almost on command the hole undulated and though it was still a bit of a squeeze, he slid out, landing on a blue tarp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of the long journey through his girlfriend, Francis was not too disoriented. It was hard to tell how much time had passed, but he knew exactly where he was. He stood up on his trailer, looking around the empty parking lot where this wonderful adventure had started. The stoner thought back to that moment. When he laid eyes on her, he was almost convinced he would end up eaten and digested. What compelled him to go through with this idea still eluded him. He looked up to see Rheina squatting over the trailer, letting out a small fart before realizing her date had already left the building. She turned around and cooed gently at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you look adorable.\" She patted the slime-soaked man gently, Giving him the space to hop off his trailer. He blushed and looked up to the elephant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I hope we'll see eachother again soon.\" He blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better believe it. I can't wait to taste you again.\" She smiled down at that tasty little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You spent two days tasting me with every orifice on your body.\" The stoner gave her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina leaned in, lowering her voice to a seductive whisper. \"I could taste you for a thousand years and not tire of the flavor.\" She licked her lips, looking ready to prove her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, alright, I'll bring some barbecue sauce to slather myself in next time.\" Francis joked, but the elephant woman gave a high-pitched squeak of joy at the suggestion. \"You know just how to spoil me, little snack.\" She was salivating onto his trailer, already imagining the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's been a real trip. See you soon.\" He mumbled, stretching his arms wide. Rheina gladly obliged, picking him up and wrapping him into an overwhelming hug. Her soft tits were delightful as ever, cushioning him against the pressure those hefty arms produced. She concluded the embrace with a kiss, setting him down and waving goodbye as he drove off.</span></div></div>",

Of South American descent, she stands at an imposing nine feet in height with a hefty body and chubby belly to match. Essentially being an anthropomorphic carnivorous boar-lady, Patricia has packed on quite the pounds over the years from all of the delicious humans that have traveled down her gullet. What can a girl say, they\u2019re quite tasty. She\u2019s also a big party animal, both figuratively and literally, but she also has a very short temper. However, she has had some interest in dating, and that Monstr app does give her an impressive list of options. And what\u2019s the worst that could happen? If she doesn\u2019t like her date she could just eat them. So, who does Patricia want to go out with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed - A nervous college student a few years younger than her. He isn\u2019t expecting Patricia to actually be a monster, believing Monstr to be a roleplaying app for people interested in supernatural creatures and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Ted is going to school for computer science and is very intelligent, if a bit quiet. Perhaps Patricia could liven him up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry - A 20-something survivalist who loves the outdoors and feels in-tune with nature. Very hearty and approachable, Larry is always the life of the party and usually has a pep in his step. He seems like a pretty good match for the boisterous boar-woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek - A stereotypical frat guy who loves to party until the sun comes up. Despite his ability to woe ladies of all sorts and show them a good time, most of those ladies are of the same species as him, plus, although he is a born-partier, Derek can come off a bit one-dimensional in conversation. He may sweep Patricia off of her hooves on the dance floor but beyond that he may run into some trouble.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days passed and the big night is here. Stephanie goes over her looks one last time. They agreed to meet on the forest's edge, where she would pick him up and take him to her home. Probably a smart call. There weren't many human places they could visit with her titanic stature and most of her usual hangouts would treat her date like a snack. She cooked up something nice for him already. Hopefully she didn't make his portion too small. With every detail of her appearance looking just as she wanted it Stephanie left her house in the mountains and went for her brisk walk to the forest's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant took careful steps. All those trees would snap like twigs under her tread, but she didn't want to make a mess of the forest. The thought ran by to grab a deer or something as a quick snack, but she didn't work hard to make a fancy dinner just to spoil her appetite now. Why was she so nervous anyway? This was just a one night thing. With a human of all things. What danger could it possibly pose? As the sun slowly began to set she saw a single car rolling down the road, slowing down and parking just outside the woods. Human hikers started their trails there, but something told her this wasn't another hiker. Her suspicion was confirmed when a man got out and waved at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArno was excited about this day. He'd always adored big girls and with just over five feet in height to his name there were plenty of those around him. But sadly he always fell short in their eyes. Now he was about to go on a date with someone so vast he could barely believe it. Seeing her towering over the treetops as he drove to their meeting point was awe-inspiring. That giant of a woman is there for him. He got out of his car and waved at her, smiling as she seemed to recognize him as her date. The ground trembled ever more with each approaching step. She kept coming closer until he feared this date might get cut short with one deadly misstep. Thankfully she stops in time, squatting down to take a closer look at her date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're even more adorable in person.\" Stephanie cooed, speaking softly so she wouldn't hurt his tiny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhehe, thank you.\" He stammered back. Though he was certain she had nothing but the best intentions for him, it was still intimidating as hell to stand before a woman this huge. He was no bigger than her pinky finger and he flinched as she brought her hand down, opening her palm before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, climb on. I'll carry you.\" She tried to sound encouraging, but the man seemed hesitant. He shuffled back to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I gotta grab something first.\" He said, opening the back door and retrieving a package. He put it in her hand and stepped back. \"Here, for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled by this tiny gift, Stephanie lifted her hand, bringing the plain looking box to her face for a closer inspection. With all the care she could muster she pushed it open to see what looked like a chocolate cake in it. It was shaped like a heart and finished a little sloppily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made it myself. I hope you like it.\" The man shouted from down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you didn't have to.\" She cooed again, throwing the whole thing into her mouth. It was little more than a quick piece of candy to the giantess, but the rich taste was divine. Human chocolate just tasted so much better than the monster version. \"Mmmmmm... Do you spoil all your dates, or am I lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them so far...\" Arno added, scratching the back of his head nervously. He was a little embarrassed by the truth, but that wasn't gonna matter now. Stephanie extended her hand again and this time he got on himself. Her fingers wrapped around him, holding him firmly and leaving only his head exposed. She lifted him to her mouth and for a moment he feared he would become her next meal. Her big lips pursed and smothered his face in a sloppy kiss. The giantess wasn't shy about showing her appreciation for a man who would go this far for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell we're both going to enjoy tonight a lot.\" She mused, holding him steady as she walked back home. It only took her a few minutes to traverse what Arno was certain would be a day-long hike for him. Finally they entered the giant house in the mountains. He was surprised to see how similar it looked to his own home, all the regular things were there. They were just scaled for someone huge, which put an interesting perspective on things. Most furniture was the size of buildings to him, cupboards standing 60 stories tall. Stephanie took a seat on the couch and held up the man in her hand. Gently she released him back into her open palm, smiling from ear to ear. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The giantess shot a quick look at the clock. Their romantic dinner was already in the oven and would need another fifteen minutes. Just enough time for a chat, or perhaps a little game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, Arno. Is this date everything you'd hoped it would be so far?\" She cooed softly at the little man in her hand. He breathlessly nodded, awestruck by the enormous environment he found himself in. He didn't think any of this was even possible, but here she was, the biggest woman he'd ever seen. And he was on a date with her. He kept daydreaming until he noticed her lips moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arno? Are you still with me?\" Stephanie teased as she wondered what was going through his little mind. She followed his gaze and found him staring blankly at her tits. That didn't seem like a coincidence. Her button up shirt was low cut enough to give him a sneaky look at the goods. It gave her an idea for a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked up to see her smiling. He knew that grin. She was up to something. Her fingers closed around him, holding him in place as she moved around on the couch. He was put down on the far side with Stephanie laying herself down along the full length. Her head was propped up by the arm rest and she spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want a kiss, you've got two minutes to get up here and collect it.\" She cooed, watching him burst into a mad dash towards her leg. She'd given him a reasonable amount of time in her mind. Two minutes was a long time and in spite of the unusual terrain she imagined his love would drive him forward. The first challenge would be not getting distracted. She was wearing a modest skirt, but he was between her legs being served the world's largest upskirt right now. And those black lace panties underneath didn't leave a whole lot to the imagination. To her surprise he took a second to admire it before getting back to his task. He was a man of discipline for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArno stood beside a leg thicker than he was tall. Even Stephanie's slim ankles were huge to him. The fabric of her socks let him climb on top with relative ease. He set off, running along the smooth surface of her leg. It felt weird to run on someone's body. The ground was a little yielding, like walking on a firm mattress. It made his movements look a little clumsier that he'd like, but soon he was running along her thighs. The fabric of her skirt provided slightly better footing, but he had to be careful not to slip off. Stephanie giggled a little as he reached her belly. The small gap left by her shirt meant he ran across her bare skin again, tickling her as he did. Her laughs made the already unstable ground impossible to run on, sending Arno down on all fours. He nearly slammed his face into her cute belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stood up and look ahead at his next challenge. With only half his time remaining he'd need to navigate past her button up shirt next. There were two paths to take though. He could move to the side a little and climb onto her shirt, running over the top of it. But those magnificent breasts propped her shirt up enough for him to consider slipping underneath it. The second route would be shorter, but she might not approve of him getting into her clothes this early in their date.</span></div></div>",
