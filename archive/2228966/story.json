When he walked in, the house didn't seem different at all. Shawn shrugged it off, and walked to the kitchen to get food. When he tried to get a plate, the top shelf seemed more out of reach. \"The hell? Did I shrink or something.\" He tried to brush the hair out of your eyes, when he noticed his fingernails were painted. Taking a more in depth look, his arm had shrunken as well. He were also wearing what appeared to be a girl's tang top, and has female shorts on. He had ran to the bathroom to find what the book meant. In this universe, he was a woman. He looked himself in the mirror for a good 5 minutes, letting the situation sink in. \"This is happening. I'm a girl.\" he said to himself. He walked to his room, to find it also has changed. It was more more girly, with female clothes scattered about. He saw a purse, which he realize was his. He searched through it, and found his driver's license. He found his name in this universe was still Shawn, but he started to wonder what else was different. </span></div></div>",
