Mainly this is because I find it a lot easier to relate to Haruhi because she and I are eccentric, while Kyon's just too normal for me. I'll leave options for each of my posts here when doing a POV other thank Kyon's so we can switch to his POV at any time.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupid Kyon! Just who does he think he is? Always staring at Mikuru's boobie-bombs day in and day out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like I can exactly call him out for that, though. That girl's got a Grade-A rack on her! I should know, having seen it and manipulated it enough times when 'helping' her change. It's really rather annoying: the 'moe' character of our group is so shy and cowed that she's really unable to tolerate any man's attentions. Always beggging people to stop looking at her! If I had her rack, I'd use it to expand the empire of the S.O.S. Brigade and free the world, but she just covers them up all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy does he always have to stare at her like that? In case you're wondering, we're at Kyon's place. celebrating his little sister's birthday with a party. It's the first time I've ever been there, so I never knew they had a pool in their yard. Kyon doesn't really talk about his home too much. Come to think of it, the only thing he ever does is lecture me endlessly. I need to show him his place, and soon: otherwise the vision of the S.O.S. Brigade could crumble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, since this is a pool party and all us girls need to get changed, I ended up changing in Kyon's room. I'd always wanted to check out his room, mainly to see if I could get an idea of the guy. He doesn't seem like he fits with the theme of the Brigade, even though he is a devoted choreboy. Nagato's the quiet, live-in guest whose eyes watch the world and can't forget, Mikuru's the sexy, moe girl, Itsuki's the mysterious transfer student, and I'm the glorious leader. But what is Kyon? Why is he in the Brigade?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he never really talks about it, I need to find out more about him. This opportunity is an excellent chance to do just that. First off, better change first in case people ask why I'm taking so long. While changing into my bikini, I glance in Kyon's mirror. Since it's summer at the moment and we're on vacation, I've grown my hair out slightly, so it's about halfway to the tips of my shoulders. I see a body that, while slim and perfect for a model's, looks far too boyish when compared to Mikuru's amazing bust. Man, somedays she makes me FEEL like a boy! My boobs are an average size, given my height and weight, but it's rather annoying that Mikuru weighs less than me and has a better rack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finish putting my clothes away in my bag, I notice something shoved under Kyon's bed. When I pulled it out, it was...</span></div></div>",

Of course he'd hide a naughty mag under his bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, since I've already gone to this much troubgle, it can't hurt to have soemthing to blackmail him with. May as well have a look and see just what gives him his jollies. Yeah, yeah, I know curiosity's a sin and all, but I'm not a cat so I should be fine. Besides, if Kyon didn't want his dirty mags read he should've hidden them better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, contents page... The feature articles seems to be on a lady calling herself Dors Feline. That's a weird name, but MAN! No wonder Kyon stares so much at Mikuru if he's into girls like this. The article says that her bust size if 34KK. If I had airbags that big, I'd need them because I'd be falling over all the time.Still, she's not exactly model-thin. She looks like a rather heavy girl, but she is hot. I'll agree with Kyon on that, she is smokin' hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that I know this, how should I capitalize on it to make sure I get my way with Kyon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a few ideas that come to mind. The first is to go visit a doctor and get some 'professional' advice on how to make my bust bigger. The second is maybe to up my consumption and hope for the best. After all, this Dors chick has a slight bit of pudge to her, maybe being a bit heavier won't hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, since this IS a point that could seriosuly change things around, might as well break the wall down. \"What do you think I should do, Nagato?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I'm going to get an answer, she's not even...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I think about what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGYAHHH!H!!!! Where the HELL did she come from? waitaminute, does this mean she's a ghost?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNah, couldn't be. She doesn't have the personality to be a vengeful spirit. \"Since you're here, I was wondering on whether or not I should consider putting a little wieght on. I mean, it's not going to be easy to keep my sexy figure, so I thought might as well try and put a little on now while it's still easy to lose and then I'll have the motivation to keep fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy's Nagato not looking into my eyes?

This is normally the part where any other girl would point out my slender figure and encourage me to keep it rather than deliberately porking up on purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is your body, and therefore your choice. if you wish to do that, logically I have no right to deny your wish anymore than I have control over your body. Not to mention that what you say has its own inherent logic. From a purely logical viewpoint, you wish to experience a specific handicap in a controlled manner to identify how your body reacts o a certain stimulus. in this case, that stimulus is overnourishment to create an excess of adipose tissues along with a reduction of exercise to see how this affects you. By your hypothesis, this would allow you to experience the feeling and then attempt to naturally remove the adipose tissues by exercise and a healthy diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, it's times like this I wish she'd use plain English...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically put, you wish to put on some weight in order to see what it feels like, then attempt to lose it. By what you've said, this is to motivate you to maintain your weight and health. On those grounds, i see nothing wrong with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, THAT'S what I call convenient timing. A little spooky, maybe, but convenient. \"So you see no problems with this at all, basically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. I see no reason why you should not attempt this research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's good to know that Yuki actually bought my logic.

Gotta think about this. Come to think of it, better finish changing, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, how can I put on a few pounds without it being obvious? Ahhh!

Good excuse, good excuse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are only two real possibilities here. if I new somebody who was already a bit heavier and having trouble with a diet, I could help them out by putting on some 'sympathy weight' and then pretend to diet with them.

I just want to know if something's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well... Can i speak freely with you, Miss Suzumiya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikuru, just call me Haruhi. As Leader of the S.O.S. Brigade, I have a personal interest in ensuring the well-being of my subordinates. You can tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that, lately, I never really seem to be able to resist foods that are delicious. I don't know how it started, Haruhi, but I just couldn't say no to things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's new, it's the first time she's not been shy or stuttered around me. This could work out better in more than one way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've been stressing that you'd notice and force me to do laps in ridiculous costumes and... and...\" Is she crying? Never knew she took it so personally. Guess I'd better say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikuru. Look at me.\" What is that in her eyes, anyway? Is it fear, or hope? \"I only saw today that you'd put a few pounds on, but if you were feeling stressed, you should've come to me sooner. Tell you what, I'll go out to eat with you, so that we can start drawing up a list of the foods that you can't say no to. Then we can get to work on a diet and exercise program for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? you'd do that for me?\" So it IS hope! Now for my benefit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go even further. We'll do a weigh-in tomorrow morning. However much you weigh, I'll gain to match it. Then we can diet together and lose it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you Haruhi!\" Awkward... She just hugged me. Why'd she just do that? I thought she was scared witless of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikuru, I'll be honest with you. I'd been thinking about putting a few pounds on myself and then dieting, as motivation for me to keep fit later on in life. If I'm going to do it anyway, might as well be to help out a member of the S.O.S. Brigade. So, are you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru looks at me. What's she going to say?</span></div></div>",

After our Quiz had ended Haruhi, who always sat behind me, seem to be in a dream-filled wonderland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough in honesty that giddy smile she had on while she slept worried me somewhat but considering the classroom, more importantly the school, had yet to explode in a fiery mystery I decided to reassure myself that Haruhi's dreams would not bring about the end of the planet. She was allowed to have a peaceful, if somewhat happy, slumber wasn't she? Well if she wasn't I'm sure all of us would have been erased from existence moons ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway she sure did seem happy or at least content with whatever it was she was dreaming of, really I had no intention of wanting to know what went on inside that head of hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter-School and I find myself heading over to the HQ of the SOS Brigade, more importantly science class ran a little late so here I am trying my best to hustle on over before Haruhi realizes I'm not in attendance and decides to bite my head off through a stern lecture once I arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the door is in sight and knowing full well that everyone is already inside I decide to simply walk in, a part of me silently hoping Haruhi is either asleep again or took a quick trip to the restroom...no such luck as I open the door swiftly and spot her sitting in front of the computer staring away at it as if it had challenged her to some sort of staring contest. Yes even I realize how stupid that sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on it seems that Haruhi has finally taken note of my arrival only after Mikuru greeted me with a smile, what a smile, and a warm cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyon you're late.\" she stated in a stern manner, yup just as expected, but surprisingly didn't bother to see me in the eye or look away from the screen. That was rather unlike her? Just what the hell was she looking at anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell regardless I took my tea with a smile nodded toward Nagato who just like Haruhi seemed content with keeping her eyes elsewhere, as usual a book of literature being said focus point, but still had enough presence of mind to nod in my direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards I took my seat opposite of Koizumi, a grin ever present on his face. I went on to explain my tardiness as we began our usual game eventually getting around to asking him if he noticed anything particularly different about Haruhi, her lack of a verbal outburst confused me somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you take a look for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat that's real helpful there, buddy, but deciding to humor him I turned to my side to get a better look of Haruhi.</span></div></div>",

This was not good... whatever was in this vial, it was probably better left in there and if she opened it.. ugh... who knows what would happen. But before I could say anything she snatched the vial out of my hands.<br>\r\n\"So...what exactly is that?\" I asked trying to sound as casual as usual. <br>\r\n\"Well duhh, didn't you here me? It hit my head as I was walking by a beauty salon so it's got to be a perfume of sorts.\" <br>\r\nYes, yes that was it just perfume, nothing out of the ordinary, I lied to myself. Then I watched as Haruhi opened the stopper of the vial and lightly splashed herself with perfume. I had to admit it smelled absolutely perfect. I closed my eyes and breathed in the sweet smell. Which of course was a bad idea being around Haruhi as to take your eyes off her for one second was a big mistake...<br>\r\nLuckily she had just taken off a few meters ahead of me.

As the door closed, I saw Nagato in a corner of the room, reading, apparently unfazed by the flagrant display of abuse occurring mere inches near her.<br>\r\n-And I thought today would be a calm day...<br>\r\n-Well, that's Haruhi-chan for you-Koizumi smiled-. But, to be honest, that outfit did look a tad too small for our dear Mikuru-chan...<br>\r\nHe was right.

Stop struggling!<br>\r\n-Auuuu, Ha-haruhi-chan, it's too tight...<br>\r\n-Don't be stupid, I know your bust size perfectly, and I made sure it was exactly your size!<br>\r\n-But, but...<br>\r\n-Shut up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the door opened.

A black-and-white cow suit, composed by a spotted short skirt with a tail in the rear, striped stockings, a tiara with tiny horns in her head and the smallest top ever. The fact that the girl's breasts were almost overflowing out of the bra only accentuated it's obvious smallness.<br>\r\nMikuru was looking as uncomfortable as with every other dress or cosplay she had been forced to wear, but this time it was even more justified: The straps from the bra were cutting in her skin, the string knotting the cups together was at its limit and the fabric was so stretched one could perceive the nipple under it. Besides, her skirt was almost ripping at the seams, revealing even more of Mikuru's thighs. After a few seconds standing here with my mouth agape, I pulled myself together:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Haruhi, this is...-I started.<br>\r\n-Yeah, I know! It totally sucks! I made extra-sure the bra was her perfect size, but look at her, she looks like she's gonna burst out of it! Unless...-Another smile, another chill down my spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi got in her usual molesting stance, that is, grabbing Mikuru's breasts from behind. Mikuru's whimpers increased accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Whoa, look at those! So this is the problem here, your breasts got even bigger!-They truly were. Mikuru's already ample chest looked fuller and rounder, but still as firm as ever. Haruhi's hands traveled to the hips area.-And your butt too!-That was also true. Mikuru's figure was already generous and curvy, but now, looking at her, she looked like an hourglass. Or maybe a guitar. Or an 8. I forced myself to look away from her, knowing well the consequences if I were to fall for her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I thought you had already bloomed, Mikuru-chan, but it seems I was wrong-Said Haruhi-. Or maybe you have gained weight? Whatever, a healthier look was exactly what I was looking for! In fact, in a hunch, I ordered a bigger cowsuit just in case, and it looks I was right. Stay here, I'll go back home and bring it here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she stormed right out from the room, leaving poor Mikuru in the same flimsy clothes. I quickly gave her my jacket, and Koizumi and I got out of the room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Tsk...-Itsuki was looking kind of nervous, which is pretty rare in him.<br>\r\n-What? An enclosed space?<br>\r\n-Oh, no, no, don't worry, there hasn't been any kind of paranormal activity lately. It's just that...well...Mikuru-chan's ''developement''...<br>\r\n-W-what of it?<br>\r\n-Doesn't it look too...you know...sudden? Yesterday she was wearing the same clothes as always and they didn't look as tight.<br>\r\n-In fact...before Haruhi entered, Mikuru-chan was sitting near me, and they looked the same as always.<br>\r\n-Well, isn't that awfully weird?-I must have been developing an allergy to smiles, because the one Koizumi had in his face made me shiver for the third time.<br>\r\n-You mean...<br>\r\n-Don't you remember? Last week, Haruhi was watching on her laptop that famous anime show with those, ummm, specially gifted ladies, wasn't she? She kept making remarks at how small Mikuru's breasts looked in comparison...<br>\r\n-You mean she can do that? She can just change someone's body just by thinking about it?-In my mind, the pigeons in the shrine rapidly flashed.-Yes, yes she can. So what is going to happen?<br>\r\n-That, dear Kyon-kun, is for Haruhi to decide, and for us to prevent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike always, Itsuki was right, but...<br>\r\nI thought about her ''new'' body. The round, heavy breasts, the wider hips...if we did nothing to stop her, would those keep growing? Do I want to stop that from happening?</span></div></div>",

But, she's getting her way, right? Things only get bad when Haruhi has a reason for it. Outside of the costume shop not selling the larger sizes, I don't see anything that might set her off. Haruhi gets her way, no anger, no closed space, no problem. Right?\" I was surprised at how convincing I was. Pity no one could've heard that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to almost all other moments I've known him, Itsuki was not smiling. \"Maybe... I suppose it wouldn't hurt to continue to observe Ms. Suzumiya's behavior.\" He paused to collect his thoughts. I didn't get it. Why was Itsuki so worried about this? It wasn't a huge deal, even if it was Haruhi's fault. Although, I'm sure from Ms. Asahina's point of view, things were much, shall I say, closer to the chest? \"I just don't want this one to get out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Asahina's quiet whimpering subsided, and Haruhi yelled for us to come in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItsuki's face broke into his ever present and all too familiar smile. \"All right, we'll play this one by ear. I suppose we shouldn't keep Ms. Suzumiya waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven a size larger, the cow suit made Ms. Asahina's growth all the more apparent. The skirt--too small by design--was noticeably stretched by her generous hips. Even more so was the top, struggling to contain the giant, unstoppable beasts they were charged to contain. I must have been staring, because Ms Asahina caught my eyes, and began to nervously stare at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Mikuru, you're huge!\" Haruhi jumped on the innocent girl again. \"I'm going to need to size up <b>all</b> of your costumes! You're never going to fit in those again!\" Haruhi flopped into her seat at the head of the SOS brigade table. She made a wide, sweeping gesture toward the teapot in the corner. \"Mikuru! Tea, please. With <b>milk</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sure things happened afterwards, it's almost never a quiet day in Brigade Headquarters, but to tell you the truth, I don't remember. All I could think about the rest of the day was updating my Asahina Gallery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened to Yuki turn her pages and Koizumi's pieces click on our board until I felt myself walking away from the clubroom.</span></div></div>",

I had traversed these streets so many times I could do it with my eyes closed. But there I was, in a part of the city I had never seen before and with no landmarks visible. Years upon years of weird accidents happening by being associated with Haruhi made me better at dealing with things like this, but it was disturbing anyway. I kept walking. Whoever made me get lost probably wanted to talk with me, and so was bound to appear sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there she was. Even though I was preparing myself mentally for whatever entity I was going to confront, I certainly was not prepared to meet Ms. Asahina's future self, much less in her...actual condition. Last time we met, Mikuru's adult body was even more developed than her actual self, with an extremely generous bust, narrow waist and wide, wide hips. But seemingly, actual Mikuru's latest ''developements'' were taking hold of her future body: Her breasts had grown enormous, as big as a P cup, and were totally overflowing out of her far too small blouse. Her mole was visible, a tiny tiny little dot in a massive extension of flesh. Her waist had expanded a bit too, giving her a more thick appeareance, and her hips and thighs had almost doubled in size, making her black miniskirt look more like a big belt. Her ass was even plumper, buttocks peeking out of her skirt and pushing themselves against the fabric, which seemed about to rip apart.<br>\r\nI stood there, mouth agape, for what could have been seconds or years, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Well, Kyon-kun,-Her angelical face was unchanged and blushing, but her voice came out as firm as ever- I don't think I need to explain what the problem is this time, right?-A faint smile gleamed through her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Uh, eh, uh, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Ms.Suzumiya is doing something to my past...I mean present self that is having direct consequences in my...body.-She blushed again, looking away from me and hugging her breasts, which made them jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-But...-I tried for the life of me to focus-but this makes no sense! I thought the future was already pre-established, isn't that how it works?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yes, that is what we thought too, but...remember, Ms.Suzumiya can rewrite the basic laws of the universe, so we can't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Wait a second here-Something didn't add up-, this is not the first time Haruhi makes something like this, but usually the change goes away, that's why at the future you guys don't have to deal with the consequences of her messing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-That may be because Haruhi loses interest in whatever she has changed pretty soon, so she changes it back subconsciously, leaving no trace behind except for those who where there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-But...that would mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yes, Kyon-kun-She faced me again, her whole body bouncing and jiggling-I am like this because Haruhi will never want me to not be like this, an...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sentence was cut short when a loud ripping sound was heard, and then something small and hard hit me in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Ow ow ow ow ow ow!-What can i say? Getting hit in the freaking eye hurts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Calm down, Kyon-kun-Sighed the overly-voluptuous time traveller. She then walked at me, her mountainous breasts getting closer and closer, and then grabbed something from the ground. A button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-This is what I was going to tell you about. Haruhi is making present-me keep expanding and growing, and as a consequence, I am expanding and growing too, but since I was natually bigger, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I...see...-I muttered as I rubbed my eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Kyon-kun, I need you to stop Haruhi before I become a total cow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-How am I supposed to do that? Haruhi is stubborn as a mule, and according to you, this change is the only one that will ever stick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Well...</span></div></div>",

As I open my eyes I see my prized computer is still sitting atop my belly still turned on, not that I need to worry, I had manipulated the data of it's power cell to run for another 6 months, which allowed me to play for entire days at a time. I turn my head I see the fat blob of my \"roommate\" residing next to Mr. Kimidori, a green balloon dog I created. Achakura has been recently gaining copious amounts of fat in her small chibi body. She's now more round then Mr. Kimidori and she weighs more then my original weight twice in fact... such a glutton. Though I myself have also gained weight, from my original 110lb my body was put at, in only a few short  weeks I have sprung up to a large 650lb being, oddly despite the fact no human should be able to function let alone walk at this weight without extreme discomfort. I am doing rather and fine and enjoying this new weight, I guess I should be glad I am not human or this would be rather painful, based on my research after Achakura forced me to look it up when she gained her first 40 pounds. I am not sure what caused th two of us to gain but it has not had any interruptions on my current time at school and at home. So far the only two to show any surprise to my status were Kyon and Mikuru Asahina, who while they worried for my health and what just could cause this they also hoped this would not create a reaction onto Haruhi, who surprising even me slightly saw me as completely normal and seemed to think that me being so big was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching the flab that rested on my new blubbery rolls of my side, I got up to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(ps. sorry Fox for the short chapter I suck at introductions.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Getting my self up, I walked to the kitchen of my abode to see Achakura and Mr. Kimidori already preparing a meal of what smells like a dashimaki (Japanese omelet) with bits of parsley, green peppers, rice vinegar, and sugar. They must've gotten up while I was busy thinking, they must've thought I was still asleep. It seems this weight of mine has had activated an increase in my already astute olfactory senses, allowing me to recognize what my meals consist of without analyzing it's data. \"Oh good morning Miss Nagato!\" Achakura said to me as she just finished preparing the 45th omelet. Showing the 50+lb chibi being my acknowledgment to her greeting, I sheepishly nodded and sat my grand bottom down onto the floor to wait for breakfast. It occurs to me that the term breakfast was created by humans meaning to \"break the fast\" of the night. This early morning food often consisted of lots of carbohydrates to supply people with the energy necessary to work throughout the day. However, my amount far exceeds what would be normal for a group of people, let alone one person, and even then I will certainly not being doing any hard manual labor that would require such, not that I am unable to, but that I do not need to do so in my schedules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As I continued to watch my two \"roommates\" prepare our morning meal, I saw the stack of plates gradually get higher than Achakura was, which even at her diminutive stature was quite impressive. \"It's almost done, Mr Kimidori would you please begin handing Miss Nagato these 50 plates?\" \"Of course.\" the green balloon dog said as he balanced several plates atop his latex body. \"We've made extra for you today Miss Nagato.\" Kimidori said as he placed 5 plates in front of me, some he placed on my massive gut, seeing as it served well as a portable table to me at times. That was a lie, I knew well that Achakura always sneaked about 4 to 9 plates worth of breakfast food every morning, which is why I stole her actual breakfast every morning as well right as she was about to eat them. It rather annoyed her, and I wouldn't do it, but she sneaks away food when she is not supposed to and I do so enjoy teasing her. Seeing my former back-up who at one point did well in trying to kill me and Kyon now reduced to something that was now terrified of a common stray cat, not even a small threat to Kyon, let alone myself. I guess you could say I enjoy seeing her in such a state, and that now I could even agree that we are friends, though I wonder how that would change if she were to return to normal size and power suddenly. Oh well I mustn't worry about such insignificant possibilities right now and focus on my favorite hobby....eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!!!\" I belched after swiping 3 plates worth food from Achakura. that's 3 down from her 25 total plates.  \"Agggghhhhh! Miss Na-Nagato you fiend!\" stop stealing my food!\" the chibi girl cried as she banged her hands on the table, her small flabby body swinging all around as she yelled at me. I saw that then she began to puff up her cheeks and pout per usual when I played around with her in this manner. \"It's not fair, I cook all this food for us and you end up hogging for yourself, so selfish...\"  Apologizing to her, I grabbed another plate of food from her side of the table and one of her plates on the floor. \"DON'T STEAL MY PLATES AFTER APOLOGIZING!!\" Achakura sobbed as she slammed her fist into the table, had she been at a more normal size this would've probably broken part of it, but due to her flab around her whole body and her small size, it merely rattled my belly slightly which was on the receiving  end of the table on the other side. \"Oh.\" I simply replied to her outburst. Sensing Achakura was about to make a claim towards never cooking for me again, I quickly pulled out a large bar of Godiva chocolate, something the both of us craved,  I had been saving it for my night of playing my eroge games, but calming her down was a higher priority.  \"Mi-Miss Nagato?\" Achakura said staring at the best chocolate we'd ever purchased that laid in the palm of my fat hand. Reaching across the pile of clean plates and full plates I handed the bar of sweet deliciousness to her. \"Here, this is my apology.\" Achakura looked onward at the treat with a glimmer in her eyes, despite it being a crumb compared to our current appetites, just a bar was like a piece of heaven. \"Thank you Miss Nagato!\" The chibi girl then jumped up from her spot at the table and swallowed the bar in one gulp from hand, landing on the table with a moderately loud plomp sound as her rolls of blubber fell onto the wooden surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmhh  uuurrrppp,... soooo good ahhhaa\" Achakura said as she laid on pile 20 clean plates that littered the table. Looking over at Mr. Kimidori, I could see he was sighing, dismayed at just how easily the girl was won over.  Ignoring the orgasm my friend was having in her mouth I continued with eating the last of 162 plates of food. Lucky for us we didn't have to rely on money issues with buying food due to my ability to just create any amount I needed for whatever purpose. Ending our 2 hour long breakfast with a loud belch, I went back to my laptop, which had been kept safe in my belly folds. Over the time I've been like this I've come to like all the storage space my body gives me now. Due to the soft fat that lays upon my entire body anything stored there is safe from damage, and it does feel quite enjoyable against my skin, especially that feeling I get when I pull something out, it is a pity Achakura is still too slim to be able to hold items in her flab, she is missing on an experience. Just as I put on my treasured bunny headphones, given to me by Kyon I hear my cellphone ring, putting it to my ear I hear that person on the other line.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Nagato...sorry to bother you, but Haruhi demanded we go out today and search for some anomalies...again\" I heard him grumble as he spoke, obviously not compliant with Haruhi Suzumiya's plans. Letting out a small involuntary burp, I had acknowledged that I had heard him. Hearing a small grunt I could tell my action had surprised him. It was obvious he was still getting used to my fairly new weight and mannerisms. \"...Well we'll see you in a bit Nagato, bye.\" Turning off my phone, I inserted it into one of numerous belly folds for safe keeping. Turning my head, I saw my roommates were now bringing up the mountainous pile of plates up to our sink. I would've helped them honestly, but I had more important matters to attend to. Going to my closet I put on my cardigan, which despite it only being needed for school usage I had grown accustomed to wearing it outside of the establishment. Of course this was not my original cardigan as that had been torn to shreds by my flab approximately 2 weeks and 3 days ago. This one I had gotten from the school faculty after it had as described by my physics teacher \"exploded\" off my body. I have to say though...it was relieving to let out my fat from that tight constriction, I still don't fully understand why humans are so adamant about dress codes in school, perhaps I shall try and eventually get them to see it my way for once.  <br>\r\n\"Miss Nagato! Where are you going?\" Achakura hollered to me as I walked towards the door of our home. <br>\r\n\"Out, the brigade needs me.\"  I said nonchalantly, then realizing that I required a pitcher of milk from the refrigerator before I make my leave. Now despite our relationship and her diminutive stature, Achakura had grown a sort of maternal instinct when I took her in. It mostly popped up when she was cleaning and I was \"fooling around\" as she called it, but she could rather demanding when she disagreed with my actions...which was almost all the time.<br>\r\n\"Don't \"brigade\" me! Mr. Kimidori and I need you to help in cleaning the dishes, after all you did eat the most of it...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">gluttonous pig</font>\" Achakura muttered under her breath at me. I would retract that statement, I am most certainly NOT a swine, how degrading to call me as such. Grabbing one of the many pitchers of milk from our fridge, I consumed 4 cups worth and responded, well...not without a hearty belch from downing the milk first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">BBBBUUUURRRPPPP!!!!</font> I cannot, sorry I will work on whatever you haven't finished when I get back.\" Bowing myself out with my colossal sized belly folds pushing into the floor, I hurried myself out as Achakura shouted a few obscenities at me, which I would rather not repeat. Walking outside along the sidewalk I made notice of several people looking at me. At first it was certainly different for me being so noticed, as I had gotten used to being rather unnoticeable, it made it rather easy to buy my hentai merchandise. Though, now that I looked like I should be a sumo wrestler, and the fact that it had no effect on my physical ability, not that it would but they didn't know that, I had made quite an impact among the people who live near my estate. I had also noticed that some of them were looking at me not out of surprise, but of lust. Apparently these people are called \"FAs\" as Kyon said when he first realized people were staring at me in such a manner. The term stands for \"fat admirer\" and it describes a person who is physically attracted to a person of large weight, this surprised me, as my previous analyzations of the subjects of admiration and affection and lust had led me to believe only those of more thin and voluptuous figures were targeted by such emotions, it made sense given how Mikuru Asahina and Haruhi Suzumiya were treated by the male populace of our school. When asked of his opinion on that subject, I could not get a proper answer, he merely mumbled and turned his head, I guess he doesn't seem to like that stuff. Walking further along I realized my cardigan, despite it being large enough to hold three people of average size in it, it continued to ride up on my belly, my large, cavernous navel peeking out from underneath. Truth be told, I did not pull it down as most people would do, I rather enjoyed the feeling and did not care if parts of my body were being shown in public, it's not like anything bad could happen to me because of it, so I didn't bother to. Taking another sip from my pitcher which I held in my blouse, between my large breasts, I crossed over a crossing path that would lead to the restaurant we regularly made our visits at when we made plans on weekends. I always enjoyed walking this way to the WcDonalds (A/N: I swear I remember seeing a W version of the logo in an episode.) it quite scenic, many species of birds fluttered about, occasionally being fed by just simply walking near a human, how I envied those creatures' abilities to persuade humans in such a simple manner for sustenance. I also loved the beautiful flora that had been planted here, springtime made the cherry blossoms such a wondrous combination of red and white. Most importantly though, was the excess amount of stores that held vasts amount of games, mangas, and animes. It was simply...an incredible experience, much like my first time being in the local library with Kyon, I practically floated around whenever I went in to browse and shop. By the way, it seems a mere flash of skin in the upper and lower parts of the torso in one of these stores will grant one a substantial discount, were it not mildly \"socially unacceptable\" to do so, I would've hugged the cashier upon this discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the sun's position in the sky, as I had forgotten which fold I had stuffed my phone in, I could see it was 3:23, exactly 14 minutes since Kyon had called. Seeing as he had not specified that I be quick, I took it as an opportune time to grab a snack from a cafe to the opposite of the street I was on. Walking in, I immediately noticed I was the only one in there, I saw this as a good sign, as it would allow me to eat as much as I wanted and let out gas without being bothered by other patrons. Sitting my gigantic bottom onto the petite chair, which despite it's metal structure I could hear the strain of steel breaking underneath me. Giving my order to the skittish waitress, who seemed greatly intimidated by my appearance, much like Miss Asahina was at times towards when I was skinny, though I doubt it for the same reasons, I politely sat at my table, taking time to pat and rub my extended flesh, which rumbled as it begged to be filled. About 23 minutes later the waitress, along with others to help her carry my food, gracefully set my order atop the table, that is until they realized it wouldn't fit and then pulled in two more tables to accommodate the food. Not bothering to use my usual table manners in these establishments, as again I was the only one here, I demolished the stack of food sitting in front of me, pieces of white cake and fruits were getting caught in chins and cardigan. Belching and farting as I devoured my <i>snack</i>, I saw that several staff members of the cafe had taken to watching in amazement as I ate. I admit, I was quite proud of my quick eating when I was normal sized, but how I ate now made that seem like a person moving on a slow-motion camera in comparison. In only two minutes, as I took a break to go to the restroom, I had eaten as a snack what anyone else would consider a full course meal made for 5. Paying the staff the amount required for the meal, alongside a 30% tip for giving me an audience, I made my way out as the staff looked onward, their mouths open, and their eyes twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one more sip from my pitcher, I finally finished drinking the delicious milk. I must make note to find the cow this milk came from and give a gracious thanks, for it was possibly the best milk I had ever consumed. Seeing the WcDonalds up ahead, I could see Haruhi standing outside, she seem slightly annoyed as she was tapping her foot, with her arms crossed and a frown graced her face.<br>\r\n\"Ugh finally, there you Yuki we've been waiting forever for ya!\" Haruhi said as she very quickly brightened up at seeing me, poking her finger into my extended gut, she made a comment about my weight. \"Sheesh, did you eat my weight in food? You look even bigger then you were yesterday...\" Even though Haruhi's tone suggested she was exaggerating, I knew that I had actually eaten far more then her weight today, probably 5 times it. Walking inside I saw the others make note of my appearance, becoming eased at the sight of me. <br>\r\n\"Stop pestering Nagato Haruhi...\" Kyon said, apparently hearing the girl's comment at my size from before. \"She's already got enough problems with random strangers staring at her, she doesn't need you pointing out her weight.\" <br>\r\n\"Ah quit whining Kyon! If Yuki was bothered by it, she would've come to us about it by now right Yuki?!\" Haruhi said this as she draped her arm across my shoulder. As I took my seat, Haruhi began talking about how she had made some research on an area nearby that had some odd events happening at it, which Mikuru took a slight interest in, Itsuki seeming enamored by the news, and Kyon merely sighed in irritation at Haruhi's excitement. We then partook in drawing the toothpicks to assign who we'd search with, seeing I had drawn a colored toothpick I looked on at the person who had also drawn a colored toothpick.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've gotten the luck of being with Yuki, damn you!\" Haruhi clamored as she flailed her arms out towards Miss Asahina, she looked as if she was ready to lunge at her. \"Hey what are you doing Haruhi?!\" Kyon was now holding Haruhi from lunging at Asahina, he looks rather disgruntled, which is easy to understand, Miss Suzumiya is at top physical condition and is full of energy while Kyon is rather average in both categories, nevertheless he is doing rather well at holding a person like her back. \"Let go Kyon I've just gotta get a good grip on Yuki's flesh, it's so soft and bouncy hahaha!\" \"Isn't Miss Asahina enough?! Hell she should be more than enough, and Koizumi stop sitting there and smiling and help me dammit!\" I watch as the two drag off Haruhi out of the restaurant, with a few onlookers perplexed bu all us. I turn to Asahina to see she's got on that innocent almost naive smile of hers. To be honest I am jealous of such naivety, to not know what will happen, to be able to ask questions about something you know nothing about, to me that is a great treasure. \"Ummm so where shall we go?\" Asahina asked to me, turning towards me, nearly smacking into my extensive breasts, which surpassed even her own, perhaps these are the reason Haruhi Suzumiya has been going after me as of late along with Asahina... Taking a fraction of a second to answer her I dully reply. \"Buffet...I am hungry once more, then I would like to take a trip to the arcade.\" \"Oh alright...OH! There's this place I found a few days I think would be lovely, let's go there!\" I nodded as she took hold of my chubby hand. As the two of us walked along the sidewalk, we heard what sounded <br>\r\nlike a young man in pain with a young woman screaming in anger but we deemed it unimportant and continued onward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Asahina and I walk together I'm noticing an immeasurable amount of people, both men and women are staring at us, several with looks of confusion, lust, amusement, and amazement. Some I could tell are enticed Asahina's voluptuous form and cute nature, while others are looking at me, some bolder then others try and walk down our path, trying to brush past my exposed belly, to get a small touch of my gelatinous flab. I have to think that we must look rather odd by most standards, a cute, fit young woman walking alongside a gigantic nearly 700lb girl, both of whom are clearly companions as shown by our nearly synchronized stepping patterns. Almost completely oblivious to our onlookers, Asahina  hurried her pace as she saw the restaurant up ahead. \"Ah, there it is!\" Looking ahead I could see the place's sign up above it's doors in big red English letters reading \" The Grandiose Buffet\" \"Ohhh...\" I said as my stomach grumbled in response, sensing it getting a chance to have a true filling today. Walking in, I could smell the absolute delicacies that laid all throughout the establishment. \"...Ok, please take your seats over there, and we will be with you two shortly!\" I heard the waitress say to Asahina as she called for me to follow her.  \"So what do you think Miss Suzumiya is... huh?\" Asahina had said, not noticing I had already moved to the buffet line. \"But we haven't made our order yet...\"  Grabbing 6 plates I carefully arranged every piece of food I put on them to maximize food quantity for each plate. I made sure to also put every single condiment on all of my food. Making my way back to the table we had I saw that Asahina was still making choices, having so far only put on a few pieces of a salad and a small piece of fried dough. Ignoring her for the time being I took my chopsticks and pierced a large piece of takoyaki covered tsuyu, ponzu, tare sauce, ketchup, mustard, and soy sauce, devouring it alongside several other things, I couldn't have bothered to pay attention, why bother, I'd enjoy it anyway? Going back to refill and get more plates I saw that Asahina's plate was halfway full. Filling all my plates again with small mounds of food on them, this time mostly filled with fried fatty deserts. Taking the 24 plates back, which was I had to be careful not to spill as 16 of them were fitted into my belly folds, and 4 of them were in my cleavage. Wanting to quicken my pace I merely fitted several of the plates straight into my mouth, maneuvering them around to swallow all the food and leave the plates in my mouth. Pulling them out back onto the table I rubbed my growing stomach as I let out a massive belch that shocked everyone in the buffet, including Asahina, who dropped her plate and both it and herself fell to the floor, the back of her head covered in food.<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BBBBBBUUUUURRRRRPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!</font> I know she is a timid person but she should be somewhat used to my... new quirks by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a break to relax Asahina was finally done looking over at the clock on the right wall I could see she had taken 5 minutes and 16 seconds to fill her plate. Perhaps I should teach her how to pack down stuff like me, she could really save so much time that way. \"Well I think this will do nicely!\" Upon Asahina's plate was a delicate and neatly arranged salad, sushi, rice, pork, and a slice of a dekopon. \"So...why do you want to go the arcade?\" Asahina said as she chewed up a piece of sushi. Twiddling my fingers on my gut that was pushing into the table we were sitting at, I gave the red headed girl my response. \"There is a new arcade game of Maid Royale, Maid Royale Calamity Shift Supreme Ultra Sexy Edition, I plan to  play it.\" I said with a sweet bliss in my voice, my eyes were probably sparkling at that moment. \"Maid Royale...?\" Asahina said, not knowing much about the subject, but nonetheless showed considerable interest in the subject \"So... how is your gluttony going? I can't imagine hefting so much fat around all the time...\" Asahina said attempting to imagine herself at my size, if I could see her thoughts I'd imagine there'd just be a big stop symbol over a her imagine self. \"It is magnificent, this extra layer of fat gives me plenty of holding storage and it makes a handy table for my laptop. \"Only an extra layer?\" Asahina said in disbelief at my description of my blubber. \"So you like it? Hmmm...\" Asahina pondered for a few seconds, I began to think if perhaps she was wanting to follow in my footsteps, I'd immediately start feeding if that were true, but I doubt it, she doesn't seem to have the appetite for that stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing my break, I took to devouring down another 30 plates, which I admit was a little unsatisfactory to my last meals, there was substantially less food then before, and a staff member had tried to deter me from eating anymore food, with little success. Asahina had been done long ago, being full after only eating a quarter of her second plate which I happily devoured the rest of. Calling for our waitress we payed our bill who despite being rather surprised by my rate of consumption and how much I ate, was very nice to us after she saw my moderate tip of 200%, I still don't know why Asahina tried to tell me to give less, I believe the appropriate amount of money should be given to someone who allows you to eat to your content, she must be stingy. Walking out of the buffet, after an event with Asahina and help from other patrons pushing me from behind as my rather large belly got stuck in the door frame, we set out for the arcade a few blocks down. Going inside I could see a wide variety of games, UFO catchers, dancing games, drum games, fighting games, shooters, party games, racing games, and much more. \"Ohhhh an Infy doll!\" Asahina cheered as she saw a UFO catcher with a doll of the alien lion she kept as a pet, which does not make sense as it is not of this world, but I did not put much thought into it as I had found my game... Maid Royale Calamity Shift Supreme Ultra Sexy Edition, brand new and ready to take my money. Putting 500 yen worth of money into the machine I began to play and dominate the game an everyone came by to play 2nd player. Fighting as my main Sakuya, who fights quite similarly to how I myself fight, albeit more limited in her movements, I perfected every match, for today I was fighting at my highest difficulty setting. What was really fun though was some of my opponents would give fair amounts of their yen to touch my belly, I gladly accepted as I did not see any problem with such actions...it is merely the physical contact of one's hand on the epidermis of my middle section, nothing to make a deal about. getting a good deal of enjoyment from the fights I took a  break to check up on Asahina, who was still playing the UFO catcher, and had somehow not only failed in getting the Infy doll but had also put it at the bottom of the pile of dolls. \"Why won't this claw hold it tighter?\" Asahina asked troubled by her predicament. \"This machine works on a random number generator that after a series of tries, the amount of grip strength in the claw is set to maximum, thus guaranteeing success if the appropriate amount of skill is used. This machine will reach the number of tries to set it to maximum after one more play is done.\" \"Aahha!\" Asahina squealed in excitement, putting her arms up in happiness. Allowing me to help her at least move the Infy doll back to the top, I then moved aside to let her take part in the final play that would mean absolute victory. Putting in the coin, Asahina slowly moved the claw over the doll, making minute movements to make sure it was directly over the doll. As the tension increased we both pressed against the glass of the machine, I had to be careful though as my tremendous belly began to cause small barely noticeable cracks to appear on the surface. \"It's READY!\" Asahina shouted as she pressed the button. The claw moved down, spinning as it latched onto the doll....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reaching into that fold I had actually found my misplaced phone. Pressing the talk button I answered the caller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yuki, come here down to the park, we just found something totally amazing! Keep digging Kyon, I've got to survey the area for any more possible oddities! *click*\" \"What's going on?\" Asahina asked to me. As I stuck the little piece of primitive technology back in my flab, I responded to her question. \"Haruhi Suzumiya has requested that we meet up at the local park, something amazing has appeared.\"  \"Alright!\" Miss Asahina then clenched her fists in eagerness, we then made our way out of the arcade, Asahina hurried out in nervousness as she realized a number of people were staring at us with disappointment and adoration,  though I could not see why they were. As we briskly walked to the park, I felt a pang in my stomach. Stopping to halt Miss Asahina, making my flabby stomach jiggle profusely for several seconds, I told her I was hungry. \"Huh, but Miss Suzumiya told us to--\" \"Tell her I will be late, and if this phenomenon is amazing then we will deal with this as usual.\" Asahina then looked at me with slight disdain. \"Okay, bye then Miss Nagato!\" she waved to me as she went off towards the park. I then made my way to the closest place that I could smell food from, finding a dango stand doing so. Giving the man some yen, I took off with a decent supply of sweet dangos, my fat filled arms holding approximately 50 of them. Gulping down about 6 of them at once, I could feel my blouse tighten up even more as the food slid down my esophagus and into my gut. Taking a minute to finish the remaining dangos, I had soon found a vending machine filled with a variety of brands. Taking out ten 100 yen coins, I bought ten Hot Calpises, guzzling them down into my mouth, the hot yogurt-like taste ran down my throat, feeling pressure build up in my throat, my belly growled for a moment before I let out a massive belch, of which made my fat bulge out even more, making small tears in my blouse, and it also startled several passersby. Wiping my lips of the hot, carbonated beverage, I waddled off towards the park to meet up with the brigade members, I wondered if they'd mind the tears in my clothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Yuki, about time you got here, too busy snacking huh? Well come on, I found something incredible buried here!\" Haruhi Suzumiya came up to me in delighted happiness, tugging my 700+lb body near a number of large dug up holes, I wondered how the local officials had not caught onto this event, as desecrating public property was quite an offense, maybe it was Suzumiya's subconscious manipulating this event. As she pulled me over to the holes, I could see Itsuki Koizumi and Kyon digging out what appeared to be large, red jewels, much like the subspecies of the Data Integration Thought Entity we had found in the Tsuruya Mountains. I could tell by his disposition and facial structure, Kyon was displeased with his current status.  \"There's got to be some law against this kind of action, Koizumi, don't you think Haruhi is going bit overboard with this, we've desecrated a public park after all.\" Wiping his brow, particles of earth smudged on his forehead, Koizumi responded with his ever present smile  \"While I do admit, what we're doing is rather verboten, no one else seems to realize what's going on, and I'm sure this will all be fixed in due time.\" \"What, you're two tag team members of the organization are just gonna come in randomly while Haruhi's distracted and take care of everything?\" Kyon said this to Koizumi in an irritated tone. Kyon didn't know this, but he was wrong.  \"On the contrary, I must give the honor of that action to our rather large friend here.\" Koizumi then motioned his hand to me, nearly grazing my prominent 5 foot belly. Kyon, clearly puzzled by this, asked in return what Koizumi meant. \"Huh, Nagato? Why her, does this involve her somehow?\" I then interrupted the conversation to give them my answer to Kyon's question.  \"Yes, the red jewels you all have found are similar to the entity we found at the Tsuruya estate.\" \"We found one there?\" Kyon responded, not remembering the event, as the entity had clouded his mind of reason, once I had disposed of it, he, Mikuru Asahina, and Tsuruya were unable to recollect any of the events that had befallen them.  \"Yes, however, this particular subspecies has a different effect on humans then the other one.\" \"Hmm, how so?\" Kyon asked me as he balanced on the shovel in the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Haruhi came up to us, looking very bloated and tired. \"Hey guys, why don't we just go and forget about this stuff for a while and go get some lunch, I'm feeling UUUURRRRRPPPP! starved.\" Startled by the sudden change in Haruhi's stature and mindset Kyon, and to an extent Koizumi were both visibly shocked. \"Waaa Ha-haruhi?! What happened to you?!\" Kyon was a nervous wreck, wondering just how she gotten this fat all of a sudden, not yet realizing it's origin. \"Huh? What are you talking about Kyon? I've always been like this.\" Haruhi Suzumiya then slapped her gut, which was rather pathetic compared to my grandiose, blubbery, belly. Then, as if to make the situation even more ridiculous to Kyon, Mikuru Asahina made her appearance. \"Miss Suzumiya, can we go now? I need to feast!\" Asahina whined as her colossal breasts wobbled in front of her fat face, the girl's svelte form was gone, replaced by the fat form, though not as fat as I, made by the subspecies. Kyon and Koizumi could only stare in shock at the two girls, all of three of us were now huge gluttons, and as nice as it was to have them like this, I could not stand to have it be involuntary. \"This cannot continue. CHOP!\" I then proceeded to swiftly exert a one handed chop to their heads knocking them out.  Koizumi, the more reserve of the two, regained his composure and asked me how this had happened. \"So... I suppose that was the effect of the alien?\" \"Correct.\" \"Ah I see.\" Kyon then intervened. \"Hey wait, if that's true, how come we weren't affected? And just why did it have that effect in the first place?\" \"Due to this subspecies being stuck underground for over a millennium, it's effect has diminished greatly, only effecting human females now, it's goal was to deter sentient beings of this world from discovering it and by making humans transform into enlarged gluttons, it was able to keep them from doing so and studying it, getting access to information that would be disastrous to them at their current level of intellect.\" \"Well I guess that explains everything. Well what do you plan to do then Nagato?\" Clenching my fists in eagerness I replied. \"I will siphon their fat and gluttony into myself. It is the only way.\" \"So noble...\" Koizumi noted. \"Is it really the only way to get rid of it?\" Kyon said, perhaps worried it may have a bad effect on me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I merely want to increase my grand size and appetite to further my abilities.\" \"Huh?! Then why say it's the only way, if you want to become even more then a glutton then you are now, then just say it in the first place!\" Kyon yelled at my explanation.  Taking a moment to rub my flab folds, as I felt an itch on them, I then placed my hands on the two girls' rotund guts, in a few moments, the fat on their bodies lessened until they were back to normal, though their outfits were greatly stretched and thin from the sudden increase in pressure on their threads. In that same moment my own body grew greatly, bulging out to the point where my blouse and cardigan were nearly torn to shreds, only barely constraining my body's features from public eye. My belly filled out to the point where it began to go over the hole Kyon and Koizumi were in. My already massive breasts grew even larger, I could feel my empty pitcher falling as my cleavage grew bigger and wider. My butt was encapsulating my underwear, if it were viewable, it would appear I had no undergarments of any sort on. Once my gain had finished I was a grand 1,327lbs, still mobile despite not looking at all like it. I then took hold of all the \"jewels\" we had found and ate them, letting out a nice burp as the horrid things were dealt with by my own amazing digestive tract. \"<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>BBBBBBUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPPPP!!!!!! </b></font> Everything is fine now.\" I said as my cheeks stopped flopping about from my gaseous eruption. \"Y-yeah...now what do we do?\" \"We wait for them to resume consciousness.\" I said, deciding that as I had delivered a more powerful strike then I had intended, I would use this time to play a eroge/eating game on my laptop, which I had pulled out from my belly button, the feeling was tickling and incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes passed by, with me passing gas and Kyon and Koizumi playing a game of 21, we waited for Haruhi Suzumiya and Mikuru Asahina to wake up. After a total of 20 minutes, the two moaned as they woke up. \u201cUhhh what happened?\u201d Haruhi muttered, picking herself up.</span></div></div>",

I stood there for a few seconds, saying nothing, this was rather awkward. I had not planned for them asking about this. \"Hey Nagato, something wrong?\" Kyon whispered into my ear, taking note of my unusual display of silence in this situation. My eyes lowered slightly, I was admittedly a little ashamed of this. \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I do not know what to tell them, I didn't expect them to ask about it.\" \"You didn't expect them wonder why their clothes didn't fit them?\" \"I think I have an idea for you Miss Nagato.\" Koizumi intervened, having appeared next to Kyon, surprising him with the invasion of his personal space, I still did understand his problem with such a thing. Giving his idea to me, I turned back to Haruhi and Mikuru. \"Hey! What was that all about?\" \"Oh nothing.\" Kyon quickly responded. \"While you were knocked out, I tried on your clothes as mine are tearing, but then I realized you would have nothing to wear so I put them back on.\" \"That was your idea?!\" Kyon quietly shouted to Koizumi, who had not heard Itsuki Koizumi giving me his idea. \"Oh yeah, that makes sense.\" \"Yeah.\" \"They actually bought it?!\" Kyon again quietly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then\u2026\" Haruhi stated as she surveyed the area. \"What happened to the jewels we found?\" \"I ate them.\" I state rather bluntly. \"I am sorry, they were very tasty.\" \"Awww Yuki! You and your appetite! Ah well\u2026they weren't really that amazing anyway, well I think we're done for today, see you guys later!\" Haruhi Suzumiya said as she walked off from the park, the sun was getting close to setting, so it was apparent that we all head home. \"Well then...\" Kyon directed to me, who was still with me at the park, for some reason. \"Are you going to fix the park?\" He looked at me with question. \"It is already done.\" \"Huh?!\" Kyon yelled in shock, turning around he had seen that I had already repaired the park's grounds with no one the wiser. Deciding to not bother asking me when I had done such a thing, he then asked me something I had not expected. \"Say Nagato, you mind if I come over today? To be honest I'm interested in seeing your place after all these changes to your\u2026physique and mindset.\" I could see he was blushing slightly, was he hiding something, maybe it was just the heat; I could sense it was a little hot right now outside.  \"I do not mind\u2026\" As I said this I realized I needed to make an important call. Pulling down my blouse to reach under my left breast, causing Kyon to cover his eyes and berate me for being too casual about my body, not like it really mattered. Clicking in the number for my apartment I waited till I heard the voice of my roommate Asakura. \"Ah Miss Nagato, so how did the day go? I hope it went well, as you left us all of your dishes to clean up.\" I could tell she sounded angry, nevertheless I ignored her anger and spoke to the chibi blob. \"Kyon is coming over with me; I need you to hide as usual to make sure he does not realize you still exist in this physical plain.\" \"Kyon! HERE?! Dammit Nagato, don't you dare tease me with him....Wait what about Mr. Kimidori?\" \"He can stay out; it will not matter if Kyon is aware of his existence.\" \"NAGATO YOU FU--*click* I could tell Achakura was rather irritated with the situation I was putting her in, I wouldn't hide her, but I rationalize that Kyon would not bode well with the knowledge that Ryoko Asakura was still \"alive\" in the sense that humans used the term, it's not my fault she went rogue and tried to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" Kyon gave me a puzzled and slightly worried look. \"A pizza service.\" I lied. \"They seemed rather loud and angry from what I heard.\" \"I ordered 500 pizzas.\" \"500 PIZZZAS?!!\" he shouted, alerting the disturbed attention of several people nearby, who turned at the random shouting of the young man. Looking embarrassed, he quieted down with his next statement. \"Well, whatever, I guess I should expect you to make requests like that now. I still wonder just what caused you to get like this?\u2026To get this.\" Kyon lightly poked my belly flab, even with such a light poke, my belly jiggled and shook greatly. The shadows that were created from the sun's light being blocked by my folds expanded and contracted as my fat shook. Some few minutes later, we made our way to my apartment, going up to my floor through the elevator, which was apparently rather painful for Kyon, admittedly it was tight squeeze. I must remember to alter its internal size when I use this thing. Making our way to my door, I opened it and we made our way into my abode.</span></div></div>",

I have finally taken down Kyon, the mighty umbrella proves itself once again!\" As I regained my composure from the sudden \"attack\" made by my roommate, I stepped over the unconscious body the young man on my floor and picked up the blue haired blob who was praising herself over her action. \"Ah Miss Nagato!\" Achakura exclaimed in surprise, having been so engraved in her triumph she neglected to notice me coming towards her, a fatal mistake. I then proceeded to shake her in my arms. \"Wa-ah-aha-aha-ah Mi-miss Na-nagato!\" The 50lb humanoid interface shouted as her blubbery body shook. I must admit, I brought this upon myself, forcing Asakura to hide, though my mind tells me it would be be a problem for others to see a girl the height of a basketball around, I was lucky that she was willing to pose as a doll whenever we went grocery shopping. As I shook the girl, she somehow moved herself from out of grip and landed on the floor near me, I could see now that Mr. Kimidori was walking towards us, I could hear soft squeaks emit from his elastic body. <br>\r\n\"Sorry Miss Nagato, I tried to dissuade her,but.... she was very persuasive\" He then began to mutter something about a mound of cotton balls. <br>\r\n\"It is okay.\" I replied to the dog. \"I should've anticipated her actions, being a radical member of the Integrated Data Thought Entity.<br>\r\nI then heard the waking groan of Kyon, and I turned back towards him, I could see Achakura waddling over, climbing onto his chest as he awakened. Groggily opening his eyes, the young man yelled as he saw the face of his past would-be killer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A....Asakura...\" Kyon trembled for a moment as the girl in front of him stared with content at his fear. \"Huh?\" As he became fully aware of her true size and demeanor, he grabbed the fatty folds of my roommate and lifted her up. I could see her face lose it's confident smile, and she was beginning to realize how he viewed her currently. \"Haha...now the tables are turned!\" Kyon said in a rather malicious and creepy tone, his eyes now small slits, and his smile was thin and wide, I could tell he was enjoying this greatly. He then began to heave the 50lb girl into the air, which while I could tell was a daunting task for him, his determination to torment Achakura kept him going.<br>\r\n\"Wah! Ah! Nah! Stop it!\" This continued on for a few seconds until Kyon became too tired to throw her up anymore. <br>\r\n\"Ha....ha...I can't keep doing this, she weighs a ton for someone so small. Hey Nagato, you mind explaining why she's like this and how's she still alive anyway?\" As I opened my mouth to respond, Achakura jumped up with an outstretched arm and interrupted me. \"I can explain that you brute! If you must know, even Nagato here did not fully anticipate my backup plan, but somehow I had failed in fully reviving my former self, and even worse Miss Nagato had become aware of my plan somehow and had captured me in my weakened state moments after my arrival here!\"<br>\r\nThat wasn't true of course, I had only found her by chance, I remember being rather surprised at first, but upon analyzing her I quickly found she had only a abysmal fraction of her powers and I took it upon myself to take her in, to keep her from being a headache to anyone else. <br>\r\n\"Alright then, now I have another question, why are both of you so fat?\" Kyon asked with his usual dead pan manner. <br>\r\n\"To be honest I don't know, I would say it was a delayed reaction on Nagato's body from all her eating, but that certainly doesn't explain me.\" Liar, she ate almost as much I did before when we we normal for our respective statures.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well then I guess since all that's out of the way....what is the dog thing?\" <br>\r\n\"Hello, I am Mr. Kimidori, I am balloon dog created by Miss Nagato when she brought home a package of balloons to amuse Achakura.\" <br>\r\n\"Hmm your voice reminds me of someone rather annoying\"<br>\r\n\"That's not very comforting to say to someone you just met.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry....Wait a minute, you said Achakura, don't you mean Asakura?\" I then intervened to explain.<br>\r\n\"It is her new name...it fits her.\" <br>\r\n\"Don't you tell him that!\" Achakura yelled at me with great anger, her temper made the name all the more deserving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later as I had awoken from unconsciousness from being hit in the stomach by Achakura, I got up and saw Kyon watching tv with Mr. Kimidori in his lap. \"Ah Nagato you're up.\" I looked around, puzzled by something. \"Where is Achakura?\" <br>\r\n\"She is in the kitchen preparing us dinner.\" <br>\r\nWalking to my apartment's kitchen I could see and smell the aromas of several dishes starting to form. <br>\r\n\"Could you lend me a hand Nagato? I need you to help me get some ingredients in the cabinets.\" I nodded, as I then remembered to take out the pitcher in my cleavage I had stored there earlier today, and palced it in the sink. I then picked her up, and I brought her over to the open cabinets to grab some spices.  \"40 centimeters to left! 20 centimeters up! Stir vigorously for 50 seconds!\" Achakura went on giving commands as I carried her over to dispense ingredients in their respective pots and bowls. 40 minutes later we had completed dinnner, we had made extra to feed Kyon, though I feel we may have overdone it a little on his serving. <br>\r\n\"Here you go Kyon.\" Achakura said as we placed down several plates in front of him, I could see her motherly instincts were overtaking her desire to murder Kyon, or perhaps she knows she stand no chance against him at this size, let alone myself.<br>\r\n\"Ah!...Are you sure this is all mine?\" Kyon said as the plates began to stack higher than him as he was currently sitting.<br>\r\n\"Oh my, I must apologize, we've never made food for anyone except ourselves...this is rather small to us.\" <br>\r\n\"R-really?...No kidding...\" <br>\r\n\"Well just eat whatever you can, Nagato and Achkakura will eat whatever you leave behind.\" Mr, Kimidori looked up to the young man, giving him relief of having to please us by finishing everything we gave him, I do hope he doesn't eat much, he seems to have the most delectable food for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we ate, watching various programs, mostly quiz shows with easy questions pertaining to the physics involving kinetic energy and an odd game show involving obstacle courses. Taking a bite from plate, I noticed Kyon staring at me, a sense of curiosity emitted from his body language. \"Is there something wrong?\" He then proceeded to become flustered. \"Ah-ha no, it's just...how can you be so casual about this change to your body Nagato? You act like you've always been like this.\"<br>\r\n\"If it does not impede my objective to observe Haruhi Suzumiya then it is of no concern to me, more importantly, I am still able to play my games and this increased amount of fat helps me carry them around with me.\" I then pulled out a couple mangas from a fold on my right side to prove my point.<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you have your priorities figured out.\" <br>\r\n\"Hey Nagato can we change the channel, this show is getting boring.\" Achakura huffed as a man fell into a pool of water after failing to jump across spinning top-like contraptions. I then grabbed the remote and switched around the various channels. Going from a reality tv drama called Cross Chord to an anime I saw about two girls who fight off demons called \"Virus\", to an eating contest, I left on here as I found it amusing to see humans try and consume as much rice as they possibly could in 50 minutes.<br>\r\n\"An eating contest, I expected you to stop on that anime with your new hobbies.\" Kyon said as he watched the contest with some interest. <br>\r\n\"I already have that one on dvd and blur-ray and the manga, it is unnecessary to watch it on tv. ....These contestants are rather slow\" I said turning towards Kyon.\"  He smirked at me. \"I think it's a little unfair comparing them to you. Come to think of it, I'd be quite interested in seeing you enter one, I bet you'd amaze the world by making a new record.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd imagine she'd eat the other contestants food along with hers, right Nagato?\" Achakura said from the pouch I carried her in, though it wasn't the same one I used a few months back as she had accidentally broke it one night as I moving about, it was rather difficult to find an extra large baby pouch.<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is the goal of certain eating contests.\" <br>\r\n\"I...don't think that's actually allowed, but then again it's never actually happened...\" Kyon murmured as we watched one of the contestants pass out onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jostling all these things from my body made my large breasts bounce and shake, which now that I was over half a ton in weight they where both quite a bit bigger than my own head. In fact my actions had caused my already somewhat torn clothes to fall from my body, leaving me in nothing but my panties. Kyon then in a hurry, covered his eyes, Achakura then shouted at me to go put on my pajamas. I nodded as there would be no way Kyon could watch if his eyes were covered. Getting up, I went to my closet and grabbed my standard light blue top and bottom, they had to be modified before putting them on, as I was much larger then the last time I had had them on. Though I intentionally left the top to not fit me all the way, I had grown rather accustomed to letting my large, rotund belly flow outward, it made it much easier to access my navel for storage reasons anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is okay to look now.\" I assured to Kyon, still nervous and embarrassed over seeing my nude form. Upon taking his hands away, he looked on at my flabby body. He was then kicked by Achakura, to which Mr. Kimirdori had to float of the way to avoid her attack as well. <br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't get any ideas you!\"<br>\r\n\"Ow dammit, I wasn't thinking anything like that! I've just never seen Nagato in pajamas before.\" Kyon said clutching his torso in slight pain. Ignoring their bickering for a moment I turned on my laptop and started up the game. Hearing the sounds of the game, the two stopped their argument and huddled over my blubbery belly to watch me decimate the A.I.<br>\r\n\"Say Nagato, what game is this?\" Kyon asked me as the spell casting maid I was fighting as was performing a TK input to start off a 20 hit air to ground combo on a transforming combat android.<br>\r\n\"Maid Royale Calamity Shift.\" I said as I noticed Achakura was intent on watching my character, perhaps it reminded her of her previous form and what it was capable of. Having played this game for weeks, I had seen from message boards that other players were complaining about the difficult inputs for the flashy one hit kill moves, especially for my main Mahoro. A simple sequence of 2 quarter circle backs, forward, back, forward, back, forward, 2 dragon punches then a punch and kick button pressed simultaneously. Going through the game's arcade mode in a quick 3 minutes, I asked Kyon if he would like to play. <br>\r\n\"Do you want to play it?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure...do you have another controller somewhere?\" I reached into a shelf of fat near my right breast.<br>\r\n\"Here.\" He then grabbed it awkwardly. \"What level do you want?\" He looked at me with amusement.<br>\r\n\"I'm fighting you aren't I? So basically \"cheat\" level.\" He said that in a tone that suggested he was rather dejected.<br>\r\nDespite Kyon having never played the game, and me being an expert gamer, he did not do poorly, he only got perfected 27 times out of the 30 matches we did.<br>\r\n\"27 perfects in a row, I only got a hit on her those last three matches because she got distracted by her own belches.\" I heard him mutter, even if he was unsure of himself, the fact he got a hit on me at all was commendable.<br>\r\nAs we continued to play, Kyon started to drowsy, I ignored thinking he would just quit playing, but he continued until He fell asleep on my belly, his head laid near my belly button. Not wanting to awake the young man or awake Achakura and Mr. Kimidori, who had both fallen asleep while we were playing, I decided to sleep there under the kotatsu. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Make mup!\" Not wanting to suffocate him I rolled over, to my slight surprise his head popped out close to my breasts, in his mouth was a still warm meat bun I had been saving there for a few days, my belly button was very good at preserving food, so Kyon didn't spit it out immediately, rather he spat it out when Achakura flew in to kick in him in the head once again. <br>\r\n\"Pervert!\" Shouting as she did a spinning drill kick into Kyon's temple. <br>\r\n\"Waaah!\" with steam rising from his damaged head, Achakura stood in front of my body, standing her ground to protect me.<br>\r\n\"I will not allow such lewd activities to go on in this apartment while I am around!\" <br>\r\n\"What the hell was that kick for?!\" Kyon shouted in response, however he had not fully been aware of what Achakura had said. <br>\r\n\"Hmmph, honestly Miss Nagato, I know you two seem to have a thing, but you can't go around acting like that, it isn't right and think of poor Mr Kimidori.\" once again she becoming more maternal, I'm still not sure where exactly this side of arose.<br>\r\n\"What about this would affect me?\" Mr. Kimidori said as a plate of eggs was balanced atop his floating body.<br>\r\nKyon then argued to Achakura her false pretenses. \"I wasn't doing anything, she just...fell on top of me in her sleep, and I got out I just happened to  land...there.\"<br>\r\n\"You expect me to believe that? Though I am glad you were nearly suffocated, I can't allow you to use that to your perverted advantages!\"<br>\r\n\"I told you it was an accident!\"<br>\r\n\"Stop lying!\" Achakura then threw herself at Kyon, slamming her head into his and knocking them both out. <br>\r\n\"Well that was certainly an interesting way to start the morning...Oh do you want to begin with breakfast Miss Nagato?\" I nodded, breakfast was one of my favorite parts of the day, next to lunch, dinner and of course dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having prepared our meals, and continued to watch the harmless squabble between my roommate and our guest, I, along with Mr. Kimidori, set down the plates around the table, on the table, and on my belly. Kyon seemd perplexed by something as we began to eat. <br>\r\n\"Uhh Nagato?\" I looked over at him with a bun sticking out of my mouth.<br>\r\n\"Don't you think this a bit much, I mean for me anyways?\" <br>\r\n\"No.\" I responded, I did not think the amount we made for him was enough, rather I think it was rather normal.<br>\r\n\"But you put over 30 plates on my side of the table! A-and why do you have so many damn utensils anyway?! I know you've got an appetite but is it really necessary?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes it is.\" I said as I scarfed down the plates on my fat shelves,even though it was unnecessary to put them on my body, there was just a certain kind of pleasure I got from being able to do it.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you'd turn down Miss Nagato's cooking like that Kyon, you're quite an ungrateful young man.\" Achakura said as she chowed down on a bowl of ramen as big as she was.<br>\r\n\"I'm not turning it down or being ungrateful, its just you two have appetites to rival 50 people! EACH!\" Look just...please eat anything I can't, okay Nagato?\" I nodded with slightly more vigor to it, glad that I could get more food down my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating away at our breakfast, Kyon had ended up eating away at a decent amount 3 plates, given his stature and normal appetite, this was quite a lot for him, perhaps he worked through them to please me, either way I seemed to be rubbing off of him. <br>\r\n\"Guhh urrp...I'm stuffed.\" the boy gripped his bloated stomach as he lied on my floor.<br>\r\n\"UUURRRRPPPP!!! Well now I have to get this place clean.\" Achakura muttered as she let out a small belch.<br>\r\nWhile I watched Mr. Kimidori munch on a pile of cotton balls with his nonexistent mouth, I felt the vibration of my cellphone in a fold near my navel, pulling it out, I answered. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Yuki! Hey get yourself over to the station, we've got a phenomenon on our hands!\" *click* I heard Haruhi on the other side of the call, it seemed we had once again found something.<br>\r\n\"What did Haruhi have to say?\" Kyon, who had heard the girl's over exuberant voice but had not made out the details asked me what she had wanted. \"We are to go over to the station to meet up, something has come up.\" He sighed upon hearing this. Then, his phone began to ring. \"Hmmph, Haruhi? yeah, I already know...I'm over at Nagato's....no I'm not doing that with her! Just wait for us at the station dammit! She is not naked!\" *click* \"Come one Nagato.\" Kyon was now blushing heavily and seem agitated.<br>\r\n\"Hehe, my my Kyon Haruhi certainly knows how to rile you up.\" Achakura took pleasure in Kyon's current demeanor. \"S-shut up, you psychotic ball of fat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we made our way out, I remembered to tell Achakura to start making dinner. she saluted as Kyon sighed for some reason. Walking out towards the station, I came to ask Kyon what Haruhi had said. <br>\r\n\"O-oh nothing.\" he said this as he looked away rubbing the back of his head. As we walked, Kyon noticed we were getting looks as he was looking left to right at a constant pace.<br>\r\n\"Hey uh Nagato, I know you don't mind people looking at you, but do you think maybe that they mind?\"  I had considered this at one point, but since none of them had made any sort of action towards me, positive or negative, I saw that if they did mind, it wasn't much.\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Such an abrupt answer!\" Kyon shouted at my response.<br>\r\nAs we made our way closer to the station, I had attempted several times to get a few snacks from some concession stands. He had tried to pull me away, which was useless given that I was over half a ton by now. Because of this he had resorted to reminding me of us being late with Haruhi and then mumbled something about \"wrong ideas\"<br>\r\n\"No! we can't get a \"snack\", besides you'd end up destroying your clothes probably, and that would make things even worse for me with Haruhi!\" I wasn't sure of what he mean't by that, but since me getting my belly filled on our walk to the station would have the possibility of giving misfortune to Kyon, I decided my grumbling stomach could wait...at least until we got to the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finally made our way there, I could see Haruhi was yelling to us with a pleased look on her face. Alongside her were Itsuki Koizumi and Mikuru Asahina. \"Hey, good timing you two, we just got done negotiating with our client!\"<br>\r\n\"Client?\" Kyon asked<br>\r\n\"Yes, it seems a friend of ours has had a rather odd event happen to them.\" Koizumi said explaining the situation to Kyon.<br>\r\n\"Well who is it?\" <br>\r\n\"Right over there!\" Haruhi pointed over to the side, near a bookstore, there we saw a familiar face.</span></div></div>",

Yeah it's me, all of me!\" the girl shook her belly, it seemed she was proud of it, which was commendable for her to be near my weight from a few days ago. I watched as Kyon pulled himself from engulfing fat.<br>\r\n\"S-so....how did you end up like this Miss Tsuruya?\" <br>\r\n\"Hmmm...well I remember going out the mountains behind my estate to train in the Tsuruya martial arts, and after I while I started to feel heavier, I assumed I was just sweating really bad, so I went back home to shower, and when I stepped in I noticed my body pressed against the shower walls and my clothes had a hard time coming off. So I don't know when I got fat like this.\"<br>\r\n\"You just said it was during your training, and there's no such things as Tsuruya martial arts!\" Kyon said, incorrectly assuming Tsuruya martial arts was made up.<br>\r\n\"Hmm interesting, can you take us to the place where you were training?\" Haruhi asked as poked the girl's flab.<br>\r\n\"Sure!...Say Yuki you sure have gotten big!\" Miss Tsuruya had come to finally notice my overwhelming girth. She went over to pat my exposed, pale belly.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's really big!\" Haruhi was now with her, also patting my gut, occasionally groping and rubbing it, she seemed to be getting aroused as her cheeks were filling up with blood and it was leaking out from her nostrils to the point that her shirt was beginning to stain. Kyon was about to pull them away for some reason, when Haruhi collapsed due to blood loss, after initial shock from the group, I calmed them down by revealing Haruhi was okay and would be awake within minutes. In actuality, I had sped up her healing process when I checked her body, so what would've required her a trip the hospital, was reduced to a short nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're here.\" Tsuruya had led us to her home, back to the place where we had encountered that alien techonlogy and when we had given Kyon and Koizumi our valentine chocolate...I still remember the step by step process we had when we made them, so much chocolate, I remember how stuffed I had felt back then, now it was nothing compared to my self now. I also remember how Haruhi teased me at my skills of forming the melted chocolate back into squares, I was rather proud of that, since I had not used any of my powers to do so.<br>\r\n\"Alright guys! Let's scope the area!\"<br>\r\n\"Great, now get off my back Haruhi!\" Kyon shouted as he had repeatedly told the girl to get off him as she had awoken around 5 minutes ago. Searching around the area, Tsuruya, Haruhi, Mikuru and I searched around the field, looking for anything suspicious, hopefully we could find it, so I could use it on myself, I was also making sure to come up with a reasonable explanation unlike last time I had inexplicably gained weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm Miss Tsuruya, is there any other info you can give us?\" Mikuru asked as meekly checked a random bush.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...I think I remember feeling an ominous feeling when I was training, of someone or someone...familiar.\"<br>\r\n\"Waahhh?!\" Mikuru cried as she most likely imagined something horrific.<br>\r\n\"Oooooh An enemy perhaps?! This just gets more and more interesting!<br>\r\n\"Hurray!\" Haruhi and Tsuruya high fived each other as I watched on at their cheerful display, Tsuruya's belly jiggled as did so.<br>\r\nAt that moment we heard an explosion off in the distance.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the vast reaches of space, one could see many things. The stars twinkling along the vast grand background. The swirly wisps of the galaxies, wonderful gates to whole other worlds. Planets of all shapes, sizes, colours and appearances, no two every looking the same. The occasional burning sun, creating glorious light for all to see. These were all many wondrous things that one could spy and marvel at, gazing at what wonders the universe held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in this particular area of space, there was one object that no one could ever dream of missing. A body so large, so immense, so ridiculously grand that the mere idea of such a thing existing seemed nearly impossible. But here it was, floating around space and acting as a beacon for an entire population of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis object was Yuki Nagato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki was a young girl. A very large young girl. A VERY large young girl. Even this alone doesn't even come close to how big she actually is. Either way, while her actual weight is unknown, the closest estimate which is plausible is around about one billion pounds. You heard me right, ONE BILLION.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty easy to see the effects of such a grand weight on her body. For thousands and thousands of miles, there was nothing but cascading blubber of this girl. Rolls upon folds upon flab could be seen, twisting and doubling over, creating a massive landscape of rich creamy white. It spread outwards, reaching further and further on so far that human comprehension couldn't even begin to fathom how far such fat could actually go on for before hitting some kind of galactic limit. Sometimes the rolls would go on and on, creating fields of plushy flesh, other times the folds would rise and fall, shifting into vast ranges of cliffs and mountains that even the most experienced of climbers would never have a chance in hell of conquering. Vast plains and stretches for as far as one's eyes would allow them to see, it was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind you, this was only Yuki's belly. The final resting place for all of her food based products before they were broken down into nutrients for her body to shift around her luscious frame was all of what was just described. The only thing that was missed out from there was her deep, ravenous belly button. A dark hole that proved doom for anything that could end up entrapped into it, it was buried deep within Yuki's massive rolls, doubled and tripled over so that no one would ever find it, with good reason. If one were to actually go into that huge drop, one would find a treasure trove of items and objects, but would never live to take them from there or escape from her navel. It was just too immense, so wide that it was a death wish for anyone to even considered entering. It was a lost cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough on that subject, there's more Yuki to talk about. Above the huge scaling belly, there was the signature sign of the female sex; the breasts. Babies from all around would be fed for the rest of their development stages thanks to the massive mammaries Yuki possessed. They were like two great balloons, expanded outwards and resting on the shelf of her gut, they stayed relatively comfortable on it's large soft belly bed. They were surprisingly perky despite all the blubber that was thrust upon them, it was amazing to say the least about how well they held up. Both were adorned with huge nipples on each, the round red defining patches acting like two eyes for the breasts, gazing over the grand body in substitution for the true eyes of Yuki, which were along with her face unable to see anything past all the flab the girl possessed. Always jutting out, always erect, her nipples struck outwards for all the world to see, as if begging for someone to go ahead and suck on the globular teats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Yuki's rear, boy what a rear this was. As plump and juicy as one would expect, the two great cheeks were stuffed to the brim with fat cells, with the huge ridge found between both fleshy cheeks being well defined, creating another huge dark drop of death for all those who were unfortunate enough to find themselves down there. Aside from that, her huge ass was just like the rest of her body; Gloriously fat. Unlike the other parts of her body, which were either adorned with flab or rolls for miles upon miles, Yuki's rump was surprisingly different, the skin only have the odd collection of bumps or lumps here and there. This would mean one could travel on her ass with relative ease, both fatty cheeks being a different change of pace compared to the rest of the girl's lardy frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer appendages such as her arms and legs, were what one could expect from a huge fat person. They were large and flabby, no muscles being present on them at all, just layers upon layers of thick folds. The arms and the legs were both resting on their respective areas, not shifting or budging in the slightest, defying their original means of creation. Yuki's arms were pretty much glued to her sides, each one snaking their way around her sides so they could just touched the very edge of her grand belly. The hands right at the end of each pudgy arm were caked in fat, the palms and the fingers smothered in juicy folds. They only served now to act as a means of caressing the wonderful tummy, the fat riddled fingers sinking into the equally fat riddled stomach. Yuki's legs were always overshadowed by her belly, the meaty legs covered and kept warm by the huge scale of her forever reaching gut. But from underneath the massive girl, one would be able to see her legs. As one would expect, her thighs were plump and lovely, masses of cellulite coating them. The rest of her legs were soft and squishy, while her feet were just like her hands: caked in a comfortable sea of flab that made them look like thick sausages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally at the top of all this is of course Yuki herself, the girl who respectively owned every single digit of this huge grand body. Finding her was a challenge, as while the rest of her body was expanded and bloated all over, the features on her face had not. But, her face itself had. A pudgy neck could be seen at the top, like a rising mountain of sheer flab that seemed to end rather abruptly at it's peak. This was due to the neck, like many other parts of Yuki's body, not going by the laws of nature of which it needed to abide by. Instead of supporting the girl's head, it was so fatty it made her head sink in, a large dip which turned into a cavern which played host to Yuki's face. Inside this cavern, it was adorned by the sight that was Yuki's cheeks and chins, all of which took on the brunt of the girl's facial fat. The chins were beyond countable, ripple after ripple surging straight ahead of her head. It wasn't that there was so many that it was hard to count them, but more along the lines of one being unable to decide where her chin fat ended and where her neck fat begun. As mentioned, there was also her cheeks. While not as big as her buttocks, the grandiose cheeks were still layered with luscious flab that made even more fatty additions to Yuki's lavish neck cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Yuki's entire being was pure fatness. She was the living, breathing, pure embodiment of gluttony. Why?.....Who knows? It seems that no matter how far back the history books go, no recollection of events or texts of the past could define how long Yuki had been here. She had always been floating around as an immense immobile blob of a woman, she just had been. When one comes to think of this, it would seem that it doesn't matter where she came from, as long as she was here it was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was due to Yuki playing hostess to an entire population of people. While the exact number was unknown, it was clearly known that there were people that lived on the huge porky girl. In their own little colonies, with their own little towns, all the little people living on the massive Yuki. This was made much easier as the sheer size of her frame had made it so she had her own centre of gravity. This meant that the inhabitants of Yuki could freely walk all over her with no fears of falling off. Plus, it seemed Yuki to be affected by orbit, the blobish girl rotating around the bright beaming sun that was present near her. Thankfully, she was at an ideal distance away, so burning was of no concern for her. Lastly, Yuki was also always perpetually circling around, creating a system of day and night which the people who resided on her had taken into account to create the system of time, even making full days, months and years for themselves. It was almost like Yuki was a planet in her own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on her had learnt to provide for themselves, all thanks to how immense Yuki was, as well as how powerful the girl's own centre of gravity was. Debris, asteroids and other lone objects in all of space would float by, and if they got close enough to the blobish girl, the objects would get pulled in. Crashing down onto the grandness of her body, the population could easily feel when something had crashed down onto Yuki, the shockwaves of blubber of the girl's fat filled frame being felt by anyone moderately close. When something was found to be crashed, the people who felt it would rush over to survey the crash site, who would see if it had anything of value. The best case scenario was asteroids, as they could then begin to mine it for whatever goods that were present on them. Even better, sometimes processed foods from other worlds in containers would crash, allowing for the people to have a rare treat. Though, in the cases of food, it was a grand law that everyone must send food to those who cared for Yuki, so that the massive girl could have a share of her own food. She acted as home for all these people, they knew they needed to give something back to their lovely fatty of a home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was simple on Yuki Nagato, even for the tubby girl herself. Nothing ever went wrong, nobody ever did wrong, it was peaceful and quiet. So, why don't we take a look at life on Yuki Nagato?</span></div></div>",

Combination of styles is also allowed as a storyline progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Obviously only the girls will expand, the single exception being Kyon's Little Sister, sorry but altering her in any way just doesn't feel right to me. Regardless keep the expansion female-only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Keep everyone in character, romance is allowed though actual sex is not allowed, try not to kill anyone (unless they are a villain), because of the rating crushing and hardcore vore will not be tolerated, when writing use at least basic spelling and sentence structure, also keep language if any within the rating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Last thing in keeping with series tradition lets keep the posts to first-person, preferably Kyon's (though I will allow the story to be told from another), this may seem tedious but hopefully won't put off a lot of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that said, I hope this interactive takes off and most of all have fun with it, everyone.</td>",
