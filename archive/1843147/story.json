It took mere seconds for him to get the proper lock, as Ichigo never bothered to suppress his reiatsu properly. \"Now, who shall the second target be?\" he wondered to himself a loud, deciding whoever he got the first lock on would do. The members of the 13 Squads all were much better at properly controlling the their reiatsu, so it took a few minutes before he got one. The reiatsu that the machine had managed to lock onto was none other than the Captain of Squad 2, Soi Fon, who was currently training as she appeared on the monitor. \"Now, just have to initiate the process and watch as I gather the research material for this results of this experiment...\" he said, typing in the commands of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was on his way home from to school by himself.

He almost grabbed the sword by the hilt be closer to Lilinette one last time before she left and took control of an enemy, hopefully temporarily, before he remembered the first person to touch the blade would enter Lilinette's (former?) body and she would enter theirs.

I don't care if you're a little girl now! Fight me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked back to scream, \"No way in hell, Kenpachi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo kept running as the fight hungry captain chased after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile running, Ichigo couldn't help but think about how all of this happened. After swapping bodies with Lilynette, Stark and Lilynette defected to join the Soul Reapers, and with their help, defeated Aizen and his army. Gin Ichimaru was the one who actually killed Aizen though, surprising everyone, and earning a lessened punishment as a result. Tousen was killed in battle. Unfortunately, the body swap technology was destroyed, leaving Ichigo trapped in Lilynette's body. Lilynette decided to live out Ichigo's life, because he felt guilty and decided to help out in case a way to swap them back is ever discovered, much to the current male's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Ichigo's family found out about the swap, and after a lot of tears, anger, and threats, Karin and Yuzu accepted the situation. Isshin just acts like everything is normal, but is secretly hoping to fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Hollows need either spirit particles or souls to survive, Ichigo could not live in the World of the Living, and thus moved to Seireitei, where she lives in the 13th squad. She still visits her sisters though, and is friends with Stark and Lilynette, along with all the other Soul Reaper friends she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ichigo was running away from Kenpachi, she noticed something red, and with a start, screamed, \"RENJI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji, her red-haired friend, turned to look at where he heard someone calling his name, and his jaw dropped when he saw Ichigo running towards him while being chased by Kenpachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji dropped the paperwork he was holding, and searched his pockets for a smoke bomb that he...<i>borrowed</i>...from Soifon the last time he was drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he found it, he threw it on the ground, and a thick smoke cloud appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the smoke cloud, Renji grabbed Ichigo and ran into a nearby building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the building?</span></div></div>",

She was shocked and wanted to pull out her sword. But there was NOTHING. She stretched out her hands and realized they were sleeved. She felt different and screamed in fear, \"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME AIZEN?...\" Unohana in Sung-Sun's body paused, realizing her voice was a bit off too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My oh my, what do we have here? A helpless little hollow trapped behind this cage. This is the first time I have seen you, Unohana, cower in fear. That's right, you are not in your own body anymore. Your body is probably causing chaos in Soul Society and by the time you return to your body. Soul Society would probably have fallen. Sit there and enjoy that new body of yours as you watch Soul Society fall. There is nothing you can do now.\" Aizen laughed filling the atmosphere with his evil laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnohana helpless tried to think of ways to break free from this cage to save Soul Society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Sung-Sun's POV</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sung-Sun will still be called Sung-Sun even in Unohana's body)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Sung-Sun was regaining consciousness and awoke to see Isane's worried look on her face. Sung-Sun, forgetting she was now in Unohana's body slipped out of character, and told her to go away. Immediately, she closed her mouth as she realized her new surroundings. Finally realizing her situation, she tried to alleviate the situation and stay-in-character. \"Ops sorry. I don't know what happened to me Isane. Please forgive me.\" Sung-Sun said and got up by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Captain Unohana.. You must have had a rough day today, let me send you to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I guess I certainly had..\" Sung-Sun heaved a sigh of relief, passing the first round as Unohana as she allowed the insanely tall Isane guide her to her host's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was late at night, Sung-San decided to rest and wait till tmr.

As she was busy looking for the device, she bumped into Isane accidentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsane who seemed afraid, apologise repeatedly and asked why Sung-Sun seemed like she was in a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that having more aid in searching would be helpful. She told Isane that she was looking for a black device which looked like a mini box. Isane snapped her fingers. \"Ah.. You mean this little black box captain? I found this on the doorway last night.\" Isane said as she took it out from her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung-Sun immediately snatched it from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.. I could have just passed it to you if you asked Captain Unohana. You seemed to be acting strange since last night.\" Isane explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm probably..

Could her day get any better than this? She hid the device in her haori that every captain had. Being in one of the most senior and respectable body in soul society. Aizen was sure nobody would suspect Unohana. Aizen also reminded that the 2 characters must be close enough for the switch to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSung-Sun left the barracks, only to see Soi Fon and Omaeda rushing to somewhere. Considering the difference in power and size, Sung-San felt that it will definitely be a good switch to make.

When Nel first took control of Ichigo's body, the mindset was still that of a young child's, but after a few weeks, it completely adjusted, so Nel's personality is like that of the adult Nel's now. Nel has more or less accepted his/her current body and has adjusted pretty well to Ichigo's life and even bought an apartment to live in with his 'daughter.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, on the other hand, is still adjusting. A few months ago, Kisuke created a gigai that works with hollows and arrancars, and made it similar to the first one he gave to Rukia. Similar, as in, it won't get rid of the inhabitant's spiritual powers, but it will turn them into an ordinary human if not regularly taken off, which Ichigo does to avoid creating a chain of fate, but wears it enough to age his/her current body. Also, (since gigai and human bodies seem to work best with those that are physically closest to them) Ichigo's gigai looks like Nel without the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Ichigo got the gigai, Nel moved out of the Kurosaki clinic into a nearby apartment, and teaches martial arts, sword fighting, and some other stuff to make money. After Ichigo got the gigai, Nel adopted the former human, and on the official papers, it says that Ichigo Kurosaki owns the apartment and lives there with his 5 year old daughter, Nel.( Mandatory education does not start until the age 6 in Japan, so Ichigo still has a few months (April-the month Nel was born and the month school starts in Japan) before he/she has to go to school.) Ichigo was told to call Nel 'daddy,' 'dad,' or 'papa,' and after months of prodding, Ichigo finally gave in. Nel was told to call Ichigo 'Nel,' or some nickname in order to avoid anyone being suspicious of them. Nel understood why, and did not hesitate to do so. But, when they're alone, they sometimes call each other by their real names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo is also going to the school for Soul Reapers after regular school in order to better understand how to use spiritual pressure, the captains ordered the child to attend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Ichigo is annoyed, especially since Nel's body wasn't potty-trained, so he/she has to re-learn that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you like this idea, press 'continue' for further details.

Ichigo smiles warmly and gives her a pat on the head and thanks her. As Yuzu leaves he notices that their is no spiritual energy coming off the package and decides to open it. He made sure Kon the perverted lion was not around as he sent him with Kisuke on an expensive cruise for some much needed relaxation after the Quincy War. Yoruichi is still here and his friends Uryu and Chad Are our of town. <br>\r\nHe opens it and finds a not saying \u201c Dear Ichigo Kurosaki, I know you have sacrificed so much and yet have received so little in return especially from the Soul Society so I offer you a gift. This watch has three functions Body Swap which allows you to switch with another person unnoticed. Trait swap which switches a personality or a physical trait of a person. And finally, the Life Swap which lets you switch with another person. When you switch with someone reality will change and no one will be the wiser, and the watch stays with you permanently and cannot work for anyone else. Enjoy this gift and have a good summer.\u201d <br>\r\nIchigo thought it was a joke but decided to try it out so when he put the watch on he noticed it scanned his DNA and started up for him. He decided to test it out on.</span></div></div>",
