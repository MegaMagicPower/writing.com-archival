In the back of your mind, you know this serene moment won't last forever. The Opening Ceremonies are tomorrow night, the prelude to two weeks of nonstop activity. The hustle and bustle seen now will only increase, as buses carrying athletes and spectators will clog the streets, making an already balmy city even hotter. At least the public water is safe to drink. There have been rumors of bottled water shortages floating around town, but considering the number of languages currently being spoken in the city, it's hard to tell if there's any merit to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems fitting that the ever morphing Olympics are taking place in a city where change has been the one constant. You've heard people call this place the Eternal City, even though there is quite a bit of construction that has only been here the last 50 to 70 years. The history permeates even the most modern of buildings, though, shedding light on the city's unique culture in a country renowned for its aesthetic qualities. Will this sense of eternity be present in the new Olympic venues? You will find out soon enough. In the meantime, you take any free time you can get to go out and see the many aspects of Rome. Given how long it took you to get into Vatican City yesterday, there's no way of knowing when (or even if) you'll get to see the Coliseum. People stand in lines almost kilometers in length to see all the sights. At least in the plazas you can enjoy all the artwork without having to wait around. Yes, the traffic can get in the way, but hey. You get what you pay for, and for not having to pay anything to see the sculptures of the Naiads it's a good deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while relaxing, you find yourself reviewing your itinerary in your mind. The Opening Ceremonies are tomorrow, and you have big plans for that. From there, you know that swimming and artistic gymnastics events will be the spotlight events for the first week. Athletics will have to wait until the following Sunday to capture the world's attention. During all of that, football and basketball games will take over every usable arena in the city as well as its suburban areas. Likewise, the Mediterranean Sea will become inundated with open water swimmers and triathletes. You remind yourself again to avoid various streets that will be closed due to the marathon events later on during the Games. In between all these events, you'll have to squeeze in a meal or two, but you <i>know</i> the restaurants are going to be perpetually crowded. Maybe someone from the area can give you some hints on tucked away dining establishments most of the crowds don't even know exist. Whatever happens, you know these next couple weeks will be made for the history books, and you can't wait! You are ready for the excitement and even all the waiting around you know you'll be doing before, during and after each competition. This is something you've spent your life imagining, and it's going to become reality in the next 24 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, in the grand scheme of this worldwide celebration, who are you?</span></font></span></div></div>",

On top of that, you haven't been mobbed by fans wanting an autograph or anything like that. You know this won't last, though. It's the last day before the Olympics, and people keeping pouring into Rome. Many of them are in the city to see you perform, but you can't let that get to you too much. While you are known in your sport for your achievements, the Olympic stage is a much different place. This message beats in your head like a drum, taking on a variety of voices: your coach, your teammates, your friendly rivals and even some fans who you know (or at least think) tell you with only the best intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you slip too deep into thought, your cell phone rings. One of your teammates is calling, and your curiosity drives you to answer more than anything. After finding out that the coaches have been looking for you, you state that you're in the Piazza della Repubblica.This also prompts you to admit that you left your camera behind, which is kind of a bummer given how you really won't have any time to take pictures of the city once the Olympics get under way. The caller chuckles and agrees to bring your camera over in exchange for having lunch in the nearby area. You agree, partly because you don't want to get too much more introspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time your teammate arrives, a few other people have decided to tag along for the ride. You all decide to hang out in the plaza for a bit and take silly pictures by the fountains. This is one of those times you don't mind being in front of the lens, as you're not doing anything pertaining to your sporting career. Even behind the lens, you find yourself laughing loud enough to almost be heard over the traffic It isn't until one of your friends falls in the fountain that your group opts to call it quits to grab some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven how all of you are still training and will be dealing with drug tests in the next few days, you opt out of enjoying a famous Italian wine with your luxurious lunch that manages to span four courses. As your group splits two small desserts, your phone chimes with a text from your coach advising of a training change. You sigh when you realize you'll be going to bed super early tonight. After all, the Games are not just fun and games for those competing. You've worked so hard over the years for this one chance, so if there's a training change you go with it. You mention this to your teammate, who nods and agrees that it's a bummer. Still, you decide you'll make the most of your time in the city before heading back to the Olympic Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, what's your sport?</font></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your journey here was long, not to mention required years of saving to make a reality. While you certainly hope your countrymen will win at these Games, your traveling to Rome is not just about national pride. The Olympics are a spectacle no matter who wins, and it's not every day that someone from China sits next to an Iranian for any reason, especially a peaceful one. All you want is to be there, to experience the Olympics from every angle. You were even lucky enough to get tickets for the Opening Ceremonies, a feat which in itself merits a gold medal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Olympics begin, you take the opportunity to visit some of the city's most wonderful historic sights. In particular, you were surprised at the relatively reasonable cost to see the Coliseum. At 20 euros, it was more than worth it. Hopefully the pictures you took turn out. You have also squeezed in visits to St. Peter's Basilica and the Roman Forum. Today is a less structured day, one in which your group decided to wander around and stop whenever something caught your eye. While you spent the morning with them, you did manage to get some alone time this afternoon. You only ended up here after getting lost trying to find the Velodrome. It's not that big of a deal, since this plaza is less daunting but still very beautiful. You really don't want to leave anytime soon, but you did promise to meet up with everybody for dinner. At least dinner isn't for several hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swell of cheering draws your attention to a spot just outside the plaza. Looking up, you find a group of teenagers laughing and shouting in what you think is Italian, but you're not sure. Hey, you barely know enough Italian to get directions to the bathroom and find out how much souvenirs cost. Even so, you smile at their antics, as one of them starts walking on his hands for no apparent reason. This stops when the acrobat is almost hit by a zooming bicyclist, but that near miss only dampens their rancor a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've had a chance to drink in the sights and enjoy it. That display, though, reminds you why you're here. You're ready to hear the roar of the crowd as the athletes race for the finish and dazzle the spectators with their agility. It's a moment you've waited years to experience for yourself. How far did you travel for this chance?</span></div></div>",

Not that being a member of the press at the Olympics isn't excited. It's just that you always daydreamed about being on the track in front of the cameras. Being behind them, though, is hard work. While you haven't trained quite like these athletes have, your day is just as long. You're also working more days. You know this will be one of the most intense assignments of your career and can't afford to drop the ball at any point. Even time spent idling in a city plaza requires a small part of your brain to be on the job. Glancing around, you don't see any notable athletes in the area, but the place is large enough for anyone to hide in broad daylight. Combine that with the mid-afternoon traffic that has shaped Rome in the 21st Century, and it becomes apparent to you that you can miss a story very easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chiming sound floats from your pocket. Fumbling, you manage to grab your phone and find a text from one of your colleagues letting you know there's a situation at one of the venues. It takes you a couple minutes to figure out where it is, and you realize you're not that far away. You fire a text back saying you can get there right away and request more details. The response seems to take forever, as you're already striding out of the plaza. While waiting for your colleague to respond, you text your assistant to bring some more equipment to the location while you go stake out a spot. You're not sure how many other press corp members are in this part of the city, but you have a feeling you'll be among the first, especially since you can walk to the venue. You just hope your Italian can pass muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrive, you find a handful of press corps members are already there, but you still have a good vantage point. A little eavesdropping nets intelligence about an athlete being injured during a routine exercise. While waiting for the police and venue officials to either provide a statement or allow anyone inside to take a look, you pull up some notes about this venue on your phone and find an earlier article discussing some equipment issues encountered during testing. Intrigued, you don't look up until someone taps you on the shoulder. It's your assistant with the equipment you requested. You thank him and go over the gist of the event while getting set up. There are more members of the press filing in, and you're glad you got here when you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour role determines what you need for this big story. What will you choose?</font></span></span></div></div>",

You're actually waiting for several other officials from your sport to arrive for a meeting. While most of the dozen or so meetings you've attended have been in IOC buildings, it was decided that an off the record discussion needed to be had, if nothing else to vent about some recent rule changes in your sport. The last thing any of you feel like doing is getting busted in the Village for such complaining, even though you know at least three other people here who fought the changes just as hard as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's very tough work being an Olympics official. You enforce the rules and assess performance while representing seemingly your entire country in the process. You've presided over world class events, including a prior Olympics. Thus, you know very well what is at stake during this gathering. Even after participating in the sport, you consider being an official to be the tougher job, especially when you're on this stage. During your time as an official, you've discovered that the degree of training and alertness you had as an athlete doesn't quite prepare you for being on the other side of the action. And then there are the fans. They're the reason you avoid the internet like the plague. It's one thing to watch the athletes get slammed, but seeing the rule and officiating decisions being, well, \"discussed\" really makes your blood boil. Sometimes, you want to drag some of these people into your zone for a day and show them what it's really like to make or break a competition. You do this because of your devotion to fairness in the sport, but some days it's much more difficult than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you spot one of your peers on the other side of the fountain. You wave silently, hoping she'll catch the flicker of motion that is your arm in midair. She spots you after a couple moments and waves in acknowledgement before trotting around to meet you. If she's here, the others will probably arrive shortly. At least everyone knows each well enough that everyone can be identified in a crowd. Once you meet, though, it's time to talk shop. What sport will you be discussing?</span></div></div>",

Since this area is familiar to you, you are having almost too much fun watching the tourists and athletes trying not to look like tourists. Sometimes it's hilarious, and other times it's just sad. With the Olympics in town, it's almost overwhelming. That's why you've been spending more and more at at Plaza della Repubblica. Not as many tourists hang around here, and the fountains are certainly lovely. It's a needed respite from the increased traffic brought about by what feels like half the planet descending upon the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoy it, though. You were definitely not among those circulating anti-Olympics petitions or organizing demonstrations against the IOC. Yes, you can understand why people would not want the Olympics in town. It's a significant undertaking, and you've seen it reshape the city's landscape over the past several years. Still, you have confidence that the Games will be successful, and the new infrastructure made initially for this event will live on to serve the city of Rome for decades to come. For that matter, parts of the old stadiums from 1960 found new life in 2020. The scope of the Olympics has changed. The allure of having a wonderful legacy of the Olympics, though, will never fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you watch as someone waves across the fountain at another individual whose head perks up in recognition. A journalist type almost runs out of the plaza in an attempt to challenge Usain Bolt's records. Tourists pose for cheesy group shots that have been an ubiquitous sight these days. Groups head off to lunch while others just try to get out of the plaza. Traffic is a little heavy, but considering the masses near the historic sites this plaza looks almost empty. Then again, being familiar with the area, you actually would be able to tell the difference between everyday sightseeing traffic and the colossal crowds associated with a worldwide celebration. It's all happening in your country, your home. How do you fit into all this?</span></div></div>",
