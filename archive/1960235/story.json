            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda opened her spell book to find an interesting spell she had somehow never seen before, the spell of... Well, she wasn't sure what spell it was, as the words became blurry in the title. Feeling adventurous, the princess decided to cast the spell anyway, unsure of its effects. After the spell was cast, a brief show of sparkling lights emitted from the princess' hands, but after that, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... How disappointing.\" Zelda thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter casting her less than spectacular new spell, Zelda practiced her magic some more, and then went about her day as usual. She next had a break from all her royal duties in the afternoon, when she decided to eat some lunch with Impa in the chapel inside the castle. Zelda talked with Impa about various things, reminiscing about the hero of time, Link, and how he had helped save the kingdom. She even told her about the mysterious new spell she had tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, you shouldn't use magic if you don't know what it will do.\" Impa told the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know, Impa.\" Zelda laughed. \"But it's strange, I've had that book for a long time, but I'd never seen that spell until today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is quite odd.\" Impa replied, weary of bad magic, but intrigued nonetheless. \"And you say it did nothing at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! That's the biggest mystery of it all!\" Zelda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two discussed the spell and magic in general some more, when Zelda felt her dress starting to get a little tight. Zelda stood up and adjusted her clothes, saying that she might need a new wardrobe soon. But when Zelda kept readjusting her clothes, Impa took notice, she stood up as well and was about to ask the princess if something was the matter, when she saw that Zelda was somehow taller than she was, almost a whole 2 feet taller in fact!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess!\" Impa shouted in surprise. \"You're so tall! But how..? And are my eyes deceiving me, are or you getting even bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you saying!?\" Zelda cried as she grew. \"I'm getting... Bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda saw that it was true when she tried to leave the room to figure out what was wrong with her, but she found that she couldn't even fit through the door anymore! The princess could not ignore her ever increasing height anymore, it had only been a few seconds and she was nearly half the size of the room already, and still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's clothes were long gone, having reached their stretching point a moment ago, leaving the growing princess completely nude. She was embarrassed at this, and tried to cover herself with what little scraps of clothing she could find, but she quickly outgrew even that and resorted to covering herself with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked down and blushed when she saw Impa, who had just seen the embarrassing scene. But Impa wasn't too interested in that, she was just standing in awe at the princess' huge height, she was so surprised by what she was seeing that even she was unsure of what to do now. Impa was beginning to look like a tiny little doll to the growing princess. Higher and higher Zelda grew until she reached the very high up ceiling, conking her head on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww!\" Zelda yelped as she rubbed her head. \"T-This is terrible, if this keeps up I'll destroy the whole castle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, I'll go get help! Uh,Try not to get any bigger in the meantime!\" Impa shouted up to the room-size princess, and ran through the door of the chapel to find somebody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impa, please hurry!\" Zelda cried, still growing larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her protector gone, Zelda then crouched down and got into a kneeling position on the floor. In this position, she could still fit into the room, but for how much longer, she wondered. Zelda was still growing, soon she'd fill the whole chapel! She just wanted it to end...</span></div></div>",

The Kingdom of Hyrule was finally beginning to enjoy peace once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Zelda had spent a long time leading the re-construction of Castle Town, it was wasn't an easy process, but she soon found that many of its former citizens were happy and eager to return to their old hometown and help rebuild. So, along with their help and that of the Seven Sages, Castle Town had been rebuilt, almost back to its former glory, in only a few short years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda enjoyed the comfort and peaceful atmosphere that had returned to her kingdom. But she still worried about future threats, so in an effort to prepare, the princess had started a new campaign aimed at the next generation of Hylians. A royal class was opened to kids of all ages, teaching a variety of subjects, from general scholarly studies, to that of fighting and even magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out to be a successful program, and Zelda was happy to be enlightening so many young minds. She had always loved children, and she was well-versed in the ways of magic, so it only made sense for her to come in and teach some classes herself, and the children seemed to love her so much, always being overjoyed when she'd make her appearance in their royal classroom, clad in such regal dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such day, Zelda had nearly finished a lesson with her young students on the subject of magic, and was about to leave the class to finish up her more royal duties. But Zelda had made it a habit to end her lessons on something unique, advanced spells from the royal spellbooks, and today she had something special in mind to show everyone before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, children, watch me now.\" The blonde princess told her students, who stared at her wide-eyed at what trick she'd pull of today. \"This is a 'little' spell I like to use around the castle to make moving things a bit easier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had brought out a pot and placed it on a desk when she first arrived. None of the kids knew what their princess had brought it to class for, until now. Zelda cast a quiet spell and pointed her index finger at the pot, magic sparkles flew from the tip of her finger into the pot, making it shine dimly. The kids were besides themselves with anticipation by this point, all of them wondering what this new spell was going to do to the pot. They got their answer in just a moment, when the pot suddenly started to shrink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" The children 'ooed' and 'aahed' together. Zelda smiled, pleased that her little magic trick had amused the youngsters. The kids ran over to the pot and looked at it. It was only a fraction of its former size, small enough that even a little kid could pick it up in one hand. One of them indeed picked it up but, well-mannered as they were, they took turns passing the pot around, though some still grabbed at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you shrink people?\" One of the kids asked when the pot was in her hand. This off-hand comment, born out of innocent curiosity, got the other boys' and girls' minds wandering. They'd already thought seeing a pot shrink was cool, but they young minds raced as they imagined other things they'd like to see dwindle away, and all started to talk about potential shrinking subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Can you shrink yourself!?\" One especially creative boy asked, rather loudly. This louder suggestion got the attention of the group, and soon they were all cheering and asking the princess to shrink herself for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...\" Zelda suddenly sounded not so confident. It was true that she'd practiced the shrinking spell before, and the corresponding growth spell along with it. However, she had only ever tested them on inanimate objects, like the pot, she'd never tried it on a person before, much less herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Pleeease!\" The group begged her. Some of them had started laughing by now, probably imagining the image of their beloved princess shrunk down to the size of a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright. I'll try.\" Zelda told the kids, and they immediately cheered happily and waited eagerly for Zelda to shrink herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're so innocent, they probably believe I can do anything I want to with magic. I hope I don't let them down!</i> Zelda thought. The spells to change size were indeed advanced, but with her skill level and experience in using them on things other than herself, Zelda thought she'd just be able to pull off such a trick for the kids. She'd just target the magic to herself, shrink herself, let the kids enjoy the show, and then grow herself back to normal in no time, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it goes!\" Zelda tried to sound enthusiastic about giving the kids the show they wanted, but she still had some doubts in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda walked in front of the classroom and cast the spell once more, she used her magic in the same way as she had on the pot, but this time focused on diminishing herself. All eyes were on the beautiful princess as she slowly started to dwindle down in size, dress, crown and all. There wasn't a single jaw in the room that had managed to stay up as Zelda's size went down. But the children, keeping their patience about them, stayed still and watched in awe as their beloved teacher/princess got smaller and smaller right in front of their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How surreal...</i> Zelda had to admit being watched was making her nervous, and getting tinier by the second made her feel even more so. But she knew she was still in control of the room, she was after all not only the teacher of these young minds, but also their ruler, she didn't demand respect but she knew she'd gotten it from all the time she'd spent with the children. So she tried not to worry about making herself doll-sized while in a room filled with toy-loving children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's shrinking stopped, leaving the princess of Hyrule standing at only a mere 5 inches tall. To the kids in the room, she now looked like a doll version of herself. But to Zelda herself, the kids now looked like giants! Big-eyed, round, giants! Zelda was amazed at the reversal of their respective heights, she wondered if this was how big she looked to the young children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And that's how it's done!\" Zelda said confidently, hands on hips as she looked up at the children that now towered over her mini form. But then she gasped and covered her mouth when she heard her new, smaller voice. \"Eep!\" She squeaked out, face reddening. She now sounded like she'd ingested a large amount of helium!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha! Look at Princess Zelda!\" One of the more rambunctious kid's laughed, many joined him in laughing at Zelda's voice and small size. They didn't mean to poke fun at the princess, the whole situation was just so bizarre that they'd settled for laughing at it over staring awkwardly. Still though, to the reduced princess, it was enough to make her regret her decision to shrink herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, children!\" Zelda started, still sounding like a chipmunk. She stopped herself and tried to deepen her voice when speaking again, \"That's enough fun for today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Zelda, her attempt at sounding more serious only made her sound more hilarious to the kids. They all burst out laughing at her now. Zelda's face turned even brighter red and she stomped her foot down in an uncharacteristic show of anger. She wanted to scold her students for their behavior, but by now it was too late. They'd all almost gone from seeing her as their teacher, to now seeing her as little more than a princess doll!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda knew the situation was rapidly spiraling out of her control, and she knew that she'd have little to no hope of getting the kids back under her at her current size, so Zelda tried to cast the growth spell on herself, when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda shook her head, disappointed with her students for their unruly behavior. Inwardly though, she knew she had nobody but herself to blame for getting into this mess. She'd traded in her height and control for a chance at pleasing the children, but now as the kids continued to amuse themselves with her puny size, she realized that doing so was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They'd best be prepared for scolding once I'm big again!</i> Zelda thought as she prepared to grow herself back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny princess focused on the spell of growth, like she had many times before in practice for today. However, this time, Zelda felt odd. The spell was prepared, but nothing happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What is this!?\" Zelda squeaked in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zelda could even begin to think of what the problem could be, a giant hand suddenly swooped down and grabbed her. The mini princess screamed as she was carried up into the air, taking her for a wild ride for a few seconds before she was stopped abruptly right in front of one of the kid's faces, her captor, a young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" The girl cried, raising her free hand up palm-forward to deter the rest of the children from messing with the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Zelda looked up and saw that her captor was a little girl with short brown hair, and wearing a pink dress. Zelda smiled as she recognized the girl as Carrie, a prodigal student of hers. Carrie always treated Zelda so sweetly and kindly, and always listened intently to her lessons. It wasn't a stretch to say that Carrie was among Zelda's favorite students, and was by far the most adept in the ways of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, dear!\" Zelda squeaked from the girl's hand, gasping through her words as, although Carrie was trying to help, the little girl was holding the shrunken princess a little too tightly by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome, miss Zelda.\" Carrie smiled down at the puny princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Would you mind to let me down on my desk, please?\" Zelda asked. As much as she appreciated Carrie's help, the innocent girl had her in all but a choke hold right now, and even had her arms and legs tightly squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie nodded and went over to the desk, which was neatly arranged with books, pencils, rulers, and all sorts of teacher's tools on it. Carrie then somewhat carelessly dropped Zelda onto the desktop, like one might toss an unwanted toy. Zelda groaned from the rolling toss, but didn't want to say anything about it, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, kids. Stay there and let me work out the reversal spell.\" Zelda said, collecting herself and brushing off her dress. The class did as they were told, having calmed down thanks in part to Carrie's actions. They watched quietly as their doll-like princess moved around the desk, inspecting the various objects on it that were now almost all bigger than her whole miniature body. In particular, Zelda was interested in the ruler she had on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie, would you mind holding that up for me? I'd like to see how small I am now.\" Zelda told her trusted student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Carrie said. She grabbed the ruler and held it up straight. Zelda stood next to it and looked to her side to see that her head was aligned with the 5-inch mark. \"Five inches, ma'am.\" Carrie informed Zelda, and everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class burst out laughing once more upon hearing how small Princess Zelda had made herself. Most of them knew how big their favorite toys were, and they now knew that Zelda was even smaller than most of those! Zelda blushed in embarrassment, she knew she was tiny, but now she felt even smaller than before. Carrie looked between the embarrassed Princess and the other kids, and started to get upset that they were making Zelda all red faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Stop it!\" Carrie yelled at the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's alright, Carrie.\" Zelda told her giant protector. Carrie looked down at Zelda, almost teary-eyed from how bad she felt for the shrunken princess. \"Thank you for helping me!\" Zelda said. Carrie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda then walked across the desk to some books that she'd brought in earlier. The shrunken blonde knew she'd be performing the size-changing spells today for the kids, and she'd practiced intently in the week before, but she still brought in the books detailing just how to perform the magic just in case. If the spell wasn't working for her now, then she'd need to do a little research to figure out just why that was. In a worst case scenario, Zelda also knew that she might be requiring Carrie to help her by having the little girl perform the growth spell on her, just in case she wasn't able to get it to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you open this book, please, sweetie?\" Zelda asked warmly. Carrie smiled and nodded, and did as she was asked to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda wasted no time in having Carrie flip through the pages for her to find the size-changing spells again. Once she did, Zelda hopped on the book and read through it thoroughly, twice even, to make sure she got everything just right for her return to normal-sized heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Zelda gulped, thinking about how to best proceed with the magic. \"Here goes...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seven years. That's how many long years had passed since Ganondorf's evil reign began. The once peaceful country of Hyrule had quickly fallen into shambles without a hero, or a princess to guide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to most, however, the long-thought dead princess Zelda had survived. Thanks to her trusty caretaker, Impa, Zelda had learned the ways of the Sheikah and was able to use magic to disguise herself amongst them. Using her learned ninja-like skills and training, Zelda had donned the persona of \"Sheik\" and gone into hiding some time after the near collapse of her kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing this disguise, princess Zelda was able to keep herself safe until the time would come that the hero of time would awake from his years-long rest and rescue the kingdom from Ganondorf and his evil forces. Those seven years had been grueling, but the time was soon coming for the hero named Link to return...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheik, or rather, Zelda, was in a rush, she'd been on a mission to make sure the paths the hero would need to take were still accessible to him. In the previous months, she was doing everything she could to make sure that Link's journey would be a smooth, if not still dangerous, one to take. With everything now seemingly in order, Zelda hurried to the Temple of Time, for it was there that Link was destined to return from, and it was there that she was needed to wait for him to guide him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith impressive agility, Zelda was able to traverse the wasteland of Hyrule Field quite easily while in her Sheik persona. It pained her to see all the remnants of destruction that Ganondorf had left in his wake over the past seven years, but she knew his time was almost over. She keep her wits about her and, silently as she could, dashed across the formerly prosperous field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in her haste, Zelda had not yet noticed that she was being tailed by Ganondorf's minions, who had been watching her since she started scouting out the temples. With skills that nearly matched Zelda's own, they followed her, waiting for the most opportune moment to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was blissfully unaware of her pursuers presence as she neared the ruins of Hyrule Castle Town. She allowed herself to slow down and breathe a sigh of relief, thinking in her mind that her long awaited savior would soon be here. She wondered how long she might have to wait for him in the Temple of Time. She chuckled softly to herself at the thought of waiting, the closest thing she'd had to a laugh in many years, and decided in her mind that she'd be fine waiting a little bit longer if it meant that her Kingdom could be saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda prepared herself to scale the walls of the town, knowing it was better to avoid the zombie-like Re-deads that now inhabited the whole place if she could. But just as neared the bridge to the town, she was suddenly grabbed from behind. She gasped as she was thrown to the ground. With her quick reflexes, Zelda was able to easily get up and recover from the surprise attack. She prepared to strike back with some kunai, but stopped herself for a moment when she saw just who had been following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before the former princess was a near small army-sized group of monsters. Zelda glared at the gang of beasts, cursing herself inwardly for being so careless to let such a large group track her to the town. Nearly 50 sneaky beasts had tailed her. Zelda was confident to be able to take a few of them down, but her training hadn't really prepared her to fight off so many attackers at once. This seemed to be her final challenge before the return of Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cry of what appeared to be their leader, the monsters rallied together for a coordinated, yet somewhat clumsy, assault on the princess. The princess immediately jumped into action, using every available technique and weapon in her arsenal to fight of the horde. Zelda was feeling confident as she pummeled foe after foe, but somehow it appeared that for every enemy she bested, three more took their place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odds were stacked against her, and the horde was succeeding in wearing her down. Zelda knew she would lose if this kept up, so instead of staying to lose the fight, she decided to cut her losses and try a more risking maneuver by running away across the bridge to Castle Town ruins. Her plan was to lose the horde by running into the Re-Dead infested town, but a quick glance behind her told her that the mod was more fearless than she expected, and they followed her right into the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first plan not working, Zelda went about trying to lose them in the maze-like ruins of the town instead. If nothing else, she knew she was faster than the monsters, so losing them wouldn't be too hard. In and out of the twists and turns of the ruined town Zelda ran, using her intimate knowledge of the layout of the town to her advantage to lose her pursuers. It took some minutes, but Zelda soon succeeded in throwing them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda felt relieved that she lost her foes, but then another problem arose. She'd inadvertently backed herself into a corner near the entrance of the town, it made for a good hiding spot, but if she wanted to make a break for the Temple of Time, she'd surely be spotted, and letting them catch onto her plans at the temple was something she could not do. But at the same time, she couldn't just wait for them to leave. Ganondorf's minions were nothing if not determined, they'd not stop looking for her, ever. Zelda wasn't sure she'd be able to really take on so many enemies at once again. She needed a different plan, anything that could help her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda consulted the words Impa had passed onto her so many years ago, she needed to concentrate on them now more then ever. As she continued to stay hidden, Zelda tried recall a move or technique or spell or anything that Impa might've ever told her about during her training so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it came to her, the one spell that Impa had told her to never use unless she was in a desperate situation, and even then only as a last resort. Impa had never told her exactly what the spell would do, explaining to Zelda that she had to be vague in describing it as it only worked in certain ways sometimes, which is why Impa had told her to never use it. But Impa also, after much prodding and questioning from a younger Zelda, taught her the spell. Impa also went on and told her that she herself had once used it to conquer 50 men. Zelda always thought it was impressive, but Impa's harsh warnings had kept her from casting it, until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, goddesses, let this work!\" Zelda thought as she cast the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Zelda felt a powerful tingling sensation throughout her entire body, and she briefly wondered if it were some kind of strength-boosting spell. However, her hopes were soon dashed as, instead of growing strength, her body quickly shrank down. Zelda let out a yelp of shock as she watched the world around her stretch and grow to gigantic proportions. She crawled about frantically in her hidey hole, clawing at the air in the hopes of grabbing onto an invisible force that might stop her shrinking, but it was no use, the spell was cast and set in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be right!\" Zelda cried aloud as she dwindled further into smallness. Her height quickly melted away, leaving the worried princess smaller and weaker then ever! Just as Zelda thought things couldn't get worse...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Ruto sighed. She'd been summoned to Hyrule Castle by none other than the princess of Hyrule herself, Zelda. Being good friends with the princess, especially after her alter-ego Sheik had helped her people, and with the two of them both being sages, Ruto happily agreed to meet with Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after making the long trek to Castle Town, and getting some weird looks from the townsfolk, Ruto had been told to wait for Zelda in the throne room by the guards. Ruto understood the life of a princess was not one that allowed one to have much time to herself, so she agreed and took a seat at the steps to the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been nearly an hour ago, and Zelda was still nowhere to be seen, leaving Ruto to wait alone in the big empty throne room, only a mysterious big box, covered by a cloth was in there with her. Ruto wasn't one to get upset or irate with such matters, she had waited seven years for her beloved Link to come save her and the whole Zora tribe after all. But Zelda's invitation and then lack of promptness was giving Ruto half a mind to just call it a day and ask to come back at a later time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto shook her head in disappointment, she'd even been looking forward to catching up with the Hyrulian princess, but it seemed like that wasn't going to happen today. She stood up and made her way to the exit, she was going to make some excuse up that she had to leave, and then say she'd be happy to return at a later, more appropriate time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope Zelda won't be mad at me...</i> Ruto thought as she neared the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ruto was about to open the doors, they opened up, and Princess Zelda entered the room. Ruto had to stop in her tracks, surprised by the Hylian princess's sudden appearance. Ruto gasped and quickly collected herself, kneeling before the blonde woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Princess Zelda!\" Ruto stammered, bowing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled at her and raised her right hand, to signal to the Zora princess to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Princess Ruto. There's no need for formalities around me.\" Zelda assured her softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Forgive me your highness.\" Ruto blurted out and quickly stood back up. Zelda laughed at Ruto's nervousness. Ruto felt a little awkward now, and she blushed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, what's gotten into you, Ruto? We're all friends here!\" Zelda insisted, her voice soothing and calming to Ruto's nerves. The Zora princess loosened up a little and allowed herself to relax, feeling more than a little foolish for her display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. It's just a little nerve-wracking to have to wait for so long. Us Zoras are used to a more fast pace style.\" Ruto told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forgive me for being late. I didn't mean to make you wait.\" Zelda apologized, cocking her head to the side and looking downward, as if sad herself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I'm not trying to scold you or anything! I just mean, uh, you know...\" Ruto lost her train of thought and again could only stammer a response. Zelda could only once again laugh at Ruto's cute nervousness, she found it funny that it was so unbecoming of her Zora princess friend. She knew she had to bring some order back to their conversation, and so simply said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again, Ruto.\" Zelda smiled at her friend. Ruto giggled a little, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's good to see you as well, Zelda.\" Ruto smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Zelda clasped her hands together happily and walked down the hall to the throne. Ruto followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we get straight to the point, then?\" Zelda asked, looking back at her fishy friend. Ruto nodded, much to Zelda's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Zelda said. She walked over to the nearby sheet-covered stand and grabbed onto the top of it. \"Brace yourself for this, Ruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto gulped. She'd been wondering what was underneath the sheet since she walked into the throne room, and now Zelda was about to reveal it to her with a warning to 'brace herself', Ruto could only imagine what the Hylian princess had in store for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda pulled off the sheet, revealing what appeared to be an aquarium underneath, it was a decently-sized one at that! Inside fit corals and seaweed, and even miniature figures of a castle and a sunken ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how cute!\" Ruto exclaimed. As a Zora, she loved all things aquatic, and even though she wasn't too keen on keeping fish as pets herself, even she had to admit that the craft was well done on this aquarium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it.\" Zelda said, smiling at the Zora princess's positive reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do! But you know I don't like to keep fish as pets, right? So why call me over here just for this?\" Ruto asked, to which Zelda chuckled lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, I wouldn't keep regular fish in it! No, YOU'RE going to be my pet!\" Zelda stated happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto's eyes went wide as she processed Zelda's words. It didn't make any sense to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Was all Ruto could ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda didn't say anything back. Instead, the blonde princess simply murmured something under her breath. Ruto knew Zelda well enough to know when the princess was casting a spell, and it seemed now was one of those times. Ruto started to worry as magic energies flowed up from Zelda's body and gathered in the air, then in the next second, the collected magic 'flew' into Ruto's body, knocking the wind out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!?\" Ruto cried. The Zora princess could only wonder what in the world Zelda was thinking by casting some strange spell on her in the middle of their meeting. She got her answer shortly when she noticed that Zelda was suddenly looking a little taller. Ruto started to sweat and looked around the room, she noticed that it wasn't just Zelda that was getting bigger, the aquarium and everything else in the room was seemingly growing all around her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Why!?\" Ruto cried out, she realized now that her supposed 'friend' princess Zelda was now shrinking her! Ruto was too scared to move, and as she looked up at the increasing large Zelda, she remembered what the blonde princess had said to her earlier. If Zelda indeed meant that she'd be taking Ruto as her pet, then it all made perfect, horrifying sense. Zelda was shrinking her to make her into own little pet fish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda saw the look of terrified realization in Ruto's eyes and smiled darkly. \"I assume you've figured it out, my little 'fish'.\" She admitted, much to Ruto's horror. \"I didn't call you all the way over here just to 'show' you my new aquarium, I called you here so you could live in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto was shocked by this sudden betrayal. She'd never have expected Zelda to turn to Zora slavery, much less in the way that she was doing it now by shrinking her! The terrified tiny could do nothing but curl into a ball and weep on the floor as her shrinking slowed to a stop, leaving the former Zora princess a mere 3 inches tall and in the shadow of a her giantess captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was pleased with her new toy and cheerfully plucked her up from the floor. The Hylian princess started off quickly by trying to play with her new prize in her hands, but Ruto refused to give Zelda any enjoyment though, and remained as rigid as she could, curled up like she had been several years ago in Jabu Jabu's belly with Link. Zelda sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please just give it up already, Ruto. You're not a princess anymore, you're the pet of one now.\" Zelda told her coldly. Ruto could only weep in response. Zelda rolled her eyes at the sad scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Zelda sighed. She moved her hand over the aquarium and casually tilted it, dumping the shrunken Zora woman inside. Ruto reacted naturally to the water and assumed a swimming pose as soon as she touched the water. Ruto thought to act fast and tried to swim downwards to gain some speed before quickly jetting up from the bottom of the aquarium and trying to launch herself out of her accursed cage. But just as she was about to come back up, Zelda grabbed the cover of the aquarium and quickly put it on, trapping Ruto in it and causing the shrunken Zora girl to hit her head on the new \"ceiling\" of her prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Ruto gargled through the water of her cage. The shrunken fishgirl sank to the bottom of the aquarium, she rubbed her aching head. Outside, Ruto could hear Zelda's taunting laughs at her plight. Ruto swam to the glass of the cell and pounded on it, begging Zelda to release her. Zelda stopped laughing, and for a moment Ruto thought the usually kind and compassionate princess had come to her senses, but then the towering blonde bent down in front of her and gave the aquarium a quick and hard tap, right where Ruto was pleading with her to be set free. The force of just a single finger of Zelda's tapping was enough to knock Ruto back someways, sending the shrunken woman spiraling backwards through the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're going to need some tough training before you lose that attitude of yours.\" Zelda told her through the glass. Thanks to Ruto's Zora nature, she could hear just fine even underwater, but right now she wasn't sure she wanted to hear Zelda's words. \"You see, I like my pets docile and willing, and right now, well, you're just not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto started to cry again. Zelda had all the power in this situation, and the miniaturized blue girl had none. Zelda didn't want to listen to reason, and Ruto was far too small to attempt an escape on her own. There seemed no way out of this prison she'd accidentally walked right into. So Ruto collapsed on the aquarium seafloor and wept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the aquarium, Princess Zelda smiled brightly and clasped her hands together. She was as happy as a little girl receiving a pony for her birthday, and in her mind it wasn't too far off, as she had just gotten a precious pet of her own. Zelda then put the cover back on the aquarium, covering the former Zora princess in darkness, and ordered her men to come into the room to carry the secret prison back to her royal chambers...</span></div></div>",

Intrigued, She grabbed the book and took it back to her room. Once in her room she opened it up and began reading. The book was full of odd seeming spells to change ones own body in a variety of ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda decided why not try one of the spells on herself and see what happens? She looked for one that seemed interesting and began casting it. It was the breast expansion spell and looked down at her own chest. Barely able to fill her B-Cup bra. She thought she could grow a cup size or two, And maybe Link will notice and stop running around with those other girls. So she cast the spell and soon felt a warm tingling in her breasts, They were growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's breasts continued to grow until they reached a full C-Cup. Zelda cupped her breasts and smiled at herself in the mirror. But her smile faded as she felt her newly enlarged breasts strain on her bra. So she removed it and decided to go braless for now. Looking at her reflection again she couldn't help but think maybe she needed a few more cup sizes?</span></div></div>",

She casts the spell again, triple growth speed, again, quadruple growth speed, again, her boobs become mountainous. She continued to let them grow, but they suddenly stopped growing. She was startled by the fact that they stopped growing, but then she began to grope them, er, she gropes as much as she can with how large they are. She seems not to be worried about how they're so big that they destroyed 2 rooms of the castle, or to the fact that they could only have stopped growing for the second. Suddenly, they begin to grow again... but the tingling sensation in her boobs felt a LOT more stronger. Suddenly, her boobs explode in size, and they break through the castle. Her breasts, still growing, STILL do not worry Zelda, who clearly has no problem with them destroying her castle.

Luckily for the blooming princess, her breasts had shielded her from being harmed. In fact, her massive tits were now supporting her instead of the other way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, laying on her two massive and soft mounds, Zelda watched breathlessly as her breasts grew even faster then ever. Soon they far surpassed even the impressive size of her castle and quickly grew to twice that size each!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so big now that her breasts nearly reached Hyrule Castle Town, which was now covered by the enormous shadow that her magnificent breasts cast across Hyrule. Many people of the town ran away from the ever expanding bosom of the princess. But they didn't all quite know that the wonderfully large, creamy flesh-like orbs belonged to their beloved princess. All they saw was two gargantuan spheres creeping up on their town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Zelda herself, she stayed laying on top of her own chest. All she could see around her was the expanse of her magically-enhanced boobs. The area of which seemed to stretch out far into the distance, and was still getting farther along as her breasts continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's breasts were now huge, really huge, round and perfect. They had long ago busted out of her usually elegant dress at the chest, leaving the princess fully clothed aside from the front of her dress. The rubble that had gathered on her breasts after bursting through the castle was long gone as well, having fallen off as her boobs swelled ever larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, goddesses, yes! Bigger!\" Zelda cried out with happiness at the sheer size of her chest. She was laying on top of her own gigantic breasts, the rest of her body tiny in comparison to the beautiful boobs, and she loved it! She hugged what she could grab of her breasts lovingly.</span></div></div>",

But then, she felt something land on top of her breasts, some meters away. She felt what felt like footsteps walking across her massive chest, but with their impressive size Zelda could not see who, or what, had joined her on top of her huge boobs. A few seconds later, she heard shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! Princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gasped as she recognized the voice as Impa's, her most trusted guardian. Sure enough, a few moments later Zelda saw the white-haired older woman climbing across her titflesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impa!?\" Zelda yelled. She knew that her guardian possessed powerful magic skills, but she never expected her to be able to stop her royal rack from growing even bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! I knew it was you! You should be ashamed of yourself!\" Impa shouted in her scolding tone. The impact of which was lessened by the older woman's constant wobbling as she tried to walk across the soft, bouncy flesh of Zelda's oversized tits. Zelda started to sweat and feel a little embarrassed as Impa made her way over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how many people you put at risk? Not to mention what this will do to your reputation, and your reign!? What in the world were you thinking!?\" Impa asked, clearly upset with the princess of Hyrule. Weighed down by her enormous bosom, Zelda had to look up at Impa as she talked. It made the princess feel even more embarrassed by the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Impa. They're magic! So of course I can still rule Hyrule like this!\" Zelda insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? Then you haven't just made the worst mistake of your life? Can you even move with these... monsters!?\" Impa asked, clearly not believing the princess's claim. Then again, when the most powerful person in all of Hyrule is laying on top of her own greatly enlarged breasts, seemingly immobile, and making such claims, it's hard to believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Watch me!\" Zelda said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa rolled her eyes at the princess, but kept quiet as she watched and waited for Zelda to prove her wrong. Zelda grunted and panted as she tried to shift her body. She shook herself backwards a number of times, as if she was trying to get her feet on the ground to walk. It seemed a fruitless effort, as even if Zelda did get her feet on the ground, how could she possibly walk around with such massive tits?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungh!\" Zelda grunted once more as she tried again.

The sun high above the fields casted it's great rays of light down upon the grassy terrain, as the clouds high above casually glided by. With Ganondorf's plan in conquering hyrule ultimately thwarted, mainly thanks to the heroic efforts of Link, tranquility flourished all throughout the kingdom. Despite the incredibly low presence of evil afoot throughout hyrule, princess Zelda was trapt within a current predicament that she so desperately tried to escape. The predicament? Boredom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything now at peace all throughout the kingdom, there really didn't seem to be any pressing matters that required her attention, ultimately leaving her with plenty of moments to spare. Yet this overabundance of free time caused her to grow restless. Surely there must've been something that could satisfy her stale lifestyle. As she was within her royal chambers, a sudden idea emerged within her head, an idea that could easily help with this boredom issue. If nothing in the real world could quench her restlessness, then maybe something in terms of magic would do the trick. Immediately, she began flipping through the pages of an old incantation book passed down through the royal family for any sort of spell that sounded interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmmm...now let's see.\" the royal princess muttered to herself while scanning through the old text. After looking through nearly thirty pages of spells, one quickly garnered her upmost attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"dragon alteration?\" she reads out the title with a raised eyebrow. The most she knew about dragons in hyrule were through children stories impa would tell her right before she went to sleep. Why on earth would there be a spell based on them in a spell book? Let alone one that originated from the royal family? After pondering for a few seconds, curiosity soon began to get the best of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...minus will give it a try.\" she tells herself while preparing to recite the incantation.</span></div></div>",

After five or six scans and countless repetitions done in her mind, she finally thinks she's ready to pull off the spell. With a stern yet commanding voice, she began to recite the ancient hyrulean language from within the old tome. As if joining the mystical spell, the book itself began to emit a bright blue aura about it's pages. After reciting the final word of the spell, a great blast of energy escapes from within the pages and dissipated around the room. After the sudden surprising experience, The royal princess looks about for any particular changes about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"strange...\" she mutters. \"did I say the wrong-\" within a fraction of a second, a sudden odd sensation began to emanate about her entire body. It was oddly a mixture of both pain and some form of ticklish sensation that spread all throughout from head to toe. \"w-w-what..\" Zelda mutters as she cringes from the growing feeling within her body. her body shook violently and shuddered as if it felt like many parts were being pulled about. After what seemed like a minute or two of the strange sensation, her eyes soon widen to realize that they were gazing straight down upon the floor of the room. \"w-w-what the!?\" She states in shock as she tries to adjust her head, only to have it bash up against a hard surface. \"owww...\" she groans as she instinctively raises her hand to rub her crown, yet strangely enough the feeling of her hand was completely different compared to before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could no longer feel the five digits adorned upon her hand that was her fingers, but rather that of four with a solid sharp object upon the tips. \"Huh!?\" immediately, Zelda brings her hand downwards only to gasp at shock at the sight before her. What was once her white gloved hand was now replaced by a large pink scaled claw. With her heart racing, she quickly lowers her head towards a fallen mirror only to spot the face of a dragon, or dragoness. \"I-is this me?\" she asks herself while gazing upon the reflection. There was no doubt about it, considering that the mouth of the dragon matched her words exactly. As she stares in awe and surprise upon the image, she notices that many traces of her hyrulean body were still intact. A long blonde mane was adorned right behind a row of two horns, as bright blue eyes gazed within the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...it worked!\" she shouts both in shock and pure excitement. As she hopped in her overall joy, her huge head suddenly ends up colliding with the ceiling once more causing a yelp to escape her mouth. \"owww...alright no doing that.\" she mutters to herself as the sudden sounds of knocking emanated outside the doorway. \"Princess Zelda!? are you alright?\" a familiar female voice asks from outside. 'oh no...Impa!' Zelda mutters with wide eyes. Just how will her loyal caretaker react seeing a massive dragoness before her?</span></div></div>",

She was really bored after sending Link back to his childhood and saving the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she began to practice her magic to relieve her boredom. This spell was supposed to increase the strength of her spells. But when she performed the spell, she began to emit a blue glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body began to feel warm, particularly around her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gasped suddenly. From under her fingers, she could feel her belly start to grow larger and tighter. Her eyes widened and she was stuck speechless. She felt her butt and it had began to grow too, as well as the space between her legs. Her back began to inflate and she started to round out, her legs and arms filling up slightly, but being pulled into her. Soon her cheeks swelled up, giving her face a chipmunk like look, though she could not blow the air or whatever it was filling her up out. Soon her body had become round and all it was doing was getting bigger,already passing the five foot mark, pulling her arms and legs in until only her feet, hands, and head were sticking out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda, though a little afraid, was actually very relaxed and facinatind with her current change. As she grew, she felt more and more free with the world. She closed her eyes and smiled, enjoying herself even more than she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite nice...\" said Blaze to herself. \"I'm just a... balloon now. I have no worries now.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a lovely evening outside and princess Zelda, the ruler of Hyrule, couldn't stay cooped up inside the whole night. So it was that she was out on the balcony to her room, reminiscing about her time with Link, the hero of time. She recalled that while they hadn't spent much time together, the time they did have was precious to her. Zelda sighed. She wished she could spend a little more time with him, but also knew that that was impossible since she had sent him back to the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Zelda got ready to hit the hay and went to sleep shortly after, turning in to bed wearing her usual nightgown. Once she lay down and fell asleep, something changed in the land of Hyrule that night. But the next day things were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda had slept soundly and peacefully through the night. She awoke to the sound of Cuccos crowing. She brushed her long, blonde hair out of her eyes and sat up on her bed to get ready for the day. But when she threw her covers off, Zelda was met with a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess gasped. She was shocked to find herself wearing a maid's uniform! At least, that's what she assumed it was. With it's black and white pattern and frilly design, the uniform didn't much resemble the ones her own maids usually wore. But somehow Zelda knew that it was meant to be worn by a maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this someone's idea of a joke?!</i> The princess wondered as she ran her hands across her new outfit. <i>It's in poor taste... How did they even get this on.. me..?</i> Zelda felt her face turn red. <i>Did they see me... naked!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Zelda groaned at the thought. Now she felt violated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess got up off her bed and paced around her room, trying to think of how this could happen. As she thought, she managed to catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror. She thought she looked ridiculous in her new outfit. Although it hugged her figure rather nicely, it was somehow also far too short!<br>\r\nShe thought that if she were to bend over even slightly, she'd be flashing her panties to anyone behind her. And every step she took made the frilly \"skirt\" of the uniform bounce up high, showing off her legs with every movement. The top of her uniform pushed her breasts up, giving her an ample cleavage, and the low cut design showed it off.<br>\r\nOne thing she hadn't noticed before was a cute little maid's cap adorning her head, seemingly put there to replace her princess's crown. But Zelda didn't think it was cute, she thought it was absurd, but somehow she couldn't bring herself to remove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to stare at herself in her highly sexualized maid's uniform, thinking it was ridiculous. Zelda tried to remain focused though, and figure out how this happened. She wondered how she could wake up in this outfit without knowing how it got on her, or where it came from. All she remembered from the night before was the time she spent on the balcony.<br>\r\nCould someone have really snuck into her room, removed her usual nightgown, put her in this base uniform, and then sneak off? Zelda shook her head, it wasn't likely, what with her guards stationed just outside her room at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. One of them must've seen something. Unless they really are playing some sort of prank on me!\" Zelda told herself. \"If that's the case, then I'd better have a talk with Impa about getting new ones! But first...\" Zelda looked down at her outfit with disgust. \"... I'd better change.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda went into her wardrobe, only to find all her clothing had changed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this!?\" She shouted to nobody in particular. She caught herself quickly though, and tried to keep a level head, but with all these strange things happening around her it wasn't easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

So she pulled off her clothes. At least, she tried to. When Zelda tried to remove her maid's uniform, she felt a small sting, and she had to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Zelda yelped. The sting didn't hurt her much at all, but she noticed that her dress had refused to budge when she tried to remove it from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda tried again, but was only met with the same results. It seemed that no matter where she pulled, her dress would \"sting\" her and almost refuse to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with this thing!?\" Zelda cried, now she started to get really worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't about to give up though, she knew now that more drastic measures should be taken if she wanted to be rid of this thing. Zelda went over to her nightstand and grabbed knife from inside, Impa had made her always keep one on hand. Zelda then tried to cut off her maid's uniform. But as soon as the knife made contact with the fabric Zelda felt that all-too-familiar \"sting\" in her hand. This time though, the strength of it had increased!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh!\" Zelda cried in pain, and dropped the knife. She rubbed her hand to try and alleviate some of the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So I can't take it off, and I can't cut it...</i> Zelda thought. She was now quite frustrated with this blasted maid's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I need help... Impa should know what to do!\" Zelda told herself, and nodded to herself to reassure herself that this was the way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hylian woman wanted to go out and find her faithful servant, but she then thought that she couldn't do it like this! If she went out in her maid's uniform now, she'd be humiliated! It was bad enough that she was stuck in it, she didn't need any to see her in it! Except for Impa, at least. So she needed to get someone else to get Impa for her. One of the guards in front of her bedroom should do the trick, Zelda thought.</span></div></div>",

So she went over to her bedroom door and opened it just a crack, just enough that she could poke her head out. She saw a guard standing by, she called to him, forgetting for a moment about the maid's cap on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you doing in there?\" The guard asked, sounding like he was interrogating her. He also looked confused, like he didn't understand why Zelda would be in her own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Zelda asked in response, taken back a bit by this guards callous question. \"Please, just get Impa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What's wrong?\" The guard asked, he made a move for the door. Zelda was worried he'd see her in her pitiful costume, so she cried out to try and stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I-It's something for her eyes only!\" She shouted quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard stopped in his tracks. He seemed hesitant, but he nodded. \"I'll call for her.\" He told Zelda, and then went off to find Impa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda closed the door and sighed. That didn't go exactly to plan, but Zelda had gotten Impa on her way up. Zelda slumped down beside the door and waited for Impa, she would explain everything the Shiekah woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, her bedroom door opened and Impa walked in. Zelda stood up to meet her servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impa, thank the goddesses!\" Zelda cried. She went to hug her friend, but Impa held out her arm, blocking Zelda. \"Wh-What..?\" Zelda asked, bewildered that Impa would do such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing!?\" Impa shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying? Impa! It's me! Zelda!\" Zelda cried. Impa just stood there, her arms folded, a clear sign that she was upset with Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know it's you, Zelda.\" Impa said impatiently. \"Don't tell me you called me here just to give me a hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you being like this?\" Zelda asked. She looked at Impa with pleading eyes. \"Can't you see I need your help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. What you need, is to leave the princess's room right this instant!\" Impa barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impa, please!\" Zelda cried. She motioned to her current state of dress. \"I woke up like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa didn't seem surprised by this though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wearing your uniform? Did you forget to change last night? No matter. I can't imagine what you were thinking coming in here with orders to!\" Impa's eyes narrowed. \"You weren't thinking of stealing from the princess, were you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Impa, I <b>am</b> the princess!\" Zelda insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa responded to Zelda's cries by slapping her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Zelda cried. She fell to the floor, and started to weep. She couldn't believe how Impa was acting, she'd rarely seen her so upset, and she'd never seen her act so cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you claim such a thing! Even in jest!\" Impa shouted. \"I don't train my maids and servants to act this way! You need to get your act together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was baffled. This whole ordeal was unbelievable. First she wakes up in a maid's uniform that she can't take off, then Impa comes and tells her that she isn't the princess anymore. Zelda's mind was rapt with emotions, she couldn't understand what was going on anymore. But something in her mind told her to keep quiet about being the princess, for now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?!\" Impa shouted, impatiently tapping her foot. She seemed to be waiting for Zelda's response, and excuse for her \"inexcusable\" actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda...</span></div></div>",

She knew she'd probably be considered insane if she kept rambling on about being the princess, Impa might even fire her, or worse! So Zelda had to keep quiet to avoid arousing more suspicion. Most of all though, she just didn't want to get slapped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" Zelda said softly. \"Please forgive me, I meant no disrespect. I don't know what's come over me myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, child.\" Impa said, her voice and gaze softening. Impa offered Zelda her hand, the former princess took it and Impa helped her up. \"I don't like being hard on my subordinates, but you have to promise me you'll be on your best behavior from now on, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you.\" Zelda nodded. She wiped her tears. She still tried to piece everything together in her mind, but right now she'd just play the subservient role she seemed to be meant to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Impa said. She went and opened the bedroom door, and ushered Zelda through. \"Come with me. Let's get you back to your duties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda did as she was told and followed Impa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Impa lead Zelda through the halls of the castle, the former princess started to understand this wasn't just some prank being played at her expense, something big must've changed overnight. Like all of Hyrule had suddenly accepted that she was not the princess anymore, and that she was now just a lowly maid. The changes in Impa's attitude towards her, and even the guards and castle staff she passed on the way seemed to confirm this. No one looked at her like she was the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the real kicker had been her waking up in her current maid's uniform. There was no way someone could've broke into her room in the middle of the night and changed her into it. She'd have woken up during the change, not to mention her many guards standing watch for intruders. Zelda suspected there was magic involved in this world-wide reversal of fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing she hadn't really considered until now was, if she's not the princess anymore, then who is? She had to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Miss Impa?\" Zelda asked meekly, not sure if it was her place to do so now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Impa is fine.\" Impa replied, sounding not too upset, much to Zelda's relief. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, Impa. Forgive me for asking...\" Zelda hesitated. She realized how strange this question was about to sound, but she just had to know. \"Um, who is the princess?\" She asked awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa stopped in her tracks. She faced Zelda and looked dumbfounded by the maid's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an asinine question!\" Impa yelled. Zelda flinched, worried she might get hit again. But Impa continued, with some restraint. \"The princess of Hyrule, whom you serve, I should probably remind you, is...\"</span></div></div>",

Well, a little trip to the Great Fairy's fountain to awaken her magic plus nightly visits to the castle's library to learn a certain role-reversal spell meant that she was now the Princess and Zelda was the maid; a fact made obvious by the fact that Abigail enchanted the maid's outfit to be irremovable. Chucking to herself, the new princess took another sip of wine, delighting in the other spells she had placed on the outfit....</span></div></div>",

Practically everything was a copy of her current outfit! She had come across different colours, such as a pink and white variant, and a black and pink variant, but nothing completely different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing aside a blue and white dress, which looked alright, Zelda let a cry of happiness. A familiar looking pink and white dress was crumpled up and thrown on the floor of the wardrobe. She hadn't seen it because the other outfits had been covering it slightly. Grabbing it, she pulled it out of the wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, I can get out of this ridiculous attire!\" Zelda said, pulling the outfit off. She threw it into the wardrobe before dressing herself in her own dress. However, as she placed the silver tiara on her head, her body began to feel strange...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at her reflection, her ample breasts ballooned. They quickly grew to the size of melons, ripping the top half of her dress apart within seconds. <br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\nHer new breasts were very firm, and very heavy. Crossing her arms angrily under her new bust, Zelda pulled the remnants of her dress away from her body. She looked back at her wardrobe, sighing as she did. At least she had a little colour to choose from...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter deciding to put the blue and white one on, Zelda headed back to the mirror. Her breasts were still huge, and yet, her outfit had grown to accommodate her new breasts. Heck, they looked even bigger in her new outfit, being pushed up and shown off. And when she walked, they bounced and rippled... She hated it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to fix this!\" She finally said, trying to stop her breasts from bouncing. \"But how?

Just as the Hylian princess accepted her demise, however, she noticed her falling speed slowing to a leisurely float. \"Oh, of course!\" Zelda exclaimed, putting it together. Being smaller than dust, gravity seemed to have less of an effect on her, so the horror of becoming a minuscule blood stain on the floor was alleviated. \"Well, I guess being this small isn't <i>all</i> bad,\" she muttered, right before a massive being rammed into her like a horse to a gnat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a timely reaction, the tiny Hylian was compressed onto a fleshy wall due to the force of impact and the wind swirling around her.

That musky, manly smell, his sexy, handsome face staring down at her as his quivering member made her shake...it was all too much for Zelda. Her hands flew back to her pussy as she began fingering herself again. With her other hand, Zelda rubbed her breasts together, mashing the slimy, white fluid as if it were bath oils. She also ran her fingers through her hair as she masturbated again, working it through her long, blond hair as if it were shampoo! At last, Zelda came again. Looking down, she saw her own cum spurt out as she shuddered with pleasure, mixing with Link's. <i>But...it's such a miniscule amount,</i> she thought to herself. Just a drop in a bucket, punctuating how insignificant she was atop this mountain of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goddesses, I could just lay here and watch you do that all day,\" Link muttered, his voice rumbling in Zelda's ears. \"But what kind of hero would I be if I didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Zelda found herself being plucked off Link's crotch, zooming away from his throbbing manhood. Trails of his semen trailed below her as Link carried her to some unknown destination. When Zelda looked up, she saw the tip of a water bottle. Link was about to douse her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LINK!? What're you...\" Zelda's protests were cut off when, from her perspective, gallons and gallons of water rushed over her, washing away most of Link's seed. It lasted only a moment, but Zelda was soaked to the bone, and no longer in the way she relished. She collapsed into the palm of Link's hands. arms crossed and shivering. \"L-L-L-Link, w-w-w-what was T-T-T-THAT for!?\" she demanded, feeling as if her limbs would freeze off. Zelda tried to sound regal, but knew it was futile with how squeaky her voice must now seem to Link. And while squatting and shivering, naked in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, a little cold, are you?\" Link asked coyly. \"THIS should warm you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Zelda watched in awe as Link's huge face zoomed closer at breakneck speed, his mouth open. Zelda shuddered all over again as she felt Link's tongue sweep over her. Indeed, this was warming her back up plenty fast, and the way the tip of his tongue often lingered over her breasts, teasing them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between licks, Zelda thrust herself up at Link's lips, lost in ecstasy. She grabbed as much of his lips as she could to kiss him back. Zelda felt her body shake from a chuckle she elicited, so she knew Link felt her miniscule attempts to return his affections. His hot breath washing over her, that tongue of his working its magic... In no time at all, Zelda felt herself being reduced in a different way: being made a quivering puddle of woman in the palm of her hero's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was all BEFORE Link focused the tip of his tongue over her womanhood! Zelda's eyes bulged out again as Link began teasing her in the most intimate ways yet. <i>Forget ME making Link want to keep me tiny! I'd gladly be his little woman FOREVER! </i>was perhaps the only coherent thought that could form in Zelda's head. Her entire body was ablaze with passion and pleasure. Her hands gripped the sides of his fingers to stabilize herself, and practically thrust herself up to give Link better access. The feel of his skin, his warmth, and OH GODDESSES that tongue probing her pussy like there was no tomorrow! Zelda couldn't keep herself from letting out high-pitched moans, which seemed to egg Link on even more, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda had her most mind-blowing orgasm yet as she splattered out her juices right onto Link's tongue. He took a moment to savor the taste, but then pressed on, driving her to orgasm again.

So she went to take a seat on the barrel, but she didn't quite sit right on the fragile thing and it toppled over, causing Ilia to fall over. When Ilia had accidentally knocked the barrel over, Zelda had to react quickly and run out of the way. Zelda then felt the ground shake as Ilia fell to the floor with a loud thump. The giantess had fallen right in front of her, Zelda was right in her line of sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Ilia winced, more from the surprise of falling than the minimal pain she felt. \"I should be more careful aroun-\" Ilia stopped in mid sentence, when she noticed a tiny person staring at her, frozen in what seemed to be a mix of fear and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda had to think fast, all her hopes of escaping quietly were now gone, so she quickly came up with another plan. She summoned her magic powers and cast a spell. Magic energy gathered in the room forming a large ball of concentrated magic. The ball then burst into smaller sparks that landed on both girls, Zelda wasn't sure if that was supposed to happen, but then...</span></div></div>",

Then, the spell's effects took place, and Ilia immediately started to shrink, but at a much faster pace than the Princess did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! What was that!?\" Ilia shouted, trying to wipe away the magic sparks from her face. She then got a good look at the tiny being in front of her. \"P-Princess Zelda? Is that you!? How did you get so small? W-Wait, are you getting bigger..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ilia, I'm sorry!\" Zelda cried up at the shrinking giantess. \"I didn't have a choice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Princess?\" Ilia asked, slowly getting to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was standing again, Ilia could see that it wasn't just the Princess that was growing, everything in the house seemed to be getting bigger and bigger! Or was she shrinking? Well, with Zelda's tiny form right in front of her, Ilia quickly connected the dots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, are you shrinking me!?\" Ilia asked, upset, but trying to give the tiny Princess the benefit of the doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Zelda nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia, now only about two-thirds her normal height and still shrinking, snatched up the shrunken Princess. \"Why would you do something like that!?\" She asked her tiny captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I couldn't let you find out about us...\" Zelda quickly answered, but realized her mistake too soon. \"Um, What I mean to say is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us!?\" Ilia shouted, now really upset. \"You mean... You and Link!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was cornered now, and she knew it. She couldn't believe she'd let that slip so easily, there wasn't anything she could say to get out of this now. She'd just have to tell the truth. But she could feel Ilia's hand grow smaller and smaller, and she thought that once Ilia was down to her size, she might be able to make her escape after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's true. We've been coming to this house quite often recently. I shrunk you so you wouldn't be able to tell anyone!\" Zelda said, she'd tell Ilia everything now the giantess was only around half her normal height. But Zelda winced in pain when Ilia tightened her grip around the tiny Princess. \"Ilia, P-Please!\" Zelda cried. Ilia scowled at Zelda, but loosened her grip anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you and him have been going up to this little shack and... Oh, goddess!\" Ilia grimaced at the thought. \"But that still doesn't explain how you got so small. Don't tell me you did this to yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I did.\" Zelda said in a quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Ilia asked, before remembering her own shrinking. \"Wait a minute, Am I going to get as small as you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, that's the plan.\" Zelda said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Was all Ilia could say as she noticed that Zelda didn't quite fit in her hand anymore, and she had to let the Princess down. Zelda watched as Ilia continued to shrink, clothes and all down to her own height of six inches tall. Ilia was shocked by how huge everything had become, especially Zelda, it was strange to see eye to eye with the woman she had held in her hand just moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda could see that Ilia was still in awe of her surroundings, and thought now would be a good time to make her escape. She'd have to deal with Ilia later. Zelda had her chance and...</span></div></div>",

She rests her arm down on it and leans back. Pushing the box back ever so slightly to her, but to Zelda and Ilia behind it, it was enough to knock them both forward to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, this'll be a real nice place to store some stuff.\" Hena says. \"But, It's a bit of mess right now. Whoever was here before didn't take much care of it, look that barrel's knocked over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena then walked up to the displaced barrel and straightened it up, and rested her fishing rod on its side. The box that Zelda and Ilia were hiding behind was right next to the barrel, and the two shrunken girls were getting nervous about being discovered by Hena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to find us...\" Zelda says, thinking out loud. \"I have to shrink her before that happens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda, wait!\" Ilia shouts, putting her hand on the Princess. \"I really think we should wait before doing anyth-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda cuts Ilia off with a glare of her own, and shrugs her off, saying, \"She's about to come our way, we don't have time to wait!\" Zelda insists and starts chanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda casts the shrinking spell again, this time at Hena, who was still cleaning off some other things in the house. The little magic show started up again and the sparks flew at Hena's leg. The giantess felt something hit her leg, and she scratched it, but other than that payed it no mind and went back to cleaning up the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Ilia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on...\" Zelda said. \"I've used the full power of the spell this time, so it should take a moment to begin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Hena was began showing signs of shrinking, she started becoming smaller and smaller. The two shrunken girls peered out from their cover as they watched the giantess rapidly shrink down to their size. Withtin seconds, Hena went from a towering giantess, to Zelda and Ilia at least, to a tiny six inch tall woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena herself didn't have much time to react though. For her, one moment she was simply minding her own business, cleaning up her new storage house, and the next, she was staring way up at her fishing rod! It seemed almost as big as Hyrule castle from her point of view! Hena's first instinct was to scream, and she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Zelda, look what you've done! The poor woman's terrified!\" Ilia scolded the Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Zelda said. Truthfully she felt sort of bad about shrinking Hena, unlike when she shrank Ilia, she thought she may have jumped the gun this time. \"Maybe we should check on her...\" Zelda said. \"Then again, maybe she'll faint from surprise, she seems like the type...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to her!

With her extensive knowledge of the worlds of both light and the twilight, she thought that it might be some kind of twili relic. But looking at it now, it just seemed like any old mirror. When suddenly, the mirror shone a bright light! Ashei was so surprised by this, she nearly dropped the mirror fragment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the twilight realm, Midna was taking a break. She was by herself at the transport between her world and the light world, now cut off from the other side, reminiscing of her journey with Link. She often wished she could go back, she enjoyed her life as ruler of the twili, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how he's doing now?\" Midna thought, when suddenly she saw the gate between worlds light up, and was shocked, but intrigued. \"How can this be?\" She wondered. Then she thought that this could be her chance to go back and see Link, at least one more time. Without even really thinking about it, Midna stepped onto the transport, where she was whisked away, taken back to the world of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the house, Ashei was examining the mirror. Then the light started to shine even brighter, she had to put it down on the table and cover her eyes. When she recovered her vision, she saw a tiny figure, like a six inch tall woman, standing on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Ashei asked, rather calm about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna meanwhile was in no condition to answer her. She had basically been on auto-pilot during her travel between worlds, and now that she was back in Hyrule, she finally had control over herself again. But with the first thing she saw after coming through the mirror being a giantess, Midna was understandably speechless. The initial shock only lasted a couple more seconds before she finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, My name is Midna. Who are you?\" Midna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashei.\" Ashei said. \"Did you come from the mirror?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirror? You mean the mirror of twilight?\" Midna asked, and turned around looking for it. What she found, of course, was a small fragment of mirror, about the same size she currently was, behind her. She rushed to it. \"Oh no! The mirror, it's still broken!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still broken?\" Ashei wondered about what Midna had said, and quickly put it all together. \"I see, you must be a Twili, and that piece of mirror was how you travel between worlds of twilight and light. Isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna looked up at Ashei, very upset, and started to rant, \"Yeah, that's right. I was the one who broke it in the first place, but you somehow found one didn't you, and then what, tried to go through? Honestly, I thought that it was Link who had repaired the mirror to it's former glory, again. That's the reason I went through the gate in my in the first place! But what do I find when I come all the way back where? A tiny little fragment of mirror, which resulted in my current tiny little form you see now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei waited as patiently as she could muster for the shrunken twili to finish her little rant before speaking herself, \"... So that's what happened to you, I see. But you were wrong about one thing, I didn't try to go through that fragment, I don't know how it activated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But then...\" Midna paused. \"... There must be some other magic force in this room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three shrunken ladies down behind the box heard the whole thing.

And up on the table Midna was the only one not effected by the spell, since she was all the way up on the table she was out of the magic's blastzone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft, why am I not surprised, they can't even handle their magic! Or do they intend to put on show for their big hero? Ha!\" Midna thought, she was glad she wasn't down there right now. She then shouted out to Link, \"Link, listen! What we should do is...\" She stopped mid-sentence when she saw the hero's expression, he was looking away from the tiny girls on the floor and his face was beet red. Which she might have expected, but was that blood running down his nose? \"Link!\" She shouted at him, even louder this time. \"Get focused, you're supposed to be our hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink heard Midna's scolding this time, and almost immediately straightened up, he wiped the blood from his nose. And finally spoke, \"Right. I got you Midna, we should get the girls something to wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure. After that we can talk about restoring my size!\" Midna yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, it's a good thing I helped that merchant!

Zelda had to keep the others attention of her, that was best, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please listen to me!\" Zelda said. \"What we need to do now is focus on getting back to normal, now my magic is acting funny at the moment so we need-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To know just what you were thinking, shrinking us all.\" Ashei cut off the Princess. \"Why would do such a thing?

One of which was already up, sitting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally up?\" Ilia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ilia.\" Zelda said. \"Good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as good as last night, though!\" Ilia said. \"I almost thought it was all a dream, but here we are. Still so small after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena got up next. The two awake girls watched her as slowly stood up, she found it somewhat hard to balance on Link's chest, which gently moved up and down with each breath. She rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and looked over at Link's face. A light seemed to turn on in Hena's mind just before she shouted at the top of her lungs! She ran off of Link's body and down to the floor, then further still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda and Ilia looked at each other, wondering what was wrong with the fisherwoman. They decided to follow her down. Hena had stopped just in front of the huge front door of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hena, what's the matter?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena quickly jolted around to face her, \"I-It wasn't a dream! He's really there, and really big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she was thinking the same thing I was!\" Ilia laughed. \"Don't worry, Hena. There's nothing to be afraid or ashamed of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena heard her and calmed down a bit. \"Oh... I was just so, so... Heh, I don't even know what I was!\" She said, now much more relaxed. \"It's just, I haven't seen Link in awhile and I recently started to have dreams...\" Hena stopped when she found herself blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, Princess!\" Midna shouted, who had apparently gotten up and followed them. \"It's been so long. I know you've probably been dying to see me, but to go through all this trouble? I'm flattered!\" Midna joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! It is nice to see you again, Midna.\" Zelda tells her friend. \"I just wish we could have met in more normal circumstances. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, Princess.\" Midna said, putting her hand on the Princess's shoulder. \"I was basically shrunk by Zant when we took over the twilight realm, so I guess I'm used to it. I'm just glad I got to keep my true body this time!\" She laughed. Zelda softly chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so we're all still small.\" Ashei says as she finally wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashei, you're up!\" Hena said. \"And you're right. Are you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay.\" Ashei said. \"Now, Princess, I believe this was your doing wasn't it? As much as I enjoyed being with Link before, I'd like to get back to normal height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course.\" Zelda said, no longer worried about her secret getting out. After all, things had spiraled out of her control a long time ago. She knew it was better just to go with the flow for now. \"Maybe I can try another spell?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\" Midna said, immediately rejecting the Princess's plan. \"From what I can tell, your magic has been off since I got here. I don't think it would be too smart to try using it again. Unless you're absolutely sure that it'll work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I see your point, Midna.\" Zelda said. \"But, I'm sure that now I've had a rest, I can cast a spell just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna threw her hands up. \"Fine. But leave me out of it! I don't want to see how it malfunctions this time!\" The tiny twili then walked off, back towards Link's still slumbering body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Maybe I should wait...\" Zelda thought. But in the end...</span></div></div>",

Oh, and also the growth spell that didn't exactly work right, but I still don't understand why that would affect my magic so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would think not much, wouldn't you?\" Midna asked, approaching the girls again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midna, you're back!\" Zelda said. \"You don't have anything to worry about now, my magic isn't working at all at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But honestly, I'm disappointed. At least if you could still cast spells, you're magic would still be working.\" Midna explained. \"But as it is now, you're completely drained of any magic powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what's going on, Midna?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as a matter of fact...\" Midna began.</span></div></div>",

Causing the portal between the light and twilight worlds to open, which is strange because the mirror shouldn't have worked at all, since it's all broken up. It's also how I ended up this small...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My magic caused all that?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible.\" Midna explained. \"And if I'm right and this all was because of that magical reaction, then the only why to get your magic back is to find all the pieces of the mirror, again, and then I can get back...\" Midna paused. \"I mean, Zelda's magic will work again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it, huh?\" A big voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken women all looked up and saw Link standing there, nude and all. He was holding the twilight mirror's shard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get the mirror back together again.\" Link said. \"Well, we've done it before! And besides, it's not like there's 100 pieces to find, I'm sure we can do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all looked at each and at Link and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Link went to his clothes and put the mirror shard in his hat, which he then put on his head. He handed the girls the little outfits he got from the merchant, except for Midna, he just gave her back her clothes from on the table, and then got fully dressed himself. When he was done, he looked down at the girls and saw them all in their new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the clothes they wore were meant for dolls for kids, and they were almost like costumes on the shrunken girls. Zelda had a cute little princess costume, it came with a little crown. Ilia wore a cowboy one, now a cowgirl outfit on her. Ashei had a soldiers uniform on, which she liked but was disappointed by the lack of a miniature sword. And Hena wore the only outfit left for her, a tiny little bikini, she wasn't too happy to be stuck with it, but wore it confidently anyways. The clothes they had were meant for dolls with bodies slightly smaller than the girls six inch forms, so they were ever so slightly tight on their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good.\" Link said to the girls. \"Are you all ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" They said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink grabbed them all up and gently deposited them inside his pocket. But Midna insisted on riding on his shoulder, like the old times she told him, and he allowed her to do so. Now that everyone was ready, the group left the house and started their journey!</span></div></div>",

I never thought I would be this tiny out side that house,\" Zelda says as she looks at the sights.

I believe she is able to sense where the mirror shards are,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. I thought it would take forever to find these things,\" Henda sighs in relief and starts to loosen up more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope we can get the shards easily,\" Ashie adds as she remembers that Link had a hard time to find the shards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I let's hope,\" Zelda says as she hopes this will be fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Link and Midna the two continues to walk until Midna since a shard of the mirror.

Then he saw the bug princess herself, by the tree, with her bugs around her. Agitha was tending to her precious bug when she heard footsteps, she turned to face whoever it was. A big smile appeared on her face when she saw that it was Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, grasshopper, you're back!\" Agitha said. \"Did you find another little darling for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Agitha. Not this time.\" Link explained. \"I was actually hoping you might have something for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, grasshopper?\" Agitha asked. \"Why, of course! I'd love to help, after all, you did bring me all the guests for my ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I was interested in this thing right here.\" Link said, pointing to the mirror piece that Agitha had framed up on her wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this?\" Agitha asked, taking the mirror shard down. \"I found it the other day while looking for my little darlings. I don't what it is, but I thought it looked pretty. But if want it, you can have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Agitha.\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgitha was about to hand over the mirror shard, but then she spotted Midna on Link's shoulder. The tiny twili looked like a little insect to the bug princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! Is that a new bug for me?\" Agitha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bug!? How rude!\" Midna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It talks!\" Agitha exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna sighed. \"Look, kid. I'm not a bug, I'm a... I'm just small, is all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink laughed at the Midna being mistaken some kind of bug. \"Sorry, Agitha. I don't think this one'll fit in your collection!\" Link joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's too bad...\" Agitha said, disappointed. Then, she saw a little head poking out of Link's pocket. \"Is that another 'not bug' in your pocket? Can I see it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sighed. The girls' cover was blown. \"Uh, sure thing.\" He said, and gently scooped the four shrunken girls out of his pocket, and held them in his hand for Agitha to see. Agitha's eyes widdened when she saw that they really weren't bug after all, they were tiny little people. And it seemed like they were arguing about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to stay down!\" Ilia shouted at Hena. \"I told you she'd see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I just wanted to see the bug girl is all!\" Hena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" Agitha exclaimed. \"They're like little wingless fairies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Agitha, you've seen them.\" Link said. \"Now can I please have the shard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgitha looked up at the hero, then at the shard, then back up at Link. She then pocketed the shard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to play!\" Agitha exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Agitha, we had a deal!\" Link shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have your 'not bugs' play with my real bugs!\" Agitha said. \"Please, grasshopper! Afterwards I'll give you the shiny thing you want, so please play with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an unruly child!\" Midna said under her breath, so only Link would hear. \"I can't believe she would hold the mirror shard ransom like this! I say we just take it by force!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sighed, this was getting out of hand. He just needed to get that piece of mirror from Agitha somehow, but he wouldn't try to take the mirror shard by force, like Midna suggested, he did need to get it though. Maybe he should just play along with Agitha for now. But he could tell by looking at them, that the shrunken women didn't want to play any games with this little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink decides to...</span></div></div>",

Darn, and in the middle of the race, no less!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I just want it to stop!\" Hena cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few seconds after Hena said that, the girls' shrinking slowed to a stop. Zelda estimated them all to be about an inch tall! Their clothes now once again too big for the girls, they all stepped out of them and stood in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink watched from above as the girls shrank even smaller. He was relieved that they didn't shrink out of existence, but they were all so much smaller now. It would be that much more difficult for them to win the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgitha meanwhile, was quite happy by this turn of events. Her childlike innocence meant she didn't think that the girls were really in any trouble, she just wanted her bugs to win. The girls were really in no condition to continue the race, but they knew the mirror shard was on the line right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan they get themselves together to win the race in time?</span></div></div>",

Zelda blushes too until she sees what Midna is doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wining this race. Midan says as she holds the two forward.

It's getting late and you ladies must be tiered,\" Link explains to the shrunken women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

The rest of the women get on Link's palm and the young man blushes as he feels their bodies as they sat down lie down on their stomachs. Link then slowly moves his hand and slowly and gently puts the one inch women in his pocket. After making sure they are safe, Link decides to check what the mirror shard looks like and notice that the mirror shard is only one inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could the mirror be the reason they got smaller?\" Link thought as he puts the new piece of mirror with the other one. Link then walks out of Agitha's castle and goes to the local inn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we became smaller then we were,\" Hena sadly says as lies down from all of that running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think happen to make us smaller?\" Ashei asks as she is wondering why they became smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't think of anything.

The country women blush for a moment with Zelda and the rest of the women listening to her babbling to her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... We only change size when we were near that mirror shard that Agitha had. So I was just thinking that maybe that the shards could affect our height,\" Ilia explains her thoughts to the other women. Zelda and Midna both look at each and then back to Ilia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you may be right Ilia. That's the only explanation at why we would shrink again,\" Zelda says while smiling at the country women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our only real explanation. But it's good for now,\" Midna says with a smiles proud for the country women able to think of an explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks,\" Ilia says with her face red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if LInk found a room yet?\" Ashei ask herself as she wants to take a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't take that long,\" Hena says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Link to find the inn, he is able to go in and pay for a room and told the staff to not enter his room. The staff agrees as they want to give the hero of the land some private time in his own room. LInk enters his room notice that he had a bed, a book shelf, a table and a small dinning area. Link then notices that there is a door, the young man opens it and sees that it's the bathroom with a sink, toilet and a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it will be good time to get the ladies out,\" Link thought as he lowers his hand into this pocket and then softly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're at the hotel. We're in our room's bath room now, I figure you would like to take a bath first,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then feels the tiny women's bodies on his hand they get on. Link slowly lifts them out of the pocket and puts his hand the sink. The tiny women are in awe as they look around the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really hard to imagine that I would be in awe for a bathroom,\" Hena says as she looks around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree,\" Ilia says with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink is able to find a small enough bowl for the women to use for a bath. He breaks a piece of soap for each ladies and gives them a hand towel to dry them selves. Link is close enough to hear what Zelda had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much Link. We'll be taking our bath now,\" Zelda says with a smiles as she gets in the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you take a bath your self. You might as well use that tub,\" Midan says as she gets in the bowl with Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, Zelda, Ilia, and Hena were about to say somthing but also remember they made love yesterday. Midna and Ashei didn't really care if they took a bath close to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny women watch as Link strip out of his clothes and get into the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very nice show we're getting,\" Midna says with a smile as she watches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we could take a bath with him...\" Ilia says to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to make love again. But then again I do too,\" Hena says with a blush on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know. We could grow at random as well,\" Ashei says to lighten up her friends spirit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sighs as she looks at their big hero.

And this time, Ashei was feeling it too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, I think it's happening again!\" Zelda cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, we're getting even smaller!\" Midna shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's happening to me too!\" Ashei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink could nothing but watch as the women shrunk again. It happened so fast, Zelda, Midna and Ashei were almost instantly shrunk down again. Before, Zelda and Midna could just barely fit into their doll clothes, but now, even the doll outfits were far too big for them! They had shrunk more than Ashei did, they were now only an inch tall yet again! Ashei on the other hand, shrunk to the size Zelda and Midna were just at, three inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's looks like it's stopped for now...\" Zelda said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all okay?\" Link asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright.\" Ashei was the first to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine, I think.\" Midna said. \"We're just smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good!\" Link said. \"But I'm sorry, Midna, I don't think I can keep you on my shoulder like before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I thought you'd say something like that...\" Midna pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Link!\" Zelda shouted. \"It's probably best that we stay in your pocket anyway, at this size there are too many things that are dangerous to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded and carefully put the smaller women into his pocket again. All he, and the girls, wanted to do now was find the mirror shard and get out of this dungeon...</span></div></div>",

But this one was far smaller than any others he had seen so far, it was so small he barely noticed it at first, but the rest of this room's walls were flat and smooth, so it stood out to him. He still didn't think much of it, but decided to take a closer look anyways.<br>\r\nHe went over to the hole and examined it. It was definitely much smaller than the others, he doubted even Zelda or Midna, the two smallest girls at the moment, could fit into it. They'd need to be about a fourth of their size to get in, at the least! He wanted to get the girls' opinions. So he took them out of his pocket, being extra careful with Zelda and Midna, and placed the shrunken girls on a small ledge right in front of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you all think about this little hole here?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Zelda pondered. \"It's even smaller than Midna and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't think that even we'll be able to fit inside it, Princess.\" Midna added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think there's something special about this hole, Link?\" Ilia asked. \"Like there might be switch inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think so.\" Link answered. \"After all, there's nothing else in this room.

In such a unique position?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, now that you mention it...\" Link replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost like...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone continues to watch as Zelda shrinks to even smaller heights. The Princess is looking up at everyone else at the same time. From her point of view they all look to be growing, of course, she knows it's just her that's getting smaller. Link already was a giant to her, even moreso after she shrunk again twice before, and during her most recent shrinking, he seemed to be quadrupling in size! Even Midna, the closest to the ever shrinking Princess, and also closest to her size, was starting to look like a giant, Zelda only came up to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Zelda looked at the hole, she was at least relieved that she was able to enter it now, she'd have to go in and lower the mirror shard's protection from in there, she was the only one small enough to do so, after all. She was ready to do her best, and hopefully, open the way to the mirror shard. The tinier Princess started to walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm going in!\" Zelda shouted, she wondered if Link could even hear her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna could hear her at least, she replied with, \"Princess! You're still shrinking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Zelda hadn't immediately noticed that her shrinking hadn't ended yet. She just wanted to get in the hole and do what she had to, as a result, it didn't really occur to her that her shrinking hadn't stopped yet.<br>\r\nBut as Zelda looked around again, she saw the world around continuing to grow, and knew that Midna was right. She was still shrinking! Zelda was panicked now, she looked at her twili companion. Midna's knees, which she was equal in size with before, were now far above her head, and still the Princess shrunk. Most shocking of all to the Princess, was Link. He had seemed to quadruple in size before, and with a sudden burst of shrinking, he had quadrupled in size again! His form was unbelievably massive to Zelda, his face covered her entire view.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, everyone watched as Zelda continued to shrink even smaller. They were all shocked by this, they'd never expected the Princess to get so small, they all wondered when it stop. Just as it seemed like it would never end, Zelda's shrinking suddenly stopped. Everyone sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness...\" Hena said, she was six inches tall and Zelda looked like a speck, even at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How awful...\" Ashei softly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda, are you okay!?\" Midna asked, worried for the Princess' safety at her newest and smallest size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stared up at Midna in awe. She knew the tiny twili was only an inch tall, but at her size, Midna appeared to be more like 50 feet tall! The size difference boggled her mind. Then, Midna crouched down and got closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry this happened.\" Midna whispered. \"I can't imagine what it's like to be so small...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midna.\" Link said, his voice was amplified to the tinier Princess, it was much louder, but not enough to hurt her elf-like ears. \"Can you pick her up? I can't see her from here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna nodded at the giant. Zelda said nothing, she knew Link wouldn't be able to hear her anyway. And so she just let Midna pick her up. She was held in the twili's hand and presented to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no..!\" Link cried. Zelda was a speck to him and there wasn't anything he could do about it, he guessed her current height to be about 1/16th of inch tall. \"This is terrible, I can barely see her! She just looks like a little speck on your hand, Midna... No, even smaller than that..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Link say that made Zelda truly feel how small she now was. But in the back of her mind, she knew she still had something that only she could do. That only question was, is she up for it?</span></div></div>",

Then other girls also congratulated her on a job well done.

She didn't care if Link could hear her or not, she just wanted to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink didn't hear her at all, of course, not even a little squeak. But Midna did, so she helped out the very tiny Princess, \"Zelda says thank you, Link.\" She shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink smiled, \"Of course!\" He said. \"But Midna, now that we've got the shard, shouldn't that have some effect on you guys' sizes?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily.\" Midna answered. \"The mirror probably was what caused us to shrink again, but the effects are random it seems. Sporadic. I don't think anyone can really say for sure when our sizes will change again, and if we'll be growing... Or shrinking.\" Midna hesitated to say that last part, she thought of how awful it was for Zelda at her current size, even if the tiny Princess didn't want to show it, and how much more terrible it would be for her if she shrank again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Link said. \"We'll just have to wait and see then...\" Link took a moment to pause before continuing, as if he was waiting to see if anything really did happen. \"Well anyway, it would probably be best to get out of this temple as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Ashei chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't want to be in here any longer then I have to.\" Ilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then let's get going.\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink grabbed the girls and put them back into his pocket, all except for Midna and Zelda.

So she, and the other shrunken women, couldn't figure out how they were getting around Hyrule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Link had set off for Lake Hylia to get the next shard. It was getting late though. Luckily Midna had sensed the shard the lake, it was next to the minish temple so it wouldn't take too long to get to. Link thought that if the shard were any farther, then he'd have to take a break at castle town for the night, but this way everything worked out nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey there was...</span></div></div>",

Rollgoal was a simple game. All the player had to do to win was roll the ball inside the course from point A to point B, this was accomplished by tilting the board to roll the ball around, hence the name \"Rollgoal\". \"I came up with it myself!\" Hena proudly exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very interesting.\" Ashei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, It seems like fun.\" Ilia agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit, I'd probably want to play it too, if I wasn't so small.\" Midna said.

But the concept of this \"Rollgoal\" was alien to her, she wasn't sure that she could do it at first. Then she watched the way Ilia played the game very intently, and picked up a few things from seeing her play. And now it was her turn to try, and so far, she was doing well. The ball was easy to control, she found. Although her hands were shaking under the pressure, which was unlike her. Soon though, she had the ball almost at the end. But just before it made its way to the goal, Ashei's shaking hands twitched the wrong way and the ball fell off of the course, costing Ashei the game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, sorry!\" Hena said. \"You've lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei was upset at her loss, she couldn't believe she had messed up.

Time to take it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I..\" Ashei tried to protest, but stopped herself. She did know the rules, and had to follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it sexy!\" Midna hollers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Ashei's face becomes beet red after hearing the twili. Midna laughed at her shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wasn't it enough to strip?</i> she thought, taking Midna's overzealous shouts as a new rule that she must adhere to. As an adventurer herself, Ashei didn't really know how to act in such a way. She did however come up with a way to keep herself clothed. Reaching down, the three inch tall woman simply removed her little doll shoes and tossed them aside, one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena laughed at Ashei's attempt to keep herself modest. There wasn't anything against it in the rules after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boo!\" Midna shouted playfully. \"She didn't even try..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might be getting too excited for this..\" Zelda said.

Hmm, in that case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena got the Rollgoal board and then, she handed the board over to Ilia, so the country girl could make a new course and told her to make the next one as well. This way it would be more fair, because Hena couldn't make it easier for herself if she was to go next. Ilia made her course, she hoped it would be hard enough for Hena, and handed it back to the fisherwoman. Hena smiled and took the board, then she looked up at Link, who had been strangely quite for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's just us left.\" Hena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded, and then...</span></div></div>",

Wake up Princess!\" Midna says to the sleeping Princess. Zelda begins to stir and sees that she could now see eye to eye with Midna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midna!\" Zelda shouts as the princess gets up. Zelda hopes that she grew to one inch tall again but notice that she didn't get bigger, it was Midna who got smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to burst your bubble princess,\" Midna says looking a sad for Zelda hopes getting crush. \"We need to some help. I think some one is up,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right. I think Link is sending us some help right now,\" Zelda  says as the princess points to the sky. Midna looks up and sees Link's gigantic face. The tinier twili is glad that Link notice that she went missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two 1/16th of inch tall girls get up but are having trouble standing up as they felt the ground beneath them start to shake. Zelda and Midna both see the three inch tall Ashei is getting closer to them. Midna is surprise that even Ashei look like a giant now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get her attention,\" Zelda says to the twili. \"Ashei! Ashei! We're down here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We're down here!\" Midna joins the princess in yelling for the larger woman's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei...... </span></div></div>",

Both girls were now 1/16 of an inch tall, they appeared to the warrior as mere inches tall, even though she herself was only 3 inches tall. The warrior bent down to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess. Midna.\" Ashei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank the goddesses you heard us!\" Zelda cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, unfortunately It seems I've shrunken some more in the night..\" Midna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they all heard Link's much louder voice ask, \"Ashei? Did you find them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei picked up Zelda and Midna, and then held them up for Link to see. Link has to move in closer to even see the incredibly tiny speck sized women and even then, he has to squint just to make out any details on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midna... Zelda, too...\" Link whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna was awestruck by just how huge Link was to her. If Ashei was a giant to the tiny twili, then Link was a giga giant, about ten times bigger than the fisherwoman! She couldn't believe how small this size really was, but seeing Link gave her a good reminder of just how insignificant she now was. It was enough to break her formally calm demeanor, if only by a little bit. The tiny twili was now shaking a little from it all. She turned to Zelda and was surprised with how well the Princess had taken being reduced to this size, especially for so as long as she was so small, the Princess must be much braver than she thought.<br>\r\nZelda was reluctantly getting used to her size though, so it didn't bother her as much. It did still amaze the Princess though, and she was caught staring up at Link's massive form just like Midna was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't... This is just, so much..!\" Midna muttered, her expression now one of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda noticed her friend was scared, so she put her hand on the twili and smiled at her, \"Don't worry. We'll get out of this, Link will save us, just like he always does.\" She said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... You're right.\" Midna said, calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look.\" Zelda said, pointing at Link's gigantic face far above. \"Link's just as worried. So we need to keep calm for him, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna nodded silently. But her resolve showed itself, the tiny twili was back to her normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him we're okay!\" Zelda shouted, loud as she could at Ashei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei nodded at the tiny Princess and shouted to Link, \"They say that they're okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sighed in relief upon hearing those words. \"That's good.\" He said. \"Ashei, can you look after them for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I think that would be best.\" Ashei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

The two had seen and heard most of what had just transpired and now wanted to get a look for themselves. The tiny specks in Ashei's raised hand was their first clue. Ilia spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that..? Did Midna shrink again?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so.\" Ashei answered her. \"She and the Princess are both the same size now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Hena cried, worried for her smaller friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia finally made it over to Ashei, at only 3 inches tall the warrior woman was much smaller than the country girl, and the two girls in Ashei's hand were even smaller than that! They looked like little bugs to Ilia, but a closer look revealed that they were in fact, Princess Zelda and the twili Midna. Ilia gasped at how small Midna had become overnight. And Hena, who had followed, was also shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How awful...\" Ilia softly said. \"I can't believe those shards made me grow so much, and then went and made Midna so small..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! Don't worry about it!\" Midna shouted, not sure if the 11 inch tall girl could even hear her. \"Me and the Princess here are tough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, Ilia could still hear Midna's shouts, and she laughed. \"Ha, I see you haven't lost your spunk, at least!\" Ilia laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna smiled brightly, if only Ilia had seen her just moments ago, but she and Hena didn't need to know about that. Suddenly, something came to Midna! She was seeing the location of the next mirror shard! The place it was in flashed in front of her eyes. When it was over, Midna sighed, she was glad that she could still sense the shards, even at her tiny, tiny size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the next mirror shard.\" Midna replied. \"I know what it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Ashei asked, \"You do?

It wasn't a huge change though, Link and the others were ready to go in only a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the journey back to castle town dragged on, the girls stayed put in Link's pocket, with the smallest two striking up a conversation amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel? To be going back to the castle, I mean.\" Midna asked the equally tiny Princess curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I'll admit, it does feel strange.\" Zelda replied. \"I'm sure it'll be fine going inside the castle, but... After everything that's happened, and with me being at this size, I wonder how the chancellor and the others will react..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's good point.\" Midna said. \"I'd bet that they might not be too happy with having their Princess so small, they might even blame Link for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nodded. \"That's what I'm worried about. At my size, there's no way they'd be able to hear me explain the situation. Maybe it's better if I don't show myself at all...\" Zelda sighed. The burden of her size weighed on her more heavily then before, now that she and her friends had to go to her castle, her size presented a new problem for the Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be better to just sneak in.\" Midna offered with a wry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda wasn't sure if the twili was being serious, she just lightly chuckled at the comment, and had to wonder if that really was the best option. How sad it would be for her, the Princess, to have to sneak into her own castle. Then another thought hit her, about the location of the shard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, how come you didn't sense this shard when we were in town before?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that.\" Midna said, rubbing the back of her head casually. \"My powers don't work that way. I'm only able to tell where one is at a time, and never able to know which one will come up next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see.\" Zelda said. \"But it is strange still.

Now he thought it would've been a good idea to come up with a plan before coming to the castle. It was too late now though, as the guard began explaining what the royals knew about Zelda's so-called disappearance.

But, wait. Zelda, what do you think? What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei looked down at Zelda and waited for her response.

It's just that, I am a Princess after all.. So there are things that it just wouldn't be right for someone of my standing to do.. What went on in that house, well, that would be one of them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Ashei said. \"Basically you want damage control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nodded at the larger woman. \"I want to let everyone know that I'm with Link and that I'm fine. For the most part. But I also can't risk letting out our little secrets, you all understand, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure.\" Midna said with a tinge of annoyance in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Well in that case, why not just make something up?\" Ashei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, that's what I wanted to do.\" Zelda said. \"And I think we can still pull it off. But only if all of you aren't seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So less people makes for a more believable story?\" Ilia asked. Also a little upset with the Princess' want to hide their affairs, but she could also understand why she needed to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm hoping.\" Zelda said. \"Anyway, I think it's best if only I and Ashei show ourselves to the chancellor. Ashei comes to the castle from time to time, so it would be the least suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Ashei said. She was completely on board with the Princess' plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well?\" Link asked, trying to hear the conversation the girls were having was hard for him since he couldn't very well hear Zelda or Midna when they spoke. \"Did you guys come up with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Ashei replied. She went to explain Zelda's plan to the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I understand.\" Link said. \"That certainly sounds like the best way to go about doing this, for Zelda's sake. But then, what will the rest of you do?\" Link asked, meaning Hena, Ilia and Midna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Link.\" Ashei said. \"We've got a plan for that too...\"</span></div></div>",

Now Ilia, Hena and herself were going to find it by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny girls had just split up from Link's group and were now in a large hallway, which seemed even more so at their reduced sizes. There were not a lot of guards in the hall, which made the going a little easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way to the shard?\" Hena asked the tiny twili sitting in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be right, down this hall.\" Midna directed the larger girls, telling them exactly what room it was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena and Ilia ran down the hall in the direction Midna told them to.

I guess.\" Ilia sighed. \"But still, taking in the sights is pretty cool..! I mean, look at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia had pointed to a huge set of armor set up next to the wall. Hena saw it and had to admit, it was quite a sight to behold.<br>\r\nAs the tiny girls, even Midna, stared up at the giant armor and other huge decor in the room, they failed to notice a guard had just entered the hall. Likewise, the guard had failed to notice the tiny girls scampering around on the floor. He walked towards them completely unaware that they were even there, as he passed them his huge foot knocked Ilia right over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Ilia grunted as she was kicked by the unaware guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor farm girl was knocked back by, what was to her, several feet.

Hena hesitated and ended up frozen in her tracks, unsure of what to do. Midna couldn't think of anything either. The tiny twili was too surprised too, at both the giant guard and at how quickly their plan had started to crumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard seemed to have felt bumping into something and was scanning the ground to see what it was. Then the guard saw what he had bumped into and could hardly believe it. A tiny girl, she lay on the floor in pain. From what he could tell, she looked to be about a foot tall. And then he noticed that she was completely naked! The guard blushed under his helmet, but stayed the course, trying to figure out what this small girl was. He thought at first that someone that must be a fairy, that would explain he lack of clothing, but she wasn't a fairy, she had no wings that he could see. He wondered what she was and knelt down for a closer look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia was now starting to recover, the pain was minimal from the beginning and it was now subsiding quickly.

The guard was covered head to toe in armor, which only served to make him more imposing to the tiny country girl. Ilia's first instinct was to scream and run away, but she stayed strong and looked him in the eye, well as much as she could, what with his helmet and all.<br>\r\nThe guard just watched and stared at the tiny girl for a few more moments before finally speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia thought about her response. It didn't seem like this guard wanted to hurt her or capture her, no, he just seemed to be genuinely curious about her. Ilia thought that this would be a good chance to come up with some kind of story to fool him, and hopefully lead him off the trail of her friends. Her friends, or friend at least, she could still see just standing behind the guard. Ilia had to come up with something now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm a... Fairy.\" Ilia answered at last, her voice betrayed her, as she sounded unsure of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... Fairy?\" The guard asked. \"Are you sure? I mean, no offense, but where are your wings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, well...\" Ilia started, she had think of something fast! \"I lost my wings. And, er, that's why I've come here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard stood up. \"Is that so?\" He asked. The question sounded rhetoric, but his voice sounded sincere. \"How awful..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Ilia said flatly, but then cried out, \"I'm a fairy with no wings..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia thought it was a good time to try some play acting, and pretended to cry into her hands.<br>\r\nThe guard knelt back down quickly and put his hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cry!\" He said, trying to hush the \"fairy\". \"Listen, I'll help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia stopped her fake tears and looked up at the guard. \"You will?\" She asked with big puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course!\" The guard said. \"As a member of the royal Hyrulian knights, it is my duty to help and protect any who need!\" The guard then offered his hand to the tiny country girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you!\" Ilia shouted. In her mind she was thinking, <i>I can't believe how well this is turning out!</i> Indeed, she had a guard who would keep her a secret and help her at her disposal now. Not only that, but when she looked back to where Hena was standing, she saw that the tiny fisherwoman was now gone, thanks in part to Ilia's masterful distracting of the guard. Hopefully her and Midna were hiding not too far away, so as for them to hear what Ilia had just pulled off. If they did, they could follow behind discretely, and if they didn't, they'd all still end up in the same place eventually anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

Down on to desk, Zelda was telling Ashei what to say, hopeful that her words would stop this increasingly tense scene. But just as Ashei was about to speak for the tiny Princess Zelda, the chancellor spoke up himself shouting, \"Guards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a group of guards stormed into the room, surrounding the exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" The chancellor said. \"Guards, arrest that man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard all charged at Link, ready to subdue him.

Then he looked up, staring Ashei right in the eyes with a face of scorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Ashei...\" He began grimly. \"I'm afraid we won't be needing your services any longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you talking about?\" Ashei asked. She didn't like the way the chancellor was looking at her, it made even her feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After what happened to the Princess, I don't believe that we can honestly trust you ever again!\" The chancellor replied.

Ashei then ran as fast as she could, while still keeping Zelda safely in her hand, to the edge of the desk. She was thinking on her feet now, so when she made it to edge of the desk and saw there wasn't really anywhere for her to go, she was stuck! She took a quick look behind her, the chancellor's looming form was making its way around the desk, no doubt to try snatching her up again. The tiny warrior took another look down, the drop to the floor was quite long at her size.

Ilia had instructed the guard who found her about where to go next, and they ended up in one of the many storage rooms around the castle. This was where Midna had told Ilia that the next shard would be at. The room was filled with all sorts of boxes and crates, so the two were making slow progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" The guard said as he and Ilia searched the room. \"We're looking for some piece of mirror or something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Ilia replied. The tiny girl was making herself useful by looking inside and around the smaller containers. \"I need it to gro- I mean, get my wings back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...\" The guard softly said, feeling for the poor little \"fairy\". \"How awful it must be to lose your wings..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's.. It's horrible..!\" Ilia cried. She knew the guard was talking about her \"wings\", but she was referring to her shrunken size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia then heard what sounded like a little sniffling coming from the guard. She couldn't see him through the huge boxes though. <i>He's an emotional one</i>. Ilia thought. <i>I wonder how the others are doing</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia walked around the side of a box, and then to her surprise, saw Hena there! Ilia ran up to her and hugged her closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hena!\" Ilia exclaimed, happy to find her friend again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ilia.\" Hena said. \"Thank the goddesses we found you!\" Ilia broke off the hug, and Hena then raised up her hand to show that Midna was there. \"Midna here told me where to go, so I thought we'd run into you eventually. I'm just glad we did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I.\" Ilia said. \"How long have you been here? Did you find the mirror shard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena shook her head. \"No, not yet.\" She answered. \"Hey, so how's that guard treating you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's been very helpful!\" Ilia said. \"Oh! But I told him that I'm a fairy who lost her wings, and that the mirror shard will help me get them back. So he doesn't know what's really going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pretty smart thinking, Ilia!\" Midna shouted from Hena's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks!\" Ilia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I think I found something!\" The guard suddenly exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia heard this and knew that he'd be looking for her soon, and she knew that she had to keep Hena and Midna hidden from him. She was about to tell them to run and hide behind one of the many boxes in the room, but the guard was quicker! His shadow loomed over the tiny girls in no time at all, he didn't seem to notice Hena or Midna yet, instead he simply asked, \"Ms. Fairy, is this the mirror shard you're looking for?\" Ilia turned around and saw that it was indeed a piece of the mirror of twilight he was holding in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

Could you hand the shard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard did what Ilia asked and gives the small woman the piece of the mirror. \"It's no problem.

The country girl could keep her little head poking out of the pocket discreetly enough as to not be seen by anyone else. As such she was able to see where the guard was going and how to get into the prison cells. When they made it down into the cells under the castle, she saw something else important too, one of the guards was letting a prisoner out for some reason. Ilia watched as that guard simply pulled a lever to unlock and open the door automatically, she took note of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guard walked along the hallway him and the shrunken ladies could hear a crowd of people talking further down. The guard, and Ilia, then saw a small group of other guards huddled around a cell, in it was none other than Link!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true!\" The guard exclaimed. \"Link's been arrested!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Ilia cried. \"How could this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think something went wrong when they met with the chancellor?\" Hena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I bet you're right, Hena.\" Midna said. \"I knew something like this would happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't doubt it.\" Ilia said. \"But let's get some more information first.\" Ilia looked up at the guard carrying her. \"Hey! Can you get a little closer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard looked down at the tiny girl in his pocket and nodded. He went over to Link's cell, he could see the young man inside, simply sitting on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you believe this?\" One of the other guards asked. \"I thought Link was some big hero? Ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Another guard shouted. \"I hear he did something to the Princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Yet another guard asked. \"You think he's behind the Princess' disappearance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch.\" Ilia's guard friend said. \"That's enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guards stopped their heckling and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" One of them said. \"I've got work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..\" Another one added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one by one, all the guards left the prison and, hopefully, returned to their posts. Leaving just Link, Ilia's guard, Ilia and the other shrunken women in the prison. Link knew the others had left, but still didn't bother to look outside his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" Ilia shouted from her protectors pocket, and she raised her tiny arms up as well. \"Let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. Of course!\" The guard stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard picked up Ilia from his pocket and set her down on the cold, hard floor of the prisons. He wondered what she was planning on doing. He saw his little \"fairy\" friend run across the floor and reach Link's cell, then much to his surprise, she was able to squeeze through the bars of the cell.<br>\r\nIlia ran some more until she was right under Link's big, sulking form. When Link saw the tiny Ilia he immediately brightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ilia!\" He exclaimed. \"How did you find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him!\" Ilia shouted, pointing to her guard friend, who was waiting patiently outside the cell. \"He helped me get down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" Link asked, then lowered his voice to ask, \"Does he know about the mirror shards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Ilia said. She held up the latest shard for Link to see. \"He helped me get this one! But... He thinks I'm a fairy and that the shards will help me get back my 'lost' wings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see!\" Link said, stifling a laugh. He faced the guard. \"Thank you for helping my little 'fairy' friend here, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, of course!\" The guard said. He never thought he'd be thanked by the great hero Link, it made him a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!\" Ilia shouted. Bringing the hero's attention back to her. Link could see Ilia holding up her hands, and there appeared to be something small on each. \"Hena shrunk again after we found the mirror shard. And Midna's still the same height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sighed. He wished that the shard's would do more growing than shrinking. But at least they were all together again, but then he remembered Ashei and Zelda, who he thought were still with the chancellor. But before he could say or do anything about the other shrunken girls' plights, someone came into the room...</span></div></div>",

From the metallic clanging of their steps, it sounded like a group of guards were coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More soldiers?\" Link asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard could see it from outside Link's cell, there looked to be about four guards closing in on them. \"Yep, looks like it..!\" He said. Acting fast, the guard flipped the lever to open Link's cell. He wasn't sure what was really going on, now that there was another supposed \"fairy\" in the room, but he knew that Link wasn't a bad person he saved Hyrule before for goddesses' sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cell door opened, and Link stepped outside. The guard was ready to fight alongside Link and had his weapon at the ready, but then Link spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back.\" He said. The guard did as he was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards were charging at Link now, screaming and holding up their weapons. Just as they came into arms reach, Link pulled out his sword, which the guards so graciously allowed him to keep in prison. He used his signature spin attack to easily dispose of the guards. All at once the attacking guards were knocked into the walls of the small prison hallway and rendered unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow!\" The helpful guard exclaimed. \"What power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink turned around. \"Thank you for your help. I'll take it from here.\" He said. The guard understood, after seeing Link's swordsmanship up close, he knew that he'd only get in the way from here on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" The guard said. \"I know you've probably got a lot of shards to still find, so I'll try and help you by keeping things under control here in the castle as much as a lowly guard like myself can. Good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the guard who had helped Ilia so much ran off. As he left, Ilia couldn't help but think that she heard him crying again. The tiny country girl just giggled and then looked up at Link, who was kneeling down before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have a lot of time.\" Link said. \"We need to get out of here quickly and find the other shards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia nodded, but then heard Zelda speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate leaving my people in the hands of the chancellor...\" Zelda said. \"But, there's nothing I can do at my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda...\" Ilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Link asked, unable to hear the tiny Princess' words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute..\" Midna interjected, thinking. \"You said before that the chancellor's actions at the castle were strange, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Zelda replied, wondering where Midna was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Midna said. \"Well, in that case, maybe the mirror shard had something to do with that? It's possible that he might have been corrupted by the power of the mirror! Link and I have seen it happen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Zelda asked, hopeful that the chancellor may still be saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Link and I have seen it happen before.\" Midna explained. \"When we get all the pieces of the mirror of twilight back together, he should return to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's great news!\" Zelda exclaimed. She was glad to hear that there was a possible explanation behind the chancellor's earlier actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..\" Ilia said, then smiled up at Link. \"It's nothing, we should be leaving now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go!\" Link said.

She knew that they'd have plenty of time to see each other again after it was all done, but not her, no she'd have to return to the twilight realm to rule over and guide her people once more. But despite the sad feelings that thought brought her, she smiled at her friends brightly once last time. Then she went...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and the tiny girls were busy trying to figure out how to put the mirror shards back together again. They all worked together to do this last thing on their journey, everyone had a piece to put into the mirror, and everyone had soon found which pieces connected together to form the twilight artifact. After everyone had put their piece into place, they still had one more to go, Midna's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midna, we only need one...\" Zelda started, but noticed that Midna had seemed to disappear. \"More...\" She finished softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Midna?\" Hena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Did she shrink again?\" Ilia asked, concerned that the tiny twili might've shrunk while they weren't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny girls started their search to find a tinier Midna on the table top. They looked for her everywhere, but couldn't find her. Finally they gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could she have gone?\" Hena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Link said, looking at what would've been Midna's piece of the mirror. He looked over and saw Zelda was eying the shard as well. \"You don't think..? Would she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think so, Link...\" Zelda replied. \"She must have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Must've what!?\" Ilia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midna's gone back to the twilight realm.\" Link answered. \"She must have.. She must've done it when we weren't looking and snuck back in through the mirror shard somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Hena cried, sad to hear of friend's possible decision to leave so suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Ashei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know for sure.\" Zelda answered. \"I had thought she wanted to return to normal size before going home, but maybe.. The reason she didn't go home, was to help all of us find the mirror shard so we could return to normal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Midna..\" Ilia whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the twilight realm, Midna had just appeared through the transport. Her home looked the same as ever, she was glad to see it was doing well in her absence. She then saw a twili was nearby, another look revealed that it was one of her guards, and not only that she compared herself to the twili and found that...</span></div></div>",

But I don't mind this,\" Link says with a smile as he looks at the normal naked size girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls look down and see they were once again naked but didn't really care about that right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it's you, I don't mind,\" Ilia says with a smile as the country girl goes over to Link and gives him a quick kiss on the lips. \"You also help us out as well,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We need to get back together some time,\" Hena adds with a smile and gets close to Link as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, don't we princess,\" Ashei says as well as Zelda nods her head and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get together once we get everything sorted out at the castle. Link do you mind if we use your extra clothes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. At least you have a reason to come back,\" Link replies with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls are happy and soon were trying out of some Link's farm clothes. Link is happy the girls are enjoying themselves as he looks at the mirror, the hero is surprise that the mirror is still in tack after the girls return to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think we can use this to talk to Minda?\" Ilia asks as the country girl is now wearing Link's farm clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea. Last time Midna shattered the mirror,\" Link replies as he picks up the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can meet each other again,\" Hena says as the fisher woman buts on one of Link's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I have a feeling we'll be again one day,\" Ashei adds on as the warrior puts on one of Link's tunics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. If Minda was able to go through a shard, we should be able to use to contact her,\" Zelda says with a smile. \"But first I need to fix things at the castle,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Link says with a smile as he looks at girls.

The girl's knees seemed to be as tall as a Goron was to Zelda if she was at her normal height! The latter kept shrinking, but was not tiny enough to avoid the intruder's hand, grabbing as easily as if she were a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-put me down you hear me?!\"  Zelda said in her now squeaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like the scroll containing the spells my servants have left in your castle has paid off!  Enjoying that shrinking spell, I hope?  With it, I got one new guest to add to my castle for the ball! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was confused. What could that child be talking about?  How did she manage to have servants?  And how did they succeed in hiding the spells she had just learned?  <br>\r\nSeeing how lost her prisoner was, Agitha explained her the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A weird turn of events,  huh?

As they got out of the house in the middle of the forest, Agitha got into the carriage she had used to come. She waved the coachman to head back to Castle Town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it possible for a kid like her to have so much authority?! \" Zelda thought. Something about her kidnapper was definitely too strange. Not only did she plan all along to shrink her, but she also succeeded in kidnapping the princess of the entire Hyrule Kingdom! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgitha smiled at her shrunken prisoner, before saying: \"You're so cute!  I'm so glad to have you as my new guest!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zelda could even reply, she released a squeaky scream as her gigantic abductor dropped her in a glass bottle. <br>\r\n\"Here you go, I would certainly not let such a gracious treasure for my castle like you get harmed during our travel!\" The ten year old lass explained. <br>\r\nThrough the walls of her crystal cell, Zelda noticed they were already approaching Castle Town. She had to find a way out, and quick!  Zelda tried to cast the many spells she knew, but felt very weak when doing so. She then observed some sort of magical glow emanated from the bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgitha, commenting the princess's reaction, whispered: <br>\r\n\"Do you really think I wouldn't have taken some measures to prevent you from escaping?  I added in that bottle a poison which neutralizes any magic coming from the spells I sneaked to you. The effects can only be reversed with this antidote.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgitha showed her a small (but huge to Zelda!) vial filled with an emerald liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't mind about that. Instead, I advise you to give my guests a good impression, so that they could see in you a nice partner, and not their next meal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gasped out of fear. How the heck did the situation turn so sour? The carriage stopped, and Agitha got in her so-called castle, the bottle Zelda was in, in her hand.

Zelda ran as fast as she could,  but fell as her dress caused her to lose balance. In spite of apparently being at the beetle's mercy, she managed to get out of its attack's way,  although her clothes got torn by the bug's horn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh...\" Zelda said when she noticed her dress was no longer completely covering her chest. She raised her hand to hide her now partially revealed breasts, but did not linger: the beetle had stuck its horn in the dirt after its charge. Zelda swallowed, and climbed on its back. She was trained in horseriding, so using a bug as a vehicle  could not be that different, she thought. The beetle unfortunately would not do so without a fight. Zelda held still while the bug did its best to shake its meal of its back: it deployed its wings, forcing Zelda to grab one of its legs while they were both in the air. The princess dropped as soon as possible, landing in a darker area, hoping to escape a gruesome fate. Taking some rest and also the advantage of not being in Agitha's sight or any other foe, Zelda tied a knot to repair her clothes as best as she could: her nudity was no longer compromised but she did not look as covered either.

The problem was, it was on a table, which on Zelda\u2019s scale, implied that the shrunken princess had to climb her way through a height of dozens of meters!  <br>\r\nZelda heard the ground shaking. It did not take long for her to turn back and see her gigantic abductor walking nearby, each of her steps causing a powerful shockwave. Although terrified and unwilling to end again in the girl\u2019s grip to be treated like a toy, Zelda gathered her courage and prayed the three goddesses of Hyrule to not get spotted by Agitha as the princess jumped on one of her shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Zelda screamed as she felt like dealing with an earthquake as Agitha kept walking, speaking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, where has my new doll gone to? I'm sure she'll enjoy having some new guests...and perhaps even a partner..!\u201d Agitha innocently said, as if not aware of how inhumane such a treatment would be. Zelda on the other hand -which she luckily was not- tried to grab the girl\u2019s dress and discreetly climb it to get to the antidote bottle as Agitha would walk by. Hiding inside one of Agitha\u2019s pockets, Zelda granted herself a few minutes of rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright...Where\u2019s that antidote now..?\u201d the minuscule princess wondered. And as she looked for her only hope to escape, she spotted it just in time to leave the undesired vehicle that Agitha was. Zelda grabbed on to the ledge of the piece of furniture the potion was lying on, like waiting for her. The diminutive woman walked slowly towards her objective, to not alert the gigantic child of her presence. Once near the bottle, Zelda put her hand on its surface, thinking how to administer the cure to herself.<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThat cryptic child has been rather...unclear on how that medicine was to be used. What should I do now ? Bathe in it ? Drink it up to the very last drop..? How does that make sense ?

But her confident smirk soon changed to a worried frown as she realized that her magic was still not back yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken, powerless Zelda screamed as she now realized she was falling down what was a great height to her without any magic to protect herself. She just barely had time to curl into a ball to at least somewhat shield herself from the fall before hitting the ground outside hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Zelda groaned. The fall wasn't too high for a normal-sized person, but at her scale, it was equivalent to a three-story drop! She just thanked the goddesses that she somehow wasn't seriously injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda wiped the potion and dust off of herself and got up. She had some bruises and everything ached, but she felt fine other than that. Zelda looked around the alleyway she'd fallen into and saw a big 'lake' of the discarded antidote.

The shrunken princess worried that Agitha might come and find her soon, so she tried to find a suitable hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before Zelda could even think about it any further, a young girlish voice cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha! There are you my lovely little insect!\" Agitha shouted. Zelda looked and watched as she saw the self-proclaimed \"Bug Princess\" was merrily skipping her way down the dark alley, right towards her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not good! My magic isn't all back yet!</i> Zelda thought with fear. All she had right now was low-level spells like her fireball spell, and she'd already seen how weak that particular spell had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda knew that she'd not be able to fight fairly in her current state, and Agitha was almost on top of her already.

All what what she knew was that where she was was hot. Her own eyesight was blurred by mist, and caused to awkwardly trip into the source of all this confusion. The warm and pleasant smell of the water she had fallen in did not fool her: this could only be hot spring water from Death Mountain: a praised product for its medical properties. Zelda would have enjoyed this bath if she was not at risk of drowning! <br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d the rough voice of the Goron merchant said. \u201cSpring water from our famous mountain! 20 rupees a bottle only!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'll get one.\u201d an unknown person said. <br>\r\nWhile Zelda was still struggling to not sink in the bottom of the tank, the large spoon the Goron served his customers with scooped the unfortunate woman out of the ocean she was trapped in. Instead, she was poured into a smaller vial, which was not any better in terms of safety, she luckily managed to grab the bottle cap to stay above the water.<br>\r\n\u201cI dare this fiendish child to find me now!\u201d Zelda said. \u201cAssuming I can hold my position long enough.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe travel did indeed not prove easy. Zelda not only had to deal with quakes striking the bottle she was in as her unaware owner was walking, but also to not slip and fall back into the water. A few minutes later, she was put free from her cell as someone poured the content of the bottle into a bowl. Zelda quickly swam her way out of it, and squeezed her dress dry. <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I can't deny that bathing into that water felt great! I wonder if I can use the reversal spell!\u201d<br>\r\nAs soon as she tried, she indeed grew back as tall as a toothpick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should count my blessings\u2026\u201d Zelda said with disappointment.<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to investigate the house she had brought in, hoping no one would spot her. Her plans did not turn out to work as the man got closer, and abruptly took the bowl of spring water and checked it out from very close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cSeems like I'm lucky for this man to have such a poor eyesight!\u201d</i> Zelda told herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf only I could find out what's so extraordinary about that rip off of a medicine...I could turn filthy rich!\u201d he said slamming the container back at the table, unknowingly splashing the shrunken princess with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, it's cold!\u201d Zelda squeaked.<br>\r\nThe sudden drop in temperature struck her nose, causing her to sneeze. The sound was enough to get the giant\u2019s attention. Now able to take a closer look at him, Zelda recognized the doctor from Castle Town. Unfortunately for her, he noticed her to and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we have here? I was sure I had cleared my clinic of any pest!\u201d<br>\r\nAlthough unhappy to be compared of such a way, Zelda tried to dash out of his sight, only to end trapped under a glass the physician dropped on the table. Now that the intruder was successfully captured, the creepy old man rubbed his chin, grabbed his magnifying glass and observed his prisoner, asking her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?  Some new fairy species? Or perhaps just an hallucination induced by my own medicine?\u201d<br>\r\nAs Zelda was unable to reply and to focus to cast any spell and escape the glass layer, the doctor shrugged and said\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despaired at the idea of getting mutilated into a bloody mess, the shrunken princess only managed to yell irrational threats she could never carry out and begging for mercy right after that.

Zelda, concealed under the physician\u2019s thick cloak, looked left and right, marveling with terror but also with amazement at the giants composing the crowd. She sighed, thinking that with a little of rest, she would have been able to cast a spell strong enough to restore herself to normal, but all the recent events had left her exhausted, and using Farore\u2019s Wind or any other magical techniques was out of the question. With a new hope finally in reach to grow back, she allowed herself to take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes, or a few seconds later for the shrunken princess, an abrupt move from the doctor woke her up. <br>\r\n\u201cShhh, shhh, out of my way!\u201d the latter shouted at something in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda woke up in a yawn, stretching her arms, before asking: <br>\r\n\u201cWhat's the matter, doctor?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid birds!\u201d he grunted at the dark forms upwards. \u201cAlways trying to bite out belongings of travelers of this bridge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked down, and could indeed spot Lake Hylia. In fact, they were so high on the bridge that the lake looked minuscule, even to Zelda! Distracted, she was not able to dodge the new assault from the flying pests, and neither did Borville. As the raven scratched a hole through the pocket Zelda was hiding in, the latter,  powerless, fell right into the lake.<br>\r\nThe physician was terrified as well, but for a different reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! My reward, my swimming pool filled with Rupees...Why?!\u201d the greedy biologist lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda, on the other hand, cried as hard as she could during her long fall, although her reduced size prevented her from gaining velocity as she was sinking deeper into the void separating the lake from the bridge.

She instinctively looked at what just caught her. She indeed preferred to keep falling to her demise: a Kargarok, one of Hyrule\u2019s largest bird species, had caught her and certainly was about to swallow her whole. Zelda therefore closed her eyes and waited for all of this to end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cSo, what are you waiting for?

Thankfully for the shrunken woman, the bird coming for her was this time much smaller, although still of a significant size for Zelda, but she no longer cared at this point. The newcomer however surprised her by the simple fact that it could talk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA human!  A human!\u201d the strange animal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda slapped her forehead in a facepalm, seriously annoyed at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I'm definitely crazy now. I just heard a bird talking to me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlumm\u2019s the name!\u201d the creature said, upset at the princess\u2019s reaction. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd Plumm is wondering why my friend brought a female human here. Female humans are rare, very rare indeed in Lake Hylia! But I wonder also why are you so small\u2026Is it a characteristic to all human females? That would explain why Plumm couldn't find any!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda shook her head and took a deep breath. After all, this bird was perhaps not that dangerous, if one put its curiosity aside\u2026The princess took advantage of her newfound peace to stare at the animal and say:<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you really wish to know, we women are not supposed to be this tiny. In fact\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda then used her magic to get a few inches taller. She was now as big as a bottle. But this was far from enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?

Tricking me into thinking she'd really have such a simple solution to my problems...\" Zelda cursed under her breath.

Aside from that, the only exit out of the alley was being covered by Agitha, and Zelda wasn't sure if she'd be able to sneak or run past the giant girl without being spotted, even at her tiny size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Zelda, won't you come out?

However, when they did, Zelda didn't feel any magic returning to her body at all, instead the Hylian Princess found herself suddenly shooting downwards in size! The tiny princess screamed in frustration as she plummeted down to even smaller heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Curse that Agitha! How dare she trick me with a shrinking potion!</i> Zelda thought with anger as she shrank again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda shrank, her reducing body got closer and closer to the rest of the spilled shrinking potion. Fearing she might become even smaller just from being around the accursed potion, Zelda hurriedly backed away from it to higher ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was safe now, but far from happy. As the smaller Zelda got, the more upset she became. She couldn't believe she'd let herself get tricked into downing a shrinking potion by an insane little child! To think her current state had become so pathetic so quickly, she was the princess of the kingdom for crying out loud! Meant to rule fairly and justly, not scramble around in the dirt like some mere bug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though, Zelda's shrinking came to a stop, leaving the once high and mighty princess much, much tinier. Zelda estimated that she couldn't be much bigger than a speck of dust by now! The small alleyway she'd fallen into looked to be about the size of the whole Castle Town to her, and the little spill of potion in front of her now appeared to take on the same size and shape as Lake Hylia to the hyper reduced princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was speechless by her new height, or lack thereof. She felt so tiny and insignificant, not to mention completely helpless without her magic powers. Her anger had been replaced by her new fear. Fear of the sheer size of things around her, a barrel the size of her castle, and Agitha's \"kingdom\" now looking more like Death Mountain by her scale. Zelda whimpered in fear and was nearly brought to tears by her seemingly helpless situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha!\" A girlish laugh echoed through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked up and gasped at what she saw. It was Agitha, only now magnified to the size of a mega giantess, the petite little girl was now more like a goddess in comparison to the incredibly shrunken princess of Hyrule. Zelda wanted to scream at the sight of massive girl, but she couldn't even do that, instead letting out a pathetic squeak. If she thought Agitha was trouble before, Zelda could only imagine what she'd be like to her now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you fall into the potion, princess!\" Agitha declared loudly. \"I bet you didn't think it was working at first, huh? No, it works by touch, it just takes a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Blast that little brat!</i> Zelda thought in frustration. But then she noticed something, Agitha was stopped just outside the entrance of the alleyway, and seemed to be scanning it. Zelda gasped as she realized that Agitha must have been looking for her, not able to see her with her naked eye because of how small she had now become!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Am I really that insignificant?</i> Zelda wondered, feeling hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm! I wonder how small you got?\" Agitha said, carefully taking some steps into the alley while looking for her little prey. \"You didn't drink it, did you? Even I don't know what would happen if you did that! Why, you might have just disappeared altogether!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So she knows I'm near microscopic...</i> Zelda thought. She pondered her options. <i>P-Perhaps it might not be so bad to be found by her right now. I've little chance of surviving on my own at this size...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better just come out now!\" Agitha called. The \"Bug Princess\" was soon almost on top of Zelda.

Glancing back and forth between the two, an idea started to form in Zelda's head. As Agitha was standing still, looking down for her treasured little \"ladybug\", she had ended up right next to the puddle of shrinking potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's not that far from it... Maybe I can splash some of her own medicine on her!</i> Zelda thought, hoping to bring her huge pursuer down to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super shrunken princess collected herself and put her daring plan into motion. She first ran over to lake-sized puddle of shrinking potion, taking great care to not trip and fall into it, lest she want to end up ruling the microverse. Zelda tugged at her dress and braced herself for the next step of her plan. She knew that the shrinking potion worked on and through clothes, so all she would have to do is use the only thing she had on her, namely her dress, to soak up the shrinking potion, and then hope that she can get it to Agitha and reduce the big brat down to a more manageable size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here goes nothing!</i> Zelda thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda acted quickly and hastily removed her dress, leaving the speck-sized woman nude for the world to see, of course she was so small nobody would actually be able to see her, that helped make Zelda's decision somewhat less embarrassing. With her dress in her hands, Zelda tied it up nicely like a whip. Then, Zelda got closer to the shrinking potion and \"whipped\" her dress into the spill, causing quite a splash at her scale, thankfully none of the potion splashed onto her, but it did soak into her dress quite nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda pulled her dress out of the potion mess and, keeping her hands on the still dry part of it, ran as fast as she could over to Agitha. But already Zelda could feel her dress starting to shrink in her hands. She groaned, knowing that even if her plan worked, she'd not be able to wear the shrinking garment ever again. But Zelda pushed on and made it to Agitha's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the bug princess's shoe, the Hyrulian Princess gasped at the towering footwear's size. In her haste to complete her plan, Zelda failed to take into consideration the Agitha had been wearing high platform shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no! Even I throw my potion soaked dress at her feet now, it would never touch her skin!</i> Zelda thought in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Zelda's chances of success were diminishing by the second, along with her dress. With no other choice, Zelda bravely jumped onto Agitha's high shoe and started to climb it. But at her pitiful size, the shoe alone seemed to be the size of a large house! For Zelda, getting up to the top wasn't going to be easy, not to mention that she had to carry her dress along with her while maintaining her grip, and of course her dress, soaked with her only weapon against Agitha, was rapidly shrinking away in her hands. Zelda feared that even if she did make it to the top, it might be too late to shrink Agitha.</span></div></div>",

She smiled at the sight of her hero, and struggled some more on the ground as if to show him how happy she was to see him. Link seemed to get the message.

I can't believe this was the best plan they could come up with to prevent your, er, execution..\" Link said, staring in disbelief at the disembodied head of princess Zelda laying on the ground before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither!\" Zelda admitted. \"To tell the truth, I don't remember much from the day of my beheading. So it seems tha- Ow! Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's words were interrupted by a finger poking her face, Link's finger to be specific. The Hylian man had poked the princess's disembodied head out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, sorry, princess!\" Link apologized, and quickly pulled back his prodding finger, but couldn't help but laugh. The whole situation was just so bizarre to the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, please! This is a very uncomfortable form to be in!\" Zelda pleaded, shaking her head back and forth to deter Link from any further poking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Is this better?\" Link asked as he grabbed Zelda's head from below in his hands and held her to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better.\" Zelda said with a smile. Link smiled back. He pulled Zelda's head in for a kiss, and Zelda obliged. After the smooch Zelda felt much more relaxed. \"Just carry me under your arm and we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did as his princess asked. It wasn't the best way to carry her head, but it would work for now. He had to admit that it felt very strange to be carrying someone's head around like this, especially from when he grabbed below her head; he had expected to feel her squishy insides, but instead of that there was just smooth skin there. But Zelda seemed comfortable enough, and the magic that allowed her to survive like this had saved her life after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Zelda was enjoying the ride. Being so helpless that she needed to be carried around like this would normally be a humiliating experience for the proud princess, but with Link she didn't feel that way at all. She just hoped that she'd get her body back soon.</span></div></div>",

After the defeat of Ganondorf, the Mirror of Twilight was broken, the Bulblins made peace with Hyrule, and Zelda was crowned as queen. The trouble is, after the castle was rebuilt (courtesy of the hardworking peoples of all Hyrule races) there was little for the queen to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had gone off on some new quest, something about an evil wizard placing curses on people at seemingly random. Zelda wanted to go along, but Link insisted that the danger would be too great. They had a very long argument about it, but in the end, Link stormed off, leaving Zelda alone and longing for adventure....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of an opening door roused Zelda's attention, though the door to the elegant throne room remained as shut as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Achem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's attention was drawn to a dark corner of the throne room where a figure in a filthy, worn-out black cloak was standing. The odd gait and glowing eyes revealed him to be a Bulblin, who was now shambling over to the Queen of Hyrule!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Zelda of Hyrule...age eighteen...bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom...\" the Bulblin was mumbling, though Zelda knew not whether it was to her or himself. Regardless, she drew her rapier, for this man broke into her throne room, and so clearly means harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It draws a blade to Rajir!?\" The bulblin snarled, \"It must pay! <br>\r\n<i>I lay this curse from blackest heart!<br>\r\nYou and my foe shall never part!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rajir the Bulblin Sorcerer vanished into a pillar of smoke, leaving only his evil laughter to echo throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foe?\" Zelda thought to herself \"What did he- Oh no...Link! He must be in trouble! I must find him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Link did not tell her where to find him! </span></div></div>",

Even if peace had returned, she was now aware that the world was way more complex and fascinating than what others have ever told her. Indeed, it was time to discover how everything began, as her friend, guardian and mentor Impa had taught her. Therefore, she decided to keep studying mythology or in some sort of way, her anterior life. To do so, the young woman headed to her father's library, where all kinds of things related to what she was interested in could be found. Once there, Zelda gazed at the stacks of books, not knowing where to start with. Her eyes scanned the entire room until stopping on a small bookcase she had never noticed before. She approached it and grabbed a book, as filthy as the shelf it had stayed on. \"Father should really think to clean this room, but as usual it is no use to remind him that once more...The cover is so dirty that it is impossible to read what it is written on it.\" She blew it, sneezed before taking a look at the title. \"The many powers of the Goddess\" she read.<br>\r\n\"It does not sound that original but whatever. I think it can still be useful...\" Zelda got back to her bedroom, so that she could read in peace. On her way, she bumped into Link. \"Oh sorry Link, I did not mean to...\" \"It's alright, don't worry.\" he replied in a smile. \"Just remember that if you need anything, don't hesitate to see me, okay ?\" \"Y..yes, thanks !\" she said awkwardly. She then walk into her room and closed the door. While sitting in the chair in front of her desk, she dropped the book on the table and and began to read it, until stopping on what seemed to be some sort of spell, written in ancient Hylian. \"Strange...Impa once told what this meant, but I can't remember, it however seems to deal with magic. Let's try it, what could go wrong after all ?\" She pronounced the incantation as best as she could, when she suddenly felt very weak and fainted. She then was...</span></div></div>",

Was'nt that the magic Hylia used to shrink back to human form ? But then, what effect just had that magic on her, as she was a mortal already, not to mention her size which was quite short. Everything then made sense to her : by using this spell a second time, her size was that of a bug ! What was she gonna do now, as she had no idea how to reverse the effects ? A quick look to the clock above her desk (which seemed to be miles away from the tiny woman) indicated that the shrinking process had only taken a few minutes.

She was just about to get help, but now she thanked her luck that help was seemingly coming to her. She quickly dropped from the Goddess book onto her desk and watched as a giant clad in mostly green garb entered her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda? Are you in here...?\" Link asked obliviously as he came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! I'm down here!\" Zelda shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked around, suddenly jerking his head around. He'd heard something squeaking in the room, and thinking it might be rats or some other small animal, he looked around to find it. He knew Zelda hated the things, so she'd probably reward him for removing it for her. But, when he layed his eyes on Zelda's desk, he noticed what appeared to be a tiny young woman standing there. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief, the minute girl looked and dressed like Zelda, he couldn't help but think it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be... Zelda!?\" Link exclaimed in shock that the tiny thing could possibly be the goddess reborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! It's me, Link!\" Zelda shouted. She was happy to be recognized at last by the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink barely registered Zelda's response, as her voice was almost too quiet to be heard. He just stared at the miniuature Zelda for a moment before it finally clicked that she was speaking to him. So he sat down on the chair by the desk Zelda was on and carefully got closer to the small girl, and was shocked to see that it really was Zelda, her clothes and style and all, just in a smaller package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda blushed as Link looked down at her, keeping her head down shyly. It wasn't that she was afraid of Link's size or anything, the size difference simply astounded the shrunken woman, and seeing Link as a comparative giant because of her own mistake was enough to make her blush in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how..?\" Link asked at last, softly as to not harm the shrunken girl. Even though he knew Zelda was normally quite capable of taking care of herself, her current size made her look vulnerable, so he didn't want to risk taking any chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Zelda squeaked. She looked up at Link, and watched him follow her with his eyes before running off to the book she had found earlier. She then shouted up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was this book! I was reading about the Goddess Hylia and found some kind of spell in it and, uh...\" Zelda laughed awkwardly as she recalled her foolish behavior from before before continuing on, \"I kind of cast it and passed out, and, well, ended up like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see..\" Link said, folding his arms. A look of relief on his face. \"So it can be reversed then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, I'm not sure. I need your help to find a reversal spell!\" Zelda yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Link seemed to ponder some options in his head, making the shrunken Zelda start to get a little nervous...</span></div></div>",

Zelda stood by the book and watched him, hopeful that there would be something that could restore her size written in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, a minute or two at first, but then several went by as Link flipped through the big book of spells and history. Zelda guiding him all the while, answering questions about the contents of the pages and other things. Together they worked to find any sort of spell that might help the shrunken girl restore herself to her former height. But they both were getting tired, as it was quite late. Zelda's memory of the ancient text was starting to get blurred, and Link was sure they'd been over some of the pages multiple times already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Link.\" Zelda apologized as time wore on. Even though she was the one stuck small, she couldn't help but feel bad for dragging Link into her mess. \"I can't get a good translation on some of these pages anymore. I wish there were some sort of index we could use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.: Link agreed, turning away from the book to yawn. \"But, wait, you don't need to apologize. It's not like you meant to make yourself this small, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda blushed. \"Y-Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Zelda looked through some more of the book. Zelda now took minutes to translate a single page and, even though she didn't tell Link, she wasn't completely sure of her translation skills. She knew enough of the language to translate, but as tired as she was now, she couldn't be sure. As much as she didn't like being tiny like this, she also just wished she could get some well needed shut-eye. But she, and Link, pressed on. Both remaining ever hopeful that the spell to restore Zelda would be found soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink yawned again as time wore on. \"But, doesn't it make sense that Hylia would have wanted to be able to restore herself at some point?\" Link asked, almost absentmindedly as he flipped through the pages. \"So there should be something in here that can help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so too. But there's a lot to cover with a book this big.\" Zelda pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, it must be pretty big to you, huh?\" Link asked her, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't make fun of me because I'm small like this!\" Zelda shouted, putting her hands on her hips and pouting. \"When I get big again, I might just remember this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, alright!\" Link laughed at the tiny Zelda's attempts to look tough, at her inches tall stature, she only looked cute. He went back to the book. \"So, what do you want to do, then? Any of these spells sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Link, we don't even know if these are spells...\" Zelda was about to continue until she read the contents of the pages Link had turned to. \"Oh! This is another list of spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, what do they say?\" Link asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure... Give me a minute to translate them...\" Zelda said, climbing on top of the book. She then crawled around the pages, slowly reading and translating it word by word. Link watched her as she did, enjoying her cute little form crawling around on the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes went by as Zelda studied the words carefully.

But soon, Zelda had grown to Link's knees, then to his waist. Zelda grinned as she imagined the possibilities of shrinking to different sizes, and wondered if there were such a spell to allow such a thing in the book. Then suddenly, Zelda felt big hands grab her arms and lift her into the air. She gasped as she saw that Link had picked her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're beautiful at any size.\" Link said as he held Zelda like a child. It was a little awkward, but she was the perfect size for it, at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda blushed and smiled at Link's words. Link took Zelda into his arms and snuggled her, before giving her a kiss. Zelda turned a deeper red from Link's actions, but returned his affections and let herself swoon in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth spell was still working its magic though, and soon Zelda had grown to be close to her normal size. Link let his girlfriend down, though he was strong enough to keep carrying her, he wanted to see her standing normal again. And normal she was, as Zelda stood tall before Link, growing the last few inches in front of him before she was her full size once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Link. It's good to be big again.\" Zelda said happily. Though she had agreed to remain shrunken for Link, being able to switch between her big and normal(tiny) sizes would be something she'd have to get used to, and she didn't mind being at either as long as she was with Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very welcome.\" Link said, and folded his arms. \"And now, I think you owe me something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean..?\" Zelda tried to play dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I'm talking about...\" Link motioned to the spellbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda did indeed know what he was talking about, the spell she promised to teach Link so he could use it to shrink her whenever he liked. She chuckled at Link's eagerness, but smiled at him and turned back to the spellbook, sitting down at her table. \"You're not wasting anytime, are you?\" She asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda, what you offered me before is too incredible to pass up! I know you just got back to normal, but I'd like to at least know the spell, alright?\" Link admitted. He knew he was being selfish, but he couldn't help it, Zelda was just too cute when shrunken!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Link. I'll teach it to you right now.\" Zelda said, flipping through the pages of the spellbook. She stopped on one and pointed to the page, curious, Link got closer and looked at the incantation in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is. 'The Goddess's Reduction Spell'. It seems like Hylia used to use this spell to shrink her enemies to miniscule sizes. But, I'm not your enemy, am I, Link?\" Zelda asked playfully and looked at boyfriend only to see that he was completely intrigued by the spell's powers, and wasn't paying much attention to her little comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do I use it?\" Link asked. Zelda rolled her eyes, but explained it to Link anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one is a little different from the other spell I used to shrink myself.\" Zelda explained, and now noticed that she had Link's full attention. She smiled and continued, \"This spell can only shrink others, and not only that, when you use it, you can determine the target's height just by imaging it in your head while you cast the spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So how do I cast it?\" Link asked. Zelda sighed from Link's one-track mind, but went on to explain the proper way to cast the spell on her to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And that should be how it's done.\" Zelda finished her explanation to Link. She smiled and got up from the chair. She saw Link was still staring at the spellbook intently. She was sure he wanted to play, but she felt a little tired from her unexpected shrinking earlier. So she stretched out and yawned loudly, hoping Link would get the message. \"Okay, now that that's done with, I think it's time for bed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink stood up and looked over at her. Zelda waited for him to say or do something, feeling a little uneasy with the power she'd just granted him over her. Then, Link opened his mouth to...</span></div></div>",

It might had always been easy for him to quickly fall asleep, but his dreams would always leak with energy. In other words, he happened to weakly whisper random words and sentences very often, not to mention his erratic moves in his bed, as any other sleep walker would do. His thoughts about acquiring the girlfriend he always wanted and rescuing her from her shrinking accident overwhelmed his mind, to the point of affecting his very dreams. Link started to unconsciously casting the spell, whispering it and pointing at random items in the room, shrinking them. Suddenly,  his fingertip aimed at a very specific direction, casting the magic as well, although nothing apparently happened, or at least as far as the male dormitory could see... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda peacefully lied in her sheets, especially after such an exhausting day.

It was generally to Zelda's loftwing to wake him up, spitting a letter from his girlfriend at his face as an awakening ritual. This time Link stepped out of sleep on his own, until noticing something was wrong. A sharp, wooden item stabbed Link's toe as it hit the ground.  The latter took a closer look to what had messed his very first step of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  What's this?  Am I still dreaming or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe item lying in his hand was nothing more than the chair of his desk, but it was as big as a toothpick!  The young man noticed how some other pieces of furniture had also suffered the same fate: the bookshelf was almost impossible to spot because of its new size, and so was a wooden bird statue Link had carved. The latter rubbed his forehead to help him find a rational explanation to this phenomenon. In a facepalm, he deduced what had happened overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me that I performed magic in my sleep just because I was obsessed with what happened to Zelda..?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly used the reversal spell Zelda taught him to fix the accident before minding his business as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda woke up early as she was used to do. Normally used to observe the sunrise as the early bird she always had been, the young woman only had nothing to see but darkness, like during a cloudy, pitch black night. What disturbed her even more was that she could hear Loftwings cry, as they would always do at dawn. She rose, noticing her head bumping against a soft, wide surface. She could have recognized that her bedsheets given how glad she was to get to sleep after a busy day like yesterday. So why was she trapped in such a dark and giant mass? Zelda mentally cursed as she understood what had probably happened: Link had shrunk her in her sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be my boyfriend Link, but I'm not your toy!\" she made her way through the smooth ocean, and once out of it, no doubt was possible: </span></div></div>",

One, Link was nowhere to be seen, and two, she was once again as small as a doll. Immediately, Zelda tried casting the spell she used to restore herself the night before. Even though she had agreed to stay small, she didn't feel right being shrunken in her sleep, and without Link anywhere to be seen. But then after the spell was cast, to her surprise, nothing happened. She tried again, and again, but each time the result was the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why isn't it working?</i> An increasingly worried Zelda wondered. <i>It couldn't be that.. 'Final Rise of the Goddess' was a literal title, could it?</i> Zelda guessed as to why the spell wasn't growing her back to normal. She hoped that the \"Final Rise of the Goddess\" wasn't a one use spell, as its name could imply. She wasn't sure, but worrying about while stuck on her bed at mere inches in height wasn't getting her anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Link..!\" Zelda groaned, now set on finding him and making him help her get to the bottom of this size-changing spell business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken girl was frustrated by such a bad awakening, and also shocked at how it happened to her in the first. Mostly because she had expected the shrinking spell to only work if you were close to the target, and also because, while she had shrunk again, she wasn't actually as small as she had been last time. Zelda estimated herself to be at least twice as big as she was the night before, putting her at about 6 inches tall. Not very big at all, but still big enough that the tiny girl could make it off of her bed by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Zelda leapt off the edge of her now massive bed and grabbed onto her equally massive sheets and began climbing down them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Link is definitely going to be hearing about this when I find him!</i> Zelda thought to herself, but then something occurred to her. <i>Wait. What if had doesn't even realize that he shrank me? Could he have cast the spell in his sleep?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda wasn't sure if such a thing was even possible, but she did know she had to get to her boyfriend and get him to restore her as soon as possible. So she kept climbing down her bedsheets. As her tiny feet touched the floor, Zelda was thankful that she was still at least small enough to crawl under her door. But to get to Link's room she'd have to go through the halls and down the stairs, and if she did that there was a chance she'd be spotted by somebody. Zelda shivered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait!\" Zelda exclaimed suddenly, speaking out loud in her small voice. \"I should be too small for anybody to really see me now. So it should be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith herself reassured, Zelda headed for the door to the hall and...</span></div></div>",

She decided to head downstairs, hoping to find Link in the kitchen, but this idea was a double edged sword: Link was indeed likely to be there, but so would other people. Will her size make her hard enough to spot? Will she be cautious to not end under someone's shoe? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started to climb down the stairs with her current size, that is to say by hanging down each step and drop to the next, Zelda eventually reached the end, although the process was tiring and time-consuming. Would Link still be there to help her? Suddenly, the young woman noticed the ground was shaking with loud quakes. Zelda dashed to hide in a nearby pot when a group of students unintentionally stomped the floor, coming out of the kitchen. Zelda sighed out of relief, thinking she was safe in her tiny shelter. She soon understood she was far from being out of danger when someone lifted the pot she was in!  <br>\r\n\"Who has been silly enough to leave those pots here?!\"  a voice said. <br>\r\n\"Did someone try to lay a trap so that I break my back while stepping in that mess? FLEDGE! Would you explain me this?!\" the same person said in a ruthless tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one person could be so strict with someone like Fledge, Zelda thought: Henya: the aging school cook. The shrunken woman then felt the pot she was in move to someone else's hand. <br>\r\n\"B-but Miss! How was I supposed to move those pots out of the way as you asked me to take care of the dishes instead..?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenya crossed her arms and stared at him angrily. \"Do you dare to reply to my orders? Do what I say!  We haven't got all day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFledge sighed and looked down. Zelda gasped, fearing him to see her, given that she was trapped in the palms of his hands! Luckily for her, he did not stare at the pot, but simply to the ground. Zelda took advantage of his lack of attention to jump out of the jar and land on a shelf nearby: she was high enough to stay out of sight. She took a better look at the kitchen now that nothing could harm her. At the bottom of the kitchen, she saw...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zelda was glad she had found her boyfriend, but at the same time, she felt upset that he didn't seem to have a care in the world. She wondered if he had bothered to check on her earlier in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her beloved found, Zelda knew she had to get over to him before he left the kitchen. But doing that was easier said than done, as the shrunken Zelda didn't want to risk shouting for and getting someone else's attention. So Zelda decided the best course of action would be to climb down the shelf she was stranded on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny girl crawled over to the edge of the high shelf and peered down, it was only several feet to the ground, but at her size it was a very long drop. Zelda gulped at the thought of falling such a height. She backed away from the edge and looked around for something to make her descent easier. As luck would have it, the shelf she was on was being supported by four poles on either corner of it, something that Zelda could use to slide down to the floor gracefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes...\" Zelda whispered to herself, bracing for the drop. She grabbed onto the metallic pole and jumped, and with her great agility, was easily able to slide down stealthily. Once on the floor, Zelda quickly moved behind another pot to hide and think of how to get to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect! Now to get to Link before he leaves!</i> Zelda thought. She wasn't too worried about Link leaving though, he usually took his time to enjoy a meal. Zelda wondered what a meal would look like to her at her miniscule height, and her mouth almost watered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda then peered out of her cover to find Link again, she looked and saw that...</span></div></div>",

If he did leave, then Zelda was basically stuck like this for an indefinite period of time, the thought made the tiny woman shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste any more time, Zelda made sure the coast was clear and ran over to Link's table. At her 6 inch size, the kitchen looked huge to her, and even thought the table was only a few feet away, Zelda built up quite a sweat in running over to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!\" Zelda shouted when she got under Link's table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Link said. He scooted his chair back and looked down for the source of the tiny squeak. His eyes widened when he saw Zelda looking back up at him, at only 6 inches tall! \"Zelda!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Link! It's me!\" Zelda shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened to you..!?\" Link asked. Zelda sighed, she had hoped that Link would've known that he'd made her shrink overnight, but from his genuine reaciton just now, it was clear to the shrunken girl that he had no idea what he had done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cast the shrinking spell on me while I was sleeping!\" Zelda shouted. Link seemed shocked by her accusation, but then thought about it and he seemed to understand what had happened to his tiny girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... I'm sorry, Zelda. Here, let me get you off the floor.\" Link offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing gentle, Link lowered his hand for Zelda to climb on board. The shrunken blonde got on, thinking they'd go back to her room and find out why she wasn't able to regrow herself. But then, Link just pulled her close to his chest and sort of \"hugged\" her, as much as he could hug a 6 inch tall girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I can't imagine what you've been through today.\" Link apologized sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've been... fine.\" Zelda told him. She wanted answers, but also liked to enjoy melting in her gentle giant's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're safe.\" Link said. He then moved Zelda back and just looked at her for a moment. \"Why didn't you use the 'Final rise of the goddess' spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Link, I tried! But it isn't working for some reason!\" Zelda cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked worried, but not in any hurry to help her. Zelda was glad that she had gotten his attention so easily, and even though she had to admit it felt good to be safe and held by her giant lover, it wasn't really what she wanted right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Link. I don't know how you shrank me in my sleep, or why my own growth spell isn't working so we need to get to the bottom of this!\" Zelda insisted, hugging one of Link's fingers tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked down at his tiny girlfriend and...</span></div></div>",

He then looked down at Zelda again, and shoved a plate towards her. \"Oh yeah, here you go! Eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked at the huge pile of food next to her, puzzled by how Link expected her to eat it when it was bigger than her whole body. Not that she wanted to eat right now anyway, all she wanted was to return to normal size and get a proper breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, please!

She knew he liked to eat, but never thought that that would stop him from helping her. She guessed that this is what she gets for letting Link control her size, and resigned herself to for fate of waiting for Link to finish, she was in no real danger or rush now that she was with Link, and besides, despite her protests, Zelda did still like being small next to her hero.

Nonetheless, Zelda mustered up the courage to take a handful of the soft breakfast and eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it, little ladybug?\" Link asked, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda took the time to savor the flavor of the pancake before responding with great joy, \"It's delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink just laughed heartily at Zelda's reaction. The 6 inch girl looked up at her boyfriend and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously! This is the best pancake I've ever had!\" Zelda sounded equal parts excited and surprised. She took another bite. \"Oh my goddesses, could it be because I'm so small that it tastes so good!?\" Zelda quickly took yet another bite of the huge pancake. She nearly squealed in delight as she ate it.

Zelda simply ignored him though and kept right on going through a sort of 'taste-test' of everything she could get her tiny little hands on. Link stopped laughing, and started to worry about her. \"Hey, now, Zelda. Don't you think you've had enough yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh!\" Zelda shook her head, enjoying a delicious piece of oversized bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, are you sure you can handle all that much at a time?

The projectile fired from Cawlin's weapon progressively came at her, getting as big as a boulder to her once about to collide into Zelda's spot. The only thing the latter could do was to scream out of terror and duck, hoping to dodge the shot, or at the very least not get spotted by anyone. After the loud impact of the pellet, Zelda slowly looked around her, understanding she was safe and sound...or rather for now: the tiny woman noticed the shelf's structure was badly weakened by the attack and about to collapse!  She had to find a way out, before crashing to the ground with the massive furniture!  As Henya was yelling at Cawlin for such a violation of the school rules -and served him right- Zelda thought. Did he spot her, especially at this size and distance? <br>\r\nShe did not have the time to give it further thought, when the shelf finally fell down, causing Zelda to thankfully land in a bag of flour. <br>\r\n\"What happened?  Where am I..?\"  Zelda said, confused.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe next thing she could see was the gigantic Henya, walking to the mess Cawlin had caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no, no, no!\" Zelda cried, despaired. Unable to think straight, she could think of a single place to hide: the flour she was on. She covered herself in it, hoping to be as stealthy as a chameleon. <br>\r\nThere goes the time I spent doing my laundry...Zelda thought. Henya thankfully fell for the trick, too busy to think of thousands of ideas of punishment for Cawlin. Zelda's nose started to itch, causing her to repeatedly sneeze. Henya unavoidably flinched when the flour quaked, as if coming to life, but moved on, blaming some cockroaches instead.<br>\r\n\"Disgusting pests! \" she unknowingly insulted Zelda. \"Always there to spoil my ingredients! Cawlin! Be useful for once and get me rid of it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" the troublemaker replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dragged the bag to the exterior, with its minuscule intruder still in it. Zelda did not attempt to flee, as it would only get her into huge trouble. Unfortunately,  the outcome did not prove that simple, especially when Cawlin decided to stuff his hand into the bag, thinking out loud :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That old hag isn't friend with insects, huh? Then let's see how she likes those in that flour! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda could not move from an inch, and Cawlin eventually found her, pulling her out of her hide. Fortunately for her, she was covered with the white powder and could not be recognized this easily. It took her all of her willpower to stay silent and motionless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? How did that doll got here? And what am I supposed to do with it?\" he said, holding the shrunken Zelda in his clutch. <br>\r\n\"I wonder if I'd rather sell it to that idiot of Beedle, that slingshot was really expensive...\" <br>\r\nBut suddenly, he...</span></div></div>",

Here she was, 6 inches tall and covered in flour, and now trapped inside the pocket of one of Groose's creepy friends while having to pretend to be a doll as to not be discovered. Oh how she wished to just be back at the dorm with Link, full sized or no, she'd not mind being small if it were with him. That said, she still wished for Link to take responsibility for shrinking her in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh..\" Zelda groaned as she landed on something sticky that she couldn't see in the darkness of the pocket. To make matters worse, every step that Cawlin took shook her whole world, bumping her into the same spot several times and getting her all sticky.

She knew they were way too high in the sky for her to escape, but given her current size, being at two or twelve feet above the ground did not really matter. She noticed how a wooden cage, fitting her size, was empty and left ajar. What could have been inside?  The answer came to her by itself when a pincer-shaped mouth snapped in her direction. The Horn Colossus Beetle had just found its dinner. Zelda proved agile enough to dodge its charge, before using its own cage as a shelter.

At her 6 inches of height, Zelda was far too big to be comfortable in the cage meant for a small bug. Even now, sitting alone in the corner of the wire cage, Zelda was feeling cramped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed before Zelda heard someone approach her cage. Zelda squeaked and stiffened up to look like a doll again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh? How did you get in there!?\" Beedle cried curiously. Beedle found his answer shortly, when the Horned Colossus Beetle crawled back up to the cage. \"So it was you, huh? Get back in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeedle pushed the insect with one hand, while his other opened the cage. Zelda gulped as she saw the giant bug enter her previously safe cage. But luckily for her, she didn't have to get comfy with her roommate for long, as Beedle swiftly picked up her shrunken form and pulled her out of the beetle's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's a relief!</i> Zelda thought as she was lifted into the air. But now that she was in someone's hand again, Zelda knew she had to stay as perfectly still as she could and keep her breathing slow, which was not an easy thing to do with a giant shopkeeper is manhandling her 6 inch body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Zelda's luck was on her side as the ride didn't take too long and Zelda was put down on the counter of Beedle's floating shop. Zelda landed straight on her back, which left her staring straight up at the ceiling of the small building, and she was too afraid to even move her eyes, lest she be discovered as the living, breathing Zelda instead of the doll that she'd convinced everyone that she was. Zelda tiny ears still worked just as well though, and she could hear Beedle talking with someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that'll be six hundred rupees!\" Beedle told the customer all too happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Quite the profit, huh, Beedle?</i> Zelda thought as the greedy merchant sold her for twice the amount he paid for her. <i>But I'm still worth more, you know!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a deal.\" The customer said. Zelda thought she recognized the voice, but wasn't sure. She wished she could just turn her head for a second to see who it was, but alas, she had to keep up her facade of being nothing but a small plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customer handed Beedle the rupees, while Zelda watched the two's arms make the transaction from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thaaank you!\" Beedle chimed cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you.\" The customer said slowly, Zelda could almost feel whoever it was eyeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customer grabbed Zelda quickly and carried her out of Beedle's shop in a hurry. Zelda groaned inwardly, both from the swinging motion of being held by someone while they were walking, and from wondering just how much longer she'd have to pretend to be a toy. Zelda thought she was going to feel sick, when all of a sudden, her new \"owner\" held her up to their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nearly gasped in shock when she saw that it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda was fully prepared to give Link a scolding, but as she freed herself from her oversized bedsheets, she noticed two things. One, Link was nowhere to be seen, and two, she was tinier then she'd been the night before. Her bed now looked like a massive expanse of white, and the covers she'd just crawled out of a gigantic, soft structure the likes she'd never seen, even on the surface. The shrunken girl gasped at her insanely enlarged surroundings, she was sure she was much smaller then before, feeling like a speck on her bed, she was sure she was less than an inch tall now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Zelda tried casting the spell she used to restore herself the night before, out of fear of her greatly expanded world. But, to her surprise, nothing happened. She tried again, getting frustrated, and again, now getting scared, but each time the result was the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... Why isn't it working?!\" Zelda panicked. She could feel tears welling up in her eyes as dark thoughts crossed her mind. She wondered if she was stuck at this pitiful size, while she had agreed to stay small, she certainly to mean to stay this tiny! She wondered if Link or anyone else would even be able to see her, as small as she now was. She wondered if Link even knew what had happened to her, and if he ever did notice her at her incredibly small size, that he'd be able to restore her to normal, or even doll-size. Zelda laughed a little at the thought, she felt so desperate now that even being just inches tall was preferable to this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No!</i> Zelda thought to herself, pushing those negative thoughts away, she tried to reassure herself. <i>I made it through the surface, I can make it through this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda took another look at the drop to the floor from her bed, just the walk there taking the minute woman a considerable amount of time. At her size it was a good 50 feet down. Zelda nodded to herself, and began climbing down. She wasn't sure what she could do by herself once on the floor, being so small, but she had to at least try. If she was lucky, Link might even already be aware of what he'd done to her and maybe, she thought wishfully, that he'd shrank her so much on purpose, as a prank, and was just waiting in the other room laughing to himself, and he'd come around the corner and reveal himself before growing her back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might forgive him if he did that...\" Zelda said aloud, eyeing the bathroom door hopefully. But as Zelda kept climbing down her bedsheets, it was becoming more apparent that Link hadn't intended to do this her and certainly wasn't just playing a 'prank' on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well... I guess it's up to me then...\" Zelda was about most of the way down her bed when...</span></div></div>",

It was confirmed when her once again giant-to-her boyfriend poked his head through the opening of the door. Zelda felt relieved that it was Link who had entered her room, feeling hopeful that he'd know all about how small she'd become overnight, and be able to reverse it soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time, Zelda was fearful of Link's massive size. Her beloved appeared more like the goddess statue that used to be part of Skyloft than any human she'd ever known, only magnified by an insane amount! Zelda felt like an ant as she watched him come in. Still though, she remained hopeful that he could help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Link! I hope he knows what happened to me!</i> Zelda thought as her enormous boyfriend entered her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way he carried himself, however, it seemed to Zelda that Link had no idea that she had shrunk so small, as he entered her room cautiously, as if not wanting to wake her. He looked then scanned her room for her, looking straight at her bed that she was currently trying to climb down. Seizing the opportunit, Zelda tried to get her monolithic boyfriend's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link! Down here!\" Zelda shouted as loud as she could, she even let one arm hang free to wave at him for added measure. But it was no use, her voice was far too small to carry all the way to her boyfriend's elf-like ears, and her body much too small to be seen from his comparative mile-long height. Zelda gulped as she started to wonder whether or not Link actually did know that she was the size of a speck on her bed and just waiting for him to help her like the hero she knew he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis became more apparent when Link, still showing no sign of acknowledging Zelda's presence, looked around her \"empty\" room for her, seemingly oblivious to her nearby self clinging onto a single strand of her bedsheet while desperately trying to get his attention. He walked around the room so cautiously, Zelda thought for a moment he might still know what was going on and was just being cautious as to not step on her. She could only hope, but things were confirmed when Link spoke up again, saying...</span></div></div>",

Are you in here?\" Link asked as he suddenly started walking more casual through Zelda's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zelda's heart dropped as she heard him say the words. Her worst fear had become reality, Link truly had no idea what had happened to her, he was clueless to the fact that she was shrunk down to an extremely miniscule, not to mention frightening, size and struggling to get down her own gigantic bed. But now she knew beyond doubt that she was on her own, and so decided that getting Link's help would be her first priority, though she wasn't sure how she would do that exactly, being so small and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda climbed downwards again and cursed inwardly, regretting teaching Link the shrinking spell without knowing the full details about it herself first. She couldn't blame Link for wanting to shrink her again, but if she'd known how powerful a spell the shrinking one was, she'd have thought twice about teaching it to him, instead keeping the shrinking magic to herself and shrinking herself for him when he asked. But as it was now, Zelda knew Link was her only hope of getting back to normal, again. So she kept on climbing down her sheets in the hopes of getting his attention any way she could at bug's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Maybe she's already eating breakfast?\" Link seemed to wonder aloud. His loud voice grabbing Zelda's attention, and she looked back at Link, then her eyes went wide as she saw Link start to move closer to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda panicked as the colossus moved towards her. If he got on her bed now, then at her puny size she'd likely go flying from the force. But with nowhere to go, Zelda did the only thing she could do, cling tightly to the strands of bedsheet she was on and hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, puzzled as to where Zelda could be, while thinking of how to shrink her down for fun when he saw her later, took a rest and sat down on Zelda's bed carelessly. He didn't flop himself down on the mattress, but even the gentlest of motions were enough to shake the tiny Zelda's world. Down below, the shrunken girl couldn't hold her grip tight enough and was knocked off of her bed and up into the air. Zelda closed her eyes and screamed as she got tossed around. Not knowing that she was about to land on...</span></div></div>",

The 3-inch tall girl ran over to the spellbook and climbed on top of it with some effort. She walked across the pages that were huge to her, reading the words for casting the spell intently. After a minute, she turned back to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Link, get ready, because here I come!\" Zelda squeaked, sounding quite cheerful all of a sudden. The doubts she had before seemed to now be erased from her mind, and Link could even swear there was a mischievous glint in her tiny eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you up to?\" He asked. Zelda just giggled and started casting the \"Final Rise of the Goddess\" spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic energies flowed through the tiny girl's body and she could the powerful spell starting to work as she hoped it would. Soon, Zelda's minute form started growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's working!\" Link sounded surprised, but happy for Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked up at him and smiled. Her growth continued for a moment before she got too big stay on the book, so she hoped down on the desk itself and sat by the edge of it. Now about a foot tall, and still growing steadily, Zelda crossed her legs and watched as Link and the rest of her room seemed to shrink before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going up!\" Zelda giggled excited to be returning to normal. Link was happy for her too, but still puzzled by what Zelda meant earlier when she said she had a \"better idea\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Zelda, you used the spell anyway? What did you mean before, then?\" Link asked his now 2 foot tall girlfriend, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" Zelda teased. A sudden growth spurt hit and Zelda grew a lot to 5 feet tall. She was now sitting comfortably on her desk like any other regular sized person might. A few moments later, Zelda reached her normal size and her growth subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back.\" Link said to his now full-size girlfriend. He was admittedly disappointed that she wasn't his little doll anymore, but glad to know that there was indeed a way to restore her size when they needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to you.\" Zelda replied. She leaned into Link for a kiss, which he obliged her with. Zelda smiled and hoped off her desk, now standing above Link, who was still sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all I get? How about the spell to shrink you with?\" Link asked, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! That spell! Let me find it right now...\" Zelda replied, and went to work flipping through the spell book for the right spell. Link watched her go through the book with bated breath, all the while thinking of how much fun he could have with her later with the shrinking spell. Zelda found the spell shortly and pointed down to it for Link to see. \"Here it is!\" She said in a sing-song tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\" Link wanted to shrink Zelda again as soon as possible, he didn't think she'd mind even though she'd only just been restored to her normal height. But, before Link could even get a look at the page, Zelda started speaking. Link turned around quickly to see her casting another spell, while looking right at him. At first, Link thought that Zelda might be shrinking herself for him again, but then felt something strange in his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Z-Zelda, what are you..?\" Link's eyes went wide as he felt magical energy surge through his whole body, and in the next instant, saw Zelda and the whole room rapidly expanding. Link gasped as he realized that Zelda was now shrinking HIM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like I said, I had a better idea!\" Zelda said, smiling down at her now shrinking boyfriend.</span></div></div>",

He wondered if this is what Zelda felt like when she was the smaller one, but he hadn't done anything like this to her while she was small.

Please!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stopped suddenly, jerking Link's little self to a halt. The 3 inch tall Link was so dizzy now he felt like he was going to throw up. But before he could recover properly, Zelda placed him down onto her desk, next to the spellbook. She laughed at him and went to sit down, nearly doubling over from her amusement at his plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Zelda, you're being far too rough!\" Link complained, holding onto his stomach to keep himself from getting sicker. \"You need to stop this now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

It's a good thing you're so cute though, otherwise I'd just have to get rid of you.\" Zelda teased her boyfriend, poking him in the stomach gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink groaned.

But he wasn't sure how much more \"playtime\" he could take from the cheerful goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just turn me back to normal, okay?\" Link pleaded with his giantess girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Zelda asked flatly, clearly getting upset with Link. \"I'm disappointed in you, Link. But I guess you only want to play when I'm the tiny one, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gulped. He didn't want Zelda to get mad or anything, he just wanted to take a break. He knew Zelda had a point though, and he wasn't even sure he'd be able to stop himself from wanting to get her tiny and in his hands again if she grew him back to normal.

Instead, he just turned the sink's cold water on and placed his hands under the pressure, giving Zelda a powerful, frigid shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!

But then she noticed that, worst of all, the spellbook had been ruined by the hot liquid. \"Oh no!\" She cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink ran over to the desk and set Zelda down on a spot that hadn't been spoiled by the soup. He and Zelda both looked at the book, but saw that it's pages had been shriveled up by the liquid setting into them, the book was now illegible. Link hurried and grabbed some towels to wipe it off, as Zelda sat down and stared in disbelief that the only thing that could restore her size had been destroyed, and it was all a result of her own foolish prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Zelda felt like she could cry, but reminded herself that she had chosen to remain tiny forever, for Link.

She did trust Link, but the bumpy ride was starting to get to her. So Zelda tried to stretch a bit and loosen up in the small space of the pouch, but when she did, Link took another step outside, causing the miniature girl to lose her balance and tumble to the bottom of the pouch. Or, at least she would've, but there had been a hole in the bottom of the pouch the whole time, going unnoticed by both Link and Zelda as it was so small, but to the 3-inch tall Zelda, it was large enough for her to fall through, and fall through she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waahhh!!\" Zelda screamed as she slipped out of Link's pouch unexpectedly. Luckily for her though, she landed on something soft. \"Ugh...\" She groaned as she got up and tried to get her bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda saw that she was indeed in the Bazaar now, but she wasn't sure where exactly. She looked down and saw that she had landed on a soft bag, she thanked her luck that it was there to break her fall.

But it was no use, the giant just kept on walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda hopped off the bag and hurried to try and catch up to him. She quickly saw that it was no use trying to match his speed, even with her nimble agility her little legs just weren't nearly fast enough to keep up.

But to her surprise, and embarrassment, she spotted Groose standing right beside the wall to her room, his ear pressed firmly into the stone. He seemed to be just as surprised as her, as when he noticed her standing there looking at him he quickly stood up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Groose!\" Zelda gasped, putting her hand to her mouth. Before Zelda would've been much shorter than Groose, but thanks to her enhancements, Zelda was now equal in height to the red-haired young man, if not a few inches taller. Just another surprise to Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, h-hey...\" Groose said awkwardly, and rubbed the back of his head. His face was glued to the floor as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Zelda noticed that Groose seemed to be sweating a little, and blushing even. An idea of what the red-haired brute was doing flashed in Zelda's mind. She started to get flustered, had he heard her cries of self-pleasure? She decided to play it cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What are you doing?\" She asked him. Groose quickly looked up at her and stared into her eyes, almost as if he was to embarrassed to look at the rest of her. His staring only served to make Zelda nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um... I was just l-looking for, uh, Z-Zelda...?\" Groose half-said half-asked in response. His eyes then went back to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?</i> Zelda thought, shocked. Did Groose not recognize her? She was standing right in front of him! Then it hit her, in her nervousness about being found out for playing with herself, Zelda nearly forgot that she now looked completely different then usual. <i>He doesn't know it's me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nearly burst out with the giggles at Groose's cluelessness. But then her mind went rapt with ideas of how to play this up in her favor. Zelda smiled big at this turn of events. She wondered how many other people would not recognize her in her sexier body.</span></div></div>",

Zelda couldn't help it this time, she let out an involuntary giggle. Groose heard it, and looked up at her with the most pitiful expression on his face. Smiling big time, Zelda decided to keep up her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak up, young man!\" Zelda yelled. She put her hands on her hips forcefully, causing her large breasts to jiggle slightly. She saw Groose turn a lot more red at the marvelous sight before him, and took delight in how her wonderful new curves worked on the opposite sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I mean.. Yeah, I was looking for Zelda..!\" Groose repeated, much louder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Zelda said. She put her hand on her chin and rubbed it, while also using her other arm to hold it up along with her chest, accentuating it. Her eyes drifted upwards, as she wanted to look like she was pondering her own whereabouts. Even though she couldn't see Groose like this, she could just feel his eyes on her. Zelda then had an \"Ah-ha!\" moment and snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you just missed her.\" Zelda said at last. She then saw Groose's eyes quickly dart up to hers. Zelda smiled warmly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, th-that's a shame, then..! I'll just be going now.\" Groose said and hurried to excuse himself. As he turned to leave Zelda, she caught a glance of the bulge in his pants and Zelda blushed despite herself. Had she really given him a boner just by him looking at her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Zelda called out to him, not really sure why she did. She never really liked Groose, since he was always such a jerk to Link and everyone, and was always pestering her as well. But something inside made her want to stop him now. Her thoughts turned past just teasing and into more sexual ones. She had to stop herself and wonder, had her new body hadn't changed her mind as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroose stopped in his tracks, but didn't turn around. Instead, he just stood there, holding the front of his pants. \"I've really g-got to, uh, go!\" He claimed, but Zelda knew the truth. The only question for her was, would she really go through with her new desires?</span></div></div>",

Along with helping with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroose went stiff as her other hand drifted downwards, two fingers stroking the bulge in his pants. Stroking turned into a firm grasp, her hand wrapping around his hidden manhood. Feeling it swell in her palm, Zelda licked her plump lips, giving them a faint shine that Groose couldn't help but stare at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-Well, I, uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe normally boisterous boy was at a complete loss for words, perhaps for the first time ever since Zelda had met him. His eyes darted around frantically, moving from her full, beautiful eyes down to her heaving chest before coming to a rest on her curled hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... wouldn't m-mind a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Zelda needed to hear. Pressing a finger to his thin lips, she let go of his manhood and, grabbing his hand, led him into the room she had just left. Pushing him through the door, she followed him in, making sure to lock the door behind her. After all, she wanted no unwanted visitors interrupting the two of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Maybe there's something to help us in here?\" Zelda suggested with a flirtatious wink. Groose merely nodded in response, hands folded over her crotch. He had snuck off to a corner of the room, attempting to make himself look small, something that wasn't working. \"Hmmm... This can definitely help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda wandered towards her bed, planting her plush backside on it and reclining. Staring at Groose, she smiled and beckoned for him to join her, something he hesitated in doing. But soon enough, he was sat next to her, hands still firmly covering his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, this certainly won't do...\" Zelda tutted, grabbing his hands and peeling them away from his groin. Her eyes went wide as a considerable tent formed, indicating to her that he was certainly packing down below. \"But that certainly will! Now, just hold still while I help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching over, Zelda wasted no time in pulling both his pants and underwear down, revealing the full extent of his penis. It was long, it was thick, and it looked absolutely delicious to her. No end of ideas of how to play with it ran through her head, ranging from her hands grasping the meaty rod, working up and down, to her lips closing around it, her tongue running along the meat in her mouth. But she could also skip the foreplay and get right down to it...</span></div></div>",

She had always wanted to be a mom, but she thought it'd happen with Link...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pregnancy was obviously progressing much faster than a natural one, but this was only the beginning. For, you see, Zelda's pregnancy was hyper. She would be having 10 babies as of now, though more could always form later. And, her pregnancy was accelerated- she would span a month in 12 hours, leading to her giving birth in 4.5 days. She was deep in her sleep now, sleeping through Link knocking on her door several times. Eventually, he pulled the old Loftwing trick that she pulled on him all the time, having his Loftwing drop a letter in her window. The letter landed on her face, waking her up roughly 12 hours after she first fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt different somehow, but couldn't place her finger on it. She opened the letter. \"Zelda, what have you been doing in your room all day? Meet me by the Goddess Statue, I just wanted to see you. -Link\". Despite him not talking much, at least he could write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda got out of her bed, feeling incredibly heavy. She looked down and found that her belly was the size of someone 9 months pregnant- and she was just a month into her hyperpregnancy. \"AHHH!! Wh-what.... what in the goddesses name....\" She was absolutely shocked. She ran her hand down her belly, surprised at how soft yet firm it was. Suddenly, she felt a kick. \"Oh!! Oh my God, am I.... pregnant?\" She was dumbfounded. How could this happen? She paced around the room, trying to keep her balance. Then, she spotted the empty bottle. \"Of course! The expansion.... maybe meant stomach expansion? How shocking. Wait...\" She found the bag. Inside was the second potion she bought.</span></div></div>",

No wonder that felt so good... Well, these will just get bigger the longer this pregnancy goes on. Therefore, this potion will go to here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand over her rump, Zelda uncorked the potion. With a steady hand, she slowly poured it over her panty clad backside.

Her hips grinded outwards, surpassing the width of her shoulders, until she had a wide set of child-bearing hips. Her backside grew rounder and softer, slowly devouring her panties. Her thick thighs inched towards one another until they were pushing against the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding a hand down her hip and towards one of her thighs, Zelda shuddered with pleasure. Ever since she had drunk that first potion, her body had felt so sensitive... And those feelings weren't being helped by the second and third options. Rather, they only intensified that feeling, making even the slightest of contact with her belly or lower body incredibly pleasurable for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling quietly as one hand caressed her gravid belly and the other groped her backside, Zelda found herself stumbling towards her bed. Falling onto it, she continued to touch herself, a hand drifting closer and closer to her most intimate area...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Zelda?\"<br>\r\nA knock at the door, followed by a voice, interrupted her. Reluctantly stopping what she was doing, she got to her feet and went to answer the door before pausing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't look like myself!</i> She thought, staring at the heavily pregnant pear-shaped woman in the mirror. <i>I can't let anybody else see me like this!</i><br>\r\nCoughing, Zelda tried to make her mature voice sound a little younger. <br>\r\n \"W-Who is it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice answered...</span></div></div>",

The question was however, how could she get to the Goddess Statue without being seen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe people truly wouldn't recognize her? If Groose didn't recognize her earlier, then she could be pretty safe now. She just had to play the part of a pregnant woman and sell it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put both hands on her stomach and rubbed it. It actually felt wonderful.... She had no idea how big she would get, though. Was she fully pregnant already? (Nope!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practiced walking around her room, her back leaned back a little bit to counterbalance her new heavy belly. As she leaned back, though, she her a tear- Her dress just ripped around her belly! \"Drat, what could I wear now?\" She checked her closet. She couldn't wear her signature dress, that would give her identity away. Finally, she found one of her mother's old dresses- and it was her maternity dress! \"Perfect!\" Zelda slipped it on, the pale yellow floral design complimenting her hair. She finally felt ready to go. She left her room and started her way towards the Goddess Statue, but she had to go through the Bazaar, which seemed pretty crowded. This was the moment of truth. She got in complete character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walked through the Bazaar, her belly aimed out a bit as she leaned back. With one hand to her side and one hand to her belly, she actually started drawing attention. People stared at her massive form, but didn't seem to recognize her. Someone came over and asked how far along she was, and Zelda panicked. \"Erm, I'm, uh, just about full term.\" Luckily, they bought it, and she made it to the Goddess Statue.</span></div></div>",

His feet and hands became smaller and more feminine. Link felt his face change as his lips became a bit more plump. His hair lengthened a tiny bit. His hips widened, and his chest tingled. Slowly, small breasts began to form and expand outwards from nothing to a C-Cup. He felt down towards his crotch to find that his dick had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had completely become a girl.

Zelda was surprised at how fast Link changed her mind on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same speed as Zelda's growth, the new female Link grew in height. She grew a few inches and her C cup boobs expanded to a DD cup. Her hair lengthened down to her elbows. She was now 22.5 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, you seem to be growing in the same intervals I did.\" Zelda observed. If this went the same way, Link would age another 6 years, then a final 5 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second phase was beginning as Link grew to the point where she was eye-level with Zelda's cleavage. Link's boobs expanded once again to an F cup, now 28.5 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final phase started and Link was now roughly the same height as Zelda with H cup boobs to match the princess's.

At first, she was sure he'd be able to help her stop that evil man, but as the days went on Zelda became increasingly worried about Ganondorf's search for the sacred realm, and she wasn't sure that the kokiri boy, Link, would be able to stop him in time. They just needed some time to put a stop to the evil warlock's plans, Zelda thought. She'd tried everything in her power to get Ganondorf thrown out of the castle, but nobody would listen to the young princess, not even her father, the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being dismissed by her father again, Zelda knew that she would have to do something herself. She was searching through the the royal library for a spell book that might help her. Zelda wasn't exactly a grand mage or anything, but she had been trained by some of the best wizards and sorceresses in Hyrule, so she was confident enough in her abilities. The thought that there might not be much time left to save the kingdom hounded her mind, and so she hurriedly looked for a spell powerful enough to give her some more time or an edge in the fight against Ganondorf. After reading through several advanced spell books, Zelda still couldn't find any time-related spells, although she did come across something else, a shrinking spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrinks any target down to any size imaginable..\" Zelda read the spells description out loud. \"Interesting. This could be just what I need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda studied the spell for a while. It didn't take long for the princess to memorize the spell, and she tested it out by shrinking a book to less than an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Zelda said happily. She bent down and picked up the tiny book, she examined it between her fingers. It wasn't even as big as her fingernail! \"This will be that evil Ganondorf's size soon.\" She thought, and left the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stormed into Ganondorf's chambers, and found him standing in front of his desk, he didn't even bother to turn around when she barged through the door. The young princess couldn't take his arrogance any longer, she approached the man, making sure to stomp her little legs loudly as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ganondorf!\" Zelda shouted, pointing her finger at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark warlock turned to face her. \"Ah, Princess.\" He said with a tinge of annoyance in his voice. \"How can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! You can leave this castle.\" Zelda snided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf shook his head and sighed. \"I know you don't care for me, Princess. But if I weren't here who would advise your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not here to help, and now I've had enough of your lies, Ganondorf!\" Zelda shouted. \"If you won't leave of your own free will, then I'm afraid that I must make you leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe than recited the shrinking spell she had just learned. Magic energy began to gather in the air, causing quite a bright, multicolored spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" Ganondorf shouted, he couldn't believe that the princess was capable of using spells as powerful as he was sure this one would be. Instinctively, he began chanting his own spell, a magic barrier, one that would reflect any spell cast on him back onto the user. He finished his chant just in time, the magic struck his body then just as quickly turned around and hit the young princess Zelda instead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few moments were a blur for Zelda, one second she was casting her spell, and the next she found herself looking up at quite possibly the biggest thing she had ever seen. But with her brief disorientation and the sheer size the thing in front of her, it took her moment to realize just what she was looking at, and when she finally did understand what it was, her heart sank. She was looking up at Ganondorf, from her point of view he appeared well over a thousand feet tall to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No... NO!\" Zelda cried, devastated that her spell had backfired. \"How!? H-He was supposed to shrink... Not me!\" Then it hit her, Ganondorf must've put some kind of reflective magic barrier at the last second, causing the shrinking spell to effect her instead of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda didn't know what to do now that she was so small, she was now wishing she had learned a growth spell, and she couldn't even try the shrinking spell again because of Ganondorf's magic reflecting barrer. Her first thought was to run away though, and she did. Running as fast her tiny feet could carry her she tried to escape the mountain-sized man who she just tried to shrink. She was terrified of his giant form, but she took one look back as she ran and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Link came back from the future to warn Zelda about Ganondorf's plans, the kingdom of Hyrule entered a long period of peace. However, most history books detailing the history of the land overlook the actions of another, mostly insignificant villain's plans to cause mayhem in the kingdom. That villain was known as Garland, a powerful but largely unknown evil sorcerer, who spent most of his time refining and creating spells. He resided in a small underground cave in Hyrule Field, not too far from Lon Lon Ranch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs coincidence would have it, he decided to take action not long after Ganondorf was arrested. Word of the Prince of Evil's arrest had spread throughout the kingdom, but it didn't bother Garland in the slightest. He finished creating a series of spells which he thought would be the first step to help him conquer Hyrule, but he needed a test subject to try them on. He eventually focused his sights on Princess Zelda: Not only would just getting to her already be a good test for some of his other spells, but he also liked to spread sorrow around: kidnapping Zelda would surely throw the kingdom into a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left his lair, having already planned every spell he would use to kidnap the young princess. When he reached the outskirts of Hyrule Castle, he used one of his newly-created spells to merge with his own shadow. This spell could also allow him to absorb people and items into his shadow, which made it perfect for the job. He slithered on the ground in shadow form, swiftly and quickly making his way to Zelda's bedroom, where he found the young princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was peacefully sitting by her desk, reading a book about various legends of Hyrule. She especially liked two legends: one about a hero from the skies who travelled through the land and fought an ancient evil to protect the reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, and one about another young hero's quest against an evil Minish wizard. However, before she could continue reading, she felt a strange, cold sensation near her feet. She looked down, and saw her legs turning pitch black as her shadow was quickly growing and enveloping her. She tried to scream for help, but her shadow was moving too quickly for her to do anything. By the time she realized what was going on, her shadow has started covering her entire body, causing her to lose consciousness. It was the work of Garland, who was in the process of absorbing Zelda into his own shadow, so he could kidnap her effortlessly. The young princess's shadow started to shrink just as quickly as it had spread over her. As soon as it was done, Garland moved out of the castle and returned to his lair, quickly and undetected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left his shadow and caused Zelda to reappear, before tying her to a chair so she wouldn't escape. The young princess was struggling a bit, but in vain as the ropes were too tight. An overjoyed Garland proceeded to introduce himself and taunt her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, hello, your young Majesty! I am the powerful wizard Garland, and this cave we are standing in is my lair! It is a bit small at the moment, but I intend to relocate to a much bigger lair, fitting a sorcerer like me! The shadow spell I used to, shall I say, \"invite\" you, is a mere fragment of my large repertoire of new and powerful spells, which will allow me, in due time, to conquer this fine land of Hyrule! You might be wondering why I brought you here, however, am I right? Well, that is simple: I need a volunteer to test my other spells on, and see if they are ready to be used for my plans. And with your permission, let us not waste any more time and start right away, with a de-aging spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started muttering an incantation, and raised his arms high in the air. Soon, he started glowing pure white, overflowing with energy. Zelda struggled even harder, but couldn't undo the ropes that were tied around her. After a short while, Garland threw his arms forward, pointed them at the young princess, and with a scream, released spell on her. It came out as a pure white beam of energy from the sorcerer's hands, and hit Zelda square in the chest. The young princess shook as if she was struck by lightning, and started glowing as the spell was running through her body. It was surprisingly painless, but it was nonetheless a very uncomfortable experience. After the beam wore off, Zelda started to feel dizzy, as she could feel the spell taking effect. Her hands and arms got smaller, and the rope that was tying them was beginning to loosen. Her shoes slipped off of her feet, which were getting smaller and slightly chubbier. Her head was also shrinking, and her facial features were getting even more childish than before. Her entire body was getting smaller, and even her voice was getting more high-pitched. She was getting younger so fast that within seconds, she looked like a toddler playing dress-up with her sister's clothes. She was approximatively around five years old, but did her regression stop there?</span></div></div>",

All in all, she looked rather unimpressed with Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Princess Ruto of the Zora!\"<br>\r\nAt the mention of her name, Ruto nodded. Uncrossing her arms, she finally returned Zelda's smile. However, in contrast to Zelda's natural yet nervous one, Ruto's appeared to be forced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto gestured for her guard to leave before walking towards a small table at the side of the room. Zelda did the same before nervously following her. Sitting down, the two Princesses stared awkwardly at one another for a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So...\"<br>\r\nZelda cleared her throat in preparation for breaking the ice, but stopped when Ruto slammed her webbed hand down into the table. <br>\r\n \"So, how's Link?\" She demanded somewhat angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-Huh?!\" Zelda stammered. \"I don't... What do you mean? He's gone to look for a friend of his. Is there a problem?\"<br>\r\nRuto snorted in response to the question. <br>\r\n \"I guess there is! And its name is Zelda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ruto's hostile tone, Zelda turned to the door, intending to call for her guard. However, Ruto quickly leaned across the table, slapping her damp hand across her mouth. Zelda struggled against Ruto's grip, but couldn't escape her strangely strong grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You tried to take my future husband from me!\" Ruto hissed. \"I gave him my mothers sapphire, meaning he is engaged to me! I can't have you around when he returns, so I've come up with a plan to neutralize you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching below the table, Ruto produced a small sapphire. Zelda's eyes widened as she recognized the familiar shape of it. <br>\r\n \"That's right... Zora's Sapphire. It's used to open the Door of Time, but if used by a royal of the race, I can slowly change them into a Zora!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto grinned as she pressed the Sapphire against Zelda's flat chest, where it began to glow with a bright blue light.

None so poignant than when Link told Zelda that he would soon leave the land of Hyrule. He said he was going on a journey to find a lost friend. She granted him luck with his decision to leave Hyrule. They'd had so much fun together the past summer. Zelda didn't want it to end but she would not stop him. Besides, she felt he'd come back one day. Still - she wished she could go with him, if only to be with him always; but being a Princess, she would not be allowed to travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the last day before he left, Zelda offered him a gift - a good-luck present. She gave him the Ocarina of Time; the precious heirloom of the royal family, and the mysterious instrument that sent Link on a journey beyond her wildest imaginations. Surely this precious flute could do so again. And if not...well it would help remind him of her. She felt no regret giving it up to him again; she knew she could trust him with it. And it would of course eventually lead him back to her, if only to return it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now our story begins. Zelda roused from her sleep, feeling strange. She awoke feeling a definite hollow feeling and her skin felt hard and smooth. She could not move a muscle, but she could still feel. She felt her body was much rounder, but asymmetrical, like she was oblong or potato shaped. What was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a warm and comforting feeling come over her lower body, but the feeling was joined with fear when she saw what looked like giant fingers wrap around her and lift her from her place - wherever she was. She felt herself turned until she saw the face of a giant Link. What was going on? Why was Link huge? Or maybe what if she herself was smaller? If that was the case, then she was somewhat gladdened that it was Link of all people to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda gave you to me,\" Link said to her. Why was he talking to her like that? \"I'll make sure that nothing happens to you. After all we've been through, it's glad to have you back again.\" Zelda could sense that Link didn't recognize her. She wanted to wave her arms to get his attention but she still couldn't move. Disheartened by the fact that whatever she'd transformed into, she clearly didn't have a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to look down at herself - difficult as she was unable to move her head, but her eyes were still at least mobile, she saw that her body was a light blue color. It was then that she realized the shocking truth - she had become the Ocarina of Time!</span></div></div>",

But something was different for her, she groggily opened her eyes and found herself feeling rather tired this morning. She couldn't get up out of bed so easily, which was strange for her, she was usually so alert, even in the morning. But for some reason, today she found that she couldn't muster the energy to even get up, let along out of bed.<br>\r\nSo instead, the princess decided to simply lay there and wait until she was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda yawned as she lay in her big, comfy bed. She tried to think about what went on the night before, but somehow she couldn't quite remember what happened last night. It was all a blank space in her memory, but she knew that something had happened, she just couldn't remember what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen at last, Zelda decided to not waste anymore time thinking about it in her bed, she was going to get up now. The princess sat up on her bed and felt a strange weight on her chest. She looked down and gasped at what she saw, her breasts were huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda covered her mouth with her hands and gasped again. She couldn't believe what she was looking at!<br>\r\n <i>How did this happen to me?</i> She wondered. Cautiously, she cupped her enlarged breasts, they felt real all right, not that there was any other way they could feel, she mused. But still, they were big and firm, and they stretched the top of her blue nightgown almost to it's limits, and they were hers.<br>\r\nThe princess tried to get a feel for how big they were, she reckoned they were about the size of watermelons! Not huge ones, but decently sized melons to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sat on her bed and mused over her bigger chest for a few minutes. She didn't know if she liked this change or not, they felt nice and firm, and the way they reacted to every touch of hers, oh the way they did! It was all nice and good, but she was a princess for crying out loud! She had always been very conservative about such things, and or course she had her reputation to think about here. Large breasts were not something people associated with her royal lineage. So even if she did like them, there was just no way she could keep them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, what a dilemma to wake up to...</i> Zelda thought as she continued to stare at her breasts. <i>I-I need to do something about this... But what?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda didn't know how to even begin with returning her breasts to their normal size. She didn't even know how they got so big to begin with! But regardless of all that, the princess got up off her bed and decided to try and figure this out, her new assets bouncing as she stood up. Zelda groaned at this, but nonetheless tried to get herself dressed. She found that she could just barely squeeze her new boobs into her usual blue dress. So she got dressed normally and was about to leave her room at last, when...</span></div></div>",

I just couldn't stop thinking about you, and I know you can't stop thinking about me, what little you can remember, at least. So I wrote this letter to you, just so you know what's going on. I'll be waiting for you at the same place you were last night, you probably don't remember, but that's in the cave next to Death Mountain, you know the one, just north of Kakariko! By the way, I hope you like your new assets! If you don't, don't worry, I've made it so when you finish this note, you'll enjoy them a little more!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fiend!\" Zelda said sharply. She grunted as she threw the note away in a fit of anger unusual for her. \"Whoever wrote this knows what has happened to me, and from the sound of it, enjoys it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked down at her pronounced bust. It made sense though, she thought, men would love such a thing after all. Hell, even she sort of liked the change in a way, since her new breasts were so sensitive. Oh how she wished Link was here, not only to help her get rid of this fiend, but to alleviate the aching pleasure radiating from her enlarged chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the princess, curious about what the last part of the note meant, grabbed her breasts again, groping herself and judging their increased sensitivity. She could tell immediately that they were more sensitive now then when she woke up just minutes ago, her touch nearly had her in heat. She panted, and quickly regained her composure. She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're even more sensitive now..!</i> Zelda thought. The princess took another look at herself to see if anything else had changed, sighing in relief when nothing different was immediately obvious to her. <i>At least they haven't gotten any bigger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda realized now that whoever was doing this to her was serious. Already the person had changed her again, With a spell or something else, Zelda didn't know how it was done, just that she had to find this person and get them to stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now where did that note say this fiend was?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda ran over to where she had tossed the note, her large breasts bouncing along majestically as she did; it seemed that gravity's only effect on them was to make them jiggle and bounce as enticingly as possible, as Zelda had noted before that they did not sag in the slightest. The way the princess's massive melons bounced caused them to rub against the fabric of her dress, and due to their magically enhanced sensitivity, caused the princess to start feeling aroused from even just the short strut across the room. But Zelda made it to note, although almost in heat just from the little jog she did, bending down and picking it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I don't get to the bottom of this soon, I don't know if I'll be able to stop myself...</i> Zelda gulped as she tried to collect herself, fanning herself with her hands. <i>Worst yet, I don't know if I'll want to!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calmed herself before checking the location of where whoever had sent the note said they would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cave next to Death Mountain, north of Kakariko?\" Zelda read aloud. She didn't remember ever going to such a place, but then again, she didn't remember much from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

Zelda slowly continued out into the entrance room. She peeked around a corner and saw that the place was packed with people, guards, maids, servants, all kinds of royal staff were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, no. There's far too many people...</i> Zelda thought, losing her nerve. <i>I'll never be able to sneak by like this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda snuck back into her room, where she let out a big sigh. Again she looked down at her enlarged chest, she couldn't believe how annoying such a thing could be to her, she sighed again. But she couldn't just give up now and hide in her room all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr could she? No, she thought, she couldn't take the risk of whoever had done this to her somehow making more changes to her body. She'd have to get to this person today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda went into her closet again and pulled out a raggedy, old looking cloak. It was one that she'd sometimes use to disguise herself and walk amongst the people of Hyrule incognito. And now, Zelda was happy to notice as she put it on, it also happened to be big enough to adequately cover her bigger bust. Well, only somewhat. Zelda's huge breasts put the cloak to the test, bulging it outwards in the chest area, but not so much that anyone would think twice about it without looking closely. But Zelda didn't think that would be a problem; any guard who stared at her chest too long wouldn't be working at the castle for too much longer anyway, so she didn't have to worry about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her figure concealing cloak on, Zelda made her way out of the castle. The hallway was still empty, no problems there. But then she made it to the entrance room. Guards and such were stationed all over the place. Zelda kept her cool, avoiding contact with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The disguise is working!</i> Zelda thought to herself as she made her way across the large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd work it did. Most of the staff didn't think twice about her outfit, as most already knew about how she liked to go to town sometimes, and whenever she did so alone, she always wore that cloak. Although a few people did see her and say hello or smile, she just smiled back and nodded at them, and they kept going. Not one person in the room seemed to notice the princess' enlarged breasts.<br>\r\nZelda smiled, her first genuine smile since the start of her day, she was going to make it after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still smiling to herself, Zelda rounded a corner. She sidestepped a guard, who apologized before continuing on past her. She was getting close to the exit, the inner courtyard visible through the open doorway. She could hear the yells of soldiers training, a welcome sound considering she was trying to leave undetected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she drew level with the doorway, she came across what was effectively the final test. Two of her most experienced guards, ordered to keep an eye out for her by her personal maid, Impa, who took her security seriously. As Zelda neared them, she could feel their eyes lock onto her. Lowering her head, she paused when they crossed their spears across the doorway, barring her from leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Your Majesty,\" One of them rumbled, looking at Zelda. \"You know the rules\".<br>\r\nSighing, Zelda looked up. Of course they'd recognize her escape attempt. <br>\r\n\"I do know the rules. However, I believe the rules no longer apply as Ganon has been defeated. Very little out there poses a threat to me,\" She said. <br>\r\nThe guards looked at one another. It was true that nothing would harm her, not if they wanted to live. Zelda basically had a direct line to the Hero who vanquished Ganon. She could summon him at will, although he wouldn't have the Blade of Evil's Bane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Princess. And what should we tell Impa should she ask?\" One of them inquired. <br>\r\n\"Tell her I'm... unwell?\"<br>\r\nIt wasn't exactly a lie. Enlarged breasts was an illness, right?<br>\r\nThe guards nodded, removing their spears from the door. As she passed, they banged them off the ground and came to attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she passed by, she didn't realize that her cloak was trailing slightly, and one of their spears had caught it. A couple of steps later, she felt her cloak pulled from her body, and let out an \"Eep!\" as her body was revealed to the entire inner courtyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire courtyard fell silent as they all turned to look at their Princess. Zelda swallowed nervously. She crossed her arms over her melon-sized breasts and slowly walked through the courtyard. She did her beat to ignore her bouncing breasts and the uncountable amount of stares she was receiving from her soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until she heard a ripple of laughter did Zelda finally break into a run. Her breasts bounced madly, almost smacking her in the face, as she ran out of the courtyard, tears almost streaming down her face...</span></div></div>",

After dealing with them Link quickly rushed to the boulder pulling it off the princess to see if she was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon picking up the Boulder Link was quite shocked to see a paper thin princess laying on the ground.\"Oh god Zelda please be okay\" Link said worryingly. He was about to pull a fairy to revive Zelda with only for Zelda to come off the ground completely okay... Well besides being flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda are you okay\" Link said to the paper thin princess.\" Ugh... Oh hey Link how are you doing\" Zelda said in a dazed tone. Link peeled Zelda up holding the princess in his hands as she recovered from her dizziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh what happened to me\"Zelda said in confusion. Link explained everything the had happened after she got crushed. Upon understanding, the two then though about how they would get her back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they got their answer as Zelda body popped back to normal. Though surprised at first,Zelda and Link had been happy that Zelda was back to her normal 3 dimensional self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then concord that the spell must of been what caused Zelda's body to flatten out so she could survive being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Zelda then decided it would be best to continue their journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo they make it to the dungeon, or is there problems along the way?...</span></div></div>",

Coming up with a plan to destroy Calamity Ganon was hard work, and Zelda wanted a rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda and Link arrive in Kakariko Village. Link decides to cook them dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass. Dinner is ready- some seared steak, both a favorite of Zelda and Link's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so brave, Link. You're a fantastic Champion, and I could never do your job!\" Zelda laughed, and Link followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Zelda saw something shining in Link's arrow bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to be some sort of green, glowing arrow unlike any she had ever seen. All she knew of were normal, fire, ice, shock, bomb and ancient arrows. But a green one? She didn't know any existed. Link didn't seem to know how it got into his bag either, but there were bunches of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we try it?\" Zelda suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, the duo made their way to the Dueling Peaks. Link stealthily walked up to a Bokoblin camp, and shot one of them with it. He struck the Bokoblin square in the head, and suddenly the creature's head grew. The poor thing couldn't even stand, but before it had a chance to collect itself, Link shot it in the head again. This time, the head shrunk down to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Zelda exclaimed. \"It changes the size of things! I wonder if there is a limit to it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both agreed that it would come in handy, and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 3:00 AM, Zelda snuck to Link's arrow bag. She took the green arrows and a bow outside to do some more... \"testing\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have always wanted a better figure. Bigger breasts, bigger ass, slimmer waist.....\"</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better work!\" She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Zelda try to do?</span></div></div>",

She didn't want to wake him in the event that she decided to... inspect her body. Clutching the glowing arrow, Zelda left their small campsite and headed for a small cluster of trees nearby. It was close enough that if she was attacked, all she had to do was shout and Link would be there, but not so close that she could wake him by talking regularly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here...\" Zelda said to herself, walking behind a tree and losing sight of Link. Grabbing the hem of her tunic, she pulled it over her head, revealing her new breasts and exposing her upper body to the cool night air. The chill caused her to shiver slightly. <br>\r\n\"Oh, wow. It's rather cool out here at night...\"<br>\r\nDoing her best to ignore the cold, Zelda cupped one of her breasts. Each one was firm and round. Her bra, which had been made for her old breasts, was drawn tight. Reaching around, Zelda loosened the garment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better!\" She exclaimed happily. \"Now, what to do next?\"<br>\r\nLooking down at the arrow, a smile appeared on Zelda's face. If the slightest touch had did this, then what would a more prolonged one do?<br>\r\n\"Time to find out what you can really do!\" Zelda said to the arrow, picking it up. She briefly inspected the glowing arrowhead before she pushed it down the middle of her breasts. Heat began building in her breasts. It wasn't a painful kind of heat, but a more pleasant kind. After a moment, however, it began to grow uncomfortable, causing Zelda to yank the arrow away from her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassaging her breasts in an attempt to dissipate some of the heat, the tingling feeling from earlier returned, only it was much stronger this time. Looking at her breasts with anticipation, a smile appeared on Zelda's face again as she felt her bra quickly dig into her now swelling breasts. As she watched, they quickly grew to the size of her head, where they didn't stop. A couple more seconds, they reached the size of Hydromelons. Still not slowing in their growth, they finally ripped through Zelda's bra, the garment falling to the ground and revealing Zelda's growing melons to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a solid minute of non-stop growth, Zelda's breasts finally stopped. She grinned as she inspected the massive orbs that sat on her chest. Each one was perfectly round, with absolutely no sagging. Reaching her arms around them, she found that it was a slight stretch in order for her to do so. <br>\r\n\"This is simply magnificent!\" Zelda gasped as she brushed against one of her erect nipples. \"I wonder if the growth properties would work on any other body parts?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pondering her question, Zelda shivered. She was wearing nothing to cover her upper body, and she was beginning the feel the cold. Looking down at her tunic, she knew that it wouldn't fit due to the size of her breasts, but it would keep her warm. Pulling it over her head, she was surprised to find that it almost fully covered her upper body, the only part of her body not covered was a small part of her belly. She also found that the material her tunic was made from was rather... pleasant... As it rubbed against her bra-less breasts. Ignoring the feeling, Zelda stooped down and scooped up the arrow which she had dropped when the heat had gotten a bit too much for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose the only way I'll answer this question is to experiment on myself. Not that I'm complaining about it...\" Zelda muttered to herself. \"The most logical choice would be my backside, so that the weight of my breasts is counteracted by the weight of my backside\".<br>\r\nBefore she tested her theory, she poked her head around the tree to check on the camp. Link was still sound asleep, and no danger was present around their campsite. Pleased, Zelda retreated back behind the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning her neck to look behind her, Zelda partially saw her round backside, which, before she had decided to play with the arrow, had been her most prominent feature. She had caught Link, among others, staring at her lower body on multiple occasions. Each time she caught him, she chastised him while secretly pleased that he had been taking note of her. Sometimes, she just felt invisible to her knight. <br>\r\n\"Well, after this, I most certainly won't be invisible!\" Zelda said confidently, grabbing the waistband of her black pants and pulling them down to her ankles. The cool air of the night collided with her backside, once again causing Zelda to shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching the arrow, Zelda gently touched it against her ass before pulling it away. She waited a moment before a familiar tingling was felt. She felt her backside grow slightly heavier before stopping. <br>\r\n\"So, my theory was true. Well then, I should even this out...\"<br>\r\nHolding the arrow in between her cheeks, Zelda waited until the growing heat became uncomfortable before pulling the arrow away. As she did, she noticed something different about it. <br>\r\n\"It's not glowing any more?\" She noted. The green glow, once bright, had faded to a very faint glow. She guessed that the arrow's power had waned given that she had been using it almost non-stop, but decided to hold onto it rather than throw it away. It might recharge over time, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the arrow against the tree, Zelda felt the tingling return. She grinned as her ass swelled in size, each cheek quickly growing to resemble her breasts in size. To her surprise, her hips grinded outwards to accommodate her large backside. They stopped when they were wider than her shoulders. <br>\r\n\"This feels great!\" Zelda exclaimed, running a hand over her firm ass. \"It's a pity that the arrow no longer functions. Or does it? I suppose I never really checked...\"<br>\r\nGrabbing her pants, Zelda pulled them up, or tried to. When she came to her ass and hips, she had to use quite a bit of force to get them to fit. And when she did, it wasn't long until she heard a couple of rips appear in the black fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if you still function, or if I'll need to find a new one...\"<br>\r\nClutching the arrow, Zelda decided to hold it against her backside again. If she had a bra to support her massive melons, she happily hold it against them again, but at their current size, her back was already beginning to ache. <br>\r\nAs she held the tip in between her cheeks...</span></div></div>",

The tip burned against her flesh, making her want to scream out in pain. However, her body wouldn't respond. Instead of instantly removing the heated arrow, she held it there, paralyzed by some unknown force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda let out a groan as her new chest began to feel odd. She managed to force her eyes downward, just in time to see her melons begin to shrink. <br>\r\n\"No!\" She managed to get out, her eyes widening as her breasts began to shrink even faster. Within seconds, they had reached their original size and they didn't stop there. Zelda struggled to remove the arrow when she felt her backside surge forth. Each one of her melon sized ass cheeks filled with... something. Zelda quickly came up with a theory: That the energy contained within the arrow now resided within her body, and the arrow acted as a magnet for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she couldn't test her theory, as she was still frozen. A number of rips cut through the silence of the night, telling the frozen princess that her pants had reached their limits. Swelling larger and larger, she began to feel very off-balance as her breasts shrank away to nothing. Her beanbag sized ass pulled her backwards, Zelda falling onto her new makeshift chair. Hitting the ground caused her ass to ripple and jiggle, as well as breaking her immobility curse. She yanked the arrow away, even though her backside had stopped its growth a couple of seconds ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the arrow, Zelda's hands flew to her flat chest. She ran them over the area where her breasts had once been, disappointed to find that she now had absolutely no chest to speak off. They then travelled to her new backside. She felt the very strained fabric of her pants, along with flesh bulging through multiple rips. She was in two minds about her backside. While it was incredibly heavy, there was no way Link could miss her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I should return my body to normal,\" Zelda finally said. \"Although, I suppose I could experiment a bit more...\"</span></div></div>",

The first thing she did was touch the tip to the spot where her breasts had once been. She let out a groan of discomfort as the energy rushed to her breasts. They swelled larger, until they were slightly bigger than they normally where. Her backside having shrunk back to a manageable size, Zelda got to her feet, wobbled slightly and dusted herself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then!\" She said, spinning the arrow between her fingers. \"Let's see what this can do!\"<br>\r\nReaching the tip down, she gently tapped her thighs. Another groan escaped her lips as her backside shrunk again, the energy travelling to her thighs. They grew thicker and thicker. Soon, they were pushing against one another, as well as pulling her pants tight. <br>\r\nZelda couldn't see her body, but she could feel it. Even standing still, she could tell that she was very bottom heavy. Her hips flared outwards, forcing her arms out slightly. Her backside was still large, flesh bulging through the rips in her pants. Her thighs were like meaty columns, thick and wobbly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting... It does act as a magnet for the energy,\" Zelda noted, inspecting the arrow head. \"If only I had additional arrows in order to test how much energy a person could store... No matter. I wonder how many places the energy can travel to?\"<br>\r\nDeciding to try somewhere obscure, Zelda tapped her thin arms. She was used to the energy running through her now, remaining silent as her arms began fatter. Her breasts shrank down, becoming small bumps on her chest, as her arms began to tighten her tunic sleeves. They grew until they resembled tree trunks, where they stopped. Lifting one, Zelda found that, oddly, the energy carried weight. She groaned as she tapped her breasts again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The energy shouldn't be that heavy... Unless it takes on properties of other things stored in the human body? Perhaps fat?\" Zelda guessed, adjusting her tunic as her breasts returned to their enhanced size. \"One final test before I return to camp\".<br>\r\nLooking past her breast, Zelda tapped her flat stomach. Unlike the other growths, this one felt... good. Euphoric, even. <br>\r\nShe let out a moan as her thighs shrunk back to their original size, along with her breasts and her backside. Her pants, still tight on her original backside, slackened somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tunic, however, began to tighten. Her belly lurched forth, forcing the hem of it upwards and revealing the bottom of the swelling belly. Zelda moaned again, pleasure beginning to build in her body. This felt so good, she never wanted it to end...</span></div></div>",

One hand was glued to her ample bust, fingering her hardened nipples and squeezing her breasts. The other hand massaging her growing belly, which made her look slightly pregnant. She let put a quiet moan as it pushed outwards again, forcing her tunic upwards even more. Her belly was an odd mix of firmness, like she had just stuffed herself with way too much food, and softness, like a layer of existing flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as her belly button poked out from under her tunic, her attempts at alleviating her pleasure clearly weren't working. She needed more, she needed...<br>\r\nStill massaging the swelling orb that was her belly, Zelda's other hand grabbed the waistband of her ripped pants and yanked them down. Her hand immediately flew towards her white panties, pulling them down her legs and revealing her pussy. She extended two fingers, gently pushing them in and out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked. Zelda shivered with pleasure, gradually increasing her speed until she could go no faster. Her belly still grew, making her look almost nine-months pregnant. <br>\r\nShe moaned and groaned as her belly stopped, yet she didn't. Her massaging hands moved up to her breasts, dropping the arrow as they did. She instantly began rubbing one of her breasts, playing with her nipples which hardened under her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and the Princess orgasmed. Juices ran down her leg, forming a small pool on the ground. Amazingly, she had managed to stay somewhat quiet, so she didn't rouse Link. <br>\r\nAs her pleasure melted away, Zelda breathed heavily. She cleaned her hands before pulling her panties and pants back up. After dressing her lower half, she rubbed the orb that was her belly. Even touching it caused her to bit her lower lip.

The rustling then followed her, slowly catching up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I can find more of these odd arrows soon,\" Zelda said, rolling the dull-tipped arrow between her fingers. She had took a couple of precautions with it, such as wrapping the tip in a makeshift leaf cover. Just in case she accidentally caused a movement within her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared the camp, the rustling caught up with her. Hearing a twig small behind her, Zelda stopped. Against her better judgement, she turned around. <br>\r\nNothing moved. The wind blew quietly through some leaves, making them sound as though someone, or something was following her. <br>\r\n\"I suppose it was nothing,\" Zelda shrugged, turning around. She was within sight of the camp when, all of a sudden, she felt herself yanked backwards. A rough sack was forced over her head, causing the Princess to let out a gasp. Before she could call for Link, she felt the hilt of a sword connect with the back of her head, causing her to black out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda awoke with a groan. She felt horrible, and the spot where she had been hit was absolutely killing her. <br>\r\n\"W-What happened...\" She asked groggily, trying to look around the dark room she was in. After a moment, her eyes adjusted, and she saw that she was in a rather dingy cell. There was a tiny window with bars on it, which allowed her a view of the moon. A wooden door with an even smaller window was across from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to push herself up, Zelda heard a chain clink. Looking down, she saw that a lock was securely fastened to her ankle, making it impossible for her to move more than a few feet. <br>\r\n\"Who did this?!\" She demanded, raising her voice. \"I demand to know who captured me!\"<br>\r\nHearing a lock turn, Zelda looked towards the door to find that...</span></div></div>",

She had expected the Yiga Clan to be behind her kidnapping, not some of Hyrule's dumbest enemies. The Bokoblin chattered at her in its own language. If they could learn Hylian, then this one had clearly skipped that lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand you,\" She said simply. <br>\r\nApparently, this was a massive insult to the Bokoblin, as it grabbed its wooden club and screeched at Zelda. She recoiled back as far as her chains would let her, one hand instinctively going to her pregnant-esque belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Bokoblin came within striking range of her, a voice rang out through the small cell, causing it to stop. The voice sounded somewhat human, yet spoke in the gruff language of the Bokoblin. <br>\r\nTurning around, the Bokoblin left her cell, much to Zelda's relief. Her hand dropped away from her belly, only to quickly move back to it when another Bokoblin walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the other one, which was red, this one was a brilliant silver. Also unlike the other one, this one looked somewhat intelligent, its eyes studying Zelda with interest. <br>\r\n\"Who? You?\" It croaked out in broken Hylian, causing Zelda to gasp. Never had she expected a Bokoblin to learn a different language... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? You?\" It repeated, visibly irritated. <br>\r\n\"I am...\" She decided against using her full title. \"I am Zelda\".<br>\r\n\"Z-Zeda?\"<br>\r\nShe shook her head. <br>\r\n\"No, Zelda. Say it slowly,\" She told the Bokoblin. <br>\r\n\"Zel...\" It started to say, before stopping and scratching its head. <br>\r\n\"Da\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda?\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded, smiling at the silver creature. <br>\r\n\"Yes, that's it!\"<br>\r\nThe Bokoblin tilted its head curiously, before copying Zelda again. She made a face as it bared its dirty teeth in a crude smile. <br>\r\n\"May I ask who you are?\" She inquired, trying to be friendly. Sure, Bokoblins were the enemy, but maybe if she befriended some of them, she could escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" The Bokoblin pointed to itself. \"No\".<br>\r\nZelda thought about its response for a second. While it knew Hylian, it wasn't well-versed with it. So, she decided to change her tactic. <br>\r\n\"Me. Zelda\". She pointed to herself. \"Who? You?\" She pointed at the Bokoblin. <br>\r\nThe Bokoblin shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Perhaps they don't have names like us...\" Zelda whispered to herself. \"Okay... I'll call you Silver\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter teaching Silver to say its own name, Zelda decided to go for broke. <br>\r\n\"You. Let. Zelda. Out?\" She asked, hating how she was forced to speak like one of them. <br>\r\nSilver shook its head. She was obviously way out of line, so much so that Silver left her cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" She cried out. \"Come back...\"<br>\r\nZelda hung her head, tapping her belly.

Their primary function<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is to immobilize the target by drastically enlarging the limb/limbs impacted by the arrow. The effect is only temporary and <br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 swelling will go down slowly over the course of 2 hours, or if the affected target is hit with another arrow. The arrow head is<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 made with a mixture of Luminous Stone, Goron Spice, and Monster Extract. Yellow Chu Jelly is added to boost the effect and make it<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 temporary.The mixture itself functions similarly to the Arrow but the effect is permanent, and swelling will be much less severe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use in combat is not recommended.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was greatly surprised to see that she had all the ingredients in her study, she expected at least one to be hard to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a lot of information\" Zelda thought silently \"Maybe instead of using one of the arrows I could make that mixture myself, then I won't end up so sore after any more of these horseback expeditions, and I wouldn't need to use any of these incredibly situational arrows... and I won't have to tell Link why some of them are missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>What Will Zelda Do Next?

She grounded all the ingredients together to make something the consistency of a cream. It was green and glowed with the same tint as the strange arrows her and Link had mysteriously found. She grabbed her roll of measuring tape, can't say her habit of holding onto odd tools weren't helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess snuck back to her room, past Link, asleep, guarding the door and locked it. No-one would be interrupting her at this hour, but just in case someone did show up she would be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to her mirror and turned around, Pulled out her tape and took some measurements for her notes before setting it on her nightstand. \"This may be for personal pleasure, but I can at least make it sound like it was done in the pursuit of knowledge!\"she took the cream that she had been saving, slipped her hands down her pants and began to rub it onto each of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" She felt a wave of pleasant heat come from where she was applying the cream. \"Guess that's the Goron Spices, heh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pants began to slowly but surely tighten around her butt. What little wrinkles her pants had began to slowly disappear as her pants were drawn taut around her hips. The cheeks pressing against the fabric made Zelda want more, but she kept her wits about her and decided to let this run it's course. As her butt grew, her pants stretched from the ever increasing mass held within.   Her hips were almost as wide as her shoulders now and it kept getting better, with her pants still in the game. Her pants were starting to get pretty tight, and she wasn't wearing her underwear... she could feel the pants beginning to pull into her groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why these pants were made this strong, and I honestly don't want to\" She let out a squeal of pure bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pants where starting to get <i>very</i> tight. She could see a camel-toe beginning to form on the surface of her confinements. She noticed her hips were officially wider than her shoulders and that her pants were beginning to compress her squeezable mounds. The seams were nearing their final moments just as the growth slowed to a halt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did it stop?\" her demeanor wavering, her breathing was scarce, her heart was pounding in her ears. \"Well, let's see just how much bigger I've gotten\" She picked her roll of measuring tape back up from the night stand and took new measurements. \"Wow, my butt at least <i><b>doubled</b></i> in size during that\"  She sat down on the floor in front of her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Hylia, it's so soft!\" The princess shouted. She quickly covered her mouth. \"I hope I didn't wake Link up with that\" She crawled slowly to her door and stuck her ear up to it, and she let out a sigh of relief that she could still hear Link snoring away outside of her room. \"Thank goodness, I almost woke Link Up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess thought to herself for a moment \"Hmm, I did justify this by saying that I would do this as a gift for him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>So What Will Our Heroine do Now?

Unable to hold back her \"secret\" any longer \"Link, look at me, notice anything different?\" The Young man studied Zelda's face for a moment pondering what she meant. \"Oh Hylia you're so dense.

Then more thoughtfully, \"I suppose I could use some counterbalance... It's really starting to throw me off.\" Hands cupping the bottom of her rack, she gave them a small squeeze, considering what it would be like if they were bigger. Quickly realizing how much she likes the idea, she quickly undid her belt, causing it to drop to the floor. The pouch hitting the ground with a satisfying <i>thump!</i> As she went to retrieve the cream, she lifted her now free shirt up, bunching it just underneath her breasts. She didn't want to expose them. At least, not yet. And she wasn't wearing any underwear up-top either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of the cream in each hand, she reached under the bottom of her shirt.

We're back home!\"<br>\r\nHyrule Castle Town, the capital city of Hyrule, loomed in the distance. Having spent the past couple of months touring Hyrule after Ganon's defeat, Zelda was happy to be back. When they had left, a massive workforce were busy repairing the town and the castle. And she couldn't wait to see how things were going. <br>\r\n\"Come on, Link! Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding into the castle stables, Zelda had a massive smile on her face. Castle Town was almost back to its former glory, except for the fields in the west. As for the castle, it wasn't in the best state. However, the two rooms Zelda had asked for were fixed. Link's room had been fixed, as had her own and her study. After handing her horse over to Link for him to feed, Zelda hurried to her study. Purah had asked her to participate in a study, which she had readily agreed to. All she had to do was drink a potion, and observe the effects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking her study door, Zelda placed the vial on her desk. It didn't look like anything special. It was a clear liquid, not too different from water. However, unlike water, it fizzled occasionally, bubbles rising to the surface where they popped. <br>\r\n\"Well... Down the hatch!\"<br>\r\nZelda lifted the potion to her lips, drinking the small vial in one large gulp. It had no taste that she had ever had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited...</span></div></div>",

The vial that had held the potion fell to the ground, shattering. <br>\r\n\"Whoops...\" Zelda managed to say, turning around and gripping the edges of her desk. She really didn't feel good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to feel worse and worse, she didn't notice that Purah's Potion was beginning to take effect. As Purah had, accidentally, de-aged herself to a child of about six, the potion she had created was meant to add some years back. However, her curiosity had gotten the better of her, plus she had grown attached to her new form, so she had given it to Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing away from her desk, Zelda managed to stumble towards her mirror, where she let out a gasp as she saw what was happening to her. <br>\r\nAs she watched, she began to grow taller, until she around the same size as Link, who had been a couple of inches taller than her. Her golden hair, reaching half-way down her back, grew longer and longer, stopping when it was touching the bottom of her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her tunic tighten, she looked down to see her pert breasts swell and push forth. They grew quickly, stopping when they were similar in size to her head. <br>\r\nFeeling her pants tighten, Zelda's hand went to her large lower body. She felt her waist narrow and her hips flare outwards. Her backside grew rounder and rounder, pushing her pants to their absolute limits. She had always been bottom-heavy, and as such, her lower body had grown the most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Zelda almost didn't recognize herself. Breasts that were the size of Hydromelons. A narrow waist and child-bearing hips. The only thing that told her that she was still Zelda was her backside, which was still soft to touch and very large. <br>\r\n\"I can't let anybody see me...\" Zelda said worriedly. \"What if they don't recognize me?\"</span></div></div>",

Especially if her ass, the only thing still comfortable in her form tight outfit, is the only recognizable thing. Only perverts would know who she is! Her clothes are tight from her increase in height but still cover her. Her firmer stomach is peeking out just the slightest due to her large breasts taking more of the blue cloth. Her boots are tight against her toes due to her feet growing a tad bigger. <i>\"I must be at least twenty by now...\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to head back to Purah, hopefully her work might help me.\" Zelda mutters as she grabs a dark cloak her chair. It covered her body well enough and with everyone being busy they shouldn't try to mess with an unknown person at sunset as they prepare for the next day....hopefully. Purah has been working on the age reversing rune before her embarrassing transformation into a six year old. She stopped working on it afterwards unfortunately.

Deciding to leave like normal, the now twenty year old princess decides to exit her study to the main hallway. The hall was still lighted with a orange glow from the setting sun signaling the end of day as lighted torches align the worn stone walls. Going forward Zelda sees two guards clad in leather bearing the emblem of the royal family. They are more volunteer soldiers till Zelda can start having someone train them. The two men have yet to see her which gives her time to plan ahead. Her voice hasn't changed...much so she could easily convince them she is going out. But they may choose to alert other guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact she might have easier time going though the servant's quarters...the place is ruined and in disrepair meaning less people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking a deep breath, Zelda prepared herself to face the guards. Technically, she hadn't been seen by anybody except Link and the Sheikah Tribe in just over one hundred years, but the people of Hyrule probably knew enough about her to recognize her. Even with her cloak, it would be a challenge to sneak past them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step towards them, Zelda stumbled. One of her hands shot out, pushing against the wall to steady her, while the other flew to her head. She let out a quiet groan as her vision began to darken and she began to feel light-headed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, not again...</i> Zelda thought, beginning to lean heavily on the wall. <i>I need to get back to my room...</i><br>\r\nClumsily spinning on her heel, she slowly retreated to her room, relying on the wall to keep her standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling into her room, Zelda managed to kick the door shut with one of her feet. She rolled into her back, her chest rising and falling as she gasped for breath. She felt drained all of a sudden, something she found odd. Her first change hadn't made her feel so tired, just light-headed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down, Zelda saw her breasts begin to swell, telling her that her changes had restarted. Her already enhanced bust pushed outwards, commanding more and more of her blue tunic. She weakly grasped at the hem of it, trying to keep her stomach covered, but her hands quickly fell to her sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her, Zelda felt her backside resume its growth. Her fertile hips grinded outwards, while her ass grew rounder. However, as Zelda poked a finger into her swelling ass, she noted with disdain that it was much softer now. Her last growth had made it firm, while now she could dig her finger into it a fair bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her assets swelled, Zelda was aware of some less obvious changes happening to her. Her boots were much tighter, indicating that her feet had once again grown. She could feel her body stretching, while there was an odd sensation pulling at her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes felt like they lasted for an eternity, but in reality she lay there for a few minutes at most. As her vision returned and her head began to feel normal again, Zelda slowly got to her feet. She was almost scared to look at herself in the mirror...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp escaped her mouth as Zelda reached her mirror. She ran her hands over her bountiful breasts, which had taken even more of her tunic in place of a bra. Each breast resembled a Chu in size, and they were just as soft. Zelda gave them a light squeeze, and had to grit her teeth to prevent herself from moaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her hands down, she poked her firm stomach, which felt a little more muscular them before, before sliding her hands over her hips. They were such wider than her somewhat shoulders and, alongside her thin waist, round breasts and full ass, gave Zelda an envious hourglass figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her hands fall to her sides, Zelda forced her gaze away from her breasts. She was slightly taller, probably an inch taller than Link now, while her boots felt ready to burst. The lower half of her slim stomach was visible, while her pants felt incredibly tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I must be around... Twenty-five? Twenty-six?</i> Zelda estimated, inspecting her slightly longer nails. <i>I'm completely different from what I'm supposed to look like! There is absolutely no way I could sneak out now! I mean, I look as though I stole this outfit and am now dressing up as Princess Zelda! How am I meant to her out of here?</i></span></div></div>",

The question is, how do I go about it? I could try contacting Link and get him to bring her to me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to her desk, Zelda pushed some papers aside. After making sure that she was settled into the castle, Link practically vanished from Hyrule each night without fail. None of the other races had reported seeing him in their respective territories, and scouts she had sent into the field to follow him reported losing his trail at various points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his apparent disappearances each night, Zelda had managed to track his whereabouts after countless hours of research. However, contacting him proved difficult for Zelda, who had lost much of her power after her one hundred year battle with Calamity Ganon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick attempt at telepathic communication, which returned nothing but a heavy silence, Zelda let out a sigh. <br>\r\n<i>I suppose I shall try to sneak out... Hopefully nobody pays too much attention to me. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her dark cloak, Zelda pulled it into her body and immediately ran into a number of issues. First, her increase in height meant that the garment, which covered her entire body at one point, left her tight boots uncovered. Second, her chest and backside looked out of place, causing the front and back of the cloak to bulge outwards suspiciously. And finally, the hood no longer fitted over her head, leaving her more feminine looking face and longer hair on full display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So much can go wrong with this plan</i>, Zelda thought. <i>But I have no alternative. I must get out of this castle!</i><br>\r\nOpening her door, Zelda peered down the corridor. The two guards from earlier were still stood there, their armour and weapons gleaming in the setting sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here goes...</i><br>\r\nShutting her door behind her, Zelda kept her head down as she walked towards them. As she neared them, she heard them whispering for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<i>Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Highness!\"<br>\r\nThe pair stood to attention, clumsily saluting her.<br>\r\n\"Carry on...\" She muttered quietly, intending to quicken her pace and hurry by them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Princess?\"<br>\r\nZelda reluctantly stopped. <br>\r\n\"I'm gonna need to ask where you are going at this time?\" One of the guards asked nervously. \"I-If you don't mind, that is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing nervously, Zelda shuffled backwards slightly. Only when darkness fell over her did she look up to answer. <br>\r\n\"Urgent summons from Purah,\" She answered, trying to keep her voice level. \"I won't be back for a few days\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards looked at one another. <br>\r\n\"We weren't told about this, Your Highness,\" One of them said. <br>\r\n\"V-Very urgent!\" Zelda repeated. \"She contacted me just now, you see!\"<br>\r\nThey looked at one another again before nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Your Highness! Enjoy yourself out there!\"<br>\r\nWith a gracious nod, Zelda hurried past them, making sure to keep her head down. <br>\r\n<i>That was too close</i>, she thought as she rounded the corner. <i>Hopefully, the rest of my route is empty...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the corridors, Zelda was pleased to find her chosen route devoid of any guards. However, the more she walked, the more she came to dislike her new body. Her feet, contained within a set of boots that were much too small, were killing her. Her back, forced to support a set of chu-sized breasts, was killing her. And the way she swung her wide hips in order to walk, the way her ass bounced and rippled within her pants... Hylia, she despised it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding a corner, Zelda saw the main gate come into sight. Beyond that sat the half-ruined Castle Town, which was still in the process of being built. However, if she reached it, then there was little chance of her being recognized, especially with her new body...</span></div></div>",

She knew this voice, and she wasn't too eager to meet its owner...<br>\r\n\"Identify yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Zelda's heart sank. The Captain of her own personal guard stood before her, a serious look on his face. Once upon a time, he stood a good foot above her. Now however, she came up to his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, identify yourself!\"<br>\r\n<i>He... doesn't recognize me?</i> Zelda though, her hope of an easy escape rapidly vanishing. <i>The captain of my own guard, and he doesn't recognize me?

Maybe she should downgrade his sword if she survived this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...\"<br>\r\nZelda began to introduce herself, and then stopped. Would he even believe her? If somebody that looked almost ten years older than her introduced herself as Princess Zelda, she definitely wouldn't believe her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no way out of this...<br>\r\n\"Captain Corrim!\" She said in her most regal sounding voice. \"I am Princess Zelda Hyrule!

I command you to let me past this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda had never been one for pulling rank, but considering the situation, she was going to have to. Captain Corrim listened to nobody but her and Link, and in her case, she had to sound like she knew what she was doing before he would obey. Plus, she had used her full name. Not many people were aware that her last name was just the name of the country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, Captain Corrim stood still, his mouth agape.

Doesn't he?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Highness!\"<br>\r\nIn one swift motion that would've made Link proud, he had sheathed his sword, fixed his slightly tilted cap, stood to attention and saluted Zelda. <br>\r\n\"My deepest apologies!\" He said, bowing his head low. \"I did not recognize you in this low light!

I assumed that it was safe, that any effects would be minor at best. Instead, I got... whatever this is. I hope to fix this before any further changes occur\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrim took another long look at her body. Zelda watched his eyes, just in case they lingered for too long on certain parts of her body. Unfortunately for him, he gazed for a second too long at her heavy bust, and received a swift slap from Zelda for his actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his cheek, Corrim nodded in understanding. <br>\r\n\"Of course, Your Highness. That would explain why you would be leaving the castle so late at night... However!\"<br>\r\nHis tone changed suddenly. Zelda took a step back in surprise, not expecting the sudden shift in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does not explain why you are heading there alone! You are aware that monsters still roam the fields, yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Captain, I am perfectly aware-\"<br>\r\n\"Then why are you heading alone?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda let out a sigh. While Corrim was incredibly effective at his job, he sometimes took it way too seriously. Just the other day, he had insisted on personally escorting her to the dining hall for lunch. She had maintained that there was no need for her to be escorted from one side of the castle to the other, but he wasn't having it. In the end, Link had been forced to step in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link will be meeting me at the gates,\" Zelda lied. \"I expect that you know about his nightly disappearances?\"<br>\r\nCorrim nodded. <br>\r\n\"I ordered him to fight during the night. Monsters are much like us, using the night to rest. Link sneaks in, and takes them all out. An effective plan, according to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrim was silent for a few seconds. <br>\r\n\"I see...\" He finally said. \"That does sound like Sir Link. Well, Your Highness, I won't hold you up any longer. Do arrive at Hateno Village safely, won't you? And apologies again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrim saluted her before marching off towards one of the guard towers. Zelda watched him disappear into it before making her way towards the main gate. <br>\r\n<i>Finally!</i> She thought, relieved to be free of her overly clinging guard captain. <i>Now, just to get through Castle Town, and I'll be home free...</i></span></div></div>",

Even so, she was taking no chances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite it being dark, Castle Town was as full of life as it would be during the day. A couple danced near the fountain in the centre, which had been one of the first things repaired after people had made their way back into town. On the other side of the fountain, a small band had stuck up an unfamiliar tune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her head low, Zelda made her way past the fountain. <br>\r\n\"Hey! Lookie here!

Who doesn't want a free drink?!\" The man exclaims drunkenly. Zelda tries to escape, but even with her older body she fails to shake away from his grasp. Before long, she is dragged into the tavern the smell of alcohol fills her nose making her scrunch up her face. Several people are dancing or lying on the floor thanks to the fast music being played, one of them being a guard. <i>\"I'll have to set <b>firm</b> rules on playing around while working, it seems. Once i take care of this problem.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, i really need to get going.\"Zelda says politely but firmly as the scarred man forces her to sit down. The man seemingly gets the message as his scarred face seems to finally realize her words as sits on a wooden stool nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.....party pooper. Please though have one drink! Please!\" The man waves his hand and a drink come down the table, being surprisingly skillfully caught by the drunk blue hair man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looks down in the tall wooden mug, a dark red reflection staring back at her. If she wasn't worried about the effects of the potion on her, she would proudly say her older face has become beautiful. Her long hair adds an allure, which is why this drunk dragged her in the first place. Her wise eyes look at the drink in slight distain. She stares at the other drinks noting that others are all the same rusty brown with none being the same as hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ordered something special for such a sweet thing such as you! Once you're done your free to goooo!\"  The man slurs at the end, his breath making Zelda back up the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, as long it's just one.\" Zelda sighs, knowing that this is her only way to get out of here without making a scene. She could use some of her magic, but it would cause a panic. Grasping the wooden handle, the princess brings it to her mouth taking a small sip. Tasting something sweet yet sour, Zelda takes an another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she watched, he quickly downed his own drink, slamming the tankard down and letting out a satisfied belch. Zelda leaned back, anxious to avoid the invisible stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you've drunk?!\" The man demanded drunkenly, leaning over to peer into her tankard, which was still near full. \"You ain't a lightweight, are you?\"<br>\r\nZelda didn't answer, instead electing to look everywhere but at him. <br>\r\n\"Silence says it all, sweetheart!\" The man chuckled. \"Another one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tankard filled to the brim was set down in front of the man. He downed it just as quickly as the first, which resulted in yet another revolting belch. Zelda leaned back while taking another sip of her own drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, only one way to help with that!\"<br>\r\nZelda let out a yelp as her tankard was ripped from her hands. Despite the sickly sweet taste, the drink had been starting to grow on her. Not enough to make her crave it, but just enough for her to tolerate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" She said, clearly irritated. \"I thought you wanted me to finish that?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. But you ain't drinking quick enough! You gotta drink fast to enjoy it! And you ain't enjoying it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Probably because I don't want to be here, especially with somebody like you!</i> Zelda though indignantly.<br>\r\n\"You gotta drink it like...\"<br>\r\nHe paused and took a look around the bar. Zelda copied him, doing her best to follow his gaze. He looked at the bartender, who was at the other side of the bar. He then looked at some guards, who were too busy playing cards and drinking to be of any use. He finally focused on Zelda, who glared back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\"<br>\r\nWith surprising speed, the man grabbed Zelda's cheeks and squeezed. Her eyes widened, and she was fully prepared to slap him when his other hand shot out and grabbed hers. Before she could ready her other hand, the man began to pour her drink into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda initially choked as she resisted the urge to swallow. After a few seconds, she reluctantly began to drink down the red liquid. Even then, she began to choke on the taste, which was amplified immensely by the quantity flowing down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Zelda, who hated everything about this, the man seemed to be enjoying himself. He giggled every time she struggled against his grip, chuckled every time she coughed, causing the liquid to spit out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the last drop flowed down Zelda's throat, he stumbled away from her, a massive smile plastered across his face.

More enjoyment!\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded in response, lifting her tankard and finishing off her drink. She slammed her tankard down and signalled for another drink. Within seconds, another was set in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning on her third drink, Zelda felt great. Her first drink had been mediocre at best. Now, it tasted much better.

However, as the liquid began to run down her throat, her vision darkened. Lowering her tankard, she swayed slightly on her seat, something that she couldn't attribute to her drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No... Not here! Not in front of everybody!</i><br>\r\nLooking around the tavern, Zelda's rational mind quickly returned to her. She shouldn't have been slacking off in here, and now she was going to pay the price. Even if she could hide her aging process from the tavern, there was one person who would definitely notice it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, sweetheart?\"<br>\r\nJumping as Burlon's hand grabbed her shoulder, Zelda looked at him with worry. <br>\r\n\"N-Nothing at all!\" She said quickly. \"J-Just need some fresh air! Yes, that's all! If you'll excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to move past him, Zelda felt his grip tighten. <br>\r\n\"Fresh air, huh...\"<br>\r\nShe swallowed nervously. Eyeing the nearby guards, she wondered if they would still be able to do their jobs when drunk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a great plan, sweetheart! Lead on!\"<br>\r\nGetting up from his seat, Burlon pushed Zelda towards the door. With no other options, she reluctantly stumbled towards it. One hand clutched her head, while the other helped steady her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn him!</i> She cursed silently. <i>He couldn't leave me alone, even for five minutes?!</i><br>\r\nAs Zelda marched out of the tavern, she shivered as the cold Hylian air hit her. Even with her cloak, nights were still quite cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, Burlon seemed to be having no problems with the cold. Rather, he seemed more energetic. He whistled happily, leaning next to the door. Zelda couldn't help but notice that he was keeping an eye on her. He had started out friendly enough, but now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled. Leaning up against the wall for support, Zelda turned her back to Burlon. Keeping her growth secret would be hard enough without him peering over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling pressure build within her, Zelda looked down. She was expecting the usual changes she had come to expect. A bigger bust, a rounder ass, wider hips and maybe a few changes to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts and backside did grow, however their growth was barely noticeable. What was noticeable, however, were the small rips and tears now beginning to appear on her overtaxed clothes. Between her new curves and new height, all her clothes were struggling. Her tunic no longer covered her belly button, her pants were clinging to her like a second skin, her boots were painfully tight and the hem of her cloak now only reached down to her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the rest of her body, such as her face and height, Zelda wouldn't be able to make out any changes without a mirror to help. She didn't feel any taller, and a quick touch of her face didn't reveal any huge differences. At a guess, she had probably aged another couple of years, leaving her at twenty eight years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really need to get going</i>, Zelda thought as she inspected her longer nails. <i>Before Burlon hauls me back into that tavern again...</i><br>\r\n\"You've been awful quiet, sweetheart!\"<br>\r\nZelda let out a yelp as Burlon spoke right next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't do that!\" She said, clutching her chest. <br>\r\nBurlon grinned in response.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Burlon, I must get going. I have... business in Hateno Village, and I must leave Castle Town as soon as possible. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I hope we meet again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Zelda turned around. She began to head for the gate, but a couple of steps later, a hand grabs her shoulder. Letting out a gasp, she turns to face Burlon...</span></div></div>",

She highly doubts the guards will come due to their past foolishiness. Good for the princess as Burlon has yet to notice her aging. His eyes seem unfocused and he seems unbalanced as he sways the slightest. <i>\"I really need to get going, like a couple hours ago.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Burlon but this is a very personal matter. My....\" Zelda tries to find the right words. Though the aging process has helped her sober up, her mind is trying to find a good excuse. \" My life is at stake here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is also very true.

I owe you for those drinks and getting me out of debt!\" Zelda raises her brow a bit. Debt? She never cleared Burlon's debt did she? Maybe somehow she did. She did toss out high value Rupees after all. Honestly, she thought he was following her in order to get into her pants. She still thought that but was surprised that this maybe out of debt drunk was more then he seemed. But she still can't have him following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though it would seem she would have no choice but to deal with him or she could use some of her weakened magic. It should easily take care of Burlon in his current condition.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zelda could get some here, but she rather not waste even one more second in Castle Town if she can help it. Taking several careful steps in her extremely tight boots, Zelda notes that torches have been lit and the sun has almost completely set as few stars start to appear.

One had his head bobbing up and down with each breath and the other was snoring loudly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cGods I\u2019m thankful, but also so disappointed as well.\u201d</i> Zelda mentally sighs as she takes several queit steps. She couldn\u2019t help the small noises that she made with each step. Her toes were fully curled inside her boots making it only possible for the princess to step a little loudly. It takes more time then she would have want thanks to her clothes resisting some movements but she manages to sneak past the sleeping men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I get back I think I\u2019ll have Link take over their training for a week.

Thankfully, she runs across no one as she travels possible because it is at night. She needs to make as much progress as possible in order to make up for lost time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHateno Village is at least five days on foot. If I manage to get a horse that would be good and only take at least three. But that may require a detour I may not have time for.\u201d Zelda thinks to herself. The distance is vast but she must cover it quickly, every moment counts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way Zelda slowly figures out how well her clothes that fit her younger body deal with their current situation. Her butt and breasts that once bounced the slightest now don\u2019t as they are squeezed tightly. Her sleeves traveld up her arms barely covering past her elbows, several long tears align the sleeves as they protest against their older owner. Her stomach is cold against the cold night as well. Every bend and twist is met with a slight protest warning Zelda of her clothing predicament at each moment. Her boots are the worse however, she has loosened them fully but she still can\u2019t pull her feet out, they were stuck in her boots!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sighs tiredly, the princess rather keeps going but for some reason she feels extremely tired. Mostly likely a combination of events led to this. <i>\u201cI dislike it but I have to stop here for the night. Monsters are also active even more at night so making a fire should keep most of them away.\"</i> Except for the stupid ones of course but Zelda received reports that monsters have been avoiding fires of late from Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon and the stars shine brightly as Zelda goes about her business there are few trees around the plains but at least kindling and wood is easy to find. The fire will be easy to start as soon as she collects enough and the leaves, grass, and her cloak should keep her warm in the cold weather. The wind is fair and should help with a fire and some sticks are large enough to make a torch if she decides to continue at later tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda starts to gather careful of the way she gathers wood as she does. Her clothes refuse to let her bend down fully as they are forced to bend to her curves and bigger breasts. Sometimes her large breasts get so squished that she has hard time breathing. <i>\u201cI hope I find a merchant on the way to Hateno Village, or else\u2026Gods I should have just bought some clothes at Castle Town!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continues to gather wood, Zelda hears something out of the ordinary\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite the best efforts of her clothes to stop her from bending over, she had gathered a decent amount of wood. While she was no Link when it came to survival in the wilderness, she probably had more than enough to last her the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading slowly back to her makeshift campsite, Zelda stopped when something caught her eye. It twinkled at her in the undergrowth, beckoning her closer. Curious, she took a couple of steps towards it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"<br>\r\nZelda's eyes widened as she discovered the source of the twinkle. A silver rupee, seemingly polished, had been discarded in the undergrowth. She had no idea why somebody would discard such a valuable rupee, but she wasn't going to complain. It would replace the rupee she had spent in the tavern earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her excitement, Zelda temporarily forgot about her stretched clothing. Storing her collected wood under one of her arms, she bent over, her other hand reaching out to grab the rare rupee...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RIIIIIIIIIIIIP*<br>\r\nShe stopped. For a few seconds, she was completely still as her face began to turn red. Only when a chilling breeze blew past her, lifting her cloak and whisking past the new hole in her pants did Zelda begin to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Hylia!\"<br>\r\nCursing in her traditional manner, she instantly straightened up. Her free hand flew to her backside and began to inspect the new rip. Unlike the others, which were negligible, this one was an actual hole directly over the top of one of her cheeks. Her ass, finally given an outlet, bulged through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a face redder than a red Bokoblin, Zelda crouched down and grabbed the rupee. Shoving it into her pocket, she hurried back to her camp, her exposed flesh bouncing and wobbling with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing some of the wood into a stone out she had prepared earlier, Zelda did her best to move her mind away from the stupid mistake she had made. Grabbing a bit of flint she had happened upon, she grinded it against a knife Link had practically ordered her to carry. Sparks flew into the air, and with another few strikes, a small fire had sprung up in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this small triumph, Zelda now faced a new problem. Her clothes were tight enough to prevent her from sitting next to the fire. And while her crouching pose didn't threaten her clothes, it was incredibly uncomfortable. There was no way she could just crouch next to the fire all night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" She cursed again, looking down at the warm flames. \"What I'm Nayru's name am I meant to do?! I can't sit, I can't bend over... I suppose I could lie down... But, ugh... I don't really want to ruin these clothes. They're the only ones I've got, and it's bad enough travelling in these. Mud would just make it unbearable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing the muddy ground, which was covered in twigs, leaves and a few white stains that looked suspiciously like bird droppings, she gave a reluctant shrug. If Link could sleep through a storm, complete with lightning that actually tried to target his sword, then she could sleep atop some mud and bird droppings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I suppose I could... No!\" <br>\r\nShe tried to wave another idea from her head, but despite her best efforts, it lingered. It involved just stripping out of her clothes, leaving her in just her underwear and probably her boots, and...<br>\r\n\"No, stop it, Zelda! You are a Princess, and cannot be seen naked in front of Hyrule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing her arms under her bust, which caused a few rips in her sleeves to widen, Zelda looked down at the small flame...</span></div></div>",

Her first thought, understandably, was about Link, and how he had found her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the whinnies began to sound closer to her, she began to pick up on another couple of sounds. The sounds of wooden wheels creaking and spinning, the sound of mud being kicked up, and the sounds of a carriage driver grunting as he fought to kept his horses under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering through the murky darkness, Zelda saw a faint light approaching her. The occasional shadow flitted in front of it, presumably the people within the carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank Hylia!</i> Zelda thought happily. <i>Maybe I can persuade the driver to stop and give me a ride!</i><br>\r\nDoing her best to ignore both the rain, which was beginning to steadily increase, and the chilly wind, which blew past her exposed stomach, wrists and face, Zelda stepped into the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They can't miss me if I stand here</i>, she thought, standing slightly off to the side, just in case they somehow did miss her and then trampled over her. Clothes would be the least of her worries if that happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the carriage neared her, Zelda began to wave. She frowned briefly as she heard another few rips from under her arms, but ignored them. If these people had clothes in her size, then she could finally get rid of these heavily tattered ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uh... They aren't stopping?</i><br>\r\nRealization almost hit Zelda too late. Just before she was trampled by two brown stallions, she dove aside. Landing heavily in the mud, Zelda let out a groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am going to take a long look at the rules of the road once I'm back to normal</i>, she thought, looking down at her arms. <i>So much for avoiding the mud...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit down the road, the carriage came to a halt. Looking up from the mud, Zelda saw the door swing open. A shadow stepped out of the carriage, looked around for a few seconds before spotting the fallen Zelda. <br>\r\nThey said something to the carriage driver, who nodded, before heading towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drew closer, Zelda made out a few details about the shadowy figure. First, they were definitely female, with a chest about half the size of Zelda's. Second, they were dressed like one of the nobles that marched around Hyrule Castle like they owned the place. And third, they looked somewhat irritated that they had almost run over Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mysterious noble reached Zelda, she kneeled down and inspected her for a few seconds.

She had slightly tanned skin, with hair as golden as those gold rupees that used to be in circulation. Her ruby red eyes held irritation as they connected with Zelda's green eyes. And the part that really worried Zelda and helped identity the mysterious noble was the tattoo of an upside down eye that surrounded her right eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A Yiga Sorceress!</i> She thought worriedly.<i> I hope she doesn't recognize me as Princess Zelda. I hate to have to do this, but...</i><br>\r\nThrowing her head down and holding her hands up in forgiveness, she muttered through gritted teeth, \"Please forgive me, Ma'am. I didn't realize you were a noble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress let out a cold laugh. <br>\r\n \"What, you thought another stripper such as yourself could afford a carriage? Grow up!\"<br>\r\nZelda grunted as she felt the woman's boot force her head down even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But what is this? Perhaps you aren't the stripping pig I originally thought you were! Look up at me!\"<br>\r\nFeeling the boot retreat, Zelda was still for a moment. <br>\r\n<i>I think she might have recognized me...</i> She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I said, look up at me!\"<br>\r\nLetting out a yelp as she felt the woman yank her hair up, Zelda found herself looking into the cruel eyes of the Yiga. <br>\r\n \"Why, I believe I've caught myself a Princess!\" She said gleefully. \"Apologies, Your Highness! I didn't recognize you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm not... Princess Zelda!\" Zelda lied, her hair still being gripped tightly. \"I just look like her!\"<br>\r\n \"Uh-huh.

Must I go on?\"<br>\r\n \"Take... a closer look!\" Zelda insisted. \"I'm way older than her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing her eyes, the sorceress leaned down.

He'll be right back, and when he sees you threatening me, you'll be incredibly sorry!\" Zelda said bravely. <br>\r\nUnfazed by Zelda's threat, the woman smiled. <br>\r\n \"Is that so? Then I welcome the challenge. How does that knife of his do against dark magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Pretty well?\" Zelda responded with confusion. \"It's the Blade of Evil's Bane? You know, the sword forged in the three sacred fires and blessed by the Goddess Hylia, giving it the power to repel darkness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Forgive me. I meant to ask how it fares against the magic of the dark God Ganon?\"<br>\r\n \"Still pretty well.

He was sealed up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling at Zelda's response, the woman threw her head into the mud. Before Zelda had a chance to lift it out, a boot pressed down on her head. <br>\r\n \"Nobody appreciates a know-it-all, my dear Princess. Especially a Yiga Sorceress who was blessed by her god with powers mortals such as you couldn't even comprehend! Let your Hero come! I've got the perfect spell for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The Master Sword -\" Zelda had managed to lift her head out of the mud, and was prepared to explain that the Master Sword could reflect the spell right back at her, but the woman slammed her boot back down. <br>\r\n \"-Is powerless to stop me!\" She roared. \"Its power has waned since it was first forged, all those years ago! Interrupt me again, Princess, and I'll prepare a spell for you as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda fell silent. <br>\r\n \"Good! Now, summon your knight for me!\"<br>\r\nThe boot moved away, only to replaced with a hand which gripped her hair tightly. <br>\r\n \"He isn't here!\" Zelda insisted. \"I was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Disobeying my orders now? No more chances, Princess. I was hoping I wouldn't have to do this, as it makes my job of finding that wretched hero a lot harder, but you've left me with no choice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her face was returned to the mud for the umpteenth time, Zelda hears the woman begin to mutter in Yigan. While Zelda was well-versed in Hylian, Sheikan and Ancient Hylian, her knowledge of Yigan was very limited. The only word she recognized from the whole chant was 'The', and even then, she could have been wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...Bos!\" The woman finished, pressing a finger into Zelda's spine. Zelda writhed as pain shot through her body for a few seconds. It soon retreated, leaving a dull throb in its wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What... you... do...\" She gasped, using all her strength to push her head out of the mud. <br>\r\nThe woman grinned.<br>\r\n \"Remember what I called you when we first met?

Her arms could barely support her and she could just about recall what she had been called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Close, Princess, but not quite there!\" The sorceress cackled, kneeling down. \"But I suppose these two things go hand in hand. If you are a peasant, then this is a viable job option. And if you're one of these, then you are most likely a peasant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing again, the Sorceress reached down Zelda's back and stoked one of her generous ass cheeks. Gasping with pleasure as she felt the finger gently brush against her backside, Zelda, once again, tried her best to recall the names she had been called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>P-Peasant... Um, what else... P-Pig? Yeah, that sounds vaguely familiar... Was there something else?

She hummed a suggestive time as she did, a smirk stuck to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stripping me is meant to help?</i> Zelda thought, still struggling to think. <i>Wait... Stripping... Did she call me a stripper?</i><br>\r\nSeeing the realization on Zelda's face, the woman removed her hand from Zelda's partially uncovered ass and began to clap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well done!\" She said mockingly. \"Looks like you finally caught on! Yes, the Princess of Hyrule will slowly become a stripper! How will your faithful subjects react to that? Well, I suppose I know how the men will... But the ladies? Those stuck up nobles? Your own faithful knight? Oh, I simply can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling to herself, the Sorceress returned her hand to Zelda's backside.<br>\r\n \"But of course, a stripper must have something... eye-catching... to strip with, as well as a matching mindset. And that's where my spell comes in... Ah, but I won't spoil the surprise. It looks like some of the changes are already beginning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling fingers dig into one of her ass cheeks, Zelda groaned as she felt warmth spread through her body. It was mainly focused in her breasts and backside, the reason for which soon became apparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger gripping her backside slowly began to dig deeper and deeper into her ass, while her breasts, which were currently surrounded by thick mud, began to make more room for themselves in their prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to move as her assets swelled even larger, Zelda let out a groan of disbelief. Her, a stripper?! Even the thought of it turned her face a bright red. And yet, despite trying to push it from her mind, it kept fighting its way to the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh? Is the idea appealing to you?\"<br>\r\nThe Sorceress had picked up on her embarrassment and had apparently mistaken it for arousal. <br>\r\n \"Perhaps I can help speed up the process? After all, acting as a stripper will accelerate your changes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Zelda by the neckline of her shirt, the Sorceress effortlessly yanked her to her feet... </span></div></div>",

Drops of rain pelted down onto her face, causing her to blink madly as a few assaulted her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look at me, dear...\"<br>\r\nFeeling a hand grab her chin, Zelda's head was pulled down so she was staring directly at her Yiga Captor. A cruel smile adorned her beautiful face while her red eyes glinted with malice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perfect! Now, don't you worry your pretty little head about what's about to happen. I assure you, no harm will befall you! Yet, anyway.

Her vision went dark as something, presumably a bag, was yanked down over her head. Her arms and legs, both feeling like dead weights, were tied together and her body effortlessly lifted. Hearing a carriage door creak open, she was rather unceremoniously thrown inside. There was a brief chuckle, the slam of the door and then silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying face down on the wooden floor, Zelda was aware of a few things. Firstly, the carriage was moving at quite some speed. Every bump they hit caused it, and her, to shudder slightly. Every so often, she heard the rider, who are guessed was the person who had bagged her, spur the horses on, but that was the only sound she heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, her body was still growing, albeit incredibly slowly. Her breasts continued to swell, adding more rips to her already battered tunic and pushing her slightly further from the floor. Behind her, she could feel her even more torn pants growing ever tighter. And while they were still swelling, she could feel both her breasts and backside firming up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, her head still felt indescribably fuzzy. If anything, it was even harder now to form a coherent thought. As soon as she thought of something, it was whisked away and returned to the fog slowly enveloping her head. Strangely, however, certain thoughts about various people, such as Link and the Sorceress, weren't taken away from her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point during her kidnapping, Zelda drifted off. Much like her thoughts, it was an oddly fuzzy nap filled with weird dreams of her dancing in front of a faceless crowd. When she was roughly shaken awake, she found a slight smile on her face which she, unfortunately, couldn't hide fast enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh-ho! Looks like our new entertainment was having some pleasant dreams!'<br>\r\nOutside the carriage, the Sorceress who had captured her giggled. <br>\r\n \"Don't you worry! Soon, those dreams of yours will be reality! Now, up you get! Need to get you ready for your first big show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her by her tunic, Zelda allowed herself to be led down a fully lot corridor. As she walked, she felt her breasts and backside, both of which had stopped growing, bounce slightly within their respective clothing articles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It feels so nice...</i> Zelda thought, a pleasant smile still spread across her face. <i>Maybe this won't be so bad... W-What?! What am I thinking?! These are Yiga! I need to escape as soon as possible!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, any attempts at coming up with an escape plan were ruined by her inability to think properly. Even as she tried her best, the pair reached a set of iron bars leading into a rather bare room. The Sorceress whistled, causing the bars to rise up enough for her to throw Zelda in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling breasts first onto the floor, Zelda heard a chuckle behind her. <br>\r\n \"I'd begin getting ready. Your first show begins soon...\"<br>\r\nThe iron bars slid shut behind her, leaving Zelda trapped in her new room...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a moment, Zelda considered escape. However, a quick glance around her prison, as well as the thought being washed from her head, soon changed her mind about that. The room she was trapped in had no other apparent exits part from the door, and the only furniture contained within was a single mattress shoved in the corner, an old wardrobe and a dressing table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do, Zelda decided to check out the wardrobe and table. Pushing herself spot her feet with a grunt, she made her way towards them, oblivious to how erotically she was swaying her hips. Stopping in front of the wardrobe, she pulled the doors open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What... am I looking at?\"<br>\r\nZelda stared in disbelief at the contents of the wardrobe. Contained within were a selection of very revealing outfits, ranging from Yiga-branded bra's and panties to skin tight swimsuits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table next to her was no better. Zelda's own dressing table at Hyrule Castle had the bare essentials, but this was laden down with stuff she had long deemed unnecessary. Various shades of eyeliner and blush were available, as well as what appeared to be hair dyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking between the two, Zelda let out a reluctant sigh. <br>\r\n \"I suppose I should change... If I don't, they'd probably make me. Let's see here...\"<br>\r\nRooting around in the closet for something not so revealing, Zelda came up empty handed. Deciding that the swimsuit probably have her the greatest coverage of skin, she pulled it out and stared at it with disgust. Much like the bra and panties, it too had the Yiga Eye drawn on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I don't have any other options...\"<br>\r\nGently pulling the tattered remains of her own outfit from her voluptuous body, Zelda carefully folded them and placed them back in the closet. Looking at the swimsuit, she sighed before pulling it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, the swimsuit was not as covering as she originally thought. Clearly designed for a flatter body than hers, both her breasts and ass were bulging out. The bottom part of the outfit was slowly being devoured by her round ass, while her breasts threatened to explode out of the top half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking at the hem of the suit, Zelda looked over at the dressing table. For the briefest of moments, she considered applying a little make-up, but soon shook her head in disgust. She wouldn't give in to this spell! Not now, not ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the door, Zelda saw a familiar face grinning at her. <br>\r\n \"You look exceptionally beautiful in those colours!\" The Sorceress cooed. \"And luckily for you, our audience tonight loves beauty. Now, come, come! Time to reveal our newest attraction...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bars slid open, the Sorceress strode in and took Zelda by the arm. As she led her out and down the corridor, Zelda tried to take note of any possible escape routes. Once again, she found it impossible to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding a corner, Zelda found herself staring at a set of stairs leading up to a stage. A crowd cheered nearby, which excited her slightly. <br>\r\n \"Alrighty!\"<br>\r\nThe Sorceress clapped happily, turning to Zelda. <br>\r\n \"Your body will know what to do! I suggest you let it do its thing, otherwise I won't be too happy! Now, up you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body turned automatically and began walking her towards the stage. Zelda tried desperately to stop herself, but couldn't. Stepping onto the stage, she saw a metal pole sitting in the centre of it. Looking away from the pole, she found herself staring down at a crowd of...</span></div></div>",

As she drew nearer to centre stage, a few green rupees were thrown at her, causing her to pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over to pick them up, Zelda felt more of her swimsuit disappear between her ass cheeks. Behind her, the crowd went wild as her nearly uncovered backside was revealed to them. She heard a few whistles, followed by a few more rupees flying on stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is so degrading...</i> Zelda thought as she straightened up, a rupee clutched in each hand. Her hands reached up to her bulging bust and shoved the two rupees between the twin orbs. Shivering as she felt the cool metal pressing against her warm tits, Zelda's body continued towards the pole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached it, her arm shot out and gripped it firmly. Pulling herself in close, the pole slid in between her breasts, tightening her swimsuit even further. More and more flesh was gradually revealed, until she pulled away and swung around the pole, her chest wobbling madly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I feel so embarrassed!</i> Zelda thought as she continued to whirl around the pole. <i>I'm the Princess of Hyrule! I shouldn't be dancing in front of nobles like some common peasant! Though, I suppose the rupees are nice... No, they aren't! None of this is right!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, any attempt she made to regain control of her body was futile. Whatever spell had been cast upon her had suppressed her own divine abilities, meaning she couldn't even call upon the Goddesses Power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her body continued to dance around the pole, Zelda quickly lost track of time. She remained minimally aware of what she was actually doing right up until the finale, when her body decided to go the whole way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face the cheering crowd, her hips began to sway erotically. Her hands gripped the hem of her swimsuit, which had slipped down during her dance and was just about covering her nipples. Wiggling it about, which caused her breasts to ripple invitingly, the crowd lost it. Rupee after rupee flew into the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please don't strip, please don't strip, please don't strip!</i><br>\r\nThankfully, her body only seemed to be teasing the crowd. She stopped wiggling her tits and, with a final wink and a giggle, strutted back off stage. As she descended the steps, she was met by the Sorceress, who clapped gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A wonderful first performance!\" She said cheerfully. \"So wonderful, in fact, that...\"</span></div></div>",

And the responses I received were astounding! No less than twenty people have contacted me! Now, that's a few more than I was expecting, so I picked out a few who were willing to pay extra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda opened her mouth to protest, but no sound came out. Robbed of her voice, she resorted to pleading with her eyes. However, her attempts were laughed off. <br>\r\n \"None of that!\" The Sorceress chided her, grabbing her by the shoulder. \"You've got people to entertain! Now, come along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her body still obeying whatever commands the Sorceress gave it, Zelda found herself following the Sorceress. As she walked, she was acutely aware of how her new body bounced and rippled. Her half exposed breasts jiggled madly, while her wide hips swayed erotically with each step she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Zelda attempted to take note of potential escape routes and, once again, she found her head quickly clouding over. However, unlike last time, she found new thoughts floating to the front of her foggy mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder what these people are like...<br>\r\nWill they take control, or will I?<br>\r\nI hope I get to show off my body...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts continued until she paused in front of a stone door. <br>\r\n \"Here we are!\"<br>\r\nThe Sorceress turned to face Zelda, hand on hip and smile on face. <br>\r\n \"Now remember. The client is the one in charge in there. Whatever they tell you to do, you do. Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the door open, Zelda reluctantly strutted into the room.

Unlike the ones that Zelda allowed to enter Hyrule Castle, who were refined and elegant, he was the complete opposite. He was beginning to go bald, his face was unkempt and unshaven and he was heavily obese. His green jacket was stained and unbuttoned, giving Zelda a good look at his fat guy and the equally stained white t-shirt that tried to cover it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, about time, Princess!\"<br>\r\nHe grinned hungrily at Zelda, whose body smiled back. Her mind, however, was trying it's hardest to regain control so she could escape both the room and the slob currently leering at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come closer, my dear...\"<br>\r\nHe beckoned for her to approach, chuckling as he did. Her body obeyed, strutting closer to him. As she did, he eyed her hungrily. His gaze lingered on her wobbling breasts before moving down to her thick, swaying hips and fat ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching him, Zelda paused in front of him, a smile still on her face. <br>\r\n \"Camilla wasn't lying!\" He chuckled, reaching a fat hand out to touch her hips. \"You really are something to look at! But I didn't pay to look. I paid for action...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back and leered at her. <br>\r\n \"Let me see that chest of yours!\"<br>\r\nHe practically barked at her, surprising even her body which took a step back. However, it quickly recovered and stepped forwards, leaning down until her glistening breasts were in front of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is so degrading...</i> Zelda thought as her hands began to knead her soft breasts. <i>But why do I enjoy it so much?! It feels so wrong, yet feels good... I want him to touch me so badly... Please...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda groped her massive melons, the man reached around and roughly gripped her fat ass. The action incited a groan of pleasure from her, which made a grin spread across his face. He began to dig his fingers into her bare ass, causing moan after pleasurable groan to escape Zelda's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, yes... Harder... Harder!</i><br>\r\nUsing one hand to continue massaging her own chest, she reached out and stroked the man's crotch. Beneath her finger, she felt something twitch slightly, making her giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh?\" She whispered, her voice full of lust. \"Something seems excited...\"<br>\r\n \"Why don't you probe a little deeper?\" He asked hungrily. \"Perhaps you'll find something waiting for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Zelda stopped fondling herself.

Both her and the nobleman looked towards the door in shock as it was thrown open, allowing three burly Yiga Guards to charge in. They quickly surrounded the duo, one placing a hand on Zelda's shoulder and pulling her back, while the other two stared down at the now cowering nobleman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's going on?\" Zelda asked, both relieved and disappointed at being pulled away from her customer. <br>\r\n \"Yes! What is going on?!\" The nobleman demanded. <br>\r\n \"Well, it's rather simple...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet voice silenced the nobleman. The Sorceress strode in, an unhappy look on her face. <br>\r\n \"What did I tell you about her?\" She asked, gesturing towards Zelda. <br>\r\n \"Lady Camilla!\" The nobleman stammered. \"I-I'm sorry!

You violated the only rule I have regarding her, and for that, you must be punished\".<br>\r\nShe clapped her hands twice, causing the two guards to reach down and grab the nobleman by each arm. Another clap, and they hailed him out of the room, ignoring his pleading and begging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda watched him go, feeling slightly sorry for him. <br>\r\n \"Apologies about him, my dear. I have strict rules about touching the girls, and he broke the most important one. But, I couldn't help but notice you were... aroused by him. Perhaps you'll fit in here after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla chuckled as she headed towards the door. Before disappearing, she turned back to face Zelda. <br>\r\n \"You're done for the night. Take her back to her room, would you?\"<br>\r\nThe guard grunted in acknowledgement, shoving Zelda forwards.

But if he accepted, when he returned, she would put her new body to use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here we... Wait!</i><br>\r\nZelda froze, her hands mid clap. She glanced down at herself, drowning as she did. She was still wearing her swimsuit from earlier, her full body bulging out of the right material. Sure, it showed enough flesh, but she could always show a little more, right? Men loved that kinda thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I suppose a change of clothes wouldn't hurt</i>, Zelda giggled as she retreated back into her cell. <i>N-Not that I want to change clothes or anything! I-It just makes escaping easier! Yeah, that's all...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of her wardrobe, she pulled the door open. Once again, she made a face as the sea of revealing red and black Yiga branded clothing greeted her gaze. Abandoned at the bottom of the wardrobe were the tattered remains of her old outfit. She stared longingly at it for a moment before looking back at the other clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's see here...</i> Zelda wondered, digging through the wardrobe. <i>I've already worn a swimsuit, so maybe something else? Hmm... I think this... This looks alright, I guess... Oh, this actually looks quite cute! Maybe if I could get it in blue... And perhaps this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda spent ages rummaging through her wardrobe. She stopped to inspect every single article of clothing held within it, from underwear to shoes. Things she liked were pulled out and thrown in a gradually growing pile on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Zelda stopped. Taking a step back, she closed the wardrobe and looked towards the pile of clothing on her bed. <br>\r\n<i>W-Wow... That's a lot of clothes...</i> She thought in disbelief. <i>And it's only going to get harder from here. They're all so... sexy and revealing... Which only helps my chances of escaping!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the fog from her head, Zelda grabbed the first item she saw, a lacy red bra with a black eye imprinted over the left cup, and held it in front of her bulging breasts. She made a noise of approval before returning to the pile and finding the matching panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly lost track of time as she gradually made her way through the pile, holding up clothes and checking herself out in the mirror. Her initial pile slowly died down until she was left with six outfits. After another session in which she actually fit the clothes over her voluptuous frame, those six became two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first outfit was a modified Yiga Suit that consisted of a top that revealed her trim midriff and a pair of short pants that only came partway down her thighs. It was made out of a tight leather rather than fabric, which made it clung tightly to her body. Of the two she had chosen, it was nowhere as near revealing as her other choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other choice was as skimpy as it came. Her massive breasts would only be covered by a black bra with a red eye inscribed on both cups. A dark lace curtain hung down from the lower strap, hanging down over her belly. Her lower half would be covered by a long black skirt that had a slit down the right side, revealing her thick thigh. Completing the look was a black veil for her face, giving her a very Gerudo Dancer look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking between the two, Zelda let out a sigh. It was a difficult choice. One would be more appropriate for an escape, while the other would just make her look like some sort of belly dancer. She let out a long sigh, unable to decide between practicality or sexiness...</span></div></div>",

Still wearing the lacy black bra with red eyes on the cups she slowly worked the top over her head and shoulders. Getting it over her massive breasts was a bit of a challenge due to the tight leather material not stretching so she is forced to breath in and ease her bouncing flesh into the top. If not for the thick leather over her breasts the princess going stripper has no doubts that her nipples would be visible with any other type of fabric even with her bra.

The zipper was impossible for the blonde to zip up so she just made due just buttoning it. Looking in the nearby mirror Zelda was satisfied the way the red leather shorts shows the curvy lines of her butt and thighs and the way it was tight against her skin.

Zelda still couldn't make the guard out, but he definitely sounded like a man. Which meant he would be powerless against her body! Who wouldn't want somebody as... endowed... as her flirting with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, you see... I'm very lonely in here...\" Zelda called out in the most seductive voice she could muster. \"And you seem very lonely out there! So I was thinking... Why don't we spend a little time together? You, me, nobody else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, partly for effect and partly because a few images of the pair of them performing a few lewd actions had just entered her head. However, her giggles soon turned into a yelp as a bolt of black magic blasted into the wall next to her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's get this straight...\" Her guard said, finally stepping into the light. Zelda had been expecting some muscular guy with a big sword, the usual guys Link fought against during failed kidnapping attempts. Instead, a tall, wiry man in a black and red cape looked out of the darkness, a gnarled staff clutched in one of his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You don't interest me in the slightest, Princess!\" He practically spat, stopping in front of her door. \"So why don't you head back to that bed of yours? It just means I don't have to waste the energy casting anymore spells!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda swallowed nervously. Her eyes flicked between his staff, his furious expression and the key attached to his belt. Eventually, she sighed and slowly retreated to her bed. As she did, she heard the guard make an irritated noise before he shuffled off back down the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on her bed, Zelda stared at the door. Of all the guards she had to get, it had to be the one immune to her body?<br>\r\n<i>I can't give up...</i> She thought. <i>I refuse to be confined to this cell any longer!

I wonder why?\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nZelda stares at the wizard's retreating back, actually his buttocks, unwittingly releasing a sigh of longing before coughing into her hand. <i>\"He also seemed interested in me...I saw his eyes looking all over me. Ahem, but with disgust. Perhaps he prefers a certain type...that or something is going on behind the scenes involving a certain woman.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda thinks of Camellia no doubt the type to punish others for unreasonable things. Their bodies were somewhat similar at the moment so perhaps the wizard was pissed at people like her for a reason. The princess doesn't blame the guy as Camellia seems the type to rub others the wrong way. <i>\"Perhaps I can use that anger and get him to either blast a hole or at the least open the door. They do seem to think I'm defenseless as a damsel here. Hmhmhm....I think this just might work.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the wizard could retreat fully back into the darkness Zelda spoke up loudly as she moved directly in front of her cell door, \"You aren't interested in me? Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely you foul bitch.\" She hears the wizard grunt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>\"Good got his attention...now to <b>rile</b> him up.\"</i> Zelda wasn't sure what context she meant rile but she continues to speak,\" Then you must not be much of a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that!?\" The Wizard turns around and stares at Zelda in shock obviously not expecting an insult to his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously you have a princess locked up and you just refuse to get in her pants when she invited you. You must be a woman or go after men!\"Zelda yells as she experiences a sudden thrill at talking down to somebody. \"I bet you just don't have the balls to come at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare you slut of a Hylian!\" The wizard growls as he walks toward Zelda's cell with angry steps, his staff hitting the brick sharply. \"I am not interested in foul women like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what type of women? Perhaps it is one like me as it sure didn't seem that way when you stared me down. I guessing that staff is the only thing you've been with in your entire life. It does seem...well used.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda cannot believe her words but at the same time it was something else a...<b>needy/calculated</b> woman did to get a male's attention. The Wizard stomps in front of her, dark magic covering his wily body and his black and red cloak covering his face but she can see his gritted teeth. Seeing that shroud of built up magic the princess realized she perhaps provoked the robed man too much. <i><b>\"Oh Hylia!\"<br>\r\n</b></i><br>\r\n\"Why don't you see what kind of woman I like!\" The Wizard yells as a blast of dark magic roars against her door destroying it before hitting the wall of her cell creating thick smoke of debris!

Her own Divine Magic helped warn her when somebody targeted her with dark magic, plus she had gotten quite good at predicting where it would hit from all the times she had been targeted while travelling with Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, however, there were some new factors. The first was her body, which was nowhere near as flexible as her old one. She was heavier now, and that heaviness threw her off as she tried to jump to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second new factor was her somewhat foggy head. Since she had been left alone in her cell, she had been more in control of her own mind than any other point during her imprisonment. When the wizard had first approached at her, she had felt a little of the fogginess return. And when he had cast that massive bolt, it was like her mind didn't want her to move. It wanted her to get hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these factors affecting her, Zelda didn't move in time. While she managed to avoid the door, the bolt definitely hit her. While the door went crashing into the wall, Zelda went crashing into the floor, breasts bouncing slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up at the ceiling, Zelda gasped for air. She had never been hit by magic before... It felt like her entire body was on fire! She could feel various parts of her tingling, almost like her body was changing once again. But that was impossible, right? Only her master could change how she looked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the burning subsided, she heard the wizard laugh. <br>\r\n \"Heh... You look a lot more appealing to me now!\" He said gruffly, stepping into the room. \"Might have a bit of fun... Though Lady Camilla may not appreciate the sudden remodelling of your room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda groaned and sat up. Her backside still felt huge, spreading across the floor beneath her. The same could be said for her breasts, which caused her leather top to creak as she breathed. However, her body still felt off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-What... What did you do to me?!\" Zelda demanded, before clamping her hands over her mouth. Her voice... It wasn't her own! Her soft-spoken voice had been replaced with an exotic, sultry purr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Surprised?\" The wizard chuckled. \"Take a look, Princess!\"<br>\r\nZelda slowly got to her feet and looked towards her mirror. Amazingly, the door had missed her bed, her wardrobe and mirror. Stepping towards it, a gasp escaped Zelda's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pale skin had tanned to a light orange, while her golden hair was a dark red and reached down just below her ass. Her flat belly, uncovered by her clothing, now sported the beginnings of a six-pack, while her arms and legs felt a little more muscular and tense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... I'm a Gerudo?\" Zelda said in disbelief, running a hand over her tanned skin. \"B-But why?!\"<br>\r\n \"Cause I like me a Gerudo, that's why!\" The Wizard stated, walking behind her. \"Now, that offer still in the table?\"</span></div></div>",

Zelda yelped as her arm shot out, grabbing the belly dancer top and skirt. Her other arm whisked up the jumpsuit and chucked it over her shoulder before her legs marched her over to her mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of it, Zelda stared at her reflection for a few moments. Her swimsuit was slightly damp, probably due to the perspiration from her earlier activities. Her breasts, still bulging out, had a slight sheen to them for the same reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hylia, I look so... Sexy!</i> Zelda thought, her free hand drifting to her left breast. Before it got there, she shook her head madly, the movement causing her breasts and backside to wobble. <i>No, no! Stop thinking like that! This body and invading mindset are absolutely revolting! I hate this so much! How I'd love to get my hands on that detestable Sorceress and show her how a real woman acts!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda thought of how she'd punish her master should she ever get the drop on her, her body began to undress itself. Sliding the shoulder straps of her swimsuit down her sweaty shoulders, she pulled the swimsuit off. Shivering slightly as the cool air of her cell rubbed against her naked body, Zelda's hand twitched as she eyed her erect nipples. However, she managed to resist her urges and her body began to dress itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with the top, she unhooked the bra and pulled it around her hefty breasts. As she went to connect the hooks, she found that they came nowhere near one another. Grunting slightly as she forced the two hooks closer together, Zelda ignored how tight the cups were beginning to feel. Managing to get the two hooks together, albeit in the loosest setting, she glanced down at her breasts. The cups were so small that they dug uncomfortably into her breasts, flesh spilling out of the top of the cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her mind hated how small the top was, her body showed no signs of caring and moved into the skirt, which looked a little more fitting. Before she slipped it up her legs, she grabbed a set of panties that just about fit her fertile hips. With her intimate area covered, she pulled the silken skirt up her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That feels surprisingly nice</i>, Zelda admitted to herself. <i>I wouldn't mind a skirt like this back at the castle... Something to give the guards a bit of a show...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the skirt fitted over her thick backside, she grabbed the final part of her outfit; the veil. Fiddling with it for a few seconds, Zelda wrapped it around the lower half of her face and turned to the mirror. Under her veil, she made a face as she saw how ill-fitting her outfit truly was. Her breasts were practically bursting from the cups, her skirt, which felt fine, revealed a lot more than just her thighs and the veil... Well, it fit, but she didn't like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever much she hated her new outfit, she was oddly reluctant to change. Twirling in front of the mirror, Zelda nodded and started for the cell door. If this outfit didn't work on the guard, then nothing would...</span></div></div>",

Zelda panicked for a few seconds, unsure of what she was meant to do? Should she dive for her bed and pretend she was sleeping? Or, and this was oddly tempting, she could act as though she was practicing dancing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, don't bother moving, sweetie. You think I don't know what you were trying to do? I'm a part of your mind! I know what you're thinking before you even think about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman, clad in elegant red and black robes and wearing an extremely smug expression, strode into her room. Two burly Yiga Guards, both equipped with their own massive katana, followed her in and flanked the open door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As soon as the thought of escaping occurred to you, I knew,\" Camilla said, stopping in front of Zelda who found she couldn't move her body. \"At first, I thought of shutting it down and reasserting my control over your mind. But then, a wealthy client of mine paid me a visit! He wanted something we didn't offer, and that's when it hit me! I've got a brand new girl under my command who could do literally anything for me! So, why not have her dress up and change her body to suit our client's specification, and then send her along to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's mouth moved silently, trying to form a sentence. However, her master had just given her a lot of information and she was still trying to process it, plus her head felt awfully foggy again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That outfit you're wearing?\" Camilla continued, reaching out and running a petite finger along the dark curtain covering her midriff. \"Our client requested it. If I'm honest, I didnt even know we had one until you found it in your wardrobe. It suits you. Shows off your... charms. But unfortunately, your new customer doesn't really like how you look at the minute. And that's why I'm here. I'm here to change you so he does like you. Just hold still for a moment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Zelda wasn't really given a choice in the matter. Her body, which had been swaying slightly, froze up. Staring into her master's red eyes, Zelda grunted as she felt a warm hand press against her belly. Her entire body began to tingle as Camilla forced more dark magic into her body. As the tingle began to feel a little painful, Camilla stepped away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There we go!\" She said, clapping happily. \"Well? Have a look! It's your body, after all!\"<br>\r\nForced to obey, Zelda turned to her mirror...</span></div></div>",

Her breasts were still threatening to explode free of her bra and she could still see a hint of her red panties through the slit in her dress. However, as she took a closer look at her reflection, she saw what Camilla had changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the side, Zelda lifted her hands to her belly. Formerly slim, it had swollen outwards into a somewhat saggy potbelly that hung over the metallic waistband of her skirt. Grabbing it, she gave it a few hesitant shakes. It wobbled and bounced, slapping lightly against her skirt. Initially, Zelda was disgusted with her new belly, however the on her she looked at it and the more she played with it, the more she appreciated it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My outfit really compliments it</i>, Zelda thought, turning back to the mirror. <i>I can only imagine what it would be like if it was bigger... Actually, never mind. It's big enough as it is! I don't want to be any bigger, be it my breasts, backside or belly!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, you turned out perfectly!\"<br>\r\nZelda yelped as a cold hand reached over and slapped her belly, causing her flesh to ripple. <br>\r\n \"I'm sure your new client will greatly appreciated you now!\" Camilla said happily. \"Now, come along! We don't want to keep them waiting, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's legs began to move by themselves, carrying her out of her room and after Camilla. Once again, as she walked through the dimly lit corridors, her mind refused to take note of anything that would help her escape. Rather, it was more focused on how she now walked. Her hips now swayed erotically, each step forwards causing the slit on her dress to reveal one of her thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I feel so... so... Urgh, I can't even think of a suitable word!</i> Zelda thought as Camilla led her down a more brightly lit corridor. <i>Sexy? Hot? Disgusting? Revolting? Fat? Whatever it is, I don't even know if I like it! I need to escape, otherwise I may have an answer to that question that I won't like!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Here we are, sweetie!\"<br>\r\nCamilla stopped in front of a door, hand on the knob. <br>\r\n \"Go on in and do whatever your client wants,\" She ordered Zelda, who found herself nodding. \"And remember, I'll know if you try anything\".<br>\r\nCamilla pushed the door open, allowing Zelda to stride in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room she found herself in was lavishly decorated, with various scrolls and tapestries decorating the walls.

Doing a light twirl that showed off her red panties and thighs that escaped the fabric she continues to dance as Rene continues to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly for Zelda, the Gerudo continues to watch Zelda's belly as it bounces being only slightly disappointed when Zelda turned away to shake her peach like ass in the black skirt or when she showed off her breasts to the point her nipples nearly freed themselves from their tight prison. Sweat starts to wet her fair white adding some more charm to her body as her client seems to be stratified with her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you can stop now please.\" Zelda nearly giggles at how innocent Rene was but holds it in fear of offending her as Camilla threat still lingers in her mind. Gerudo can be rough and blunt at times but never has she encountered one so cute and innocent. In order for the giggle to not show the princess releases a slight cough as she stops her dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. What else do you wish for me to do?\" Zelda questions as she holds herself back from being informal or too seductive actually creating a nice balance between her currently warring self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I do wish for you to do something for me more then dancing Ms. Zelda.\" The Gerudo stands up showing her nearly boyish frame as she does.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, it's better for me if you're really hungry! And thirsty as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of hunger and thirst, Zelda's body answered for her. Her flabby belly let out a growl that echoed around the room. Zelda blushed, but couldn't deny that she was feeling famished. Since being kidnapped, she hadn't had anything to eat or drink. Strangely though, until Rene had said anything, she hadn't been feeling particularly hungry. Did her Master somehow control her hunger and thirst as well as her body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I think that answers your question!\" Zelda giggled, rubbing her belly. \"Now, what do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\nRene held up a finger, telling her to wait, before turning to a door behind her. Pulling it open, she spoke quietly to somebody on the other side before grabbing a cart and pulling it in. As she did, Zelda's stomach let out an almighty groan. Whatever was on that cart smelt absolutely divine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-Here!\" Rene said, pushing the cart towards her. \"I want you to eat everything on this cart! O-Or as much as you can!\"<br>\r\nZelda smiled at the petite Gerudo, pulling back the sheet draped over the top. As she got a look at the food beneath, her eyes went wide. She had been half expecting bananas, but instead a massive, glistening Roast Cucco stared back at her. Sitting next to it was a bowl of steaming Roasted Potatos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please! Dig in!\"<br>\r\nWith Rene's command given, Zelda dove into her meal. Ripping the legs off, she wasted no time in stripping them to the bone. Dropping them into the cart, she licked grease from her lips and, grabbing a nearby knife, cut into the rest of the Cucco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite her, Rene watched her with awe. She kept one eye on Zelda's hands, both of which worked quickly to stuff food into her mouth, while the other was firmly glued to her belly, which wobbled and quivered as its owner moved. With the amount she was eating, coupled with the speed she was doing it at, it didn't take long for her soft flesh to begin to solidify and swell outwards into a firm orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to to her admirer, Zelda ate like a woman possessed. After finishing off a good amount of the Cucco, she moved onto the potatoes. Pushing a few into her mouth, she savoured their taste briefly before swallowing hungrily. Another couple were forced into her mouth, followed by another slice of Cucco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda neared the end of the top part of the cart...</span></div></div>",

She has not eaten in a very long time hence why she was able to eat as she did. But both the Cucco and the potaoes she has almost consumed complelty has left her with a needy thrist. Rubbing her stomach that was hard as a rock and unable to even push the tips of her fingers into her skin Zelda releases a small burp with a faint blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading her mind Rene speaks, \"A-are you perhaps thirsty? Unfortently all they gave me is some water to give you....sorry about that not being wine or something a bit grand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...thanks for the considerations\" Zelda huffs out as she watches the petite Gerudo lift something from underneath the cart. The large wooden container seemed to contain a vast amount of water. So much so that Rena seemed to have some slight trouble with putting the heavy containter near her plate on the cart with a dull thump. \"That Cucco made me a bit thristy. It's greasy but sadly it's still a bit dry. May I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure hang one second...\" Rene dissappears to underneath the cart once more before coming out with a metal tube object. \"This is a straw. I made it myself too you won't have to lift a finger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Straw...do I perhaps suck on it to drink from the container?\" Zelda partially groans as Rene gives a slight nervous nod before putting her lush filled lips onto the hollow metal tube before sucking on the tube greedily as water pumps itself into her mouth down to her stomach. She doesn't care if anyone hears her heavily breathing for air as she takes in air in order to drink more heavily and deeply. The water itself, perhaps from not having anything real to drink in some time, tasted heavenly better then any wine at the moment. If there was something in it the princess hardly cared. Every once in awhile the princess would take a bite of Cucco as it was the only thing left from all the potatoes being in her stomach now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her drinking far to much attention, Zelda fails to note Rena watching her intently as her hard stomach slowly becomes bouyant once more as water swishing around from her. The light gurgling as water moves around seemingly enchanting as the Gerudo blushes before realizing that Zelda was not even paying any attention to her at the moment making Rena quite grateful for the princess's ignorance.

Despite having drunk a quarter of the massive container, her throat still felt a little parched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll give you this back if... if you dance some more for me!\" Rene said, setting the container next to her. Zelda stared longingly at the water for a few seconds before Rene coughed meaningfully, kicking her body into action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping away from the cart, Zelda first adjusted her skirt which, despite how thick her hips were, had somehow slid down. She then grabbed her belly, which sloshed and gurgled quietly, and gave it a good shake. Rene blushed as she did so, which caused a sultry smile to spread across Zelda's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, well!\" She called out, swaying her hips to an inaudible beat. \"Looks like somebody likes my belly!\"<br>\r\nRene blushed again, more deeply this time. However, Zelda could see the lust on her face. She could tell her client wanted nothing more than to reach out and play with her belly. Perhaps she even wanted it bigger? And who would she be to deny her client that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the slight thirst she still had, Zelda danced her way around the cart, which had been partially blocking her from Rene's sight. With her thick thighs and round ass now visible, Zelda began to incorporate the remaining Cucco into her routine. Every so often, a hand would reach out and grab a slice, waving it around for a few seconds before ferrying it to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting opposite her, Rene's mouth hung open. Her eyes were glued to Zelda, watching eagerly as she simultaneously danced and ate. As she ate, her belly became a little harder, gradually losing its bounciness. Initially, Rene was disappointed, but as it grew bigger and rounder, she found herself wanting it more and more. She could imagine herself caressing its taut surface, maybe even resting her head atop it and listening to it gurgle quietly as it digested its owners meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Rene fantasizing, Zelda sultry grin reappeared.

She looked so excited to see her thick body swaying back and forth, and for whatever strange reason, Zelda didn't want to destroy that excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of lunging for the door or trying to grab the water container, Zelda began to move towards Rene. Lifting her arms high above her head, she spun on a heel while kicking her other legs out towards the excited Gerudo. As Zelda gradually drew nearer her, Rene's excitement began to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"S-So big...\" Rene mumbled, reaching out a shaking hand. Spotting this, Zelda stopped spinning towards her and stopped with her stuffed belly facing her. Simultaneously, both girls let out a moan as Rene's hand gently rested atop Zelda's gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Looks like somebody likes my belly, huh?\" Zelda commented, shaking her stuffed belly for effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRene nodded, a wondrous look etched on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, in that case, feel free to touch all you want...\" Zelda said, closing the gap between the duo so that Rene was mere inches from her belly. \"Touch it, play with it... Do whatever you want with it, I don't mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRene nodded again.

Prior to her imprisonment and subsequent curse, it was a feeling she had only felt a few times throughout her life, albeit never very strongly. This time, however, it started strong and only increased in intensity, until it was all she could think about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted... No... She <i>needed</i> her belly bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching behind her, Zelda felt her fingers brush against the cart holding her food. Yanking it closer, she began to hungrily ferry its contents into her mouth. Her earlier feeling of fullness, weirdly, subsided as she eagerly resumed her self-stuffing, a moan escaping her mouth as a particularly good potato slid down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlice of Cucco gripped in her hand, Zelda glanced down at Rene, whose hands had frozen. Eyes wide with wonderment, she watched closely as Zelda slowly pushed the slice into her mouth, letting out a long moan as she played with the slightly chilled meat. Chewing slowly, she leant down and, right next to Rene's ear, swallowed loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like seeing me eat?\" Zelda asked, her voice a sultry whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRene nodded slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like seeing my belly swell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother anxious nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want my belly to grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then be a part of it,\" Zelda purred, pressing a potato into her hand and opening her mouth wide. Rene looked at the potato before pushing it into Zelda's mouth. As the Princess-turned-Dancer chewed, she pulled the cart around so Rene could reach it. Swallowing hungrily, she then grabbed Rene by the shoulders and, in one swift movement, switched their positions so Zelda's plump ass was sat on the equally plump seat and Rene was stood over her. The young Gerudo stared at the blonde for a moment before nodding confidently and grabbing some treats from the cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Open wide!\" She ordered eagerly. Zelda obeyed, allowing her mouth to drop open and food to be pushed into it. She chewed briefly before swallowing and reopening her mouth, awaiting more food. Rene obliged and, within seconds, was ferrying the remaining contents of the tray into Zelda's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmmm~\" Zelda moaned as Rene lifted the gravy boat, which was still half full. \"Oh, yes, fill me up... I don't care what with! Gravy, meat, vegetables, I'll eat it all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRene tipped the boat, causing thick gravy to stream into Zelda's mouth. With each hungry gulp, her belly, already massively stuffed, inched outwards, her lap gradually disappearing beneath it. Meanwhile, unknown to both girls, Zelda's already thick backside and heavy breasts were becoming increasingly so. Her clothes tightened, her fleshy breasts bulging out of her top and soft cheeks peeking out from behind her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flow of gravy came to a disappointing end, Zelda took a second to breathe. Rene, however, had other plans for her, quickly ramming a handful of mixed vegetables and potatoes into her mouth. Not expecting it, Zelda almost choked, but just about managed to swallow. But just as she did, another handful entered her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Rene...\" Zelda tried to say, but was quickly silenced by a third and fourth mouthful. Looking up at her stuffer, she found Rene's mouth hanging open slightly, her petite chest heaving as she worked overtime to stuff Zelda with whatever she could get her hands on. Resigned to her fate for the time being, Zelda relaxed. After all, she had asked for this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-We're out of food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda lazily cracked an eye open. At some point during her meal, she must have drifted off. Not that she minded, as her dreams were just as delicious. Beautiful men and women, all working to fill her insatiable belly, her body swelling with more and more soft fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw, that's disappointing,\" Zelda said, her voice a sultry purr. \"But, my, I feel so full. Perhaps you would care to stroke it? Caress it? Rub it softly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke, Rene's disappointment melted away, replaced with delight. Squealing happily, she dropped to her knees in front of Zelda's huge gut and, not wasting a moment, began to caress the tight skin. A happy groan escaped Zelda's mouth as she relaxed yet again. And as she did, the last vestige of Princess Zelda of Hyrule faded away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just Zelda, a dancer in the employ of the Yiga. She was unique amongst the other dancers as she enjoyed nothing more than having her clients stuff her full of delicious treats. Of course, with each client she saw, her body became softer and softer, much to the delight of both herself and her clients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmm... Just like that, Rene...\" Zelda moaned, staring down at her belly. After her meal, which was bigger than usual, she had noted with pleasure, she was massive. Certainly, she was bigger than she had ever been before. Breasts as big as watermelons that threatened to burst free from her top if she inhaled too sharply, resting atop her gargantuan gut that was large enough to mask the small Rene from view. And supporting her hefty body were a set of thick hips that were wider than her shoulders and a plump ass that her skirt did nothing to cover. \"Oh, yes... Yes... Yes... Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Zelda reached her climax, a gentle bell echoed throughout the room. Its sound caused Rene to leap to her feet with a nervous '<i>Eep!</i>', while Zelda merely let out a disappointed groan. This always happened, right before her finale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm afraid that's time, Rene, dear!\" Camilla announced, appearing in the doorway. \"But don't worry, Zelda isn't going anywhere. And I'm sure she'd just love to see you again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRene blushed and, with a final wave to Zelda, left the room, leaving the sluggish blonde with her Mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now, I believe that's you for the night,\" Camilla told Zelda, who nodded sadly. \"Head back and sleep off some of that food. After all, our clients so adore stuffing it full\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy grunt, Zelda pushed herself to her feet. She felt so heavy, yet she loved it. As she walked forwards, her entire frame wobbled. Belly slapping lightly against her tree trunk thighs, she began to make her way back to her room. Camilla watched her go, a smug smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Looks like I win, Princess...\" She muttered to herself. \"Soon enough, Hyrule will be within my grasp...\" </span></div></div>",

Hastily looking towards the owner of the voice, she found herself staring at a woman clad in black robes that hid her body from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just hide at the door!\" The woman barked, startling Zelda again. \"Get over here! I want a better look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, ma'am!\" Zelda squeaked nervously, hurrying towards her client. Pausing about a meter from her, Zelda held her breath as the woman ran her eye up and down her teenage body. After a couple of tense moments, during which Zelda began to doubt herself, the woman let out a derisive snort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph... I suppose you'll do,\" The woman said, leaning back in her seat. \"Now, do your job and entertain me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously clearing her throat, Zelda hesitated for a brief moment, unsure of how she was going to actually entertain her. While her mind struggled to answer, her body took over. Lifting her arms above her head, she began to clumsily wiggle her hips to a silent beat. After a few, incredibly embarrassing moments had passed, the woman let out a heavy sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ganon have mercy... They told me you were inexperienced, but this is much worse than I expected!\" The woman said, sitting up. \"Allow me to show you how it should be done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman got to her feet, her hood fell back, revealing a scaled face and a large blue fin. As she strode into the centre of the room, shoving Zelda aside, Zelda noticed she had etched some symbols onto her face. The upside down eye looked familiar, yet she couldn't quite place it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda jumped as the woman barked suddenly at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, ma'am! Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next while, Zelda watched closely as the Zora danced and spun her way around the room. Despite her confusion at recent events, she found herself hypnotized by her clients movements. How her fins swayed as she moved, how she masterfully kept her balance even on one foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't wait to dance like that... Zelda found herself thinking, clapping as the Zora finished her routine. She quickly stopped, however, when the Zora marched right up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now, your turn!\" She ordered, pointing at Zelda's diminished chest. \"Any more mistakes, and I'll get your Mistress to... punish you a little more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling to herself, the Zora returned to her seat.

Things seemed to going well as the Zora with strange and familiar markings had yet to say anything and didn't seem to be angry but rather cross armed and stern. Zelda had to be somewhat careful as her looser dancer outfit almost revealed her diminished chest to the world. The moment Zelda makes her way to spin on her toes however she feels her balance was not quite right. Her veiled face covered her expression as she tries to find her balance unless the dancer wants to tip over, which Zelda does not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't think I can do this correctly... I was never much of a dancer.\"</i> Zelda thinks even if her mind is muddled and sometimes so foggy, she at least knows that. But she cannot remember what she was good at....what was it? It was something dealing with knowledge but sadly the princess cannot fully remember it. Soon, despite her best efforts, Zelda finds herself collapsing on her butt with a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"NO,NO,NO!\"</b> The Zora yells, the black robes trailing behind her thin body. \"Did you even pay attention to that part!? You looked like a child pretending to be a dancer! Where is that skill you showed earlier!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm sorry but these dancing clothes I have...\" The enraged smirk on the Zora made Zelda pause as the usual courage she had to speak to others suddenly disappeared, \" Are loose.... and I uh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because you failed to dance does not mean you blame the clothes that your mistress kindly gave you.\" The Zora's expression softens slightly as if feeling sad for what was about to happen but the glint in their azure eyes conveyed a slight glee. \"Sadly you failed to meet my standards....I will ask for Camilla to punish you justly for offending all us dancers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait please don't!\" Zelda know well of her mistress's thinking even if it has been a short while forced underneath the Gerudo's services. While Camilla is unpredictable in her usage of magic Zelda has no doubts her body will be changed to make it harder to leave this place somehow. However the Zora pays no attention to Zelda's pleas, instead, the Zora closes their eyes for several moments with their lips barely moving. A moment later Zelda silently watches the Zora move to a nearby chair with a table nearby as a black bell appears on the table. A thick mist comes from the bottom of the ebony bell making Zelda shiver at it. The Zora however does not care for it and casually rings it before turning back to the princess become dancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is too late girl... ringing that bell is all that is needed from now on.\" The Zora grins just as Zelda starts to grunt in pain as dark magic begins to swell inside her smaller body. Zelda's body wants to close her eyes but Zelda uses her willpower in order to see what will become of herself. In response to that the dark magic seems to become more uncomfortable forcing Zelda is squeeze her eyelids shut from the pain.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She rubbed her arms in a futile attempt to relieve at least a little bit, but it only seemed to further increase it. Further and further, the pain went until, finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it died down, going from full intensity to a dull throb and then finally disappearing altogether, leaving Zelda's body feeling numb, another gasp escaped Zelda's lips. Unwilling to see what the dark magic had done to her, Zelda kept her eyes closed. Well, until her client got tired of waiting for her to open them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Open your eyes!\" The Zora barked, causing Zelda to flinch. \"See what happens when you disappoint your client!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Zelda wanted to keep her eyes closed, her mind ordered her to open them. Slowly, she cracked one open and glanced down at her body, which still felt incredibly numb. As soon as she saw herself, a frightened \"Eep!\" pushed past her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noted was her earlier complaints about her clothes being too loose had been completely ignored. Her chest had shrunk down to mere bumps on her chest, while her backside was similarly diminished, meaning her outfit was practically hanging from her thin body. And those weren't the only things that Zelda had lost. As she unsteadily got to her feet, she found that the Zora now towered over her, meaning that she had also lost more height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-What did you do to me?!\" Zelda squeaked, her voice slightly higher pitched and even more timid sounding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What your Mistress gave me permission to!\" The Zora answered with a smug grin. \"Failure to please me results in a few years being cut from you. But should you manage to please me, then perhaps you can regain those lost years. But only if you manage to please me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nodded hesitantly. Glancing nervously around the larger room, she found her previous life was even harder to recall now. And not only that, but she constantly felt... nervous. Anxious. Intimidated. Was she good enough for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I... I need to be!</i> Zelda thought. <i>L-Lady Camilla believes in me! I...

Still nervous underneath it all Zelda begins to dance to an unheard beat doing her best to dance so she can show she can do well. However unlike the last time and the time before that Zelda has to be careful of her dancing colthes as they hang off her and near her feet. Her narrow hips barely keep it on as she moves around and Zelda fears it might fall off at any moment but she can't keep her hands there as she ahs to keep them moving. The chest part, once tight and ill fitting, now hangs and if the princess is not careful she might reveal herself. The veil tickles her ankles as the height is meant for a much older person. The Zora watches fully expecting the princess to fail. <i>\"I'll prove her wrong I can do this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"AH!\"</b> Suddenly Zelda finds her feet yank the veil on her body. Her balance becomes clumsy before falling on her back with a dull thud on the red carpet floor. The Zora sighs as she reaches for the black bell.

Eventually, the Zora let out a heavy sigh and flashed Zelda a faux apologetic look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As much as I tried, I just can't think of anything you could possibly provide for me that I don't already have,\" The Zora said, holding the bell between her thumb and forefinger. \"If you were the <i>actual</i> Princess Zelda, then it would be a different manner entirely. But as it stands, you merely share her name. Perhaps you will be easier to teach if you are a tad younger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-No, wait!\" Zelda stuttered, moving from sitting on her backside to kneeling before the Zora. \"I... I am Princess Z-Zelda! The P-Princess of Hyrule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zora hesitated, during Zelda with a newfound curiosity, before letting out a titter and frowning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And perhaps Lady Camilla can train that deception out of you as well!\" The Zora commented. \"It's common knowledge that the Princess is both well into her teens and living comfortably in Hyrule Castle! You are merely a pre-teen, who is about to be regressed to a child, and destined to live out your days in service to the Yiga! Now, be quiet, lest I ring this twice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting her mouth, Zelda watched with sad eyes as the Zora gently swung the bell from side to side. A gentle ringing echoed around the room before a dark mist swirled out of the base of the bell. As it did, pressure began to build within her small body. Falling back onto her backside, Zelda merely stared at the Zora before her, already resigned to her fate. Closing her eyes, she gasped and groaned as she felt her already diminished body compress and shrink down even further. And while her body shrank, more and more of her former life as the Princess was lost to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure suddenly dissipated from her body, which allowed Zelda's body to stiffen as she heard a familiar voice with a dangerous edge to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see our newest... recruit... wasn't to your liking. As compensation for her failings, feel free to visit another of our fine workers. It's on the house, of course\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking a nervous eye open, Zelda watched as the Zora strode past her without a second glance. As soon as she left the room, she heard a heavy sigh, followed by footsteps as somebody walked in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My dear Princess...\" Camilla tutted, kneeling down in front of Zelda. \"I see you found out what the punishment is for not pleasing your clients. But before I continue, take a look at yourself. See what you've become\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffling, Zelda opened both eyes and inspected her body. Her top had fallen from her shoulders and was bunched around her legs, as was her skirt. With no clothes covering her, her completely flat chest and lower body was on full view to Camilla, who didn't seem concerned by her nudity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'd estimate you're around... eight years old now,\" Camilla continued. \"Seeing as you've fallen so far in such a short time, I should explain what happens should you continue to fail me. Regress below three years old, and your mind becomes mine to command. But I am not entirely without mercy. Reach the age of twenty by pleasing clients, and I'll let you go free. But for now, I think you're done for the day. Back to your cell you go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering up her clothes, Zelda allowed herself to be led back to her cell. As she walked, she didn't even attempt to memorize an escape route. Instead, she stared down at her childish body, her mind confused. Camilla called her '<i>Princess</i>' earlier... Was she a Princess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am... Princess Zelda...</i> Zelda thought. <i>Of Hy... Hyrule? But why am I here? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda continued to ponder why she was here, and not in Hyrule Castle like an actual Princess, until she reached her cell. Glancing up at Camilla, she briefly considered pleading to stay with her, however Camilla paid her no mind and shoved her into her cell. The door slid shut behind her, leaving Zelda alone in her room...</span></div></div>",

Zelda teared up as the pain stopped and she realized what she must do to satisfy this zora.

I\u2019ll do it right this time!l\u201d she swallowed her pride and repeated Camillas insults to her self <i>Stripper, Slut</i>.<br>\r\nShe began her dance again, but this time moved with confidence, thrusting out her hips, breast and delicate behind with each movement, as if having sex with the air itself, if she were in public she might be called a slut for how vulgar her motions were. She rolled her hips towards the zora like she was fighting to touch the fish womans pussy with her own but was being forced back by an invisible foe. The Zora looked impressed and sat back to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zelda knew it wasn\u2019t enough, she needed the Zora more than interested, she needed her aroused, begging to be touched just as much as Zelda herself had to be. The former princess could feel alien thoughts invade her again, <i>I\u2019m so embarrassed, but... this feels right... I want to be seen like this, I want to feel like a dirty play thing, I want her to touch herself while she watches me dance...</i> Zelda teared up a little as she realized she\u2019d have to make this next decision on her own, she was a slut now, but she had to become more.<br>\r\nHer movements increased in tempo, she thust and bobbed to an invisible beat that had just picked up and her breast could barely stay inside her top as they bounced <i>please work... please </i> her own thoughts begged more timidly than the false thoughts have ever sounded. <br>\r\nAnd slowly, ever so slowly, her clothes began to slide off of her. The thong she\u2019d been afraid of last time had now become her goal as she watched her top fall from her now bare breast and her pants slid down with every hip swing to expose more of her legs and panties. The Zoras jaw dropped as on of her hands subconsciously moved to her crotch. <i>Yes!</i> Zeldas eyes watched hungrily as she continued to dance in nothing but her underwear, shaking her breast so much they jiggled like a pair of chuchu\u2019s. <i>Crave me! Love me! Fuck me!</i> she accepted her new role, she wasn\u2019t royalty, she was a stripper, a slut that craved attention. She slowed her dance to a stop as she smiled to the zora.

She has no idea who or what the carriage driver is or where they are at currently but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has to work.\" Zelda reaches into her tight pockets slowly drawing the knife that her knight forced on her some time ago. Her body is doing its best to reject the spell and strangely the potion she dinked is also slowing it somehow. When she gets to the village she might find a cure. But now it's escape time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wretched knight, are you going to leave your princess behind to wade in the mud!\" The Yiga sorceress yells aloud taking her eyes off Zelda for a brief moment. \"Come out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her weakened body, Zelda lunges toward the witch knife extended. She hears multiple rips of her clothes as she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, no, no! Not now! Not when I'm so close to getting away from her!</i><br>\r\nAs darkness began to creep into her vision, Zelda stumbled again. Her foot caught on a clump of thick mud, causing the pig tailed princess to go crashing into the mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling heat build within her body, Zelda let out a groan. This was different from the other changes...<br>\r\n \"Amazing!\" She heard the sorceress gasp. \"Whatever caused your aging is working with my curse... Which means a Sheikah is responsible for aging you... And only one Sheikah would be interested in that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look... Somewhere else...\" Zelda managed to get out. <br>\r\nThe sorceress snickered. <br>\r\n \"And miss seeing Hyrule's fair Princess become more and more like the pig she is? Please! I'm going to watch you change, and enjoy every second of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned down in front of Zelda, her ruby eyes flicking between various parts of her body. Her gaze lingered on her curly tail for a few seconds before moving to her face, where her eyes remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for this quickly became evident. Zelda let out a groan as she felt her nose and ears begin to contort. Her nose flattened out and took up more of her face, while her ears lost their points and became floppy and slightly pinkish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlongside her piggish changes, the usual age progression changes began to wash over her. She felt her breasts, both of which were shoved into the mud beneath her, swelled out a tiny bit, while her backside did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How much bigger can they get?!</i> Zelda wondered as she felt her growth end. <i>They're both so big... Not that I'm complaining, but I would be liked to obtain them over time, rather than over the course of a few hours...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a giggle, Zelda looked up. Above her, the sorceress was having a great time inspecting her body. <br>\r\n \"This is great! Watching the Princess of Hyrule slowly morph into a pig... Somebody else had you as their target, but I think they'll find your changes fun as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why, you... *SNORT*\"<br>\r\nHearing herself snort, Zelda's face turned bright red. She looked down in mixed disgust and sadness as the Yiga Sorceress burst into laughter. <br>\r\n \"Outstanding! However, as much as I'd love to stay and watch you change, I've got a knight to find! See you around, Your Highness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Zelda a mock wave, the sorceress marched back to her carriage, leaving the piggish princess in the mud, an area she was beginning to appreciate somewhat. She played with the mud for a few seconds before looking up angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can't let her get away with this! It's bad enough I'm cursed to grow older, but to slowly morph into a pig... I need to start dealing with these curses!\"</span></div></div>",

Purah's potion can wait, she needs to undo this spell first or else she'll be doing more than just snorting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gets off her knees as she picks up her dropped knife, a loud rip is heard as she feels her left leg become exposed to the cold night elements.

This means she has to chase her one clue for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to <i>*SNORT*</i> go...\"Zelda snorts and puts her hand over mouth as her face turns red.

Thankful that it is still raining Zelda follows the upturned trail hoping to find the witch. Soon however Zelda comes across the end of the trail as it goes toward a village. It looked rather new and perhaps the reason why she has yet to hear about it is due to its newness. However,  Zelda is hesitant to go through the village, her state of dress and her new curse being the main issue. There doesn't seem be anyone due to the rain but the carriage tracks get lost with all the other tracks made in the effort to stay dry, but she might miss a clue if she doesn't go. She could get some supplies along with new clothes here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps some food as well. I rather sleep outside town though.\" Zelda thinks as her stomach growls fiercely reminding her that she has yet to really eat anything since this trip save some alcohol at Castle Town but she may find something outside the border of the town also to eat along with a clue she may have not be able to find along the forested borders as well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her anger and embarrassment swell but she takes a deep breath to calm herself. For now Zelda has to resolve herself to speak only if she has to. Perhaps when she is alone the Princess of Hyrule can figure out a way to not snort when speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looks down the path that led to the cave she could have seeked shelter at but realizes it is not far enough to be shletered at thanks to the sorcress perhaps finding out. She looks around for familar landmarks knowing this area well. <i>\"There should be a reststop or a small village in the oppostie direction I might be able to hid my piggish features and get supplies there!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda heads down the muddy path, thankful for the rain as it might wash away some of the mud on her person as well as cover some of her tracks. As she walks she cannot help but notice how her gait has changed well is rather forced to notice. Her hips and butt, trapped in the tighter pants are hurting as much as her feet in her tight boots,  giving her a half walk as a full stride would tear them and expose her lower form. Her breast are tight against her tunic making it hard to breath somewhat as a snort or a gasp escapes her every once in awhile. Every detail of her breasts would be on full display in the rain if not for the thick material. Long tears have appeared on her sides up to her armpits when she tried to stab the Yiga woman and they seem to have expanded as she walks. She can barely extend her arms and legs without making the tears worse. Her clothes are living on borrowed time she knows but she needs to move even at even a slower pace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNo doubt I look like some kind of stripper or some abused damsel.

Her hands continued to force hay into her mouth, slowly speeding up until her cheeks were visibly bulging with hay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! Stop it!

More and more hay made its way into her stomach, which, despite the pig slop she had just eaten, seemed to be satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the last handful of hay, Zelda was powerless to stop her body from pushing it into her overfilled mouth.

Thankfully when she opened it she cheers,\" Thank you Hyilia *SNORT*!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside there was armor that was well preserved despite the condition of the box. No rust or anything to be found. It must have been left not long ago! Looking down, Zelda digs her wet hands through the box not minding the new rips as her body bent over in order to find something wear. Finally she finds a wool tunic and pants. Excited, Zelda releases a few snorts as her breathing hitches and almost rips her clothes off. If they were not the last reminder of her last life one hundred years ago she would have just let them fall to shreds. The shoes were a beast of their own right to take off but with all the mud and water inside them they slowly let go of Zelda's poor feet. There were some boots inside that managed to fit her size close enough a bit large but it was far better then the other boots!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunic and pants are obviously made for a man considering how they hug their curves more then anything and loose along her arms legs and stomach but they are large enough to be comfortable and loose enough so they should withstand any further growth or changes....for now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>\"I should find a way to hide...these.\"</i> Zelda thinks as she looks at the armor will pinching her pig like ears and staring at her nose. Still inside the box. The metal helmet on top would could hide her face well as it is basically a mask that covers her face. The thick metal armor might fit her curves too....if not she knows a minor spell that would fix that. She would have used it on her clothes but she might accidently have damaged them more so she didn't as it's better to use on metal then regular clothes. The armor would serve as intimated in order to scare off the less morally inclined and help cover her pig like features for now. Plus it would protect her from the rain! <i>\"Also no one would know I am Zelda. If they do I could say I am under cover I think...\"<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

This one consisted of a weird blend of both fresh and rotten produce, alongside the usual hay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh, Zelda once again did nothing to stop her body from grabbing handfuls of fruit, veg and hay and shovelling them into her mouth. While the process was no different from the first two times, Zelda found herself somewhat enjoying her meal this time around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could get used to this...</i> She thought as she forced a rotten tomato into her mouth. <i>Oh, Hylia... Now I'm enjoying this?! How long until I turn into some sort of herbivore?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping her feast for a few seconds so she could lick her fingers clean, Zelda patted her belly. <br>\r\n<i>Huh, that's weird...</i> She thought as her body returned to its feast. <i>Am I getting... fatter? No, that's impossible. Although, I did think aging rapidly and turning into a pig were both impossible...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she taken more than a few seconds to pat her belly, Zelda would've realised that she was actually beginning to fatten up. Her belly expanded slowly with soft fat, which bulged through the existing rips on her tunic while simultaneously adding some new ones. Meanwhile, her pert breasts and ample ass began to fill with fat, adding their own rips and tears to her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the final piece of produce, which was a fresh-looking apple, Zelda took a large bit out of it. She crunched it slowly for a few seconds, before shoving the whole thing into her mouth, core included. Juice dribbled from her mouth and ran down her chin, where it was promptly caught by one of her fingers and then shoved back into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I shouldn't have *SNORT* enjoyed that...\" Zelda said, stifling a burp, \"But I enjoyed that. Oh, what *SNORT* am I becoming?! A pig destined to *SNORT* stuff herself with fresh and rotten produce?!\"<br>\r\nHer belly, which now had a thick layer of soft flab covering it, growled at the mention of produce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, shut it!\" She said angrily. \"Those boxes *SNORT* turned out to be a waste of my time! I really need to get *SNORT* moving! But dressed as I *SNORT* am, is travelling by the road a good idea? People could see me... Maybe if I try the wilderness next to the road?

I should rest but....who *SNORT* knows what will happen while I sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is indeed a good question. While she is napping she could age more and become more piggish. At least awake she can deal with the changes as they come. If she fell asleep she would be waking to unexpected things that could slow her down as she got used to them. The Yiga woman could also easily come back and catch Zelda since she has mostly been following the main road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I....I can't stay awake.

For all she knew, she could've wandered into a monster camp and fallen asleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she hadn't. She had chosen a rather pleasant clearing that was covered by a number of bushes. Overhead, the trees formed a canopy that had shielded her slumbering form from the storm. And the ground was soft. Not so much that it was comfortable, but enough that she got a good night's sleep on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alright, nice area... Now I need to stop putting of the inevitable and see if anything happened to me during the night...</i><br>\r\nSlowly looking down at her body, Zelda let out a long groan that slowly morphed into a disappointed snort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanges to both her race and age had indeed found her during the night. The most prominent change, and one she would definitely have trouble hiding, was her new skin tone. She no longer had the pale creamy skin of a Hylian, instead now having a pale pink of a pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from her skin tone, her skin also felt tougher. Pinching her arm, Zelda didn't even note any pain unless she pinched really hard. <br>\r\n<i>I suppose that could be useful... More useful than this odd craving for produce I seem to have developed... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her age, her breasts and ass seemed a lot firmer than last night. However, they still had a noticeable layer of flab covering them. And as for her belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It seems bigger?</i> Zelda thought, grabbing it. <i>It can't be, can it? I haven't ate anything...</i><br>\r\nIt was bigger, now splitting into two uneven rolls in her sitting position. However, Zelda swiftly moved on, now inspecting her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, her clothing still fit her. Sure, it was tattered and ripped. Her pink belly bulged through the numerous rips, and her breasts were just about covered, but it still fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same could be said for her pants, but just about. While they still fit her fat lower half, the waistband was halfway down her ass. When she tried to tug them up, they let out a dangerous groan of protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just as well</i>, Zelda thought as she pushed herself to her feet. <i>My tail wouldn't like it if I confined it to those pants...

Almost like...</i><br>\r\nTaking a deep whiff, Zelda nodded. She knew where it was coming from. She set off, curious and excited to see what was creating such a delicious scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take her long to find it. Pushing through a bush, Zelda found herself standing at the edge of a field. And at edge of the field...<br>\r\n<i>Is that... food?!</i><br>\r\nLetting out an excited snort, Zelda quickly made her way towards her potential meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing closer, she began to make out various vegetables and fruit. From the scent, the vast majority of it was beginning to rot. Whoever had grown it had probably thrown it into this pile, presumably for the birds to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, I'm no bird, but I certainly am hungry... </i>Zelda giggled as she reached the pile. Lifting a tomato, she greedily shoved it into her mouth. Letting out a pleased snort, she reached for another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What am I doing?!</i><br>\r\nShe stopped, a carrot clutched in her pink hand. <br>\r\n<i>I can't give in to these weird desires! They aren't mine! They're just the pig part of me trying to take over!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, Zelda found that she couldn't put the carrot back. Instead, she found herself slowly moving it to her mouth, which opened in preparation to receive it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carrot entered her mouth. Her mind slowly went blank as the pig within her took over. Letting out a delighted snort, Zelda practically dove into the pile of abandoned fitting vegetables.

Using her magic to place those boxes filled with rotted food, from her own storehouse even, was a great idea.

Letting out another squeal, Zelda tried to maintain her somewhat average pace, but it was slowly getting more and more difficult. She had never been the most athletic of people, and her new bulk wasn't doing her any favours. Her exposed belly bounced with each step she took, slapping loudly against her groin, while she was beginning to gasp for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe if I... reach the trees... it'll stop?</i> Zelda guessed, looking towards the forest. <i>I can only... only hope...</i><br>\r\nHer hopes were quickly dashed as another crackle sounded from behind her. Slightly curious about the speed of the mysterious worm, she risked a look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had expected it to be a good bit behind her. Instead, the worm was right behind her, its yellow eyes staring directly into Zelda's. This revelation caused her already clumsy pace to falter, allowing the worm to close the final few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do, Zelda opened her mouth to scream. Perhaps she could attract the attention of somebody passing by, and they could deal with this weird worm. Of course, she'd then have to explain who she was and why she was some sort of weird pig-human hybrid, but she'd rather that than have this thing catch her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her mouth opened, the worm lunged forth. Zelda's eyes widened as the creature entered her mouth, cutting off her air supply and causing her cheeks to bulge. Her hands tore at the worm, searching for some sort of hold to rip it out, however she found nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling to her knees, Zelda was powerless to stop the worm from forcing itself into her body. After a few seconds, it began to slither down her throat, causing her to cough and gasp for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This things gonna kill me!</i> She thought desperately. <i>If not from lack of air, then by forcing itself into me! It's way taller than me, so there's absolutely no way it'll fit inside me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she didn't die. She didn't even pass out. As the last of the worm slithered into her body, disappearing from sight with a wet pop, Zelda let out a groan.

Why are the Yiga still active? And where's Link? Why isn't he helping me?! And -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's long list of unanswered questions was cut short by Raven holding her hand up. <br>\r\n\"I realise you have many questions, however now is neither the time not place for answers.

At the very least, she could still grip stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, now that I've seen that, let's see where I am...</i><br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Zelda wobbled unsteadily. She was still wearing her boots, which weren't very compatible with her new feet. Reaching down, she pulled her boots off and threw them into the corner. She took a few steps to test her hooves, before nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They seem to work... Now, where am I?</i><br>\r\nHer earlier guess seemed to be accurate, as her surroundings were similar to that of a pig pen. The ground consisted of a thick mud which seemed to tug at her feet. In the corner sat a trough, filled to the brim with some sort of brown liquid that smelled heavenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Zelda took a few steps towards the trough before catching herself. <br>\r\n<i>Don't do it!</i> She told herself. <i>I eat from that, I probably never leave this pen...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing her eyes away from the trough, she trotted up to the edges. They were clearly meant to hold her, being way taller than regular pen walls. However, she was tall enough to peer over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the top, Zelda saw she was in...</span></div></div>",

In one corner of it sat a large stone structure, while in the centre was a long fence that formed a large oval. A well-worn track encircled the outside of the fence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her pen, it seemed to be at near the end of a long row of roofed outdoor pens. She could hear chickens in the one to her right, while a cow occasionally mooed from somewhere to her left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This place... It seems familiar</i>, Zelda thought. <i>But I can't place it...</i><br>\r\nHearing a whinney, Zelda's brow furrowed in confusion. She hadn't heard any horses earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she saw a number of horses ride into the central pen. They galloped around for a few minutes before suddenly stopping. At the same time, their heads all turned to face something out of view of Zelda's pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about their sudden interest in something, Zelda tried to poke her head out of her own to see what it was. Sadly, much like her shorter arms, her legs seemed a tad shorter, meaning she was unable to see whatever attracted the horses interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, she heard what was so interesting. A woman's voice singing a somewhat familiar tune reached Zelda's ears, which twitched in response. She felt attracted to the beautiful voice, and all of the tension and worry that filled her body slowly melted away, leaving serenity in their place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's so beautiful...</i> Zelda thought. <i>And so familiar... I wish I could see who was singing it...</i><br>\r\nA second later, her wish came true as a woman appeared. She walked into the centre of the horses pen, where she stood and continued to sing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had fiery red hair, and wore a pretty white top with a light purple skirt. A long apron, decorated with pictures of various animals, covered the front of her outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She seems familiar as well</i>, Zelda thought as the woman's song came to a satisfying end. <i>Why does this place fill me with such a sense of nostalgia? And why was her song so calming to me? Only one other song has that kind of effect on me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the woman's voice, which sounded a lot closer now. <br>\r\n\"Here we are!\" She said happily. \"Some delicious feed! Eat up~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking over the top of her fence, Zelda saw the woman slowly making her way down the row of pens. She carried various buckets, all of which seemed to be filled with different kinds of animal food. She could see seeds in some, while others were filled with hay. All of them, however, smelled delicious to Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew closer to Zelda's pen, her worry began to reappear. How this woman react to her? At this point, she looked more like a pig walking on two legs than a Hylian. What if she just dumped a bunch of food into her pen and walked off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need to talk to this woman</i>, Zelda decided. <i>I'll see how she reacts to me first though...</i><br>\r\nAs the woman reached her pen...</span></div></div>",

Initially, she had spent her time inspecting the walls of her pen, searching for some sort of way out or, failing that, a weakness she could exploit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter circling her pen a number of times, she was forced to admit defeat and curled up in the least muddy part of her pen. <br>\r\n<i>Well, they sure don't mess around with the walls here...</i> Zelda thought. <i>Although I suppose they are working with animals. It wouldn't do to have pigs and cows roaming freely...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her stomach, which had started grumbling around her second lap, Zelda let out a quiet snort. She cast a quick look at the trough in the opposite corner, the contents of which were looking more and more appetizing with each growl of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't give in</i>, she thought to herself, rolling over so she was looking at the wooden wall next to her. <i>The moment I give into those... desires... is the moment I'll most likely lose myself!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach didn't agree with her sentiment. It let out a long growl, which Zelda ignored. While starving certainly wasn't the best option, that woman would definitely notice something amiss if she didn't eat. And when she came to check her out, she'd make her escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pigs? Of course! We've got plenty!\"<br>\r\nHearing the woman, Zelda sat up. <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm looking for the right kind of pig, you know?

Right, just have to make sure they look at me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her hooves, she trotted towards the voices. Reaching the wall nearest to them, she crouched next to the wall. <br>\r\n<i>Okay, here goes...</i><br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Zelda let out a loud squeal, followed by a flurry of snorts.

And judging by the similar discomfort in her legs, they too were beginning to shrink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking straight ahead, Zelda saw her vision slowly shrinking as her body regressed.

Is there even more?!</i><br>\r\nIn response to her question, her belly began to inch outwards. It spread across her thighs, splitting into three uneven rolls of flab. Above them, her bare breasts filled with fat, sagging downwards until they brushed against her upper belly roll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No... It must be my lost height!</i> Zelda thought as she felt the last remnants of her old clothes, her pants, begin to tighten. <i>It's not disappearing, it's turning into fat! Curse that Sorceress!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a quiet rip, Zelda's face went bright red. Outside the pen, Camilla snickered. <br>\r\n<i>No... Not them... Anything but them!</i><br>\r\nMoving her gaze downwards, Zelda saw a massive rip now decorated the waistband of her pants. They still covered her lower body, but if she gained any more weight, then that was it for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, her simultaneous growth and shrinking stopped before that happened, however as Zelda inspected her body, she wasn't sure what to think. While her pants barely hid her bulbous lower body, it was only a matter of time before they ripped from her frame, leaving her with nothing but a stretched set of panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean?\" Camilla said, causing Zelda to look up at her. \"Quite young.

She flashed a cruel smile at Zelda, who was still lying on her side, a defeated look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to say hello to your new owner?\" Camilla asked mockingly, patting her lap. \"I'm hurt. Honestly, I am\".<br>\r\nZelda didn't answer. Her eyes lingered on Camilla's lap for a few seconds. When she had patted it, she had to resist the urge to waddle over and curl up into a warm ball...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop thinking like that!</i> Zelda chided herself, tearing her eyes away from Camilla's smug face. <i>I can still get out of this! The gate is open. All I need to do is run past her! And then hope I can outrun her...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling onto her front, Zelda pushed herself onto her stubby back legs. She wobbled dangerously for a second, unused to her shorter body, fatter lower body and new breasts. However, as she took a step forward, her balance deserted her, causing Zelda to go crashing into the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla tutted as she was forced to duck out of the way of some mud that came flying her way. <br>\r\n\"Looks like your hind legs don't work like they used to!\" She said gleefully. \"Which means you've got no choice but listen to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked up at Camilla, curiosity on her face. She had never wanted to talk before now, so why was she changing her mind all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm not a cruel person. I know you think otherwise, but I've been kind so far. If I so wished, you would've been a total pig when we first met. But that's beside the point. I wish to make a deal with you, Pigcess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda narrowed her eyes. <br>\r\n\"What *SNORT* kind of deal?\" She asked suspiciously. <br>\r\nCamilla smiled. <br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!

However, as time passed, her squeal became less of a squeal and more of a human scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda felt her stubby arms and legs stretch outwards, slowly and painfully returning to their original sizes. Her four extra breasts retreated back into her body, however her original two remained as they were, pink and hefty. Her hooves split into five distinctive parts, all of which curled inwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the pen, Camilla was having a great time watching Zelda slowly revert into a Hylian. She could be made the whole process quick and painless, but where was the fun in that? The sound of her screams was like beautiful music to her pointed ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling to her knees, Zelda gasped for breath. She massaged her arms, which still throbbed with dull pain. After a few seconds, it receded, allowing Zelda to inspect the form Camilla had decided to give her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Camilla had been more merciful than Zelda had been expecting. Her skin was still a bright pink, her nose and ears were still that of a pig, she still had a short curly tail poking out from above her ass and both her chest and ass were much larger than normal, but aside from that, Zelda was mostly back to being Hylian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm... I'm me again...\"<br>\r\nZelda let out a long breath of relief.

Very fancy stuff they used to be I reckon.\"The young voice gives a disirption and Zelda lets out a huge sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"They are talking about me. I do suppose I do like a Bokobin...Hyilia help me.\"</i> Zelda is suddenly grateful that she did not stop in a town. If she did who knows how the guards and the people would react? She probably wouldn't be alive after someone came into her room. <i>\"I need to escape or hide. I could try to reason but I doubt they will listen to me. Maybe. They've never met a talking Bokobin before.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm perhaps it's a good thing we placed these rotted food here and there. It makes them easy to capture when their bellies are full. That Yiga woman did scare me, but her advice was pretty sound wasn't it?\" The older manly voice gets closer to the large vegation covering Zelda's hiding spot. Peeking out a bit Zelda cannot make out any features to tell if they were warriors or even farmers that live in the area. Her belly bobs the slightest, reminding her of  her fattened body. She hears the two men moving the vegation as she realizes they are coming toward her! She needs to do something soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A Yiga woman? Now I am curious, did she come here beforehand? Or is this a different Yiga woman? Also why are they capturing Bokobin instead of killing them?\"</i> Zelda calmly looks around in the small cave she is in. She's been in plenty of this situations before. She could hide somehow maybe but she'll be easily discovered as the cave was only big enough to hide the boxs and herself but if she hides behind the boxs....she doubts she could hide by holding herself up on the walls but it is also an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zelda clamped a hand over her mouth as she heard one of the boxes rattle slightly. From her prone position, she could barely make out the shadow of one of the men inspecting the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, the boxes are cold,\" The younger voice declared. \"It's probably moved on by now. You know they don't hang around places that don't have any food.\"<br>\r\nThe older voice grunted in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, well. Suppose it's somebody else's problem now,\" It said. \"Shame, though. That Yiga Woman did say she'd pay handsomely for a pink Bokoblin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps slowly retreat from the cave, Zelda let out a long breath. <br>\r\n<i>That was way too close...</i> She thought, wiping sweat from her forehead. <i>I'm just glad they didn't look any closer. However, this talk of a Yiga paying for Bokoblins... Is it the same woman who cursed me? Or some other member of the clan? Either way, it would probably be best if I didn't get caught by her...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving out of her hiding place, Zelda cast a final look at the empty boxes before heading for the exit. <br>\r\n<i>Hopefully, they aren't waiting for me outside</i>, she thought as she neared the exit. <i>That would really suck...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Zelda figured out her clothes were in fact becoming looser as she herself became smaller, her pace became even faster once her line of sight went even closer to the ground again. Her clothes were now loose as her older body stretched them to their limits. Strangely, while everything else shrank or changed, Zelda's hair did not staying the same length as it was moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why is this happening? Is it the rain...or is the potion's effect wearing off?\"</i> Zelda is confused but more terrified. First she had to worry about becoming older and literally growing out of her clothes now she might have to worry about crawling in them!<i>\" The cave shouldn't be much farther now...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was thankfully right as several yards away and sees the opening of the cave. Grateful for the sight Zelda quickens her pace not seeing the uncovered muddy root near her now fitting boots. \"Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knows it the Princess of Hyrule finds her face in mud. As she works the face full of mud off her face she feels the clothes loosen even more. Still half blind with mud in her eyes Zelda runs toward the entrance of the cave in a hurry to get away from the rain in order to take stock of what is happening to her.  Water and dirt drips off her as she takes off the hood one that perfect fits her body frame and drops it to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..regressed back to my normal age?\" Zelda mutters looks down at herself. No Chu sized breasts and large hips. Just her normal self. \"The potion was only temp -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her eye drops a bit more she feels her hair touch the stone brown floor,\"- orary? Oh Hyilia no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to be the rain! Or is just water?! Either way I need to get dry quickly!\" Zelda looks around the cave looking for something to use. Thankfully it seems someone was here some time ago as she sees an abandoned blanket. There was some holes and while an emergency Zelda still rather not be seen without something covering her. The clothes though loose are now hard to take off as the rainwater makes it stick to her skin. Her boots are hard to take off due to the water and mud inside them but soon her feet scream in relief as they come off. As She tumbles her clothes around as she feels her hips and breast receded a bit more and without formality quickly grabs the large blanket and uses the outside to dry herself off. As soon as the princess is completely dried she takes a deep breath as she tries to collect herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Water regresses me....or just the act of getting wet results in this?\"</i> In her scholarly mind Zelda was intrigued with this as well as the impactions it could have on the people if perfected. Yet she doubts something like this could be perfected. However she rather gets cured first before researching, or having others research, this more. Her nails and hair are still long as before her regression. Taking careful steps Zelda approaches the mouth of the cave and eyes a deep puddle near the entrance. Looking at the pool Zelda sees her mud covered face the rest of her body is covered and she still has her curves, even if they are not as prominent as before. Her eyes are still the same but her face looks even more youthful. Perhaps if she did not trip earlier she would be at her normal age. <i>\"If I'm right...I'm no longer even my eighteen year old self. Possibly fifteen, sixteen at most? Some people might recognize me as Zelda now though a bit on the young side.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nZelda carefully wipes off her face, being careful as she knows the act of water might trigger her newfound regression. Maybe now she'll stop growing? Or just continue to grow till wet like a weird plant? <i>\"Perhaps it's a onetime thing. I don't want to test it however.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nJust as Zelda cleans her face she looks around the cave there were some abandoned Cargo here and there some left quiet recently to her knowledge perhaps she might find some clothes here along with some other things she might need for the journey. <i>\"First thing first I need to do something about my hair and nails. I look like some kind of lost ragged child. Then clothes, then a fire.\"<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, first up is my hair. I wonder if any of these boxes have scissors in them...\"<br>\r\nDue to her lack of fitting and clean boots, Zelda carefully tip-toed deeper into the cave, doing her best to avoid the pointed rocks that littered the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually reached the crates, having stood on a few rocks on her trip. Sitting on an empty one, Zelda took a few seconds to dig the rocks out of her heels before beginning her search for a pair of scissors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here...\"<br>\r\nHumming a quiet lullaby to herself, she pulled a crate close to her. With her long fingernails, she struggled to open the lid. After a few seconds, she decided to stop caring so much about her nails, considering that she was going to cut them soon enough, and dug them underneath it. Another few seconds passed before the lid flipped open, promoting Zelda to clap happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! We've got... Some blue rupees... A rusty sword? And... Eww... A pair of mouldy pants...\"<br>\r\nThrowing the pants aside and pocketing the rupees, Zelda eyed the sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could use this, but it probably wouldn't be too safe... Let's see what else we have...</i><br>\r\nGrabbing another crate, Zelda struggled again with the lid, before shrugging and using her nails again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And box number 2 has... A single green rupee... Urgh, an even mouldier shirt and... A pair of scissors! Finally!\"<br>\r\nOnce again throwing the shirt into the corner and pocketing the rupee, Zelda ran her eyes over the scissors. Their blades were a bit rusty, and they squeaked loudly when ever she opened them, but they should suffice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand through her blonde locks, which tickled the back of her knees, Zelda slowly cut her way through her hair until it reached mid-way down her back. Kicking the discarded hair into the corner where the mouldy clothes sat, she turned her attention to her nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, easy does it...</i><br>\r\nWith hands that shook slightly from the cold, Zelda did her best to clip her nails. Due to the rusty and dulled blades, it was a somewhat painful process that took way longer than Zelda had originally planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the scissors into the corner, Zelda turned her attention to the next item on her list; clean clothes. While she had technically found clothes, they weren't exactly clean. Even Link, who had no qualms wearing woman's clothing and even wandered about in his underwear on occasion, would probably shy away from the mouldy clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a third crate, Zelda now had a new problem. She no longer had her nails, which had been her only way to open the crates. After a few choice Goddess names, she came across an idea. Grabbing the rusty sword from the first crate, she used it to pry open the lid. The blade creaked dangerously and threatened to snap, but it held as the lid flipped open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a couple more rupees, Zelda frowned. While she did appreciate the small amounts of money, she wasn't really looking for any. Pocketing the rupees anyway, she threw that box aside and grabbed another one. Using the sword again, she managed to crack it open at the cost of her sword. The blade snapped in half, which caused Zelda to let out a yelp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping hold of the broken hilt, she flipped open the lid. Her eyes lit up as she spotted some light blue fabric and some black fabric. <br>\r\n<i>It may not be new clothes, but I can definitely repair my old ones! </i>She thought happily. <i>Now, let's see here...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching through another crate and finding some thread, Zelda set about repairing her clothes. In order to repair her clothing, she reluctantly had to remove both her top and her pants, leaving her naked until she had repaired every last hole. Only when she had pulled them back in did she breath in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And now, fire! There is definitely no shortage of wood, but as for some flint... Maybe the last crate has something in it...</i><br>\r\nPrying open the last crate with her demolished hilt, Zelda let out a cheer as she spotted a small bit of flint. Pocketing the rupees that she had come to expect in every box, she threw the flint onto the floor. It was followed by one of the boxes which she broke up with her sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, a fire roared to life in front of her. Sitting next to it, Zelda warmed her hands for a few seconds. Outside, the rain was still coming down, accompanied by the occasional rumble of thunder and flash of lightning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it won't give up for the night...\" She sighed, looking down at her regressed body. \"I should get some sleep, and hopefully, the rain will have stopped in the morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurling up next to the fire, Zelda drifted off to sleep, the crackling of the fire and the rain helping to relax her...</span></div></div>",

She dove for the destroyed sword hilt she had used to pry open the boxes. While it only had an inch of rusty metal acting as a blade, it was probably still deadly enough to do some damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing her eyes as she struggled to peer through the curtain of water covering the cave entrance, Zelda lifted her hilt in both hands.

Same hair colour as you, same eye colour and same clothing sense! Seen her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Zelda was rendered speechless. He couldn't recognize her, even with a few years knocked off her age?

His eyes were no longer bloodshot, which probably meant that he was no longer drunk. However, he wore an irritated expression, which probably meant that he was suffering from a bad hangover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you do look awfully familiar...\" Burlon muttered. \"But just to make sure... What was the drink I bought for you?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know. You never told me what it was called,\" Zelda answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurlon was silent, which worried Zelda. While he had been an incredible pain while drunk, maybe sober Burlon was a little more helpful. <br>\r\n\"Lass! It is you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda let out a yelp as Burlon crossed the cave in two steps and scooped her up into a big hug. Her feet left the floor, which told Zelda that she had lost a fair bit of height. The two had almost been equal the last time she had seen him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what happened? You're so...\"<br>\r\n\"Young?\" Zelda filled in. <br>\r\nBurlon nodded. <br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Do you have an umbrella?\" Zelda asked, peering over Burlon's shoulder at the curtain of rain still covering the cave entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurlon poked at the fire with the tip of his sword, an odd look on his face. After a few seconds, the look faded and he nodded. Reaching into his pack, he pulled out another bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na, not an umbrella... Something a little more effective. I always thought some of the things Ma taught me would be useless,\" he said, looking over at Zelda. \"Thought she was mad when she told me to always carry this, that and some more of this. Looks like at least two of those skills aren't useless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Burlon unzipped his bag, Zelda curiously peered over. Her eyes lit up as she saw what the bag contained. <br>\r\n\"Is that... A clothing repair kit?!\" She asked. <br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, plus a few extras. Never actually been used, now that I think about it. I'll need your clothes, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda shot him an irritated look. <br>\r\n\"What am I supposed to wear while you repair these?\" She asked. <br>\r\nReaching back into his bag, Burlon pulled out what looked to be some of his clothing. He threw them at Zelda before turning his back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis meaning clear, Zelda pulled her own baggy clothing off and replaced it with Burlon's even baggier clothing. His top stunk of alcohol and acted as more of a dress on her teenage frame, while she had been forced to tie a length of rope around her waist in order to keep his pants on, but other than that, his clothes were quite comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be careful with those!\" She asked, handing her clothes to him. \"They... don't make them anymore...\"<br>\r\nBurlon nodded gently. <br>\r\n\"Not to worry, Lida. I'll take good care of them. Now, let's see here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda watched in silence as Burlon reached into his bag, pulling out a couple of needles and a length of string. He slowly measured out various lengths before beginning to patch up the holes. <br>\r\n\"You mind not looking?\" Burlon grunted suddenly. \"Makes me a bit nervous\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh! Of course! Just tell me when you're done!\"<br>\r\nTurning around, Zelda found herself quickly becoming bored as she listened to the fire crackling, the rain falling and the soft noises of Burlon fixing her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed slowly. Unfortunately, the rain didn't ease off, instead sounding even heavier. Thunder and lightning began to join the torrential downpour, which worried Zelda. Lightning had a habit of striking people out of the blue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an indeterminate amount of time had passed, Zelda heard Burlon drop his tools and let out a long sigh. <br>\r\n\"There. That should be that\".<br>\r\nZelda turned around. In his arms were her clothes, which looked almost brand new. A few specks of mud were the only evidence that they had been damaged at any point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I made you this as well. Should keep the rain from your skin!\"<br>\r\nHe handed her a black long-sleeved hood. <br>\r\n\"Thank you, Burlon. And I'm sorry for leaving you back there,\" Zelda apologised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurlon grunted in response. <br>\r\n\"Nah, I was... Doesn't matter. Get changed, and we'll try that hood out!\"<br>\r\nHe turned around, giving Zelda her privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Zelda was back in her own clothing, which had been both repaired and resized for her younger body. Pulling the hood on, she tapped Burlon on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" She asked brightly, twirling around. <br>\r\n\"Looking good, Lida,\" Burlon grunted. \"Now, let's try it out\".<br>\r\nHeading towards the cave entrance, Zelda cast all doubt from her mind. She trusted Burlon's handiwork, despite not even knowing him that well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing through the curtain of rain, Zelda stood in the rain for a few seconds...</span></div></div>",

Oh, no... Well, some of my ancestors were. The very first Zel... Uh, Lida... played a harp. Then there was the Ocarina, and I think there was a set of pan pipes at some point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay...\" Burlon scratched his head. \"What about that song though?\"<br>\r\n \"The lullaby? It... was passed down through my family, from mother to daughter. Apparently it has magical powers, but it's never shown any!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked away, feigning interest in a nearby tree as a smile spread across her face. Her lullaby did indeed have magical abilities, but only when played on one of the aforementioned instruments. However, seeing as all three instruments had been missing for millennia, the only power it had now was the power to make her drowsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Magical power, huh... Sounds like your ancestors were quite powerful!\" Burlon said. <br>\r\n \"I... guess you could say that!\" Zelda said nervously, unwilling to say anymore. \"Anyway, how much longer until the village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not long. Look, you can see the hill over those trees\".<br>\r\nBurlon pointed over some trees ahead. Zelda craned her neck in an attempt to see the mill, but was unable to see over the trees. Noticing this, Burlon reached over and, with relative ease, lifted Zelda up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-Woah!\"<br>\r\nZelda's hood wobbled dangerously. With an unsteady hand , she yanked it forwards. <br>\r\n \"Burlon!\" She said angrily, looking down at her partner. \"Tell me before you do that! I almost lost my hood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurlon gave a gruff laugh in response. <br>\r\n \"Sorry... You're a lot lighter than I thought!\"<br>\r\n \"Excuse me?!\" Zelda said, pouting. \"Put me down! I'm done with being carried like a sack of grain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Burlon dropped her. She landed unsteadily, almost losing her footing. Her hood fell down, and for a few seconds, Zelda's hair was subjected to the intense downpour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No!\" She wailed, yanking her hood back up. \"Don't look!\"<br>\r\nBurlon, visibly confused, averted his eyes. <br>\r\nPlease don't shrink, please don't shrink, please don't shrink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her body tingle slightly, Zelda felt herself drop about an inch. Her tunic and pants loosened a little, but remained tight enough to stay on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda ran her hands over her body. Her breasts had lost a little mass, as had her ass. Her face was slightly rounder, while her lengthy locks had retreated up her back a little. <br>\r\n<i>At least it wasn't too much...</i> She sighed in relief. <i>Maybe a year at most! So I'm probably fifteen again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, so...\"<br>\r\nZelda looked over at her partner, who had his back to her. <br>\r\n \"Can I look now?

Now, lead on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in silence until they reached the village. True to Burlon's word, the sign outside the village was blank, aside from a scuff of white paint.

I wanna talk to you!\"<br>\r\nIn the corner of her eye, Zelda spotted Burlon waving and calling her over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegrudgingly, Zelda headed towards him, two empty glasses clutched in her hands. <br>\r\n \"What do you want?\" Zelda asked roughly. <br>\r\n \"Wow, service sure is rough around here!\" Burlon chuckled before lowering his voice. \"Listen, Lida. People think you work here, and that works in our favour. They'll ignore you, giving you ample opportunity to pick up information. So, play along. Refill some glasses. Deal with the drunks. You know, the typical kinda stuff\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda shuffled nervously. She had been way out of her depth before this. Now, she couldn't even see the sun. <br>\r\n \"I... I suppose I could do it...\" She muttered. \"But only if you promise you won't drink too much! Deal?\"<br>\r\nBurlon grinned. <br>\r\n \"Deal. Now, get me a top-up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, despite her royal upbringing, Zelda found her new temporary job relatively simple. She weaved her way through the crowd with ease, even while holding two full tankards. She even got into the mindset of a waitress, giggling at drunks telling her bad jokes and even trying her hand at flirting. However, after somebody tried to kiss her, she quickly stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter refilling her another couple of tankards, Zelda found herself summoned by a still sober Burlon. <br>\r\n \"So, I see you're fitting right in!\" He said as Zelda made her way to the other side of the counter. \"Hear anything interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"More worrying than interesting,\" Zelda said, pretending to wipe down some glasses. \"Yiga have been spotted in the area\".<br>\r\n \"Those customed weirdos? Thought they disbanded. Another, please\".<br>\r\nRefilling Burlon's glass, Zelda let out a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's wrong?\" Burlon asked, a faint smile on his scarred face. \"Job getting to you?\"<br>\r\n \"What? Yes, I guess so...\"<br>\r\nZelda trailed off. Her real worry was being recognized and subsequently kidnapped by the Yiga. Link had always scared off potential kidnappers. Burlon, while imposing, probably wouldn't have the same effect on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anyway, how much longer are we going to stay here?\" Zelda asked. \"I think that guy over there is waiting for me to leave or something...\"<br>\r\n \"Hmm... I suppose we could get a couple of rooms. You got any money?\"<br>\r\nZelda dug around in her pockets. Over the course of the night, she had made a decent amount in tips, so she could easily afford two rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Easy. Problem is, I think everybody assumes I work here now. Even the owner thinks so! How am I meant to get two rooms?\"<br>\r\nBurlon tapped his chin in thought. <br>\r\n \"Give me the money. I'll buy the rooms, tell which one is yours, and then you can sneak in at some point. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nodded.

She clamped a hand over her mouth, stifling a scream, as her newly resized clothes began to add to her pain, digging painfully and uncomfortably into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is getting too bad!</i> Zelda thought as tears began to form in the corners of her eyes. <i>I'll pass out if this continues! I need to start dealing with this... Somehow...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the faint sounds of fabric ripping and stitches undoing filled the room, an idea came to the pained Princess. It was one she wasn't too fond of, but between blacking out and it, she'd take it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the hem of her tunic, which was rising up her body at a startlingly rapid pace, Zelda struggled to pull it over her swelling tits. After a brief fight, she managed to pull it over them and her head. She threw it in the general direction of the bed before beginning to work her pants free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to her upper body, which was growing at a decent pace, her lower body had exploded with fat. Her ass and hips still reigned supreme as her most prominent feature, while her thighs weren't far behind. During her fight with her tunic, long and obvious rips had formed down the sides of her pants, making it slightly easier to pull them off, but made Zelda anxious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What if Burlon can't fix these?</i> She wondered as she chucked her near ruined pants towards the bed. <i>Or what if he doesn't have the materials? What if -</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer worries were cut short as pain flared up. She barely managed to stifle her screams of agony. <br>\r\n<i>This... is... almost un... bearable...</i><br>\r\nCurling up into the fetal position, Zelda tried to think about anything but the pain wracking her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Link... Father... The Champions...</i><br>\r\nFor the briefest of moments, it seemed to work. But as she continued to think...<br>\r\n<i>The Divine Beasts... Malice... Ganon... Darkness...</i><br>\r\nAs her thoughts turned to Ganon, the pain flared up again, worse than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a silent scream, Zelda finally succumbed to the pain. Her eyes shut, her world was enveloped in darkness, and she fell unconscious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>The next morning</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's eyes slowly fluttered open. She was still in the floor next to the door, clad in only her underwear. Thankfully, the pain that had tortured her last night had subsided, however her body was now numb and unresponsive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gods, that was horrible...</i> She groaned internally. <i>I wish I could move... I want to know how bad the damage is...</i><br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, feeling began to slowly return her body.

Letting out a sigh, she cast a look down at her discarded teenage clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perhaps I should invest in some sort of stretchy material?\" She wondered, reaching down to grab her tunic. \"Once I get to Purah, I'll suggest it to her. But as for now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door caused her to fall silent. She held her breath for a few seconds, silently willing whoever knocked it to move on. <br>\r\n<i>Please, do not be Burlon... Anyone but him...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oi, lass! You in there?! Morning's here, so we should get moving!\"<br>\r\nHearing her new companions voice through the door, Zelda made a face. She couldn't really answer him, considering that her voice had matured along with her body. Although, she had explained to him that she had regressed from this age... Perhaps she could come up with another explanation about why she was suddenly this age again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could come up with some sort of explanation for him, the door flew open. Burlon stood in the doorway, a smile on his face. <br>\r\n \"Morning, Lida!\" He announced. \"Time to wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence followed his announcement. He locked eyes with the nearly naked Zelda, which caused the silence to take on an uncomfortable air. <br>\r\n \"Uh... I think I have the wrong room?\" Burlon said sheepishly, turning to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-No! You don't!\" Zelda quickly called out. \"I am Zel... Er, Lida!\"<br>\r\nBurlon stopped. He began to inspect her, causing Zelda to shuffle uncomfortably. She was nearly naked and being stared at by a man she barely knew. If it was any other situation, she would immediately call for guards and have him incarcerated for life. But if Burlon had to stare at her for a few seconds in order to determine her identity, then so be it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, colour me surprised, Lass!\" Burlon finally said. \"It is you! I'd know those eyes anywhere!\"<br>\r\nLetting out a relieved breath, Zelda smiled. <br>\r\n \"Thank goodness! I thought you wouldn't believe me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurlon shook his head. <br>\r\n \"Nah, after you drink with someone, you tend to remember them. And you are most definitely the girl I shared drinks with! But, uh...\"<br>\r\nHe fell silent. It took Zelda a few seconds to work out why. She looked down, remembering that she was almost naked. She was tempted to yell at him, but stopped herself. He was her best chance of finding clothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, Burlon?\" She started. \"Any chance you could resize my clothing? Again?\"<br>\r\nBurlon shook his head. <br>\r\n \"Sorry, lass. Once shrunk, there's no going back. You'll need to find something new\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was afraid he'd say that, Zelda thought. \"Well, can you get something?\"<br>\r\nBurlon nodded. He disappeared, but quickly returned, clothes draped over his arms. <br>\r\n \"Here, I... found these,\" he said, handing the clothes to Zelda, who was reluctant to accept them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where did he get these?</i> She wondered, eyeing them suspiciously. <i>Well, I suppose it doesn't matter. As long as they fit...</i><br>\r\nThe clothes were simple, and compared to her teenage clothes, very uncomfortable. The tunic was a simple white, and did very little to hide her round breasts. The pants were brown, and likewise did little to hide her lower half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slipping a pair of boots into her feet, Zelda straightened up. <br>\r\n \"How do I look?\" She asked. <br>\r\n \"Good. Now, shall we?\"<br>\r\nBefore following Burlon out of the room, Zelda scooped her old clothing into a bag. She might still have use for them if it was still raining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, she saw Burlon talking to the bartender. He gave her a brief wave as she came down the stairs. <br>\r\n<i>I wonder if it's still raining?</i> She wondered. <i>Surely it must have stopped during the night?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to find out, Zelda headed towards the door.

Her hood is too small for her enlarged head and the cloak won't fully cover her, leaving her knees and below unprotected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lass, before we go...\" Burlon pauses as he realizes the issue as well. \"I've heard some things before I went and woke you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?

Her old clothes had been somewhat waterproof and helped keep some of the water from her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese new ones, however, were not. Even with her ill-fitting cloak, they were almost instantly drenched. Her fringe, which was not covered by her hood, was quickly plastered to her face, forcing Zelda to lift her arms to swipe her hair from her vision, which caused the sleeves of her hood to fall back and caused her arms to become even more soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a set of rough her gentle hands grip her shoulder and give her a light push, Zelda began to pick up her pace. Burlon's meaning was clear. <br>\r\n<i>Don't stop. Just keep moving. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd keep moving she did. Picking her pace up to a near sprint, Zelda and Burlon raced out of the small village. Where possible, Zelda weaved under trees, which provided a brief respite from the torrential downpour, but she always had to leave to catch up to Burlon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Up ahead, Lida!\"<br>\r\nHearing Burlon's voice over the rain, Zelda risked a quick look up. Up ahead, the rain just stopped, giving way to sunshine and clear skies. <br>\r\n \"Not much further now!\" Burlon yelled as he fell in beside Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That would be great, but...</i><br>\r\nZelda looked down at her tingling body. Thankfully, her regression wasn't a painful ordeal, otherwise she would've stopped back in the village. But even so, it was an uncomfortable feeling, having her bones shrink and losing mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the entire time she had been running, she had been regressing. She had no idea what age she was, given that her body was covered, but seeing as she had been in the rain for a decent amount of time, she must have lost a good amount of years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her speed in order to her out of the rain, Zelda didn't see the long tree root reaching across the path. Her boot got caught underneath it, and she went crashing to the ground. Mud splattered everywhere, which was both a blessing and a curse. It dirtied both her and her clothes, but managed to get Burlon's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spun around and sprinted back for Zelda. Grabbing by the arm, he easily hoisted her to her feet. However, as she applied weight to her right foot, she let out a pained yell. <br>\r\n<i>Is my ankle sprained?!</i> She thought desperately. <i>I won't get far like this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she spotted a small cave. Pointing towards it, Burlon understood. He picked Zelda up with ease before making his way towards the cave. He jumped over roots and rammed through bushes, but did his best to keep Zelda covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, he gently lay her on the ground. <br>\r\n \"Ankle?\" He guessed, a look of concern on his face. <br>\r\nZelda nodded. Before Burlon could take a look at it, she stopped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let me see... just how bad the damage is... to my age?\" Zelda asked, breathing heavily. <br>\r\nNodding, Bulron stepped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her cloak, which seemed a little more fitting after her run, Zelda pulled it away from her, revealing her...</span></div></div>",

She has to quickly move these hands in order to catch her pants least she flash Burlon, even if the length of her shirt would cover her important parts. <i>\"I am probably eleven, twelve maybe even....thirteen...?

That is, if I could walk.\" Zelda voices somewhat chilidishly as she gestures with a raised arm up, the sleeve falling enough to at least expose her hand. Her other hand stays on her pants as she works to tuck the now muddy brown tunic inside in order to hold it. She then tightens the rope around as far as it goes. It holds but barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some things to heal the sprain but I'll have to go outside for the material to set it.

The stone would just make it more painful to walk on and move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything in the cave you could use?\" Zelda asks as she scoots to a more comfortable spot the rocks hurt her rump a bit more than usual without more \"cushion\".

Zelda tries to take it off quickly but her tingling limbs prevent her from doing so. Without mercy her body begin to regress. Thankfully for Zelda the regression was not all that big for her as a couple inches leave her, but her hands were now completely shrunken into her sleeves of her shirt. If Zelda was not on her bum her pants may fall off. Her curves shrink, her breasts almost flat and her hips completely boyish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tingling...seems to be gone. But... the pain... is still there.\" Zelda grunts as Burlon wipes away the sweat on her brow. With the pain Zelda can't tell how immature her voice is. Slowly but steady the pain fades from her... however not at certain spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha...?\" Is all Zelda can get out before her hips pop as they grow the slightest and add fat. It does it several more times till Zelda rear was at least the size of her normal  age of eighteen, looking awkward on her young body. It almost looked like the young girl had some balloons on her buttocks as her thighs added some width as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lida, I...\" Burlon stares in shock at Zelda's lower body his voice trailing off for moment as he removes the wet cloth in order to better watch over Zelda's changes. \"Dyn, this is why I hate magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It....<b>ugh</b> n-not over just yet....\" Zelda lets loose a yell as she feels a pain in her chest, much similar to an very intense heartburn. Zelda though knows what this pain means, her childish limbs placing themselves over her chest as her breasts appear once more. With each beat of pain her breasts grow, forcing her sleeve covered hands to spread out more. Zelda pushes on her breasts, ignoring the pain as she pushes against the soft flesh in an effort to push it back into her body. <b><i>\"I didn't want this...I just wanted to heal my sprain!\"<br>\r\n</i></b><br>\r\nWith one last yell of pain, Zelda's breast stop growing, stopping also at the size of her eighteen year old self. Taking several gasps of air, Zelda looks over her body...if she could. Her breasts make it hard for the princess to look past her chest, her young shoulders feeling pain they would normally not feel. So Zelda has to use her hands to explore her body.  She goes over her narrow stomach till it meets her hips which then curve into scary curvy portions to her young body. \"This....why did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Zelda muttered the question her brain received an answer. <i>\"So the Yiga can tell you are Zelda and not some little girl or woman looking like you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cursing her own impatience, Zelda looked over at her companion. Unlike her, who currently wore her feelings openly on her face, Burlon was stone-faced and impassive. He stared at her body for a few seconds before letting out a low growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh, Burlon... Are you alright?\" Zelda asked, her voice shaky. <br>\r\nBurlon didn't answer. Instead, he got to his feet and headed over to his pack. He rummaged around for a few seconds before producing a blue tunic, a set of black pants and a pair of brown leather boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, he came back to Zelda's side and gently helped her to sit up. Even sitting up, her new breasts put a worrying amount of strain on her back, forcing the young Princess to lean forwards in an attempt to alleviate some of the stress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupporting her back with one hand, Burlon used his other hand to pull Zelda's tunic over her head. She let out a squeak of protest, her small arms scrabbling to cover her breasts. She needn't have bothered, as her arms were too short to be of any use. However, as she looked up at Burlon, she saw that his eyes were shut tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComforted that her companion was respectfully covering his eyes, Zelda helped him help her to replace her oversized clothes. Grabbing her old tunic, she initially worried about the size, as it had been resized for the body of a fifteen year old. And if she had to guess her current age, she would probably place herself at ten years old. Nine, at the very minimum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Burlon slipped the tunic over her head and she pulled it down, Zelda found that it fit surprisingly well. Granted, her breasts took up the vast majority of space, but it fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a similar story with her pants. They were a little long in the leg, covering about half of her feet, but her hips and backside helped make them fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her boots onto her feet, Zelda looked up at Burlon, who still wore his blank face. <br>\r\n \"So... Now what?\" Zelda asked, trying to coax words out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now?\"<br>\r\nBurlon's voice was quiet, and held a dangerous edge. <br>\r\n \"I've had enough of this wretched magic, aging and deaging you whenever they please. Now, I'm getting you out of this rain with no more lost years. Put this on, and hang on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding Zelda her cloak, which trailed on the floor as she cautiously got to her feet, Burlon looked out at the rain for a moment. <br>\r\n \"Ready?\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded. She had no idea how he was going to get her out of the rain without any of it touching her, and she was interested to see how he would manage it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his arms wrap around her, Zelda let out a yelp as she was easily pulled into a tight grip. Burlon hunched over her body in a defensive pose, presumably to help deter some of the rain. The rest was probably up to her cloak to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then let's go!\"<br>\r\nLetting out a yell, Burlon sprinted out into the rain. He jumped over long roots that spread across the ground like tendrils. He ducked under low hanging tree branches. And when he reached the path, exposing him to the full force of the Yiga Rain Magic, he pulled Zelda close and charged towards the sunshine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his arms, Zelda had a poor view of what was happening. All she could really see was Burlon's scarred chin, with the occasional glimpse of a tree. However, as the pair burst into the sunshine, she was forced to shade her eyes as the sun shone brightly above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You... You did it!\" Zelda said happily. \"We're out of the rain! Now we can get to Hateno Village! You're a lifesaver, Burlon!\"<br>\r\nBurlon smirked in response. <br>\r\n \"Tell me something I don't know, lass. Now...\"</span></div></div>",

Not saying a thing, Burlon slowly sets Zelda down slowly just as a rustle of bushes and vegation comes three warriors wearing the mask the Yiga, Based on the way they were dressed they are seemingly all male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yiga....they are after you lass. Hm, I honestly didn't think much of it but the rain spell did clue me in.\" Burlon looks at Zelda in the corner of his blue eye as he draws his sword. \"Lida, can you run?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looks down at her body, the generous curves on her possible ten year old body were of her eighteen year old's self. They would slow her down immensely esspecially her breast which even now are casuing her pain as the princess fights to stand stright throwing off the cloak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The most I could probably do currently is probably a light jog....if I push it Burlon.\" Zelda sighs as she realizes she is going to be burden to Burlon.

Sure they look like footsoldiers, the weakest ones. But they even give some warriors a run for their rupees.\" Zelda thinks as she examines Burlon's stance. The thick muscles and the confident hold on the sword speak of skill.....but Zelda can only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Lida, If I look like I am going to lose or die use that steep hill to the right.\" As he says it Zelda looks down the steep slope. \"That leads to a often used trail and is used alot by people these bastards won't attack you there.

Spotting a small rock that was large enough to hide her childish body, she crouched down behind it and watched Burlon's fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he neared the two sickle wielders, the archer loosed two arrows. Without hesitation, Burlon pulled his sword up, slashing one out of the air and deflecting the other with the flat of his blade. As he reached one of the footmen, he slashed his blade across their torso, causing them to crumple instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other jumped back, clearly surprised at Burlon's skill. To be honest, Zelda was as well. She knew of only one other person who was skilled enough and crazy enough to charge down an archer while deflecting arrows. She had always thought him one of a kind. Now, however... She was having second thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Burlon could give Link a run for his money! </i>She thought as Burlon snatched the bow from the archer and snapped it over his knee. <i>The way he moves, the way he holds his sword... A fight between those two would be a glorious, and dangerous, one... I'm not sure I want to see that...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you got?!\" Burlon roared as he kicked the final Yiga back a number of feet. \"I've fought harder Chu's than you!\"<br>\r\nProbably incensed by Burlon's insult, the Yiga launched himself forwards. He held his sickle backwards, a trick she had seen them use countless times. He held it to his left, meaning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burlon!\" Zelda yelled, peeking over the top of the rock. \"It's a trick! Block to the right!\"<br>\r\nBurlon turned slightly, catching Zelda's eye. He nodded before turning back and adjusting his stance slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her prediction, the Yiga slashed to the left. If Zelda hadn't called out the trick, he would've been skewered. Instead, he caught the strike of the edge of his blade. With a victorious grunt, he forced the Yiga back before delivering a powerful slash that caused his opponent to fall backwards into a heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheathing his sword, Burlon nodded before turning around and heading over to Zelda. <br>\r\n\"I won't ask how you knew that, Lida,\" Burlon grunted, \"But thanks. Would've got me otherwise\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright!\" Zelda said brightly. \"I've had experience with this sort of thing in the past!\"<br>\r\nSmiling, Burlon helped her to her feet. Almost immediately, pain flared in her back and ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got you, lass. Here, lean on me...\"<br>\r\nFeeling a hand grip her shoulder, Zelda took a wobbly step forwards. Due to her damaged ankle and wide hips, her pace was slow and clumsy. But it didn't seem to bother Burlon, who nodded gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, lass. Once we get to the next town, we'll let that ankle heal...\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded, allowing Burlon to slowly guide her towards the road...</span></div></div>",

However the crowd is only part of the problem. Her body's current state and people noticing is. Thanks to at least having an  underwear on she does not have to worry about her curves seemingly bouncing. But her hips keep on wanting to walk a certain way, a way currently impossible for her young body leading to an awkward stride.

Only two green Rubuess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sales men pulls out a red vial, It looked to be rather thick and tall with chuncks of some kind of pulp inide it, but Zelda keeps her face to the ground so the man does not see her face and also to sell her tired act. Her adult curves are well hidden underneath her cloak so the princess doubts he has seen them. Without words Zelda moves to pull out some rupees remaining in her cloak but Burlon beats her to the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry and get out of here already.\" Burlon threatens his teeth and jaw tightened together as he tries not to swing his sword at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your services!\" The salesman bows and seemingly ignoring Burlon's threat, cheeringly runs back to the road from whence he came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really have to buy that Lida?\" Burlon holds up the bottle. \"It looks....strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment, Zelda raises her head in order to see what she bought off the salesmen, and it makes her uncomfortable as well. The tall vial contained some kind of red soup based off the thickness, and the things she thought as pulp for juice are ingredients. <i>\"Tomato soup based off the looks of it, that or some kind of Goron kind of art? He did say it was something to wake me up. So I should be able to drink it?\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"I say we get rid of it Lida.\" Burlon raises a hand to throw away the vial however Zelda tugs at his pants in order to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you throw it and that salesman is nearby he will only come back. Just wait till we get to the inn Burlon.\" Zelda pleads as she rather not deal with that salesman again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurlon snorts an agreement as the two walk to the front gates.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they do, a man in gleaming armour marched over to them. Glancing at the badge on his shoulder, Zelda saw three golden stripes etched into his armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Three golden stripes... </i><br>\r\nClosing her eyes, Zelda tried to recall Link's lesson on the different guard ranks. However, as she hadn't been too interested at the time, she hadn't really been paying attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's see... Three stripes shows a... sergeant? So three golden stripes would be a distinguished sergeant? No... A sergeant who did something outstanding? Or was it one who received a special commendation from me? That can't be right, I haven't given any out...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Zelda tried to recall the meaning of the golden stripes, the guard had approached them. <br>\r\n\"Greetings, travellers!\"<br>\r\nThe guard stood to attention, saluting both Burlon and Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, he received silence from the still thinking Zelda and a grunt of acknowledgment from Burlon, who still wore a look of annoyance from his encounter with the salesman. However, this didn't seem to bother the guard, who continued on despite the lack of answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where would you and you daughter be heading to on this fine day, sir?\"<br>\r\nFinally forced to speak, Burlon let out a sigh. <br>\r\n\"Heading to Hateno Village. Hoped to get a place to sleep here overnight. Maybe some extra supplies\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard nodded.<br>\r\n\"Hateno Village, huh? That's a brave walk. But as for supplies and a bed, we've got both. General store isn't that big, but it'll have the essentials. As for a bed, we've got one of them new inns the Princess set up in every town\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing her title, Zelda looked up slightly. <br>\r\n\"The princess?\" She asked curiously. \"Have you met her? What's she like?\"<br>\r\nThe guard chuckled. <br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't seen her... Had some dealings with that knight of hers, but that's about it. As for what I think of her... She's done a damn fine job, considering the state of Hyrule. But hey, that's adult talk. Not stuff I'm willing to discuss with a child. Now, you two run along. And stay out of trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the guard saluted them again before heading off to deal with another couple of travellers. <br>\r\n\"Well, he's a cheery one,\" Burlon grumbled, looking towards the sun. \"Come on. We'll get a room, you can get some rest and let that ankle heal, and I'll gather some information\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I suppose the best place to gather information is at the tavern with a couple of drinks?\" Zelda joked, a slight smile appearing on her face. <br>\r\n\"After the day I've had fighting off Yiga and annoying salesmen, I think I deserve a drink or two,\" Burlon replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHobbling towards the inn, Burlon bought two rooms. After helping Zelda get to her room and get comfortable in bed, he disappeared back downstairs, presumably to start drinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I just hope he doesn't drink too much</i>, Zelda thought as she relaxed in her bed. <i>I need him somewhat sober if Yiga decide to attack us again...</i><br>\r\nAfter a few minutes had passed...</span></div></div>",

She hadn't taken the time last night to have a look around, her main priority being getting into bed and letting her ankle heal naturally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nothing special, however as Zelda stretched again, and her body began to wake up, she became aware that her body had changed again while she slept. Looking down, she began to let out a cheer, before stopping herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer child-sized body had vanished, replaced by her fairly regular looking teenage body. As she threw her covers back, she realised that, while she was more or less back to her regular height, her magic was still interacting with the potion and had messed with various parts of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer adult-sized breasts had shrunk into nothingness, however it seemed their mass had travelled to her backside, hips and thighs, leaving Zelda with a very pear-shaped form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, it's more normal looking that the curvy child I was yesterday</i>, she thought, getting out of bed. <i>Honestly, anything is better than that. The only problem now is clothes... Thank Hylia I decided to take my old ones off before heading to bed!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpying a pack sitting on a chair in the corner, Zelda headed over to her. She made a face as she realised that her hips swayed in quite an erotic fashion in order for her to walk. As well as that, her round backside, which looked like a couple of globes, rippled and bounced with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the pack, she pulled out a long brown dress that hung down to her calves. Pulling it over her head, it did a good job of hiding her hefty lower body, but showed off her completely flat chest in exchange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'd rather my chest be shown off than my lower body</i>, Zelda thought, pulling her boots onto her feet. <i>Now, let's see if Burlon managed to find any information, or if he's slumped over the bar...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to the door, Zelda pulled it open to reveal Burlon, who held his hand in a knocking manner. <br>\r\n\"Burlon!\" Zelda gasped, stumbling back. <br>\r\n\"Morning, Lida,\" Burlon responded somewhat brightly. \"I see you got the stuff I left for you. Hope it fits\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does. Quite well in fact, thank you...\" Zelda flashed him a gracious smile. \"I don't suppose you found anything useful out?\"<br>\r\nA look of darkness passed over Burlon's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did. Although, you might not like it...\"</span></div></div>",

Rummaging around inside, she produced her cloak , which she quickly donned. Shouldering her pack, she headed off, keeping her head low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I feel bad for leaving him behind, but it's probably best I not be there. It would be hard to fight while trying to keep me safe</i>, Zelda thought as she wandered into the main square. <i>Now, let's see....

There's no telling what's waiting out there...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the square, Zelda tried to spot either a guard or a building that resembled a barracks.

Something doesn't seem right about this place...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her reservations, Zelda decided to continue searching. With her current body, she looked like she was Princess Zelda, minus her bust. If she ordered them, they would have to help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the square, Zelda headed down a side street. Compared to the main square, which had vendors opening their stalls for the day and the beginnings of shoppers, this street was near empty. However, down near the end of the street was a building with a large banner over the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The barracks!</i> Zelda let out a sigh of relief. <i>Finally...

You need to help him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Princess....what do you mean?\" The guard's smile turns into a confused frown as Zelda explains, holding back several happenings such as her potion issue and her actually knowing Burlon and saying she sneaked in here with a couple guards, who were currently trying to help the man. She hurried here in order to get help. \" I see....that explains it. Please princess, come into the barracks and take a seat. Forgive me, I need to see to your safety first before the man's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing the look on the striped guard's face, Zelda knows that she has no choice but to get inside and seated before they go help Burlon.

She continued to cough and gasp for breath for a few seconds, inciting a few deep chuckles from the guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" He asked mockingly, leaning down so he was due level with Zelda. \"Having trouble breathing?\"<br>\r\nUnable to speak due to the tube stuffed down her throat, Zelda responded with a dark glare, which didn't faze the guard in the slightest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I almost didn't believe the Yiga when they said you were heading for our little village,\" the guard said, straightening up. \"They told me their rain barrier would be more than enough to stop you in your tracks.

I don't know how you escaped that barrier, but you won't escape me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guard droned on and on, Zelda realised something. <br>\r\n<i>He doesn't know how I escaped...

Let's see what this stuff does to you, your Highness!\"<br>\r\nPowerless to do anything other than watch, Zelda did just that. She watched as he strode over to a lever on the floor, his armour clanking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled it, the tube juddered slightly, causing Zelda to cough again. A familiar looking liquid flowed up the tube and into her mouth, falling directly into her stomach.

It's a gots a bad flavor but the aftertaste is-No wait what am I <u>thinking?!</u> I gotta stay awake till Burlon comes!\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\" You finally noticed.\" Noting Zelda's wide eyes the guard chuckles darkly. \"You see the Yiga gave me something extra bit of something to this stuff from Castle Town'...the more you drink the more addicted you become to whatever is being drink.' Or so they told me...I figured why not alcohol, you royals do like to be slothful after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"UMPG MMMMMM!\"</b> Zelda waves her head slowly back and forth and side to side in an effort to get rid of the pain. The tube makes the movement slightly painful but the alcohol has made her sense of pain a bit dull. The movement of her throat makes the alcohol squeeze out a bit faster and the princess needs to fight in order to not do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry princess Zelda I will stay here the whole time....got to make sure you don't run out of your favorite drink now! Hehe that or pass out!\" The guard chuckles at Zelda's fruitless struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate I don't know what is worse...becoming drunk or...enjoying this drink...but it's so good...I need more! <b>NO I DON\"T!</b>\" Zelda begins to fight the growing desire to drink more and willingly suck down more from the tube. Her eyes become half-lidded as more pours itself into her stomach. Her belly edges out a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His eyes were firmly locked onto Zelda, an amused smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Zelda was watching him, he looked up slightly.<br>\r\n \"So, did I get the right stuff?\" He asked, grinning at her. Zelda nodded in response, before stopping herself. <br>\r\n<i>No, don't answer... that...</i> She thought slowly. <i>I can't let him know that... it's working on me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's good... I was worried that you might be fussy about your choice of drinks. We don't exactly have our choice of drinks out here in the middle of nowhere. Not like that glorious Castle Town of yours!\"<br>\r\nThe guard chuckled as he grabbed another chair, pulling it in front of him and sticking his feet up on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've heard tales of Castle Town,\" he continued. \"The massive tavern, filled with prostitutes and drunk guards. I'm surprised they can still protect that town, considering the amount they drink. Then again, if they lose the town, they lose their alcohol!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well... He isn't... wrong...</i> Zelda thought, her mind moving slower and slower. <i>But... we still have... some decent people...</i><br>\r\nShe thought of Burlon, who, despite his love of drinking, had turned out to be a good guy. He had helped her get this far, despite not even knowing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a look at the door, Zelda's eyes fell shut for a few seconds. She felt her breathing begin to slow...<br>\r\n<i>No... If Burlon can... fight... then so can I!</i><br>\r\nForcing her eyes open, Zelda glared at the guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Still fighting it, are we?\" He tutted. \"I should probably fix that...\"<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh as he got to his feet, he wandered over to Zelda. As he drew level with her, he leaned down and pinched her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Looks like you're taking after your father!\" He grinned. \"If the history books tell the truth, then he was a hefty fellow! Then again, all you royals usually end up quite heavy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappearing from her view, Zelda heard a clunk from behind her. A second later, she felt more and more alcohol rush into her body, causing her blinks to last longer and longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nighty night, Princess!\"<br>\r\nThe guards voice echoed around her head as Zelda finally reached her limit. Her eyes shut, her breathing slowed and she drifted off to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sleep was relatively calm, aside from an odd sensation within her stomach.

Let me find something to clean you up, then we'll move out\".<br>\r\nBurlon disappeared into a side room, leaving Zelda alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leaned back in her seat, she spied a barrel in the corner.

Following the source, he found Zelda with her head stuffed into a barrel. <br>\r\n\"Lass!\"<br>\r\nGrabbing her by the scruff of the neck, he yanked her out of the barrel.

She grabbed the arms of the chair beneath her for support, but she refused to fall back into it, just in case she was trapped in it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is he really just letting me go?</i> Zelda thought, her arms shaking slightly. <i>Considering all he did to me, I thought he would've tried a little harder to keep me captive. I suppose I shouldn't hang around, the guard probably won't leave me alone for too long...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of the chair, Zelda took a wobbly step forwards. She almost fell to her knees, but caught herself at the last moment. <br>\r\n<i>This... might be harder than I initially thought</i>, Zelda admitted, taking another shaky step. <i>But I can do it! Then I'll find Burlon, we'll get to Hateno Village, Purah will fix me and then I'll have Link clean this place out!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at her plan, Zelda took another step. As she did, a familiar scent reached her nose. Without meaning to, her body rotated to the right, meaning she was now facing the wall of barrels the guard had drawn her attention to earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He was joking, wasn't he?</i> Zelda wondered nervously. <i>Although, would it be so bad if he wasn't? All that delicious alcohol... No! I don't need it! Though I suppose taking a look wouldn't hurt...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the wall of barrels, Zelda tripped over her feet and fell up against a barrel, causing it to wobble and shake. Within it, she heard a faint sloshing, which piqued her interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's see here...</i><br>\r\nFlipping the lid open, Zelda eyes widened as she found herself looking down at a sea of murky red liquid. <br>\r\n<i>Yes!</i> Zelda thought, leaning down in preparation to drink. At the last second, however, her hands shot out, grabbing the rim of the barrel and halting her descent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! I drink from this, I'm probably going to end up addicted to this stuff for the rest of my life! It's hard enough rebuilding Hyrule without an addiction to feed!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda glared at her reflection in the barrel, which seemed to invite her closer. Her arms began to shake as her resolve weakened. As her belly let out a gurgle, she finally gave in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlunging her head into the barrel, which sent some of the liquid flying out of the barrel, Zelda drunk deeply. She felt the liquid flow into her belly, where it sat heavily, causing her feeling of nausea to return. She ignored this, however, intent on drinking as much as she possibly could...</span></div></div>",

She didn't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you drank too fast?\" Burlon suggested, shuffling his stool closer to her. \"You should probably take a break for a bit...\"<br>\r\nZelda snatched her tankard up.

She purposely allowed a small bit to escape her mouth, which gave her to excuse to seductively lick her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe...\" Zelda purred, putting her tankard down. \"I'm not drinking fast enough?\"<br>\r\nHer eyes still locked with Burlon's, Zelda practically chucked her drink down her throat.

A tankard was set next to him, which he picked up and took a small sip from. <br>\r\n\"Oh, you dribbled a bit!\" Zelda noticed, spotting a small speck of liquid on his lips. \"Let me get that for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning in, Zelda quickly locked lips with Burlon...</span></div></div>",

This is actually her first time drinking as well. It will possibly be the last time she does drink as well. <br>\r\n\"Okay lass you are good to go, a deals a deal!\" The man laughs as he pats harshly Zelda on the back. This almost makes the older princess lose her lunch. Instead a loud belch and small groan escapes her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go<b>-urp-</b>od\" Is the only thing that Zelda can force herself to say. Gods know that she wants to say a lot more to this disgusting and rude man. But she needs to get moving, even if her body doesn't want to do so. Instead of getting out of the chair, she nearly falls out of it. This causes several patrons to stare in her direction. Her legs feel strange and clumsy and by taking several steps she falls down on her knees. She has to take several big breaths or else she might start to heave. This causes all the patrons to erupt in a loud laugh at her misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>HAH! </b>Seems that woman is a light weight after all!\" The voice of her forced drinking partner yells aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might want attention, look how that strippers dressed underneath!\" A thin black haired woman speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing she has a nice ass underneath that cloak, else this view would be boring!\"<br>\r\nA guard points at her arse. She will make sure to remeber him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and many more comments rein the air; but Zelda is focused on getting out of here despite the humilation. Her stomach continues to groan audibly as she stumbles out the door nearly colliding with one of the posts outside. Her mind feels sharp still even if her body is not as she voices her future threat against the tavern. \"I<i>-urp</i>.....<b>ugh</b>... <i>ah</i>\u2026will make <i>urp</i> <i><b>ssuurp</b></i> that tavern is torn <b><i>urrrrrp</i></b>\u2026<b>ugggh</b>\u2026 down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda puts her hand over her mouth in order quell the increasing nausea. She is forced to rest on a nearby crate in order to gather her bearings. She won't be able to travel like this; if she gets attacked she's done. She'll be burping and groaning herself to her doom. Knowing Castle Town well, Zelda knows that there is an inn not too far from here. She made sure to have one placed first thing. Link has even used in incognito and said it was perfectly safe for her to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes several minutes longer with her groggy body to make her way there but Zelda is happy the groan have stopped. Several people have already been staring at her when they passed, one even tried to give her bread thinking she was hungry or sick! Now though her stomach is cramping due to the foreign liquid sloshing inside her toned stomach. Quickly Zelda, places several green Rupees on the counter causing the clerk, a rough looking man with brown hair, to sneer at her and toss a key her way. With a head shake toward the second floor, Zelda realizes the man thinks she is being rude but her body's needs are primary to being nice at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing the steps, Zelda hates how her hips shift even more to keep her standing as her legs spread out a bit to keep her standing! She hates the way her breasts and ass bounce in her tight clothes with each clumsy step ! Gods, she hates how her toned stomach peeks out of her favorite tunic! But most of all she hates that she is forced into this condition since it wasn\u2019t her fault! With both hands on the wooden rail to steady her ascent to the second floor, the princess sighs with relief as she sees the same number on the door as is on the key not too far from there. A couple moves out her way as they see her come close muttering about her as they pass.<br>\r\n She slams the heavy wooden door behind her and without a care drops on the bed her cloak still on her person, her body thankful for a place to rest as it and her mind begins to think now completely free from trying to control a clumsy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might sound stupid, but what if this alcohol was not in fact alcohol? It was a different color after all.\" Zelda thinks then snorts aloud. \"Yeah right, that ugly drunk was not smart enough to make a potion or anything like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that funny thought, Zelda drifts off to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None of the guards in front of entrance question her despite the cloak she is wearing belongs to \"herself\". Perhaps they figured that the Princess is going out in disguise?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I must say, Mipha, Zora culture is much more diverse than I originally thought\".<br>\r\nPrincess Zelda and Lady Mipha were walking through the centre of Zora's Domain, Link trailing behind them. Wherever Zelda went, her chosen knight wouldn't be too far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me if I offend, Princess, but Hylians have never really understood us,\" Mipha said in her quiet voice. \"They believe us to be less evolved versions of the Rito, which may be true. However, the Zora are a proud race, with a history dating back to the Hero of Time himself. So, that theory, while it may convince some people, it isn't the truth\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is the truth then?\" Zelda asked, curious. Like many people, she had believed that the Rito had evolved from the Zora when a massive flood had covered Hyrule. However, no evidence had ever proved if the Rito and Zora were connected in any way, and the two races never really spoke about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth?\" Mipha giggled. \"My apologies, Princess. But even we don't know!\"<br>\r\n\"You don't?\" Zelda asked, her heart dropping. She had been looking forward to hearing the truth. <br>\r\n\"Unfortunately not. And neither do the Rito, so Revali won't be able to help you either. If it helps, early records state that we evolved from washed up fish that the Goddess Nayru took pity on. However, the reliability of our early records is... not so good. Another record from that time states that the Master Sword was wielded by a Zora\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Zora? Wielding the Master Sword? I don't mean to offend, but the Master Sword can only-\"<br>\r\n\"Be wielded by the Hylian who possesses the spirit of the Hero\". Mipha smiled as she finished Zelda's explanation. \"I know, Princess. Like I said, the reliability of early documents wasn't the best\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may ask another question, Mipha...\" Zelda asked, stopping to peer over a railing at some Zoras swimming down below. She smiled as a couple waved up at her. <br>\r\n\"The Zoras eat fish, correct? Yet, as you just explained, Zora may or may not be descended from fish\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipha let out a quiet laugh. <br>\r\n\"Yes, I did say that. The reason we eat fish dates back to the Era of the Hero of Time, when the Zora race still had its guardian deity,\" Mipha explained, joining Zelda at the railing. <br>\r\n\"You mean Lord Jabu-Jabu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Mipha continued. <br>\r\n\"Yes. Lord Jabu-Jabu's favourite meal was actually fish, despite being a large one himself. After he disappeared from his lake, we grieved for his loss by eating a feast in his memory. That feast consisted mainly of fish, in remembrance of his favourite food\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And it is a tradition that continues to this day, I presume?\" Zelda asked, her eye drawn to a glint of light reflecting off the Master Sword's blade. Both Mipha and Zelda watched as Link showed a group of young Zoras the Blade of Evil's Bane. Mipha smiled at the \"Ooo's\" and \"Ahh's\" Link received. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was always believed that the Zora Princess was the only one who could prepare a meal that he would enjoy,\" Mipha said after a moment of silence. \"As the one who fed Lord Jabu-Jabu was Princess Ruto, the secret to his meals was passed down through Zora Royalty\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you could prepare something like it?\" Zelda asked. <br>\r\n\"I suppose I could. I've never really tried. After all, I was raised a Princess. Meals were mostly cooked for me, not by me\".<br>\r\nThinking, Zelda finally spoke up. <br>\r\n\"Well then, let's try it!\"<br>\r\nMipha looked at her, confusion on her face. She had never seen Zelda this excited, especially these days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you sure? Like I said, I've never really cooked anything...\" She trailed off. <br>\r\n\"I'm sure that between the three of us, we can work something out!\" Zelda said excitedly. <br>\r\n\"Well, okay... I guess I could try. But first, we need to deliver that report to my father,\" Mipha reminded Zelda, who nodded. <br>\r\n\"Of course. We should head there now\".<br>\r\nAs the pair headed off, Link didn't notice them, too busy being mobbed by children wanting to look at the Master Sword. It wasn't until Zelda came back and grabbed him by the arm that he escaped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter delivering their report on the Divine Beast, Zelda, Mipha and Link headed up to the reservoir, where they had been camping. <br>\r\n\"Right. Here's how it's going to go,\" Zelda said firmly, quickly taking charge. \"Link, you can start on a fire. Mipha, you and I will look for fish\".<br>\r\nLink nodded, pulling a bundle of wood out of his magic pouch. Zelda had asked on multiple occasions how he managed to fit extra clothes, spare weapons, food, materials and camping gear in there, but he could never give a proper answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about these ones?\" Zelda asked, pointing to a group of blue fish. <br>\r\n\"Armoured Carp... No, I think Hyrule Bass would do just fine. Unless you're planning on heading into battle?\" Mipha asked, smiling. <br>\r\n\"No, of course not!\" Zelda replied, shaking her head. \"Okay, so... Hyrule Bass look like this?\"<br>\r\nShe showed Mipha a picture of a green fish on her Sheikah Slate. She nodded. <br>\r\n\"Pictures are all well and good, but nothing beats the real thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout breaking eye contact with Zelda, Mipha stabbed her spear into the water and pulled it out, a green fish skewered on the end. She smiled, plucking the wriggling fish off her spear and handing it to Zelda, who held it gingerly, a look of disgust on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipha payed her no attention, instead focusing it on her technique. Her spear was a flash of silver, darting in and out of the water with exceptional speed. The fish held in Zelda's hand began to pile up, until she was groaning under the amount Mipha had just caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that should do!\" Mipha said, pleased with her catch. \"Normally, they are much harder to catch!\"<br>\r\nShe turned to Zelda, who was struggling to hold them all. <br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry! I caught too many, didn't I?\" Mipha realised, grabbing some of the still wriggling ones and throwing them back into the reservoir. <br>\r\n\"T-Thank you!\" Zelda gasped, now holding a reasonable amount of fish. \"Now, shall we return to camp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached their camp, Zelda sighed. She had just seen Link...<br>\r\n\"Oh, have you already eaten?\" Mipha asked, disappointment in her voice. She had been looking forward to cooking for Link, one of the reasons she had agreed to in the first place. <br>\r\nLink shrugged, an apologetic look on his face. <br>\r\n\"Argh!\" Zelda stamped her foot angrily. \"Mipha was all ready to prepare this nice meal, and you couldn't wait!\"<br>\r\nLink looked away. He never really spoke, not unless you really prompted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Princess. I can cook for the two of us,\" Mipha said, laying a hand on Zelda's shoulder. She instantly perked up. <br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mipha,\" she said, bowing her head in thanks. \"I simply cannot wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda watched Mipha go through the steps of preparing their dinner. She looked on with interest as she took the bones out of the fish, before cutting it into pieces and sprinkling on a little salt. <br>\r\n\"We give thanks to Lord Jabu-Jabu for this meal,\" she said quietly, before closing her eyes and concentrating. <br>\r\n\"A silent prayer,\" she said to Zelda before handing her a silver plate, a number of pieces of fish piled high on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, that was delicious!\"<br>\r\nZelda leaned back against the rock she had chosen to act as a chair. Mipha sat opposite her, a pleased expression on her face. <br>\r\n\"Thank you, Princess. It's kind of you to say,\" Mipha thanked her. Behind her, Link was practicing with the Master Sword, which drew both of their attentions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he's ready?\" Mipha asked, hearing the blade cut through the air. <br>\r\n\"Are any of us truly ready?\" Zelda asked, worry in her voice. <br>\r\n\"You needn't worry. With all of us working together, we'll do brilliant!\" Mipha reassured her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Zelda fell silent. Everybody was ready... Everybody except her. She couldn't awaken her power, which was critical to the plan. Sure, Link was good with the Master Sword, but unless she could seal Ganon away, he would be battling for a very long time. And even he had his limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must return to the Domain,\" Mipha said, bringing Zelda out of her thoughts. \"Remember that Lynel up there\". She pointed towards the mountain behind them. <br>\r\n\"Yes, of course. Be safe, Mipha\".<br>\r\nAs she watched Mipha go, Zelda placed her hands on her belly. She briefly thought that it felt somewhat softer, but dismissed the notion. She had just had a large dinner, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stay up too late, please,\" she told Link, who nodded. He normally went to bed after her and woke before her. She used to believe that he never actually slept until she was woken during a storm, which Link had slept right through. <br>\r\nAs she lay down on her sleeping bag, Zelda shifted. Her backside felt a little odd, as did her breasts...<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" she said, drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Zelda slept, Link was wide awake. Despite her earlier order, he was busy keeping watch. He had one eye trained on the sky, and the other on a nearby ramp. The Lynel that Mipha had warned them about lived up that ramp, and while it didn't normally come down the ramp, Link didn't want to be held responsible for Zelda's death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder rumbled above them, causing Link to sigh. While the approaching storm wouldn't bother him, it would definitely bother...<br>\r\n\"What-What?!\" Zelda yelped, instantly sitting upright and looking around.<br>\r\n\"What's going on?! Are we being attacked?!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nClapping eyes on Link, Zelda breathed out. He looked relaxed enough, so they weren't under attack. That was good. <br>\r\n\"I swore I heard thunder... Or was it a dream?\" Zelda wondered, looking around. Her surroundings were dark, their only source of light being the campfire from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder rumbled again, causing Zelda to let out a yelp and pull her sleeping bag tightly around her. She looked at Link, who was busy looking at something in the distance. <br>\r\nFollowing his gaze, she saw rain clouds coming towards them, along with the occasional flash of lightning. She flinched as a bolt struck the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't stay here,\" she said, looking at Link, who nodded. \"The Master Sword is made of metal, which will attract that lightning. We should head back to the Domain, and stay there for the night\".<br>\r\nLink nodded again, getting to his feet and pulling his hood up. He ushered Zelda out of her sleeping bag before beginning to pack everything into his pouch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter packing up their camp, Zelda pulled her own hood up. While Link wasn't looking, she adjusted her blue top, which felt quite tight around her breasts, and her pants, which also felt a little tighter. <br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" She asked, looking at Link. He nodded and set off ahead of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few steps down the path, the pair ran into a Lizalfos, making Zelda thankful that he had gone first. Occasionally, she would rush ahead of him, which irritated Link immensely, especially when she ran into an enemy and he'd have to cone rescue her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink drew the Master Sword, moon light reflecting off its blade. The Lizalfos slashed at Link with its own crude weapon. Link easily parried it and hit back with his own slash. Unable to dodge, the Lizalfos fell back before bursting into smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you,\" she said to Link. Even since he had saved her from the Yiga Clan, he kept a very close eye on her at all times. Even when she needed to go to the bathroom, she could tell that he was near. Not looking at her or anything weird, but definitely near. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded. He gripped the Master Sword tighter when a roar echoed from the mountain next to them. <br>\r\n\"The Lynel... We should hurry!\" Zelda said worriedly. Link pointed down the path, where a couple of Zora were waiting. Zelda ran to them, Link following when he was sure that she had reached them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda ran into the centre of Zora's Domain, water dripping off her hood. They weren't able to outrun the storm, something Zelda had voiced her displeasure about. <br>\r\n\"I hate the rain!\" She complained, shaking her head and covering Link with water. He pulled his own hood down and hung it over a chair while Zelda looked around. They had ended up in the inn, which was more a coincidence than anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like two beds please. One normal, and one water,\" Zelda asked the owner. <br>\r\nHe bowed. <br>\r\n\"Of course, your Highness. They are on the house, of course. Lady Mipha had a feeling that a storm might hit tonight, and reserved two beds. You will, however, have to pay extra for the water bed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly!\" She looked at Link expectantly. Link sighed and reached into his pouch, lifting two shining red rupees and handing them to the owner. <br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Zelda said to both the owner and Link. She jumped when lightning hit the ground outside. <br>\r\n\"I hate lightning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Zelda awoke to see Mipha standing at the foot of her bed. As she sat up, the bed sloshed underneath her. <br>\r\n\"Lady Mipha. I wasn't expecting to see you so soon. I must thank you for reserving these beds for us,\" Zelda said, gesturing to her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not an issue, Princess. I took the liberty of preparing breakfast for you. After last night, I find cooking... relaxing,\" Mipha said, pointing to a plate on the table behind her. One plate was empty, indicating that Link was up. <br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Zelda smiled at Mipha, before getting out of bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda took a seat at the table. It wasn't the kind of breakfast she was used to, having been raised on eggs and meat, but she still devoured it. <br>\r\n\"Ahhh... You really are an outstanding cook!\" Zelda complimented, rubbing her belly. <br>\r\nMipha blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too kind, Princess. Anyway, I hate to tell you this, but the storm caused a landslide on the path to the Domain. I'm afraid you'll be stuck here for a while,\" Mipha explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nodded. <br>\r\n\"I'll need to inform Daruk. We were meant to inspect Vah Rudania later today,\" Zelda mused, tapping her chin. She didn't notice how it felt softer, her jawline less defined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send a Zora up one of the waterfalls. They won't be able to head up to Goron City, but they should be able to get the message to a Goron\".<br>\r\nZelda nodded. She blushed when her stomach let out a quiet gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry?\" Mipha giggled. <br>\r\n\"I-I... Guess so,\" Zelda stuttered, embarrassed by her stomach. <br>\r\n\"There's still some food left up near the throne room. You're welcome to have it,\" Mipha offered. \"Then again, I have heard that your knight is no slouch when it comes to cooking\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\nZelda was surprised to hear that. She had no idea that Link could cook...<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll be here for a while. Feel free to tour the city,\" Mipha said, leaving Zelda alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter adjusting her top, which had grown tighter around her bust, Zelda headed out into the Domain. She was still feeling hungry, and the news that Link was an accomplished chef had intrigued her. She always liked trying new things. Or, she could just stick with Mipha's cooking. She knew for a fact that it was good, but then again...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda argued internally before finally, she decided upon trying Link's cooking. She travelled with him all the time, and while he wasn't the chattiest person to travel with, his presence around the campfire at night comforted her. If he could actually cook a proper meal, then she could add that to the list of things he was good at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the inn, Zelda looked around for Link. Usually, he didn't go too far, but on this occasion, he was nowhere to be seen. It wasn't until she heard a number of cries from the courtyard did she find him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Link! There you are!\" Zelda said, relief in her voice. He was surrounded by the same group of young Zoras from yesterday, all of which were asking him to show off the Master Sword again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing them all talk, Zelda pouted. Apparently, her voice had been drowned out by the mass of smaller Zora. Either that, or Link had ignored her. And if he had, then he was in HUGE trouble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew nearer to the mob, Link looked up and made eye contact with Zelda. For the first time, Zelda saw worry in his eyes. She gave him a reassuring smile before pointing at the Master Sword and miming a couple of swings. Link nodded, the worry in his eyes melting away. Swinging a sword about? He could definitely do that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsheathing the blade, Link gestured for the group to step back before giving it a couple of practice swings. Even swinging it caused the Zora's to clap and chatter excitedly. He smiled before placing the blade on his shoulder. He closed his eyes, and let out a long breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda watched him with interest. She had never seen him this focused before. She was used to him swinging it about, or cleaning the blade or whatever. Placing it on his shoulder and concentrating was something she had never seen him do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link's eyes opened, he swung the sword horizontally. A bright beam of light shot out of the blade, startling the crowd of Zoras and causing Zelda to clap her hands together. The beam flew past them, colliding with a wall in a bright flash of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's never done that before!\" She said, a hint of excitement in her voice. \"Maybe the spirit is beginning to trust him?\"<br>\r\nSmiling as he was mobbed again, Zelda left the group. She took a seat at a nearby bench, smiling at Link again when he looked at her with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the crowd dispersed to go swimming. A couple of them voiced their disappointment that Link couldn't join them, but made no protest when Zelda approached them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Link. A rather interesting rumour has reached my ears. It seems that you are an experienced chef?\" Zelda asked, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\nLink hesitated before nodding. He did have experience cooking, but it was his own unique style. It was meant to fill you up during a battle and, as such, was filled with all sorts of nutrients. <br>\r\nAnd as he was more active than anybody else in Hyrule, he could make it with any ingredients he wanted, including the juiciest, most fattening stuff he could get his hands on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like you to prepare a meal for me,\" Zelda said to him. He considered denying her request, but stopped himself. The last time he had stopped Zelda from doing something, she had almost gotten him arrested. Man, he hated Gerudo Town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Link to a cooking pot just inside the entrance to the inn, Zelda sat next to the fire and warmed her hands. She watched as Link pulled out a juicy slab of meat from his pouch, her mouth almost watering...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught herself, just in time to see Link produced a green herb and some sort of radish. Before he threw them into the pot, she stopped him, producing the Sheikah Slate. <br>\r\n\"Just in case you need to find more,\" She told him, taking a picture of each ingredient. \"A Hyrule Herb... and a Hearty Radish! Thank you!\"<br>\r\nAfter Zelda had holstered the Slate, he threw them into the pot and sat back, watching the ingredients simmer and bounce in the pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing, Zelda was amazed at how good it smelt. It was the perfect blend of smells, all combining together to create a beautiful aroma that made her stomach rumble. She leaned in, taking a large sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she quickly jumped back as the ingredients disappeared in a cloud of smoke. <br>\r\n\"You burnt it!\" She complained, looking at Link, who ignored her. He plunged his hands into the smoke and pulled out something that caused Zelda's eyes to widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gourmet Meat smelt divine. The Herb had been sprinkled atop it, while the Radish had been cut apart and lay around the meat. <br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" She asked, amazed at the presentation. She hadn't even seen him cut it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shrugged. He just kind of threw ingredients into a pot, gave it a few seconds and a meal came out. He had never really thought about how it worked, and probably never would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding a plate to Zelda, he quickly left the Inn. He didn't really want to be around when she found out why he had never cooked for her before. <br>\r\nIt was likely that Zelda would slice him apart with his own sword if she found out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda didn't know where he was going, nor did she particularly care after she took a bite of the meat. She moaned as it practically fell apart in her mouth. <br>\r\n\"So good... Mipha wasn't lying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda dug into her meal with gusto, not noticing her body slowly growing. Her soft belly bulged outwards, pushing against her blue tunic. Her breasts, reasonably sized for her age, grew tighter within her bra. Her backside, which had been commented on by people thinking she wasn't listening when she actually was, became thicker, causing her pants to tighten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh... Delicious!\"<br>\r\nZelda leaned back and let out a quiet burp. She rubbed her belly, not noticing how soft it was now. Standing up, she wobbled slightly. <br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Odd. Must just be light-headed\".<br>\r\nAs she headed outside, she didn't notice her thighs brushing against each other, nor her jiggling backside. Spying Link looking over a railing, she headed up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an excellent meal, Link. Thank you very much!\" She said, bowing her head to convey her thanks. Link merely nodded. He had noticed Zelda's thicker body, her bigger breasts, her wider hips...<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\nHe stopped staring at her and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. Seeing as we are stuck here until that landslide is cleared, I suppose I could have a look around. After all, we don't stay in these places for very long. I would like you to remain here. No harm should come to me in a major city!\" Zelda said, walking off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exploring most of the Domain, Zelda took a seat outside the Throne Room. She was breathing heavily, for reasons she couldn't understand. <br>\r\n\"Must be... something in the air,\" she said, taking a deep breath. Relaxing on her bench, Zelda looked around. Down in the centre of the city, she saw Mipha and Link talking, much to her annoyance. Off to the right, she saw an elderly Zora teaching a bunch of younger ones. And off to the left, she saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking to her left, Zelda saw Ploymus Mountain towering in the distance. She had heard tales of a Lynel, a creature with the body of a horse, the torso of a human and the head of a lion, that lived there. They were ferocious creatures, the only ones in Hyrule that Link wouldn't willingly fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered the time Link and her had encountered one when they had gotten lost in the Hebra Mountains. Link had drawn the Master Sword, determined to defend her at any cost. However, one shock arrow had caused him to drop it, prompting Zelda to order a retreat. They had only taken a couple of steps before the Lynel had charged them, knocking Zelda down a hill. Link had tried to follow her, but the Lynel stopped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her fall, a couple of travellers had found her and took her to a nearby stable, but as for Link, he didn't return for a number of days. She remembered her grief at his loss, and her relief when he had staggered over a hill, sunlight reflecting off the blade of the Master Sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, look out!\"<br>\r\nA shout from a Zora Guard drew her back to reality. She looked around, seeing the guard that had shouted at her pointing to the sky above her. She followed his finger. Initially, she saw nothing. Then she heard a crackling noise, the same made by shock arrows...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pushed from the bench, landing heavily on the ground and causing her to let out a yelp. Her breasts bounced, and her new belly jiggled. She looked up at the guard that had pushed her to the ground. She opened her mouth to warn him about the approaching arrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't fast enough. The arrow embedded itself in the guards back, causing him to yell with pain and collapse next to her. She scrambled to her knees and tried to pull the arrow out, remembering that the Zoras really didn't like electricity of any sort. She let out her own yell as the arrow shocked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a hand grab her shoulder and guide her away from the guard, Zelda struggled against the grip. She only stopped when she was spun around, revealing Link with a serious expression on his face. <br>\r\n\"Link!\" She gasped. \"What's happening?!\"<br>\r\n\"Princess, we must get you out of here,\" a quiet voice answered from behind Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipha walked out of what looked like an armoury, a silver spear in her hands. \"The Lynel that lives on Ploymus Mountain is attacking the Domain\".<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Zelda asked. She had done a little research into Lynels, and knew that they normally kept their distance from populated areas. <br>\r\n\"He knows he has an advantage over us with his shock arrows. Even touching one would render a Zora unable to attack,\" Mipha explained. \"Link, take her to my room. Then meet me by the eastern gate\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded, grabbing Zelda's hand. She yanked it free from his grasp. <br>\r\n\"I can find my own way there, thank you very much!\" She said, irritated. She calmed herself before continuing. \"You deal with the Lynel\".<br>\r\nLink nodded again. He looked at Mipha before the pair ran off, leaving Zelda alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly considered running after them, but reconsidered. She had no weapons, nor any training with weapons. Sure, she had the Sheikah Slate with bombs and stasis, but Link had scolded her when she had tried to help him with bombs. Thankfully, his burn wasn't too severe and healed quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to do what Link and Mipha had told her, she ran towards the throne room. She stopped halfway up a set of stairs when she heard a roar in the distance. Looking to the east, she let out a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the Lynel swing his massive sword. A blue figure backflipped away before jumping forward and bringing its sword down hard, causing the Lynel to stagger backwards. A red figure then jumped over him, stabbing with their spear and forcing the Lynel backwards even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Zelda!\"<br>\r\nLooking around Zelda saw the elderly Zora that was teaching earlier staring at her. <br>\r\n\"Princess, it is much too dangerous out here for you!\" He told her urgently. A shock arrow hit the ground behind her, causing them both to jump. <br>\r\n\"I realise that, but...\" <br>\r\nZelda trailed off. She wanted to help, but had no means to do so. <br>\r\n\"Very well. Mipha has allowed me to remain in her room. Where about is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Follow me,\" the Zora said, walking off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on Mipha's bed, which sloshed and rippled beneath her, Zelda looked around. Mipha had a nice room, with a view over the Domain. On her dresser sat a tattered blue cloth, similar to the one she had made for Mipha and the rest of the Champions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside it was a picture of Mipha and Link when they were younger. Link wore a goofy grin on his face, and had a large cut down his arm. Mipha, on the other hand, had a subdued smile and worry in her eyes. She hated when Link hurt himself, but was always happy to heal any injuries he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sighed. Every so often, she heard a distant roar, indicating that Link and Mipha were still battling the Lynel. She felt so useless, just sitting here and doing nothing. <br>\r\n\"Princess?\"<br>\r\nA knock at the door, followed by some voices, caused her to jump to her feet. <br>\r\n\"Yes? Who is it?\" She asked, opening the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of small Zoras carrying trays looked at her. <br>\r\n\"We thought you might get hungry, so we brought you some food!\" One of them said brightly, handing Zelda a tray. <br>\r\n\"This one's for Link, for helping Princess Mipha fight the scary Lynel,\" A second one said, handing a second tray to her. <br>\r\n\"Thank you. I'll make sure he gets it,\" Zelda said, bowing to show her thanks. She took the trays and set them on the bed, sitting next to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat, her stomach let out a grumble. <br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it is about lunchtime,\" Zelda said, taking the lid off her assigned tray, revealing a pile of Roasted Bass. She gently poked one, smiling as she felt how hot they were. <br>\r\n\"Freshly cooked Bass... I must say, the Zora style of cooking is rather nice, if simple\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking one up, Zelda dug in, quickly devouring it. She smiled again, licking her lips. Zelda then worked her way through the rest of her meal, eating the next fish faster than the last, until she stuffed the last one in her mouth, chewing madly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRP... Oh, excuse me!\" Zelda said, embarrassed. She lay back on the bed, listening to the water slosh beneath her. Putting her hands on her belly, Zelda still didn't notice that it was much softer, her tunic tight around it. It formed a noticeable bump against it. Her bra was just as tight, her breast flesh starting to overflow the cups. Her pants were tight as well, the fabric slipping in between Zelda's much rounder ass cheeks. Her face was softer, a second chin starting to form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising a chubby arm to her face, she brushed a strand of hair out of her vision. Her fingers were plumper, her hands no longer dainty. Her thighs rubbed against each other as she sat up, her belly splitting into two small rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't heard anything in awhile... Is it over?\" Zelda wondered. The silence in the room was broken by another rumble from her stomach, which caused her to sigh. <br>\r\n\"I just ate!\" She said to herself. \"I can't seriously be hungry again!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Link, behind you!\"<br>\r\nZelda pointed at a small red creature trying to sneak up on Link. Hearing her warning, Link hit the Bokoblin in front of him with his shield and spun around, slashing the sneaking one with the Master Sword. It crumpled into a heap, disappearing in a puff of purple smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he turned back around, he was met with a lot more than the single Bokoblin he had smacked with his shield. Even Zelda was surprised, and disappointed in herself. She was supposed to be keeping an eye out, and she had missed this small horde of enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Link!\" She called out. <br>\r\nLink didn't answer, instead extending his sword out behind him. It glowed twice before he spun it in a circle. Lightning crashed around him, striking the army of Bokoblins and causing them all to fall to the ground, stunned. He slowly walked through the broken army, slashing at the various fallen enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a distance, Zelda relaxed. She dusted off her blue tunic and fixed her golden hair, even though she had been involved in the fighting. <br>\r\nHer job, for the moment anyway, was done. After the fall of Calamity Ganon, most monsters had retreated from the world, hunted by the few Guardians that the Sheikah had managed to repair and also by Link and herself. While she wasn't a fighter, she was very good at-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get to finish her thoughts. Another small horde appeared from behind a hill, rushing towards Link. Before she could call out to him, she felt something hard collide with the back of her head. She fell forwards onto her hands and knees, before collapsing into darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where...\"<br>\r\nZelda let put a groan as she looked around her room. It was dimly lit, and completely empty, except for her and the chair she was sitting on. She was tied down, and no matter how much she struggled, her bonds wouldn't break. <br>\r\n\"Come... On!\" She grunted, trying to wiggle her arms out of her restraints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly stopped when the metal door on front of her opened, revealing a golden Bokoblin. It grinned at her, revealing its dirty, misshapen teeth. She looked away in disgust, which irritated the creature. It chartered angrily, banging its wooden club on the floor until Zelda glared at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" She ordered. \"And let me go!\"<br>\r\nThe Bokoblin cocked its head. It clearly didn't understand her, and she definitely didn't understand it. <br>\r\nBefore she could continue, the Bokoblin wandered towards her. What she hadn't seen in its other hand was a cracked bottle full of a dirty looking liquid. As the golden creature unstoppered the bottle, she quickly caught onto its intentions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" She protested, turning her head. \"You keep that stuff away from me!\"<br>\r\nThe Bokoblin ignored her protests, grabbing her head roughly and forcing her mouth open. It poured the liquid into her mouth. Zelda gagged as she was forced to swallow the disgusting drink, almost throwing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, the drink was beginning to change her...</span></div></div>",

Her slim belly pushed outwards, pushing her tunic up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUggh! Absolutely revolting!\u201d Zelda groaned out loud, unaware what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon followed were her breasts, filling out to a bigger bust size on her smaller body, tightening the top half of her top. And then lastly her ass and hips filled out, tightening her trousers and causing small ripped holes to appear. Her once elegant body had become monstrous and she was also beginning to develop the same stench that came from the very same Bokoblin that was with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her changes weren\u2019t done just yet, her pale skin began to darken.

The drink had transformed the princess of Hyrule into a female Bokoblin.

Zelda, not sure what the vile creature was up too, stepped up close to the bucket and gasped at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the reflective water (most likely the only clean substance around here), she watched with a mix of shock and intrigue.

She then tried to distract herself by thinking some positive outlooks from this. What was used to change into this?

My knight will be more than able to take care of your Chu problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled at the wizened Rito standing before her. Behind her, Link was leaning against the wooden frame that made up the doorway to the hit they were in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thank you, Princess Zelda!\" The Rito bowed low, his grey feathers waving in the breeze. \"And you as well, Sir Link. I am sure that with your assistance, the attacks on the village will soon cease to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any information you can give that can help us with our task?\" Zelda asked. <br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, we know very little. They always seem to come from the hills to the west of the stables. However, when we sent scouts, they had little to report back,\" the Rito explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hills... Perhaps a network of caves?\" Zelda mused, her head bowed in thought. \"If so, Link would be fighting in a confined area... Not the best arena to fight in...\"<br>\r\nZelda looked up from her thoughts, smiling at the old Rito. <br>\r\n\"Thank you for telling us this! We'll get right on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarching out of the hut, Link and Zelda started the long trip down the pillar that supported Rito Village. <br>\r\n\"I know what you want to say, Link,\" Zelda started. \"I shouldn't be helping with these requests. I know what my father says. But I can't stand idly by when the people of Hyrule need my assistance! It's my duty as the Princess of Hyrule to help the people with their problems, be that monsters or inspecting the Divine Beasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink remained silent. He agreed with Zelda, of course, but in recent days, she had become less and less focused on figuring out how her powers worked, and more and more enamoured with the people. Just the other day, she had taken a request from a Rito to cook her some sort of fish dish! At least this one involved fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked in silence until they reached the stable. <br>\r\n\"So!\"<br>\r\nZelda spun to face Link. <br>\r\n\"We'll inspect the hills to the west! If you find a cave system, make sure you call me over before you charge in, okay? No playing the hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink snorted. She was more likely to be the reckless heroine than he was. She would charge into caves filled with who knows what, only to come sprinting back out, a horde of monsters following her, screaming for Link to save her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the pair set off into the hills. For the most part, Zelda remained in close proximity to Link, with only a few occasions when she would disappear over the crest of a nearby hill. Thankfully, she didn't reappear with some monster chasing her, so Link was content to just let her roam about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, until they walked into a valley...<br>\r\n\"LINK!\"<br>\r\nLink's eyes widened. A hand drew the Master Sword and held it ready. He looked around for the source of Zelda's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!\"<br>\r\nAnother call, fainter this time. It echoed off the valley walls, making it difficult for him to pinpoint her location. He sprinted deeper into the valley, hoping to run into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link...\"<br>\r\nHer voice was barely audible now. Link stopped, looking around wildly. He had no idea where she had disappeared off to! For all he knew, she wasn't even in the valley anymore! She could be up above, in a cave somewhere... Why hadn't he just kept an eye on her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence soon fell. Link stabbed the Master Sword into the ground and growled. He needed to find Zelda, preferably before the King decided to send one of his scouts to look for them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Elsewhere-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!\"<br>\r\nZelda yelled for her knight again, but got no response. She let out a worried whimper and looked at the opening above her. If only she had been watching where she had been going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait here...\"<br>\r\nLooking around the small hole she had trapped herself in, the only plausible route was a narrow opening in the wall. Walking up to it, Zelda peered into the darkness before trying to move through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come... On!\" She grunted, trying to force her way through. Her ample breasts and soft backside prevented her from moving through, so she quickly gave up and collapsed against the wall. She pulled her knees up to her chest and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed. Zelda had taken to entertaining herself with a spherical rock that she was rolling back and forth when a quiet sound caused her ears to perk up. <br>\r\n\"Link?\" She wondered hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes scanned the hole, before zeroing in on the gap opposite her. The sound seemed to be coming from there...<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" She called out, pushing her rock aside and crawling towards the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squelch answered her. Zelda peered curiously into the darkness...<br>\r\n\"Eep!\"<br>\r\nSomething blue shot out at her. Zelda barely had time to react, only having enough to let out a cry of surprise. The blue... thing... took advantage of her open mouth, and quickly forced its way in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's eyes widened as the thing began to fill her mouth, puffing her cheeks out. Her hands twitched for a few moments before grabbing it. As they made contact with the goopy blob, they immediately got stuck. A few seconds later, the goo began to envelope her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>W-What is this?</i> Zelda thought, desperately trying to free her hands. <br>\r\nA white eye appeared on the blob, its gaze locked into her. <br>\r\n<i>A Chu?! What's it doing to me?!</i></span></div></div>",

Her cheeks were pushed out to their limits, filled with the thick blue jelly of the Chu. It rolled over her tongue, leaving an oddly sweet taste in its wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock had initially overwhelmed her, causing Zelda's body to freeze up. After a few seconds, it began to slowly subside, allowing Zelda to begin coming up with some sort of plan to escape the sticky clutches of her captor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay... If I try to free my hands, then this should go a lot easier!</i><br>\r\nZelda have her hands an experimental tug. At this point, however, the Chu had completely enveloped them, and was now slowly inching its way up her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not my hands then... Um... What if I attempt to spit it out?</i><br>\r\nBeing a respectable Princess, Zelda had never been one for spitting. The guards around her had been no strangers to it, and the first time she had tried, they had all stifled laughter. Then the King had walked in, and boy had she gotten in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she prepared to spit out the Chu, Zelda felt the jelly inside her mouth shift worryingly. Her eyes widened as it began to flood down her throat, cutting off her air supply for a few seconds. She felt it begin to settle heavily in her stomach, making her feel... odd? Bloated? She couldn't settle on one feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chu flowed freely down her throat, Zelda powerless to stop it. More and more jelly fell into her stomach, and it didn't take long for her to feel incredibly full. The Chu didn't stop there, seemingly intent on forcing its entire being into her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother muffled groan escaped Zelda's mouth as she felt her trademark blue tunic tighten. She looked downwards with worried eyes. The worry quickly turned to shock as she saw her belly protruding outwards in a noticeable bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chu forced a surge of jelly down her throat, which caused her belly to visible push outwards. Her tunic began to ride upwards, revealing the bottom of her swelling stomach. It made Zelda appear as though she was in the early stages of pregnancy, which disgusted her. If it were a normal child, she'd be somewhat fine with the whole situation. But with this Chu...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly surged outwards. Zelda was powerless to do anything other than watch as the Chu slowly disappeared into her belly. With a repulsive squelch, the last of the blue blob vanished into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda collapsed onto her backside, her sticky hands falling to her side. Her mouth hung agape for a minute, her mind still processing what had just happened to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squirm from within her stomach finally kicked Zelda back into action. She slowly moved her shaking hands to her gravid orb of a belly. As soon as she made contact, its inhabitant writhed within, reacting to her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was firm and round, making her appear in the later stages of pregnancy. She gasped and groaned as her occupant squirmed within her, making her feel highly uncomfortable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... What's going to happen to me?!\"</span></div></div>",

Zelda whimpered as her belly surged outwards. <br>\r\n<i>Please, no more</i>, she thought. <i>I already feel so full...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, that surge seemed to be temporary, her belly quickly shrinking back down to its chu-filled size. Zelda let out a small sigh of relief, her hands travelling back to her stomach. She began to gently rub it again, the movement of her hands helping to calm the movement within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Zelda heard her stomach gurgle again. Looking down, she noted with surprise that her gravid orb of a belly was slowly shrinking with each gurgle her belly made. After a couple, it had shrunk down to about half of its former size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank Hylia!</i> Zelda thought happily as her stomach emitted another gurgle, her belly shrinking down to a barely noticeable potbelly. However, her happiness was short-lived as her belly emitted a final gurgle, shrinking back into her old flat belly. A few seconds later, an uncomfortable pressure began building within her breasts and backside, causing Zelda to let out a groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What now?!</i> She thought, looking down at her body. Her eyes widened as she saw her breasts begin to swell, and felt her backside begin to do the same. Her tunic and pants, specially designed by the Castle's private tailor, began to feel tighter and tighter with each few seconds that passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't too worried about her pants, as they were designed with a special material that was extra stretchy. Her tunic, however, was not. She could feel it tightening around her expanding bust, which had almost doubled in size. Each one of her breasts resembled a melon in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, compared to her lower body, her breasts had barely grown. Her hips were wider than her shoulders, her thighs were brushing against one another and each one of her ass cheeks had evolved into a globe of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her growth slowed to a halt, Zelda explored her new body. She ran her hands over her breasts and ass, noting that, despite their size, they were oddly soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, her entire body had that odd feeling of softness. Her face, her arms, even her hair felt odd!<br>\r\n\"I... can't stay here...\" Zelda said, getting to her feet. She stumbled, her new body throwing her balance off. As she took a step forwards, she felt her new ass wobble and bounce, a feeling she instantly hated...</span></div></div>",

It didn't mean she liked the feeling of walking, given that both her breasts and ass bounced with every step taken, but between having enhanced assets or a pregnant looking stomach, she'd take the former. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning against the rocky wall behind her, Zelda took a look at the hole she had fallen in. The pit had a conical shape, the opening at the top being much narrower than the bottom. Rocks and dirt cascaded down every so often, landing on her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How I wish Link were here...</i> she thought, staring longingly at the small sliver of sky visible through the gap above her. <i>He'd be able to climb out, and then help me out... I wonder...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around, Zelda closely inspected the wall. It consisted mainly of rocks, some loose and some refusing to budge when she applied her weight to them. Running her eye up it, she spotted a number of small outcrops that could double as handholds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking hold of one of the lower ones, Zelda hauled herself up. She let out a gasp as the rock dug into her skin, which seemed to be much softer and more sensitive than it normally was. Gritting her teeth, she reached for another handhold, intent on climbing out of this pit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a rock, Zelda began to pull herself up. As she searched for another, her eyes widened as she felt the rock slip. <br>\r\n\"Please, just hang on!\"<br>\r\nHer eyes scanned the wall frantically. Spotting one, she quickly reached for it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't fast enough. Her handhold went crashing to the bottom of the pit, Zelda quickly following. She let out a pained gasp as she landed heavily on her side. Thankfully, nothing appeared to be broken, so after a quick breather, Zelda unsteadily got to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch...\" She groaned. \"Not that way, then...\"<br>\r\nWith climbing being beyond her ability, Zelda looked around at the walls. Sadly, the only thing of interest was the crack in the wall that Zelda couldn't fit down. And with her curvier body, she definitely had no hope of fitting through it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?!\" She nearly wailed, collapsing up against the wall again...</span></div></div>",

Watching her hand roll the rock back and forth again and again, she felt her eyes begin to droop. After a particularly weak push, she yawned. Her eyes fluttered briefly, before shutting. Within minutes, she had fallen asleep, the only sounds being her quiet breathing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda awoke with a start. She looked around madly, disoriented by her quick awakening. However, she saw little, her surroundings covered in darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" She called out nervously, her voice echoing in the darkness. \"Is anybody there?\"<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, there was complete silence. However, a faint and familiar noise soon reached her ears, causing Zelda to shuffle nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stay back!\" She warned, looking around for the source. The noise drew closer and closer, until...<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" She yelled, spinning around to confront the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in surprise. A gargantuan Chu that towered over her sat there, its wide eyes locked onto her body. Before she could react, it slowly rolled over the top of her, enveloping Zelda in a prison of thick blue jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, she had no idea how to react. She could feel the jelly churning around her, sticking to her skin and tugging at her clothing. After a few seconds, she felt it shift ever so slightly. Pressure began to build just outside her mouth. She clenched her teeth and locked her lips, refusing to let the pressure force its way into her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer resistance was futile. A tiny bit of the jelly found its way into Zelda's mouth. As soon as it touched her tongue, and she tasted the oddly delicious substance, her mouth willingly opened. A torrent of thick jelly flooded in, causing her cheeks to bulge. It flowed down into her stomach, quickly filling it and forcing her belly outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda, for the most part, was content to let this happen. Her body soon began absorbing the jelly, causing her breasts and ass to begin swelling. As her clothes tore off, leaving her clad in nothing but her underwear, Zelda let out a happy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until the Chu had completely vanished into her body and her skin began to tingle did she break out of her dazed state. Looking down at her body, her half-closed eyes shot open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was the slim and trim Princess Zelda, replaced by an absolute whale of a woman. Her belly spread out before her like an ocean, above which sat two large mounds. She could feel her ass spreading out beneath her, acting as a crude and fleshy sofa for her hefty body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she watched, her body began to shrink. Her belly slowly retreated backwards, while her breasts and ass deflated like balloons. She let out a relieved sigh as her belly returned to its former flat state, while her breasts and ass returned to a reasonable size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer relief was short-lived. Glancing down at her body, Zelda realised she no longer had the pale skin tone of a Hylian. Rather, she was now a deep blue, similar to that of the Chu that had just forced its way down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the way she felt... Her skin felt incredibly soft, almost like that taffy treat Link had bought for her once. Her insides felt gooey and thick, while her hair had taken on a gelatinous form, looking more like thick, drooping tentacles than individual strands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... What happened to me?!\"<br>\r\nHer voice, full of fear, echoed around her surroundings. Inspecting her hands, Zelda let out a gasp as she saw jelly drip off the end of one of her fingers. She stumbled backwards. As soon as her foot hit the floor, it burst, sending goo flying and causing Zelda to topple towards the ground. She let out a scream as her head hurtled towards the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\nZelda eyes shot open. She looked around maniacally. Sweat ran down her face in small streams, drenching her clothes. <br>\r\n\"A-A dream?\" She stuttered, quickly inspecting her body. Her skin was pale, and while it was slightly softer, was still solid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a shaky sigh, Zelda leaned back. She wiped sweat from her brow, looking around at her surroundings. It was dark now, the moon visible through the gap in the ceiling. For some reason, it had taken on an blood red hue...</span></div></div>",

She had never heard of it turning red before, so why would it do so now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the moon reached its peak, a feeling of dread set over Zelda. Chills raced over her skin, causing goosebumps to appear. She shivered, pulling her legs up to her chest in an attempt to warm herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" She wondered out loud, watching in mixed horror and amazement as the night sky began to turn a dark red. All around her, particles of darkness rose, floating upwards into the sky. When she reached out to touch one, it burnt against her skin, causing Zelda to let out a pained yelp and quickly recoil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... this malice? But that would mean... Oh, no!\"<br>\r\nRealization quickly set in. A piece of information imparted to her and Link by a weird woman at one of the stables floated to the front of her mind. <br>\r\n\"A blood red moon that turns even the sky itself red...\" She recalled. \"When the forces of evil are at their most powerful... A blood moon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she announced its name, an evil laugh echoed around the cave. Zelda instinctively covered her ears, but even so, she still heard it. The temperature around her dropped immensely. Zelda could do little but watch as all around her, small blue blobs forced their way out of the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... They were reborn...\"<br>\r\nZelda immediately regretted speaking out. As the moon above returned to its regular colour, and the temperature returned to normal, all of the reborn Chu's turned to look at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely had any time to react. All at once, all of the Chu's leapt at her. They all landed on her, sending shivers up her spine. For a few seconds, nobody moved. It was only when Zelda let out a shriek did either party begin to move again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda worked frantically to swipe, batter or otherwise hit the Chu's off of her. However, for each one she successfully pushed away, another took its place, followed quickly by the one she had just removed. It didn't take long for the small army of blue jellies to overwhelm her, pinning her arms to her sides and her legs to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerless to move, Zelda could only watch as the Chu's not pinning her to the floor crawled all over her body. She watched as one found its way under her tunic, where it proceeded to crawl up to one of her breasts and then stop stop one of them. She let out a moan as the Chu quivered, causing her breast to vibrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop...\" She pleaded, but the Chu's paid no attention to her. Another somehow forced its way into her pants and decided to sit atop another intimate area of hers. She let out a squeak as it too decided to quiver, sending waves of pleasure through Zelda's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Or d-don't...\"<br>\r\nAs the Chu's continued to unknowingly pleasure the trapped Princess...</span></div></div>",

The way they teased her womanhood, brushing lightly against it, causing her to shiver in pleasure. The way they rolled over her belly, slid up and down her legs...

No!</i><br>\r\nZelda was too late in realising what that last Chu was intending to do. Before she could react, it had crawled into her mouth, completely filling it.

Her fingers brushed against it before it slid down her throat and into her belly, where it squirmed about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning as her belly bulged outwards slightly, Zelda gingerly reached for her swollen gut.

In fact, she was more than alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a cute one, aren't you?\" She murmured quietly, running a finger over the surface of the small Chu. \"I don't know why I was ever scared of you.

She didn't know what had come over her, but she felt that whatever she was doing was right. The Chu's were still firmly nestled in her clothing, causing odd bulges to appear all over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the number of Chu's, Zelda did her best to pay a little attention to each one. She petted them until they quivered in thanks, causing either a smile to spread across her face or a moan to escape her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you should be the last one!\" Zelda declared as she stroked the one sitting directly on top of her nether regions. It wobbled in response, causing Zelda to shiver. Thankfully, none of the Chu's had made their way into her underwear, otherwise she would've had trouble keeping quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as this thought had passed though her head, she felt the one she had just pet shift slightly. It rubbed against the waistband of her panties. A second later, Zelda felt it slowly make its way into them, where it retook its seat atop her womanhood. Zelda bit her lip as she felt it sink in to her slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it stopped moving, Zelda felt a twinge of disappointment. Some part of her wanted that Chu to continue, to enter her body...<br>\r\n<i>What am I thinking?! That's disgusting!</i> She thought. <br>\r\nEven as she thought that, her hands slowly moved down to the Chu...</span></div></div>",

She let out a quiet moan as the Chu reacted to her touch, wiggling against her slowly dampening nether regions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\nZelda slowly stoked the small blob, who responded by vibrating more vigorously. Another moan escaped her lips, louder this time. Her mind was being overwhelmed by pleasure. She needed to act now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTightening her grip slightly, Zelda began to push downwards. For a few seconds, the Chu resisted, trying to push back. However, it must've picked up on her intentions or something, as its somewhat solid form began to feel softer and more malleable. She could feel it pushing in between her fingers, threatening to envelope her hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it didn't. Zelda began to force the blob into her body, moaning uncontrollably as she did. She was in pure ecstasy as the Chu slowly slid into her body. She felt her already bulging belly begin to swell yet again, which only added to her pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the Chu enter her womb, Zelda writhed in pleasure. Sensing movement, the rest of the Chu's, all of which had apparently fallen asleep, began to move again. Consumed by pleasure, Zelda's other hand began to assist the Chu's. She fondled her heavy breasts, squeezing and teasing her erect nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Chu was completely sucked into her vagina, Zelda let out a scream of pleasure as her entire body began to tingle. Her skin felt so soft, almost malleable, while her insides felt somewhat gooey. Her breasts felt even heavier, as did her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her body tingled, her head felt... odd. Not light, but she could definitely tell something was off. <br>\r\n<i>This feels so... sublime!</i> Zelda thought, one hand still playing with her breasts and the other now stroking her vagina. <i>These creatures... Who knew they were capable of this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda continued to play with herself, her body continued to tingle. Her pale skin took on a translucent blue hue, partially revealing her insides, while also becoming more and more jelly-esque.

What are you guys up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin her clothing, the Chu's were writhing about, causing Zelda to giggle. A few were sitting next to her armpits, a place where she was particularly ticklish. It didn't take long for her to begin thrashing about in a fit of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hahahahaha... P-Please!\" Zelda gasped for breath. \"S-Stop it right n-now!\"<br>\r\nAs light blue tears began to run down her face, the reason for why the Chu's were so active soon became evident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the smaller Chu's emerged from under her tunic. It spied Zelda's tears dripping onto the floor and began to make its way towards them. Sliding atop them, the small Chu made a noise as it began to absorb the tears. It slowly swelled larger, becoming rounder and rounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling something press against her cheek, Zelda tried to stop her laughter. However, the Chu's refused to cooperate with her demands to stop, and continued to unintentionally tickle her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"L-Last warning!\" Zelda said through her laughter. She yelped as another Chu began to press against her vagina, unaware that it beginning to absorb her juices. She contemplated 'welcoming' it into her body, but she was curious about the pressure on her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"ALRIGHT! STOP IT!\"<br>\r\nRaising her voice, Zelda commanded the Chu's to stop. Surprisingly, they all stopped their movements, which allowed her to wiped the tears from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you! Now, what are you?\"<br>\r\nTurning her head, Zelda's eyes widened as she saw a Chu almost double the size of the others sitting directly next to her head. It looked back at her, its white eyes wide and curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're so cute!\"<br>\r\nLetting out a squeal, Zelda sat up. Her body, which had stopped tingling and was now more Chu than Hylian, let out a slight squelch as she did so. <br>\r\nShe leaned over, smiling at the Chu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh... You're so round... And so soft!\" She exclaimed excitedly, poking it with a semi-solid finger. \"I could just kiss you!\"</span></div></div>",

Sliding her hands under the sentient sphere of jelly, she struggled to pick it up with her new hands, which were a lot more slippy now that they mainly consisted of jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did manage to pick it up and, after a few seconds of preparing herself, slowly moved it towards her face. The Chu, completely unaware of her intentions, merely quivered in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes as the Chu drew closer to her face, Zelda puckered her lips. Due to her fathers incredibly strict rules, she had never kissed anybody before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To think, a Chu gets my first kiss... </i><br>\r\nA smile spread across her face at the very thought. She had always imagined somebody like Link being her first kiss. Maybe not Link, considering how boneheaded he was, but maybe somebody like him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips touched the Chu. As soon as they did, Zelda's mind went blank. She moaned happily at the feeling of the jelly gently pressing against her soft lips. Meanwhile, the Chu continued to wobble, unable to understand what Zelda was currently doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds passed, during which another idea came to Zelda. She wanted to protect these Chu's, this one in particular. It meant something to her now. And what safer place was there than her own body? If it lived within her, her first kiss would never be too far from her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda parted her lips and began to gently push the Chu into her mouth. Her cheeks began to bulge as it began to fill her mouth.

One of her hands slowly moved to her stomach, where she began to gently caress her slim stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last remnants of her pale Hylian skin began to fade away, consumed by her gelatinous skin. It began to spread to her hair, which began to meld together until a blob of yellow hair with drooping tendrils of jelly sat atop her head. Her green eyes took on a blue hue, while her pink lips also turned blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothing, which had remained untouched by all her changes, began to melt into her body. Her tunic vanished into her torso, where it quickly began to dissolve. As soon as the last thread had dissolved, her breasts swelled slightly. The same happened to her pants and boots, their mass adding to that of her ass and thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely naked, Zelda giggled as she felt her slim belly begin to push outwards. <br>\r\n \"That feels... Oh, Hylia...\"<br>\r\nHer giggles quickly turned to moans as her belly continued to fill with the absorbed Chu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a hand that dripped with jelly down past her belly, Zelda groped around for her vagina. After a few seconds, she stopped when it became clear that her new body didn't actually have one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My... Oh, no! How am I meant to... Oh, please...\"<br>\r\nAnother moan escaped her lips as her belly finished growing, making her appear in the latter stages of pregnancy. Placing a hand on it, a peaceful smile returned to Zelda's face as she felt something within her belly quiver at her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Calm down, little one...\" Zelda whispered soothingly. \"Your Princess is here for you...\"<br>\r\nLooking around the cave, Zelda got to her feet, a hand still glued to her belly.

They sat around in her in a circle, awaiting orders from their new Princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So beautiful...\" Zelda murmured dreamily, inspecting each member of her new family. \"All of you are so, so beautiful... It would break my heart of anything happened to any of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small blue tear ran down her gelatinous face as thoughts of her precious family getting crushed beneath boots and slashed with rusty blades flashed through her head.

As they came within arms reach, she began to scoop them up and lift them to her open mouth. She groaned and moaned as she accepted more Chus into her body, which began to gurgle and swell with more jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the last Chu in her hands, Zelda gave it a gentle kiss before opening her mouth and allowing the Chu to slither in. Her cheeks bulged for a few seconds, before the Chu began to slide down her throat and added its mass to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a polite burp, Zelda giggled and rubbed her belly, which had grown considerably. It had almost tripled in size, and was wobbling constantly. Above it sat two heavy orbs of dripping jelly that acted as breasts. Her hips had widened considerably to accommodate her much rounder ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Zelda didn't care.

The handhold she had tried to grab simply dug into her body, affirming her theory. As she pulled her hand away, the rock came with her. It floated within her hand, before slowly melting away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't recall Chu Jelly being corrosive...\" Zelda murmured, watching the now pebble dissolve. \"Perhaps it has something to do with my own power... Well, I suppose it doesn't matter much. If climbing is out, then I suppose the only other solution would be that crevice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving away from the wall, she made her way towards the crack in the wall. She was doubtful that she would be able to fit with her family-filled body, but it was her only hope. If she didn't fit, then both her and her family would be confined to this pit until Ganon wiped out Hyrule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here...\"<br>\r\nPushing her hand into the gap, Zelda let out a gasp of surprise as she saw her arm flatten to fit. <br>\r\n\"I see... Well, I suppose having a body made of jelly would allow you to do that. I just hope that it'll work with the rest of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Zelda slowly edged her body into the gap. She let out a groan of discomfort as she felt her body compress and flatten. It felt incredibly weird, but at the same time, felt somewhat natural. She pushed her body through the gap, looking for a way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What if this ends in a dead end?</i> She realised. <i>What if I can't get back out?!</i><br>\r\nThankfully, her worry was short-lived as the gap began to widen.

Aw, well. At least it's more spacious than the last cave! Let's see what we have...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading deeper into the cave, Zelda became aware of a faint noise. It was familiar, almost nostalgic. <br>\r\n<i>Sounds like Castle Town</i>, she thought, her hand resting atop her gooey belly. <i>But that can't be right, I'm deep underground...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing onwards toward the noise, Zelda found herself faced with a rather large hill of dirt. Taking a few steps up it, her gelatinous feet quickly lost grip on the dirt, causing both her and a rather large pile of dirt to go sliding back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm... This problem with my grip is getting quite bad. I can't climb walls, and now I can't even walk up slight hills?</i><br>\r\nLooking up the hill, Zelda decided to try something unorthodox. Getting down on her hands and knees, she slowly began to crawl up the dirt hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though her method was weird, it worked. She slowly moved her gooey bulk up the hill, her belly rubbing against the ground. Occasionally, her grip would fail her and she would slip down the hill, but she always recovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the top of the hill, Zelda pushed the loose dirt on her palms into her body, where it quickly dissolved. <br>\r\n \"That really is quite useful!\" She said, looking at her hands with interest. \"Now, let's see what that... noise... is...\"<br>\r\nShe slowly trailed off as she got a good look at the source of the bustle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cavern opened up massively, revealing a city similar in size to Castle Town. Much like the Hylian capital, a large castle overlooked the town. From her vantage point, she could make out what looked like a number of fields, a central plaza with a fountain and an area that she assumed was mainly residential. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I didn't even know this town existed!\" Zelda said, her voice filled with awe. \"The Slate didn't tell me, and I know that the Castle's Library never mentioned it! I wonder what I can find down here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making her way down the hill and across a rocky plain, Zelda found herself standing at the gates. As she prepared to make her way in...<br>\r\n \"Stop!\"<br>\r\nHeading a gruff voice, Zelda paused. A second later, she heard footsteps approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, well... It's not often we get a Chu who's taken on a human form. In fact, I think you're the first!\"<br>\r\nZelda's eyes widened as she saw a Moblin approach her, a wooden spear clutched in its red hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A monster that I can talk?! What's going on here?! Is my family in danger?!</i><br>\r\nCovering her belly with protective hands, Zelda eyed the monster suspiciously. <br>\r\n \"Where am I?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You don't know?\" The Moblin scratched its snout. \"This is the only safe haven for us monsters. We... don't really have a name for the town yet. But, it's populated by monsters, and only monsters. Hylians are... unwelcome here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly removing her hands, Zelda peered through the gates. <br>\r\n \"Monsters, huh...\"<br>\r\nThe Moblin nodded. <br>\r\n \"Uh-huh. You're welcome to go in. Just don't cause any trouble, and we'll get on fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Moblin smiled at her. At least, Zelda assumed it was a smile. It was more of a threatening leer, but she decided to just ignore that and enter the town. <br>\r\n<i>A town populated by nothing but monsters?</i> Zelda thought. <i>Father would love nothing more than to burn this place and massacre the inhabitants... I, however, will not do that. At this point, I'm more monster than Hylian. Not to mention my family...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the central plaza, Zelda took a proper look around. It was almost a carbon copy of Castle Town, aside from the missing Triforce symbols. A large tavern filled with rowdy Moblins and Bokoblins sat to her left, while a street filled with what looked like Poe's manning market stalls was on her right. And directly in front of her was the unnamed castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So much to look at!</i> Zelda thought, looking around. <i>Where do I even start?!</i> </span></div></div>",

What do monsters eat?</i><br>\r\nStopping at a stall manned by a Blizzrobe, Zelda inspected his goods. He seemed to be selling meat, however she couldn't be sure if it was animal, monster or human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Excuse me, uh... sir?\" Zelda said. \"What kind of meat is this?\"<br>\r\nThe Blizzrobe eyed her with distrust. <br>\r\n \"Cow. Any other questions, Chu?\" He asked roughly. <br>\r\nSurprised and slightly frightened at the Blizzrobes tone, Zelda shook her head and hurried off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nobody seems to trust me very much...</i> She thought as she made her way through the crowd. Thankfully, she didn't have to push her way through as people still avoided her, giving her a small area around her in which she could move freely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wouldn't take it personally. They just aren't used to your kind around here. You're a very rare breed, you know? And a Broodmother at that? You're probably rarer than some of those golden monsters!\"<br>\r\nZelda let out a yelp as something tapped her on the shoulder. Spinning around, she found a Blazerobe staring at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-I'm sorry... What did you say?\"<br>\r\nThe Blazerobe chuckled. <br>\r\n \"Monsters tend to distrust that which they are not familiar with. To my knowledge, you are the first ever Chu to ever achieve both sentience and a human form. Plus, you're a Broodmother! Combine all those, and that makes you incredibly dangerous\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dangerous? How? And why aren't you afraid of me?\"<br>\r\nThe Blazerobe chuckled again. <br>\r\n \"I don't fear you because I've spent time among much more dangerous beasts. Hylians are a vicious sort. And as for how dangerous you are, you are a Chu. You absorb fire. You absorb ice. And you absorb electricity. You are highly resistant to weapons. You have corrosive insides. You can take other Chu's into your body and add their power to yours. And you have intelligence. That is the most dangerous part of you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You seem to know an awful lot about me. Is there a library in town?\" Zelda asked. <br>\r\n \"Only the Castle library. Lucky for you, the Castle is always open. We've got no ruler, so it's mainly for show. I doubt anybody down here could band all of the different races together. Anyway, it's been nice, but I gotta run. Things to buy, monsters to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blazerobe hustled off, leaving Zelda alone. <br>\r\n<i>I'm a dangerous sort?</i> She repeated in her head. <i>Well, I'm not but... It doesn't matter. I could check out the library, try to find out a little more about this place. On the other hand, I haven't eaten since before I fell in that hole. Wait... Do I still even need to eat? And even if I do, I probably need money. Do they use rupees down here? I'll assume so, seeing as monsters constantly drop them. Where would I even get rupees down here? Urgh, so many questions...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Zelda decided to take it one question at a time, starting with...</span></div></div>",

Her gelatinous belly visibly churned, some jelly dripping onto the ground beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alright then...</i> Zelda thought, caressing her belly until it was still.<i> I suppose we should find something to eat. Although, that comes with its own set of questions... What does a Chu Broodmother even eat? And how do I pay for whatever it is?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to find these answers out as she went along, Zelda joined the crowd once again. As soon as she did, monsters edged away from her, a few shooting her looks of disgust. She ignored these for the most part, until a particular fat-looking Bokoblin got in her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Chu!\" It screeched, jumping up and down on its thick, stumpy legs. \"You no belong here!\"<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me?\" Zelda asked in disbelief. Could this stupid creature possibly know her secret?<br>\r\n\"Chu's dumber than Bokoblin!\" It squealed, pointing at her and then itself. \"You dumb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, a small crowd had gathered around the pair. Some were nodding at the Bokoblin's statements, while others seemed to be eyeing Zelda with something like pity on their faces. <br>\r\n<i>This thing is calling me stupid?</i> She thought. <i>That's irony if I've ever seen it... I suppose I could demonstrate that I'm different...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are calling me stupid?!\" Zelda demanded, stomping her foot with such force that the Bokoblin took a step back. \"You, whose race can't even organize themselves properly on the surface?!\"<br>\r\n\"That no true!\" The Bokoblin tried to protest, but Zelda wasn't having it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been to the surface!\" She declared. \"I have seen the cruelty of the Hylians! I have seen the ramshackle bands of monsters on the surface, fighting over scraps! Being declared stupid by someone who hasn't left this town? Hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the crowd around her had grown exponentially. Almost all of the crowd seemed to be staring at Zelda, with the exception of a few Bokoblins, who continued to eye her with disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Zelda fell silent. She watched her opponent, waiting for their next move. Most of what she said was true, however she  kind of made up that Hylians were a cruel race. Not all of them were cruel. Only the ones who abused her poor Chu's were cruel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You dead!\"<br>\r\nHearing the Bokoblin let out a screech, Zelda's eyes widened as it charged towards her.

She could see its tongue, hanging out of its mouth, waggling. And she could see her own body moving, even though she had intended to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's going on?!</i><br>\r\nShe felt her mouth open to an impossible size, easily large enough to envelop her attacker. As it reached its full size, her jaw brushing against the dusty floor, time sped back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd let out a collective gasp of surprise as the Bokoblin sprinted into her mouth, disappearing from view. As soon as she felt its disgusting feet touch the inside of her cavernous mouth, Zelda shut her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, she felt the Bokoblin struggle within its prison. It beat against the sides of her mouth, which was slowly shrinking around her prey. As soon as her mouth stopped shrinking, the Bokoblin's futile attempts at escape slowly became weaker and weaker, before stopping completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her prey still, Zelda felt her belly shrinking. <br>\r\n<i>No, not shrinking... They're moving...</i><br>\r\nHer brood navigated towards her mouth, leaving her belly slim and flat. However, various parts of her body ballooned as they passed through her. Her breasts tripled in size for a few seconds before returning to normal. Her neck bulged uncomfortably before she felt them flood into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few squelch's that meant nothing to the stunned crowd, but informed Zelda that her family was pleased with their meal, came from her mouth. A few seconds later, her mouth began to return to its original size, the mass of the Bokoblin slowly vanishing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mouth returned to its normal size, her family travelled back to her belly. Her belly swelled back out to its gravid state. With her body back to normal, Zelda let out a quiet burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I feel so full...</i> She groaned internally, rubbing her belly. <i>Is that how I eat now? It's... kind of disgusting... But necessary, I suppose. And it does add to my mass a little...</i><br>\r\nMoving a hand away from her belly, Zelda rubbed her breasts, which were a little rounder now. She giggled, before remembering where she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around at the silent crowd, she began to worry. She had basically committed murder, a crime punishable by death in Castle Town. Would she be sentenced to the same here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping her hands defensively around her belly, Zelda took a step back...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking another step back, Zelda glanced around for a possible escape. While she wouldn't be welcome... anywhere, really... on the surface, she could probably survive up there. If her diet consisted mainly of Bokoblins, then she'd be fine! Plenty of rogue bands wandered the surface, despite having no leader to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her escape plan was soon rendered unnecessary as the crowd around her burst in applause. She stared at them in disbelief. She had just eaten somebody, and they were applauding her? Was murder common in these streets?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's the one!\"<br>\r\n \"Never thought I'd see the day...\"<br>\r\n \"We won't have to live in fear anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking out a few shouts, Zelda's brow furrowed in confusion.<br>\r\n<i>I'm the one?</i> She wondered. <i>The one to do what?</i><br>\r\nHer question, sadly, was not answered. Instead, the crowd, still clapping, shouting and screaming, surged towards her. She inched backwards, scared in case she accidentally absorbed them or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her bulk hoisted into the air, Zelda let out a scream. She could feel all sorts of hands pressing into her gelatinous body. A few even penetrated her body, floating inside her until the owner realised what they had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtop the crowd, Zelda was carried down the street and into the central plaza, where they were met by curious faces. <br>\r\n \"She's the one!\"<br>\r\nWith that one line, the entire plaza erupted into applause. The crowd holding her grew as she was carried towards a massive gate that looked very familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is where Hyrule Castle's Gate would be!</i> She realised. <i>So that means they're carrying me towards their version of the Castle?</i><br>\r\nAs she neared the gates, two Lynel Guards appeared. They glared at the crowd, before nodding at one another and parting, allowing the crowd to push through the massive gates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing through, Zelda got her first proper look at the Castle. It was similar to Hyrule Castle, yet at the same time, was different. The walls were built with black bricks instead of white. No flags flew from the poles adorning the walls. And the gates that led to Hyrule Castle's lower levels didn't exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was carried from the bottom of the hill all the way to the top. As they neared the Throne Room, the crowd stopped and fell silent. Looking up, Zelda spotted a lone Blazerobe standing before them. Fire encircled his feet, smoke rising around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I know him...</i> Zelda thought. <br>\r\n \"Present her!\" He cried, raising his arms. <br>\r\nThe ones holding Zelda, a blue Moblin and a black Moblin, gently set Zelda down. The crowd patted before her, giving her a passage to the Blazerobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously walking towards him, Zelda watched the crowd as she moved. What appeared to be a family of Lizalfos smiled at her, their tongues flicking out. A massive Lynel nodded at her, giving her a gruff growl. A few Stal-Bokoblins chattered between themselves, watching her closely with empty eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the Blazerobe, Zelda stared at him. One of his eyes twinkled as though he were winking at her. <br>\r\n \"I see, I see...\" He mumbled, loud enough for Zelda to hear. \"They sense something within you... Magic, perhaps? No, something more ancient, more... divine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking away from her, the Blazerobe raised his arms again. <br>\r\n \"She has been blessed by the Goddesses!\" He declared, causing a cheer to erupt from the crowd. \"She is the one!\"<br>\r\nThe crowd repeated this, cheering as they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am the one... To do what?</i> She wondered again. Before she could ask, the Blazerobe floated towards her. <br>\r\n \"Come, my dear Princess...\" He said. \"Quarters have been prepared for you. And of course, the Castle is at your disposal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing her title, Zelda swallowed nervously. Surely he didn't know who she was?<br>\r\n \"P-Princess?\" She repeated. <br>\r\nThe Blazerobe nodded. <br>\r\n \"But of course! You are the one spoken of in the prophecy, a descendant of the Royal Family! Unfortunately, without a coronation ceremony, we cannot call you Queen just yet. I hope Princess will suffice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nodded hesitantly. <br>\r\n<i>Prophecy? Royal Family? This is moving really fast... All I wanted was some food, and now I'm a member of the Underground Royal Family?! I need some answers...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing herself to be led away from the cheering crowd by the Blazerobe Zelda was taken to a large bedroom. Inside was very similar to her room in Hyrule Castle, although she didn't have her tower here. She<br>\r\n<i>I did see it when I was being carried up here. I wonder if I can still access it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope these lodgings are to your liking?\" The Blazerobe asked. <br>\r\n \"Uh... Yes! Thank you very much!\" Zelda responded. <br>\r\nThe Blazerobe bowed, before making for the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Should I ask him about all this?</i> Zelda wondered. <i>He did mention a library earlier... Perhaps independent research would be more informative? Then again, it's been a long day... Sleep would definitely benefit me...</i></span></div></div>",

Initially, it had felt rather repulsive but now, she was actually growing to like it somewhat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling as the chu pressed against her finger, Zelda ignored the numb sensation slowly spreading throughout her body. It had originated in her belly, more specifically from her inhabitant, yet her belly still had feeling in it. If anything, it was a little more sensitive, which explained why Zelda was so fixated on caressing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, both her legs and her ample backside fell to the numbness. And yet, Zelda still remained oblivious to it. Another giggle escaped her lips as her fingers danced nimbly across its surface, causing the Chu within to squirm happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the numbness, which was still avoiding her belly, now inching down her arms, Zelda finally became aware of the missing sensation. And even then, it was only due to her agile fingers suddenly feeling clumsy and unresponsive that she finally paid any attention to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why do I feel so weird?\" She wondered, struggling to lift her arm up. \"Is the Chu doing something to me?!\"<br>\r\nStaring wide-eyed at her belly, Zelda's realisation came too later. As feeling vanished from her fingers, she felt the numbness begin to advance up her neck. And that was the least of her worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-Wait! What's happening to me?!\"<br>\r\nZelda's unresponsive body pushed itself to her feet, where she stood uneasily. She swayed from side to side, almost as though her legs were made from some sort of jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her face lost feeling, her lips going unresponsive, Zelda could do nothing but think to herself. <br>\r\n<i>I've lost control of my body?!</i> She thought anxiously. <i>Then who's in control right now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, she received the answer from the most unlikely place. <br>\r\n \"Burble...\"<br>\r\nAn odd noise escaped her own mouth.

I need control of my body back!</i><br>\r\nTry as she might, Zelda couldn't regain control of herself, leaving the Chu in charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a group of Chu's rolling towards her head, Zelda began to panic. Her panic only increased when her body opened her mouth and wiggled her tongue invitingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo small Chu's reached her mouth at the same time, pushing against one another as they both forced their way into her mouth with a wet *PLOP*. Her cheeks bulged briefly, her mouth filled with a strangely sweet blue jelly, before one of them began to slide down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it fell into her belly, Zelda felt her body gently caress her belly, a few wet noises escaping her mouth. The second Chu slid into her belly, causing it to visibly swell and make her appear appear heavily pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up, Zelda screamed internally as she spotted the rest of the group slowly nearing her mouth, which was still hanging wide open. <br>\r\n<i>No, no more! I don't think my body can handle that many!</i><br>\r\nHer body didn't listen to her. Instead, it reached out and began to apply guide the Chu's to her mouth, pushing them in when they drew near. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes, Zelda's body fed Chu after Chu into her mouth. With each one that was swallowed, her belly swelled larger and larger. Her tunic was quickly forced upwards and bunched beneath her breasts, which remained untouched by her sudden stuffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her body ran out of Chu's and fell backwards, landing heavily on her backside. A pained squelch escaped her mouth, followed by a pleased one as her hands began massaging her belly, which reached out to her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need to regain control!</i> Zelda thought. <i>I don't want any more monsters in me!</i><br>\r\nAs Zelda struggled to regain control, her body gurgled as...</span></div></div>",

Now stuffed firmly in the centre of her crotch, her green eyes flashed rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes... Yes... Yes...</i><br>\r\n \"YEEESSSS!\"<br>\r\nThe scream of pure ecstasy escaped from Zelda's lips, echoing around her pit. It continued for a few more seconds as she climaxed, a thin blue liquid leaking from her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Zelda pulled her hands away from her body, lifting them up and inspecting them. Licking the liquid from her hand, she grinned happily. She was back in control of her body, but she didn't care that she now consisted of jelly. In fact, she loved it. And she wanted to spread it, create more like her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she knew exactly where to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way towards the edge of her pit, she began to effortlessly climb out of the hole, her body sticking to the wall. After a few minutes of climbing, she stood at the edge of the pit, her body dropping jelly. Looking back down into her pit, she grinned again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I fell in as a Princess of Hyrule, and came out a Queen of Chu's... Not a bad trade. But a Queen needs a kingdom, and I know where to start...\"</span></div></div>",

But Hyrule does have a second Princess, albeit a much less powerful and influential one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for a moment, she glanced towards the sky. She had only been in that pit for a few hours at most, meaning the sun was now high above her. Staring at it for a few moments, she ran a quick calculation in her head before looking east, or what she hoped was easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The Domain, and my new kingdom, is that way!\" She declared, a hand stroking her belly. \"Don't worry, my children. I'll have some delectable bodies for you to assume control off soon! And once you have, we can begin spreading across Hyrule at a much quicker pace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing gleefully to herself, Zelda started towards the Domain, looking forwards to meeting her new subjects...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">&lt;-- A couple of days later --&gt;</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda let out a long breath as she struggled up the last few feet of the steep hill she found herself on. All in all, her journey had been quite exhausting. The sun had warmed her body considerably during the day, making her legs feel weak and wobbly. Travelling during the cool nights had worked much better for her, even with the amount of enemies that also enjoyed the nights. They had all ignored her, save for the Chu's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gave her belly a loving caress as she reached the peak of the hill. During her trip across Hyrule, Chu after Chu had flocked to her, seeking refuge within her body. As their new Queen, Zelda was more than happy to accommodate them, no matter their typing or number. As a result, her once slim yet pregnant looking blue body was long gone, replaced by something new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was still mainly blue, tinges of red, white and yellow from various different types of Chu's had spread throughout her form, making her resemble some sort of rainbow. Her belly, which housed the majority of her babies, had swelled massively, protruding a good five feet from the rest of her body. Within it was a vortex of colour, once again stemming from her different children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the rest of her body had not been ignored, with a fair number of Chu's deciding to house themselves elsewhere. Her breasts had doubled in size during her trip and rested atop her gravid belly, while her ass, hips and thighs were considerably thicker. Aside from those three areas, a few weirder Chu's had settled in her arms, making them noticeably thicker, while one really irritating one had made its home in her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, Zelda loved them all. As she stared down at Zora's Domain, which glittered beautifully in the early morning sun, she rubbed her body, moaning quietly as she did. While it would be sad to say goodbye to her children, they would soon be living better lives in the bodies of others. And as their Queen, she would need to support them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now, how should we go about this, my children?\" She asked, eyeing the Domain curiously...</span></div></div>",

Eventually, she let out a sad sigh and stepped back. However she approached the Domain, be it from either of the bridges or from one of the many waterfalls surrounding it, she would incur massive losses and gain very little from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perhaps we should start with some place else, my children...\" She whispered dejectedly to her belly, which vibrated slightly in response. \"I know, I know... I am not happy about it either, but I am unwilling to sacrifice any of you! Perhaps if we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda trailed off as she heard a splash nearby. Returning to the edge of the cliff, she looked straight down. Covering the cliff face was a beautiful waterfall, one of many dotted around Zora's Domain. However, as she looked closer, she spotted a red fin aimed towards her racing up it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh dear... It appears we've been seen...\"<br>\r\nZelda stepped back as a Zora launched themselves into the air. As they did, they managed to unsheathe a silver trident. <br>\r\n \"You dare enter Zora's Domain, foul beast?!\" They cried, landing gracefully and levelling their spear at Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the duo inspected the other. Standing before Zelda was a red and white female Zora. Her slim body was clad in various types of silver jewellery, all of which shone slightly in the light of the sun. However, a smile spread across Zelda's gelatinous face as she spotted a light blue sash with a drawing of a large creature with a trunk wrapped around her torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Princess Mipha...\" She murmured, stroking her belly. \"Perhaps we can start with Zora's Domain after all...\"<br>\r\nAt the mention of her name, Mipha stepped forwards and thrust her spear out. The tip of it now rested about two inches from Zelda's face, not that she was particularly worried about it. <br>\r\n \"How do you know my name?\" She demanded. \"Answer honestly, or be struck down where you stand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda giggled in response. <br>\r\n \"Oh, never mind that, Princess!\" She responded brightly. \"All I'll say for now is that I too was once a Princess! But now, I'm a Queen without a kingdom, and we can't have that, can we? So hold still, and accept my gift so that I grow both my kingdom and people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipha's eyes widened as the creature before her moved at a blinding speed. With one arm, they batted away her spear, knocking it from her grip. The other shot out, losing its shape and morphing into some sort of tentacle, aimed directly at her face...</span></div></div>",

As it drew closer, she clamped her mouth shut, hoping it would be enough to keep the dripping appendage out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the self-proclaimed Chu Queen had somehow predicted she would try this and tightly squeezed her other hand, causing the air to rush from Mipha's lungs. As she opened her mouth to gasp for air, the tentacle made its move and shot directly into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her cheeks bulged with jelly, Mipha tried to spit it out. When that didn't work, she tried biting, hoping her sharper Zora teeth would cause the creature some pain. Her hopes were quickly dashed as her teeth refused to cut through the rubbery tendril and merely slid across it slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, my dear Mipha...\" The Chu Queen giggled. \"Only a few items in Hyrule have the power necessary to cut through my body! And unfortunately for you, your teeth are not counted amongst them! Now, just relax... Allow my gift to fill and change your life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the tendril in her mouth pulsate disgustingly, Mipha began to panic as she spotted a bulge on the Chu Queen's neck pulsate in response before sliding down her neck and into the tendril stuffed into her mouth. With eyes filled with fear, Mipha watched the bulge slide down the tendril and into her mouth. Her cheeks bulged even more as she felt the bulge sit atop her tongue for a few moments before dropping atop it, chilling and numbing her mouth greatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now, my child...\" The Queen cooed. \"She's all yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the tendril retreat from her mouth, Mipha was about to spit out whatever it had placed there when it, with surprising speed, slid down her throat and into her belly. Mipha groaned as her belly bulged outwards slightly to accommodate it. Thankfully, her distended belly didn't last too long as it gurgled loudly and shrank back into her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it doing so caused a numbing chill to fill Mipha's body. As the chill reached her head, her vision began to dull. The last thing Mipha saw before her vision disappeared was the serene smile on the Chu Queen's familiar face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Mipha's eyes gradually shut, Zelda reached a hand out and gently caressed her cheek. Beneath her hand, she could feel Mipha's skin beginning to bubble, signalling her changes were beginning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Soon, I'll have a Princess and a Kingdom...\" Zelda whispered happily. \"Come, my sweet first child... Join me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching in response to her command, Mipha's skin began to visibly bubble and melt away, soon leaving her with a gelatinous replacement of her former body. Unlike Zelda, who was a rainbow of colours and filled with her children, Mipha was a brilliant white, signalling that she had been changed by an Ice Chu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last bit of Mipha's Zora body melted away and her jewellery felt to the ground with a gentle clink, the new Chu Princess's eyes gradually fluttered open, revealing that they were a glowing yellow, similar to Zelda's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well?\" Zelda asked. \"How does my new Princess and Daughter feel?\"</span></div></div>",

His chest rose and fell slowly, telling the irritated Zelda that he had fallen asleep at some point during her wondering about the Zora Race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatching over to her slumbering knight, Zelda have him a light tap with the toe of her boot. Link let a snort, causing Zelda to giggle briefly. Giving him another tap, her giggles vanished as he stubbornly refused to wake up. Taking a deep breath, Zelda prepared herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LINK! WAKE UP!\"<br>\r\nZelda shouted at the top of her voice, while also stomping her foot. Her demand echoed around the room for a few seconds, before silence returned. Link's hand twitched slightly before he lifted his head. He lazily looked around the room before focusing in on Zelda and giving her an apologetic look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly! You'd think the warrior capable of defeating Calamity Ganon would be a little more alert! What if we were attacked? What would've happened to me?\" Zelda demanded, hands on her hips. \"In case you forgot, monsters still roam Hyrule, and I'm pretty sure they'll all relish the chance to get at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Link merely shrugged and stood up. He stretched for a few moments before looking at Zelda, awaiting her orders. <br>\r\nShe contemplated punishing him somehow, maybe force him to make her an extra large dinner or something, but that probably wouldn't stick. Maybe she could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah!\"<br>\r\nShe cried out as Link grabbed his bow. He nocked an arrow and aimed behind her. Ducking down, she flinched as she heard the arrow fly across the room, embedding itself into something with a dull thunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\nHesitantly straightening up, Zelda looked towards his target. His arrow was stuck in a wall, something small glittering below it. Link walked over to it, a hand on the grip of the Master Sword. He stooped down and grabbed the shiny object, inspecting it closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Zelda curiously wandered over to him. <br>\r\n\"What is it?\" She asked, peering over his shoulder. <br>\r\nHer eyes lit up as she spotted a beautiful sapphire in the centre of his hand. Gold encircled it, giving it a familiar look that Zelda just couldn't place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful...\" She whispered, reaching down and taking it from Link's hand. She held it up to the fading evening light, giving it her own inspection. <br>\r\n\"It looks familiar, yet I can't place it...\" She murmured. \"I think I'll keep hold of it... Research purposes, of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPocketing the sapphire, she looked at Link. <br>\r\n\"Good find!\" She said gratefully, before remembering what they were talking about. \"But not good enough for my forgiveness! I want an extra large dinner if you want that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink let out a sigh, nodding in response to her demand. From experience, it was best that he just went along with her demands, lest he want even more trouble from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a delicious dinner consisting of grilled meat, vegetables and a jug of cold milk, the pair turned in for the night.

They had elected to use the ruins she had found as cover, the Sheikah Slate having told them that rain would arrive at some point during the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sat opposite her, staring at the campfire he had restarted. Zelda joined him, sitting opposite him. She stared at the Master Sword for a few seconds before speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Morning!\" She said brightly, Link's dinner having done its job in cheering her up. \"Ready for another day of research?\"<br>\r\nLink gave her a half-hearted shrug, inciting a laugh from Zelda. <br>\r\n \"Come on... Cheer up! Research isn't that bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink hesitated, unsure of how to answer. <br>\r\n \"I know you don't like it, but research helps us understand the world around us! It's an amazing feeling, stumbling across some long-lost relic or some ancient text...\"<br>\r\nZelda let out a dreamy sigh, imagining the possibilities. If she had found that beautiful sapphire yesterday, who knew what she might find today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could disappear off into the ruins, her belly let out a long gurgle. She blushed, rubbing her slim stomach. <br>\r\n \"Well, can't research on an empty stomach, can you? I'm really in the mood for some... fish! Yeah, the bigger it is, the better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnvisioning herself gorging on a huge Hylian Bass, her mouth began to water. When Link produced one from his infinite satchel, her eyes lit up. <br>\r\n \"Quickly! Hand it over!\"<br>\r\nLink hesitated. The last time he had let her cook, she had almost burnt down their surroundings. Although this time, she seemed to be so much more confident....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his better judgement, Link handed her the slightly slimy fish. He watched as she lifted it to her face, apparently inhaling its scent. When she opened her mouth to take a bite, that was when he looked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a large chunk out of the still raw fish, Zelda chewed slowly, savouring the taste. It was slimy, tough and still had scales attached to it, but none of that bothered her. Taking another bite, she let out a moan. It tasted so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the fish was reduced to a small pile of white bones that sat next to Zelda. She rubbed her belly happily, pleased with her slightly weird meal. <br>\r\n \"Delicious!\" She said, getting to her feet. \"Now, shall we get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked at the pile of bones and then at her.

He was close enough to be at her aid at a seconds notice, but far enough to avoid the smell of fish that seemed to be following her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lets see what's in here...\"<br>\r\nPoking her head around an archway, she expected to find yet another room that had collapsed in upon itself. What she did not expect to find was a large pool sitting in the centre of the relatively undamaged room. The pool was filled with water that could only be described as 'Rank', as algae, dirt and moss floated atop its green surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this repulsed Link, who was no stranger to disgusting conditions, Zelda, on the other hand, clapped happily. <br>\r\n \"I fancy a swim!\" She declared, heading into the room.

Even the way the water felt was wrong, yet this did nothing to dissuade her from her actions. Straightening back up, she pulled her tunic off over her head. Dropping it onto a relatively clean looking tile, she pulled off her boots and pants, leaving her clad in her underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the water, Zelda shivered. It was partially due to the coldness of the liquid, and partially due to the sensation of water gently lapping against her skin. It felt so good, so... refreshing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Here we go!\"<br>\r\nDiving forwards, Zelda disappeared under the surface of the filth-covered liquid. She closed her eyes, allowing the water to refresh her entire body, before pushing upwards. Her head broke the surface, her blonde hair plastered to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiping hair from her eyes, she let out a long sigh. <br>\r\n \"Hylia, this feels so good!\" She said enthusiastically, rubbing algae over her skin. \"Why didn't I take up swimming sooner? If only I'd known about how it makes you feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Zelda swam back and forth in the pool. It was deep enough to allow her to swim freely, yet shallow enough to allow her to stand up when she needed a break. During one such break, she became aware of an odd sensation in her hands and feet. However, the refreshing water soon washed it away, and she thought no more of it. Had she looked down, she would've noticed webbing now extending between her fingers and toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Zelda stopped. Stretching her arms above her head, she swam for the edge, deftly pulling herself out of the dank water. Shaking water from her body, she didn't notice that the majority of the water was quickly absorbed by her skin, which had a faint shine to it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dressing herself, Zelda left the room, stopping only to give Link a quick tap. As the pair headed further down the corridor...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda slowly made her way down the corridor, following behind Link who cleared a path for her. Her walk was slow, not because of tiredness or anything like that, but because her feet didn't feel right inside her boots. They felt dry, while her toes felt oddly constricted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could see why was wrong with her feet, an explosion of blue light, followed by a long period of crumbling rocks, echoed throughout the corridor. Looking up, she saw Link peering through a hole he had just made with a bomb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarching to his side, Zelda have him a gentle punch on the shoulder, not hard enough to hurt the hardened knight, but enough to show her displeasure at his path-clearing methods. <br>\r\n \"Please try not to destroy the ruins!\" She chided him. \"It's difficult to research when your artefacts have been blown up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gave her an apologetic look before climbing through the hole. Zelda made to follow him, but stopped when she heard the familiar chattering of Bokoblins. She held back, listening as Link rushed in, yelling his signature battlecry. The Bokoblins screeched angrily for a few seconds, before silence fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuessing that it was safe, Zelda climbed through the hole. Crawling out the other side, she landed in a corridor that was much cleaner then the one she had just left. Dirt was still present, although it no longer caked every surface. And as far as she could see, no fallen pillars or rubble piles blocked the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow... You can almost see what was etched on this wall...\" Zelda commented, inspecting the wall next to her. \"It looks like writing... I can barely recognize the language... Zora, maybe? And this... This is definitely an arrow, pointing into here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering into the door next to her, Zelda's eyes lit up as she spotted another pool of water. This one was double the length of the other and the water in it was much clearer, although algae still floated across the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, she marched in. Link followed her in, making sure it was safe, before leaving again. He had no idea where her new desire for swimming and fish had come from, and he wasn't too concerned about it. He sat up against the wall, leaning his head back and closing his eyes. Hopefully Zelda didn't need him for a while...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, so cold! I love it!\"<br>\r\nZelda let out a happy squeal as she tested the water with her hand. The refreshing feeling returned, filling her with energy. Grabbing her top and pants, she threw them behind her and dove into the pool. She closed her eyes, allowing the water to fill her with more and more energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the surface, she took a deep breath. She giggled as she played with a patch of algae, unconcerned that it clung to her hands...</span></div></div>",

She had never been the most active person in Hyrule, but while she was in the water, her energy knew no bounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So refreshing!\" Zelda repeated for the umpteenth time, swimming another length of the pool. Her webbed feet helped propel her quickly through the water, the princess reaching speeds only a Zora could. And yet, she didn't realise this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she stopped. Treading water in the middle of the pond, Zelda sighed happily. <br>\r\n\"I wonder...\" She mused, looking down past her webbed feet to the bottom of the pool. \"How long can I hold my breath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity piqued, Zelda stopped treading water, allowing her body to sink deeper into the water. Before her head disappeared under the water, she took a deep breath, filling her lungs to capacity, and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sank for a few seconds before her feet met the bottom of the pool. She remained there for a good minute before her chest began to ache, demanding air. Somewhat reluctantly, she kicked upwards, her head quickly breaking the surface of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently...\" She gasped. \"Not that long...\"<br>\r\nTaking a few deep breaths, Zelda floated there for another few seconds. <br>\r\n\"But the only way I'll ever improve is through practice!\" She told herself. \"And what better place and time than now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another deep breath, Zelda sank to the bottom once again. This time, however, was slightly different. Her green eyes remained open and, as she sank, she felt her vision adjust slightly. Rather than the water making everything appear blurry, everything was crystal clear. She could see all four walls of the pool, all of which seemed to have some of inscription. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Curious...</i><br>\r\nKicking back to the surface, Zelda took a few breaths before diving again. Swimming over to the nearest wall, she ran her hand over it, her eyes narrowing as she mentally translated the writing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The writing is awfully faded... Test... Zora... Breath... Test of the Zora? But what about breath?</i><br>\r\nStepping away from the wall, Zelda took a deep breath, completely missing the fact that she was still under water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what the other walls say...\" She said, her voice muffled by the water. \"Suppose I should find out...\"<br>\r\nAs she swam towards another wall, she didn't realise that six narrow slits had appeared on her neck, three on either side, that were acting as gills for her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since the downfall of the Calamity Ganon, peace has been returned to Hyrule and its citizens have wasted little time in rebuilding the kingdom. It has been a stressful time for everyone, especially for Hyrule's princess, who has been at the forefront of the kingdom's reconstruction. Zelda felt she was long due for a break, afterall she would love to return to her studies on the ancient Sheikah technology, especially after learning of the new discoveries Link had made on his travels. Link's Sheikah Slate seemed to have so much application, Zelda wondered if Link had really discovered all it could be used for. So, in her first vacation in over 100 years, Zelda decided to spend some time in her room, tinkering around the mechanics of the device to find any hidden potential. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, just what I suspected,\" Zelda murmured to herself, tools deep into the inners of Link's Sheikah Slate, \"There seem to be a sorta lock chip. It's keeping the device from achieving it full capabilities. If I were to just ... deactivate.\" Suddenly, the device flash with energy and spontaneously lit up, she had successfully deactivated the chip and seemingly unleashed the full power of the device. \"This is great! This will definitely prove useful in solving the mysteries of the Sheikahs, I wonder what sort of applications are now available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooting up the device, Zelda was met with a new message, it stated, \"<i>New rune installed: Volume</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volume? What could that possibly mean? Did I just mess around with dangerous Sheikah technology just to add some sort of sound control feature to the slate?\" Booting it up, Zelda remained puzzled. In front of her laid a slider of some sort ranging from 200 percent to 1 percent and two buttons, one green and one red. Both buttons featured text that was unreadable to Zelda, as it was displayed in the langauge of the Sheikah. \"Wha-what is this? What does it mean by volume?\" Zelda began to play with the rune, setting the slider to 50 percent, \"Volume in what form? Sound? Light? Siz-\" With a press of the red button, a huge beam of light shot out from the slate and hit a lamp laying on Zelda's desk. What followed next, left Zelda in a state of shock, the lamp on her desk seemed to shrink before her eyes, until it reached half the size it once was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Did that really just happen</i>?\" Zelda couldn't help but doubt her own eyesight, did such technology really exist and does she really possess it? Picking up the miniature lamp, she could tell it was not only smaller but lighter too, like all the mass it once possessed had just vanished. \"This goes against all known laws of nature! Just how advance were these Sheikahs? Hey I wonder, if the red button shrinks things, does the green button...?\" With another toggle of the percent slider, and a press of the green button, the lamp begin to change once again, now growing back to its original size. \"Yes, it can grow stuff too! What a discovery! I'll have to test this feature out even more. If it works perfectly with inorganic matter, will it work the same with organics?\" She had to find out, so she gave the word to the guards stationed outside of her room to find and bring Link to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only a few minutes, Zelda's appointed Knight entered her room, kneeling in respect. However, this was no time for formality, now was the time for science. Zelda pulled Link quickly to his feet before handing him the slate. \"OK Link, short story, I discovered this new rune on the Sheikah Slate and I want you to test it on me, just mess with the slider and press either the green or red button. Surprise me, OK?\" Link was a bit surprised, but did what Zelda commanded him to do. He set the slider to just 25 percent off 100 and pressed one of the buttons. A huge beam of light came out of the slate and engulfed the princess. Link stood stunned as he watched Zelda change before his very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, what button did Link press?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda couldn't believe her eyes, the whole world around her was changing. Everything was growing, her bed, desk, books, and even Link. Just a minute ago she was a similar height to him, around 5'6\" compared to his 5'7\", only slightly shorter, but now she would be lucky if she even reached the five-foot mark. Except, she was still dwindling, and everything around her just kept growing more distant. The whole experience was extremely exciting, everything around her felt familiar, yet so foreign. She still couldn't believe all this was real, she thought that in any second now she would wake up from a dream and continue her day as normal with her normal height. Maybe at lunch she would tell Link about her dream and he would say, \". . . . .\" Oh yeah, nothing, nothing as usual. Yet, the tingling feeling around her body continues as she further shrank in size, even confirming the reality of her situation with a short, but painful pinch on her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was done shrinking she was staring Link directly into his lower chest. She had to crane her head far up to look him in the eyes. From the look on his face, she could tell that he was just as shocked and mesmerized by her shrinking as she was, perhaps even more, knowing that he had no idea what the rune did in the first place. Slowly, Zelda walked around her room trying to take in and understand her new size. Everything seemed bigger, not unnaturally big, but definitely made for someone bigger than herself. When she tried to pick up a nearby book off the floor, it was heavier than she expected and it easily fell out of her hands. Looking into her closet, she could tell that none of the clothes hanging up would fit her small self, and her knee-high boots would most likely come up to her mid-thigh now. It definitely made her thankful that the clothes she was currently wearing shrank with her as well, she didn't want to embarrass herself in front of Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Link, Zelda couldn't help but notice how different he has become too. Of course, he was bigger than Zelda was used to, but were those muscles of his always that big? And his face, it looked so... soft and smooth, in a way, somewhat feminine. And his big cute eyes along with his wavy hair seemed to glisten from the light coming in through the windows. Zelda was memorized, although Link was there time and time again for her and saved her from the evil that was Calamity Ganon, she had never felt as attracted to him as she did now. All the minor details in his body and complexity that she previously glossed over, seemed to be more prevalent to her than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to get a closer look, so she slowly approached her tall knight, and as she did she could feel herself trembling in excitement. It was like she was in a trance, no longer able to control herself as she stood mere feet away from Link and looked up and down his body at all the features he had to offer. Link stared down at her with wide eyes, the whole situation was turning really awkward for him, and his cheeks couldn't help but blush a bright red as Zelda continued to invade his personal space.  Suddenly, with lustful eyes, Zelda reached her hand out and began to feel Link's abs through his tunic, they were so toned and strong. \"So ... hot.\" Zelda couldn't help but murmur to herself, she had never been so turned on before like she was now, next to Link, feeling the warmth emanating off his body and feeling the finer curves and details of his muscles. Link's whole face was red now, he had never seen his princess so lustful before, especially towards him, it was all overwhelming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Zelda looked up and noticed the surprise on Link's face, which made her heart skip a beat. She didn't even realize what she was doing, it didn't even occur to her that she was intruding in Link's space or that she was making him uncomfortable. \"I'm so sorry!\" Zelda couldn't be more embarrassed; her face turned a deep red as she raised her hands to cover it. All this was too much for her, she had to escape, so she ran out of the room in a hurry, not even caring that she was still a runt compared to her old self. Link tried to stop her but was fruitless. He felt bad for her, in truth, he has had a crush on the princess for a while now, but just didn't know the right way to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only she was a little less shy,\" Link thought to himself, \"She would be a bit more open in sharing her feelings with me.\" Collecting his thoughts, Link decided it was best to find her before she made it too far, after all she a fraction off her original height, she could put herself in serious danger like that. So, Sheikah slate in tow, Link set out to find Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, where did she go?</span></div></div>",

Link's never going to forgive me. Oh... why do I have to be like this?\" Out of breath, Zelda stopped to gasp for air. Looking up, she could see that she had arrived at the castle's library. This was one of her favorite places to be, especially when she needed some alone time, and by Hylia now was one of those times. After she collected her thoughts and took in her surroundings though, Zelda was initially confused to find that the grand library seemed to be even more grand than before. It took her a minute to realize that she was still shrunk, and Link had the Sheikah slate now. \"I can't believe I forgot, and worse of it, Link has the only device capable of turning me back to normal. But, I can't possibly look him in the face right after that. I suppose I'm stuck like this for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the stairs, Zelda entered the main area of the library and began to look for something to read. Reading was always something that would calm her down, she could just get lost in a good book. She was quite limited in her selection, after all, there were a lot of books on higher shelves that she could no longer reach. Eventually however, Zelda found something that intrigued her interest, the book was titled, \"<i>The History of the Gerudo Race and People: Volume 1</i>\" The book was huge, over 600 pages long, and consequentially heavy, especially to the smaller Zelda. It was a struggle to lug the big book over to the one of the nearby tables, but the tiny princess managed. Sitting down in one of the seats though, Zelda was disheartened to find that her feet did not touch the floor and that she had a hard time looking over the table. This frustrated her but it was something she just had to deal with, she thought that once she started reading she would quickly forget about these minor inconveniences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere minutes Zelda was lost in the words of the book, in the hours she had been reading, she had learned a lot about the Gerudo, including their culture, architecture, trade, relationships, wars, and even the demographics of their people. Although she already knew the Gerudo were tall, with some members growing up to 8 to 9 feet tall, their stature seemed even more impressive compared to Zelda's current height. She imagined that she would be absolutely dwarfed by any Gerudo women her age. This began to make Zelda curious, she didn't even know her own height right now, as she didn't have time to measure herself before being distracted by Link's wonderful physique. Grabbing a bit of measuring tape and walking over to a nearby wall, Zelda made a little indention where the top of her head was parallel with the wall. Measuring the height of the mark, Zelda's petite stature became ever so known to the ponderous princess. \"Oh gosh, I'm not even 4'2\"!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was surprised yet began to grow curious once again. \"With other runes on the Sheikah slate they have some sort of timer before their effects dissipate,\" Zelda thought, \"Yet, the rune that shrank me hasn't worn off yet. Would it ever? Or does it require another use of the rune to return me to my proper size? Perhaps this rune just has a longer lasting effect that the others.\" With that thought, Zelda had decided. She was going to wait a day or two before returning to her normal size, after all, she had to, it was for science and research! Plus, she wouldn't have to approach Link right away, she was still embarrassed for what she did earlier, even after calming herself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zelda's wish wouldn't last for long as once she turned around she saw Link starring down at her from the 2nd story. Her heart sank, and she began to get nervous once again as her knight slowly approached her. She expected him to be mad at her still or at least disappointed or apathetic, but looking into his eyes, Zelda saw none of that. He just looked happy to see her, which made Zelda feel more relieved, perhaps Link had forgiven her from earlier. \"Look, Link, I'm sorry about earlier, I was just... I-I didn't know...\" Zelda couldn't find the right words, but Link just shook his head as if to indicate that he understood what she was trying to say and that it was in the past. Instead, Link handed her a sheet a paper. It was an invitation for Zelda from the Chief of the Gerudo, asking for an audience with the princess in order to strengthen the ties between Hyrule and the Gerudo people now that the war with evil was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put it simply, Zelda was excited, she hasn't visited Gerudo Town in over 100 years, and now she had the opportunity to see the true height of the Gerudo people in person. If she and Link left tomorrow for the desert, it would be around a five-day trip. She had to get her things ready, there was little time to lose. Zelda was about to hurry out of the library and back to her room, when she felt Link stop her by her shoulder. Turning around, she saw him trying to hand the Sheikah slate to her as if to imply if she wanted to grow back to normal. \"Oh well, you see, I was sort of thinking about staying this size for now. You know, I just want to see if the effects wear off through time or not.\" Link gave her a concerned look. \"Don't worry about me, I can take care of myself. I'm just doing this for knowledge. You hang on to the slate for now, OK?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be truthful, although Zelda was tempted to see if the shrinking effects did wear off eventually, she was more inclined to rough it out small if it meant she could look up at her knight more and more greatly appreciate his amazing features. After all, she could help but shake in excitement every time she entered his presence. His immense stature was just so overwhelming to the poor tiny princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Zelda successfully returned to her room and began to pack. Although a lot of her clothes wouldn't fit her stature now, she was sure that she could just shrink them down to fit her if needed. By the time her bags were packed, it was already late at night and Zelda was exhausted. She laid in her over-sized bed and stared towards the ceiling in peace. While the white night gown she put on didn't seem to fit her well at all and draped below her feet, Zelda didn't seem to care. She was beginning to feel as if shrinking wasn't such of a hindrance and was also excited to see what adventures would hold for her tomorrow. \"A five-day journey with just Link and I... that'll be fun... just me and Link... ah... Link.\" In no time at all, Zelda was fast asleep, tossing and turning about in her roomy nightgown and huge bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will tomorrow hold in store for Zelda?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the next morning and Link was waiting for Zelda by the castle's stables. He had already prepared a horse for their journey, he figured that he could just share a horse with Zelda, due to her still being child sized. However, Link was growing impatient, it was already 25 minutes past their agreed upon meeting time and Zelda was nowhere to be found. Link was just about to give up waiting and go look for her before he noticed someone approaching from the distance. It was the tardy Zelda, struggling to walk as she lugged a bag nearly half her size. Panting, Zelda began, \"Sorry I'm late, I got caught up on the stairs and this bag seems really heavy for some reason.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was a little annoyed, but looking down at the tiny princess, he knew he couldn't stay mad at her. She was so cute at that size after all and seeing her struggle to carry her bag just made him feel bad for her, like a helpless kitten struggling to stand up and walk. It made Link think for a moment, it would probably be infinitely easier if he were to just shrink the princess down even more and just carry her around in his pocket. Seeing her current display of strength, there probably wouldn't be anything she could do to stop him if he were to try. Besides, if she was cute at four foot, she would probably be absolutely adorable at the size of his palm. The whole idea was tempting, but Link knew better than to do things out of Zelda's will, he wouldn't here the end of it if he were to upset her. She would probably squeak at him in rage for the whole five-day journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttaching Zelda's luggage to the side of the horse, the two of them were officially ready to head out. Overall, it was good that they were packing light, it would probably be best for both of them as to not draw any outside attention to themselves by announcing their voyage to the whole kingdom. Even though Ganon is gone, monsters still roam in the far reaches of the kingdom, some which would like nothing more than to get their hands on the precious princess of Hyrule. To put it simply, the less they make known of their travels the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Link had no problem hopping onto the horse, Zelda was another story. No matter how many times she tried to jump aboard, she couldn't get a grip on the large horse. When Link offered a helping hand, Zelda seemed embarrassed to accept, knowing that she rode horses all her life and never had this issue before. Reluctantly though, she accepted his gesture and climbed upon. \"You know, if you just gave me another minute, I'm sure I could have got on myself.\" Link somehow doubted this statement as he patted Zelda on the head in pity. In response, Zelda hugged onto Link's waist with greater force than before, and dug her face into Link's back as if to hide the fact that her whole face has turned red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flick of the reins and a hearty gallop, the two of them began their journey to one of the most desolate and isolated parts of the kingdom. The first day of their trip was nothing special, just hours and hours on end of fields and hills as they made their way across the great plains of Hyrule Field. Occasionally, they would pass by other travelers heading the opposite way down the same road, however none seemed to recognize the princess, perhaps this was because of her smaller size, or that they just weren't really looking. While Link found no problem in finding comfort while they rode, Zelda was always worried that she would just fly off at every bump in the road and thus held on to Link for dear life. She wasn't exactly use to the fact she was much lighter than she used to be, anything or anyone could probably push her around with no effort on their part. On the other hand, Zelda was enjoying the fact that she got to be so close to Link, throughout the whole ride she could feel the warmth emanating off his body and smell his unique but pleasant scent. It definitely helped her relax over the long ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the sun was beginning to set and the two of them agreed to call it a day. They found a good, secluded place to camp between the trees of lower Hyrule Field. While a stable would have been the ideal place to stop for the night, the next one wouldn't come for another few miles, and at that point it would already be dark. They decided to split up the work, while Link would set up a tent, Zelda would go around a collect firewood. It seemed like a simple task, but her size had come to her disadvantage yet again. She could only pick up a few good-sized branches before she would have to return to the campsite. At her whole height, it wouldn't have taken her more than 15 minutes to prepare all the firewood, but with her smaller hands it was looking to take around double that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her last trip out, Zelda had to travel a bit farther into the woods to find anymore sticks, outside of Link's vision. It was then, as she was picking up her final stick, that she seemed to see something move about in the shadows. Zelda began to grow scared, whatever it was, it was fast and definitely bigger than she was. And worse of all, it seemed to be getting closer! It weaved from tree to tree, back and forth as it eventually made its way to the tiny princess. Zelda was not having any of it, she dropped her cargo and ran as fast as her little legs could take her. Turning her head to look, she couldn't really make out whatever was chasing her, it was too dark, but she saw that whatever it was it was picking up its pace. Thoughts flew in and out of Zelda's head as she ran, \"Could it be a Bokoblin? Or worse, a Moblin? A Lizalfos even? What would happen to me if it caught me? I-I... this is too much!\" It was when she could begin to see Link and the campsite in the distance that she began to hear the crunching of leaves behind her, as if the beast chasing her was just mere feet away. Zelda didn't have time to look, she just ran, too scared and out of breath to even let out a scream for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Zelda made it back to the campsite and instantly clung onto Link. Exasperated, Zelda made out a few words, \"Help... something... chasing... me.\" Link's face grew serious as he readied a battling stance and drew his Master Sword. Coming from the direction Zelda came from, Link could see the bushes rattle and the trees shake as a shadowy figure grew ever closer. Suddenly it leaped from the bushes and onto the campsite where its true identity was revealed. It was no monster; it was just a deer. Zelda seemed to have of wandered into its territory and the deer, thinking she was a threat, just wanted to scare her off. After getting a quick look at Link though as he slowly approached, the deer grew frightened itself and ran back into the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda fell to the ground, exhausted, both physically and mentally. It took nearly all of her energy to run from the deer and it left her limbs weak and her body tired. She was still gasping for air, despite not running for that long of a distance in reality, it seemed much further to her shrunken self. Link crouched down to try and comfort her and lift her to her feet. Since Link had already finished setting up the tent, the two of them went together to get the rest of the firewood and light the fire. The creamy meat soup Link cooked up for both of them was absolutely delectable. It turns out Link is actually a great cook, which Zelda never realized, perhaps he gained this skill during his adventures to save her from Calamity Ganon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of it though, both Link and Zelda were exhausted from their long day and ready for sleep with their full stomachs. While Zelda slept in the tent, Link opted to sleep out under the stars to watch guard, in case something tried to attack them during the night. In mere minutes however, they were fast asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next for Link and Zelda?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The time was approximately 3:43 A.M. Zelda tossed and turned around the floor of the tent, attempting to get comfortable. Over an hour earlier she was awakened by the cry of an owl and she hadn't been able to fall asleep since. The tent wasn't exactly the most comfortable and she had a lot of things on her mind. At this point, she was beginning to give up on the idea of falling back to sleep, it just didn't look like her body wanted her to. Zelda thought to herself, \"Perhaps I should just go sit outside and enjoy the nightly air.\" So, Zelda got up from her position, put her small boots on, and walked outside of the tent. Looking around, she could see Link in a deep sleep a few feet away from the tent as well as the last little sparks of flames emanating from the ash of the campfire. Outside of the opening where they set up camp, which was illuminated by the moonlight, she couldn't see anything else beyond the trees besides the occasional flicker of a sunset firefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, Zelda felt the cool air flow over her skin which she found very relaxing. Still, she didn't think of sleep as a option anymore, she might just as well wait till Link wakes up in a few hours so they may continue on their voyage. Yet, Zelda thought, there must be something she could do while she waited. Usually, when Zelda was up this late at night, she was busy tinkering with some sort of piece of technology or ancient artifact. \"Too bad there was nothing like that around her,\" Zelda thought, \"Oh! But there is, the Sheikah slate!\" Zelda looked over by Link to find a pile of his stuff at his side, including his Master Sword, shield, bow, and even Sheikah slate. \"This great, I can further test the capabilities of the device and its new rune.\" Scooting over to where Link was sleeping, Zelda carefully and quietly reached her hand out to grab the slate. Luckily for her, she was a master of stealth, and only made several loud clanging sounds as she accidentally bumped the Sheikah slate on Link's sword and shield. Even more luckily for her, Link was an incredibly heavy sleeper. Probably not the best person to keep guard at night, to be perfectly honest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly scurrying to the opposite side of the campfire as Link, Zelda booted up the slate only to be greeted by a loud boot up sound. She couldn't help but cringe, she never realized how much noise the device made, but thankfully Link was still asleep. \"If only there was a way to control this darn thing's volume.\" In that moment, Zelda noticed a button in the corner of the new volume rune that she hadn't seen before. It was symbolized by a music note icon and with a click it brought up a separate slider from the size related one. It was volume controls! \"I can't believe it; I was right all along!\" Zelda felt proud for predicting the rune's function but was still happy that it wasn't the only thing it had to offer. She quickly turned the volume to zero percent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, without the risk to make a bunch of noise, Zelda was free to play around with the device. The first thing she was tempted to do was to play around more with the shrink feature, after all, she hadn't fully tested its capabilities on organic life. Was there a limit to how much it could shrink living, breathing cells? Of course, not wanting to test the feature on the peacefully sleeping Link, Zelda decided she would be her own guinea pig. According to her calculations, Link only shrank her to 75 percent of her original height, from 5'6\" to 4'1.5\". The next logical step would to go down to 50 percent now, so Zelda set the slider accordingly, turned the device toward her, and pressed the red button without much hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she could feel the same tingling feeling she felt before the first time she shrank, and everything began to grow around her as well. She could see the trees grow taller, the tent grows bigger, and the campfire and Link grow farther and farther away as Zelda shrank into the spot she was sitting on. Even the slate that was laying in her lap seemed to slowly grow bigger and heavier every passing moment. Zelda couldn't be more excited, the world looked so foreign at three fourths her original height, what would it look like now that she was only half height? Time seemed to slow down as she was memorized by the shrinking process. Slowly she could feel herself drop below four feet, then three and a half, and even three feet flat. By the time Zelda was done shrinking, she estimated to only be a puny 2'9\". \"Wow,\" Zelda thought to herself, \"I haven't been this height since I was a toddler, it feels so weird.\" The Sheikah slate which laid on her lap was now doubled the size it once was to her. Where it used to be 10 inches long to her, it was now 20 and it spread over both sides of her lap as if she was wedged under some sort of table or kotatsu. Carefully, she picked it up and placed it safely on the grass before rising to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around she couldn't help but notice everything felt weird and comically large. Zelda had now entered the world of giants, anyone, even children, could probably tower over her. This made Zelda feel a little nervous, she didn't think she could live being so small, everything and everyone would probably intimidate her. Maybe everyone except Link. Walking over to where he laid and looking down at him, she could really feel how big he was compared to her now. Still, it didn't really frighten her at all, Link was someone she trusted her life with, and she knew that he wouldn't do anything to hurt her, not even she was bug sized. In that moment, it really made her appreciate all he had done for her up to that point. He had done countless selfless acts and gotten himself in so many dangerous situations in the past just to make sure she was okay, and more often than not, she took it for granted. Overall, she just began to feel even more attracted to her loyal knight like she had never felt in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, not only was Zelda admiring Link's character but his body as well. Now that she was even smaller, the finer details of Link's build became ever clearer to her. She could see every little curve in his muscles, the fine hairs on his smooth and nearly flawless skin, and even the cute complexities of his face. The way his chest moved rhythmically up and down with every breath made Zelda imagining curling up and falling asleep like a kitten in its owner's lap. While the idea was extremely tempting to her, Zelda didn't want to reveal to Link that she shrunk herself even more or disrupt him from his sleep, after all, he looked so much at peace. Zelda could just get lost for hours looking up and down the sleeping giant that was her knight, escort, friend, and, dare to say, crush. She imagined that if he were to stand up in front on her, she would only come up to his waist at this height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, Zelda managed to leave her trance as she noticed the first daylight emerge from the sky. It seems that she did indeed ogle at Link all night, so, not wanting to be this size once he waked up, Zelda walked over to where she left the Sheikah slate and began to play around with the settings of the volume rune. With a press of the green button this time, Zelda returned to her, not exactly old, old height of 4'1.5\". Seeing the world shrink for a while was a new feeling for her, and it made her seem taller than she actual was, especially considering how she was just adjusting to be half her original height. Maybe she would have less trouble managing with this size now that she was more used to being even smaller, but she would have to see to find the truth in that statement for later. Right now, she returned the Sheikah slate to where she had found it and reentered her tent to wait for Link's awakening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half am hour later, Link finally began to get up which prompted Zelda to leave the tent and greet him. He seemed really happy to see her that morning, based on the relaxed look on his face. \"Perhaps he had a good dream about me last night, that must have been nice,\" Zelda imagined. Awake and alive, the two of them began to pack their belongings and set out for the day ahead of them. Zelda made sure to use the Sheikah slate one last time to shrink herself a fresh pair of clothes from her luggage. Meanwhile, Link double checked he grabbed all of his gear while humming a pleasant, but adventurous tune to himself. Once both of them were ready, they mounted their horse and set off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen on the second day of their journey?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun was almost about to set as Link and Zelda crossed over Digdogg suspension bridge and entered the Gerudo canyon pass. The second day of their journey was revealed to be uneventful and the two of them were nearly ready to set up camp and call it a night. Zelda was already falling asleep against Link's back as her lack of sleep the previous night came to bite her in the butt. Link was just about ready to pull over to the side and set up camp when he began to get a weird feeling. It was like they were being watched. Link started to put up his guard as he looked above at the tops of the canyon. Nothing at first glance, and while there was always a chance he was wrong, he had never doubted his intuition in the past. So, Link ordered his horse to a stop and dismounted. This caused Zelda to wake up, \"Huh? Is something the matter *<i>yawn</i>* Link?\" With a quick serious glance, Zelda understood what was up and joined Link at his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was quiet, too quiet. Link was on edge; the darkening sky hindered his vision of the more secluded areas of the canyon. Still, he didn't see any sort of threat. Perhaps his intuition was wrong? Maybe it was just something he ate earlier that was messing with his gut? No, Link felt fine, something was definitely amidst. Suddenly, Link felt the ground rumble and explode under him. An arm emerged and grabbed him violently by the leg. Link was not expecting it and tumbled to the ground. Zelda tried to run back to the horse but was met with two more figures emerging from the ground in front of her. It was two Bokoblins, a red and blue one, not only have they surrounded her, but they towered over her short stature. It didn't take much for one of them, the blue one, to overpower and grab her, throwing her over its shoulder. She tried to struggle, slamming her fists onto the Bokoblins's back, but it didn't do much damage, and the monster kept its grip on her. She yelled for Link's help, but he was in the middle of his own predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bokoblin that grabbed him by the leg wouldn't let go, it remained his grip as it slowly emerged from the ground. Meanwhile, while Link was not looking, another couple of Bokoblins came from behind one of the walls of the canyon and grabbed Link by both his arms. Link was pinned to the ground, he struggled to release his limbs, but the monsters wouldn't let go. She could witness Zelda being grabbed by another couple of Bokoblins, but Link was powerless to do anything. As his anger grew, Link managed to release his right arm from the hands on the Bokoblin. Link was beginning to gain some hope they could recover from this situation, when he looked to his other side and saw a huge Moblin approaching him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to think, the huge beast raised its giant club and slammed it with with immense force into Link's chest. Blood spewed out of Link's mouth as he withdrew in pain. Zelda, who managed to witness the event, cried in agony, \"Link! No! Please hang in there!\" His strength beginning to fail him, the arm he just managed to release from the Bokoblin was grabbed once again. The three lesser monsters began to stretch Link's body like a large quilt, causing greater pain to his limbs and chest. Before he could even scream in pain however, the Moblin slammed the club upon his chest yet again. By this point, Link's consciousness began to fade, but the great beast did not stop, he kept on hitting Link over and over again into the dirt with his huge weapon. \"No! Stop it! Please!\" Zelda was in tears at this point. After the seventh hit, Link was officially unconscious. \"Linkkk!\" Zelda did all she could to try to escape the Bokoblins's grasp and run to Link side, but her efforts were fruitless as the other, red Bokoblin came to tie her up and silence her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere minutes, the group of monsters, who had hidden themselves by burying themselves in small holes under the ground, had successfully defeated the great Hero of the Wild and captured the tiny princess. As the sun finally began to set beneath the canyon walls, Link laid there, motionless, in a puddle of his own blood. Great wounds were present on his chest where the Moblin struck him with its club. While he was still breathing, his breaths were slow and weak. Slowly, a figure cloaked in red and black approached the fallen Link. It was a member of the Yiga Clan, although, unlike other foot soldiers Link encountered on his journey, this was shorter in stature and appeared weaker in physical strength. He was like a twig. Crouching down to where Link laid, he laughed in triumph, \"I can't believe that you feel so easily champion. My colleagues back at the hideout always acted as if you were so high and mighty, the most powerful being in the kingdom. But look at you now, defeated by the clan's newbie, the great and amazing, Volgu! My monsters made so short work of you, it's a shame really, it doesn't make for much of a story. Kind of an anticlimactic ending to the great hero. Well, whatever, once I'm done with that princess of yours, I'll return to my hideout and be exalted as the true leader of the Yiga. No one will make fun of Volgu anymore, if they want to keep their head that is!\" Without much hesitation, Volgu violently slammed his foot on Link's chest before beginning to walk to where his monsters brought Zelda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final blow, Link had lost his last heart, and without any fairies, it didn't look good for the Hero of the Wild. However, in what could only be called a miracle, light broke the night's darkness and beamed down on the fallen body of Link. The spirit of Mipha, the Zora guardian of 100 years ago, emerged from the sky and hovered over Link. With her power of healing, she began to fix the wounds on Link's body until Link began to gain consciousness again. Once Link was fully recovered, Mipha gave Link a few words of encouragement before disappearing back into the Heavens. \"Now is not the time to rest, you must save the princess. Go Link, hurry!\" Link spent no time dilly dallying; he grabbed his gear and began to search for clues as to where the monsters took Zelda. What he found were footprints, footprints not of a monster but of someone human. They couldn't have been Zelda's either, they were too big for her shrunken self. Link knew that whoever left them, however, was probably where Zelda was. No time to lose, Link followed the footprints in a sprint, he had to save Zelda before something terrible happened to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

So the princess decided to play it safe and stay put where she stood, towering above her father and subjects and what was left of her castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda watched carefully at the scene that unfolded below her. It was hard to make out the ant-sized people from her viewpoint, but it seemed that her father the King was ordering some people around. Zelda couldn't hear what they were saying, but from the way everyone scattered about frantically, she knew they must have some kind of plan in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious as to what was being said, Zelda bent over quickly to try and see if she could hear them if she were closer. But the force from her sudden, giant movement kicked up some powerful gusts of wind that nearly blew over her loyal subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry!\" Zelda apologized absentmindedly. The tiny people below dropped to their knees and covered their ears. Zelda gasped softly, now understanding that her voice alone was enough to hurt people if she didn't keep her volume in check. She tried to apologize again, but thought better of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her accidentally caused pain, Zelda was now able to hear the ant-sized people more clearly. She thought she heard a tiny voice, it was still almost too soft for her to hear, but this person seemed to be shouting louder than the rest. Zelda had to focus to make out the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda!\" She heard the voice call her, and recognized it as her father. Zelda looked at the king, who she could see was glad to be heard by her. He continued, \"Zelda, my daughter! I've summoned the court mage to help you! His powerful magic should be enough to shrink you down a little bit. I'm sorry we can't return you to normal yet, as we still need your help to destroy Ganon and his minions, but once you're down to a more reasonable size we can talk further! Nod if you understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda understood, she just wished she could be normal again now, but she knew that defeating Ganon should come first as they never knew when she'd be this big and powerful again.<br>\r\nZelda nodded her understanding to her father. But as she did, her giant locks of hair brushed down and ran over the ground, giving everyone more than a face-full of her giant hair. Zelda quickly shot back up when she realized what she just did, and stood embarrassed before everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was standing tall, very tall, over the remains of her castle, Zelda couldn't hear her father or anyone else anymore. She could do nothing but wait and see it the castle's resident magician's magic worked. She watched as one of the tiny people below her seemed to start to chanting a spell, the court mage she assumed.<br>\r\nMoments later, a ball of magic energy that was rather large started to form, it then flew forward into princess Zelda's body and burst into magic sparks.

So Zelda sat down on an open field in Hyrule, making sure there wasn't any little people or animals below her before doing so, and took a break from her ravenous doings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so powerful! But so hungry too!\" Zelda said, rubbing her large stomach. \"I can barely think straight... why does it have to be this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda continued to sit, she thought about how she got into this mess in the first place. All she wanted was to destory that monster Ganon, but the Triforce had twisted her wish and turned her into this! Zelda was hesitant to call herself a monster but she couldn't deny the changes to her body, she was monster-sized and apparently eternally hungry. Zelda didn't want to live her whole life like this, she couldn't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" Zelda asked herself.</span></div></div>",

I don't want any of you getting hurt!\" She cried down to the crowd as they got the message and scattered as the two giants wrestled the Gleeok for a while seemed to be gaining the upper hand as it had the princess entangled but then she remembered the spare magical bow in her pocket that fired magical bolts of energy quickly pulling it out luckily it grew with her she fired a few bolts at the monster's midsection and in a flash the Gleeok vanished in a puff of smoke once the townspeople saw what happened they began cheering for their giantess princess who took a bow \"Thank you all my loyal subjects and I greatly apologize for all the damage I have done to your town now if you excuse me I have a evil wizard and his army to crush...\" As she began walking slowly towards Ganon's underworld the evil boar was throwing himself and his minions a lavish party \"Ahhh success my minions with all of Hyrule under my control,the giant princess now a outcast from her own people and Link still nowhere around to stop me the Triforce of Wisdom is within my grasp at long last!\" As all of a sudden there was a massive cave in and the Moblins,Stalfos,Zoras and other classic Zelda I monsters fled once they saw the huge hand slowly reaching into the dungeon Ganon shrieked and tried to fire a few of his own magical bolts but they did little damage to Zelda as her current size shielded her from magical assults \"Ahhh let go of me you oversized pampered brat!\" He screamed as she held him in her palm with a smirk \"So you think I fled into hiding did you pig boy? I'm taking back the Triforce of Power Ganon so basically your reign of terror is at a end...\" \"No wait the Triforce is mine!! You can't have it...I'll do anything Princess Zelda just let me go....\" But she started to squeeze him tightly he squealed like the boar he was trying to break her grip \"Like what? What could you possibly offer me in return?\" \"By shrinking you back to normal....\" Ganon cried out faintly as he was losing oxygen \"Huh? Shrink me back...you can do that?\" As she loosened her grip a bit \"Of course I'm a very powerful wizard princess.....\" She thought about this for a while \"Okay you can do it but on one condition you don't attack the upper world for a entire year ,no trick no schemes or monsters for a whole year you do that or else I'll have porkchops for dinner.....\" As she opened her mouth wide dangling the squirming wizard before her massive choppers he screamed fearfully \"Okay,okay I can tell you're serious about this! I'll lay off future attacks until the start of next year...\" \"No you will lay off until the fall or winter of next year!\" Zelda insisted as she prepared to drop him straight down her throat into her waiting stomach \"Fine whatever you want! I'll do it just let me go!\" He was truly terrified now that his power had no effect on her she set him down and he raised his hands and muttered a spell at once Zelda felt herself shrinking back to regular size \"Oh good I'm back to normal!\" She cried happily once he recovered from his shock Ganon was prepared to go back on his word \"Yes you're back to normal princess but now that I got you in my grasp...\" But folding her arms she muttered \"Don't even think about it Ganon you forget we still got the Triforce of Wisdom and I could always use it to grow big again! Could you imagine if I was over 100 feet tall what damage I could do to your underworld?\" \"You'd just as likely destroy your kingdom than attack me in my domain but though it pains me to do so I'll keep my word princess I won't attack your kingdom for a entire year villain's code of honor...\" As they shook on it and she later exited the underworld once back in the destroyed town of Hyrule already she saw the reconstruction going underway \"Well despite the horrible day I just had at least one good thing out of it occurred....\" She muttered to herself as she walked back to the palace also slowly being rebuilt brick by brick \"Link wasn't around to witness my moment of gigantism *giggle*\" </span></div></div>",

The triforce said nothing. Zelda was about to say something when she noticed that she was still shrinking. Smaller and smaller she got until she was barely the size of an ant! \"Great, now what?\" She asked. The room was so huge and everything in it was bigger than the miniscule princess. At least her clothes had shrunk with her, one thing positive about this situation. She knew she would have to get someone to help her, but would they even see her at her tiny size?

She now cursed her size once again, as she knew that it would take her a long time to get anywhere like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sighed and started her journey across her castle. She played it safe, hanging next to the walls, in case anyone came by she'd at least not be stepped on, she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of walking, Zelda heard loud footsteps coming from behind. She looked and saw that it was one of the many maids of the castle. This was the first time Zelda had seen another human being from her reduced perspective, it was a strange sight to be sure as this woman appeared to be a regular giantess from her point of view. Zelda shook her head, she needed to get this giantess's attention somehow. So she ran out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Down here!\" Zelda shouted at the top of her lungs, while jumping up and down and waving her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the maid just walked on by, showing no reaction to the tiny, shrunken princess below. Zelda could only watch as the giantess got further away, she hung her head in defeat, and kept walking along the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe nobody is helping me! I'm the princess for crying out loud!\" Zelda complained. \"Am I really so small no one can see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's path through the castle continued slowly, a few more people came by, and the princess tried to get their attention, but each time to no avail. Eventually Zelda made it to a room, the kitchen. She peered her head in to see, and saw that Link was there! He was sitting on next to a table enjoying his lunch. Zelda's eyes lit up, as she finally found one person she was sure could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking Link would help her for sure, Zelda ran into the now huge kitchen towards her hero.

She thought he was talking to himself. Then, she heard a softer, feminine voice respond to his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, Link! You're going to have to try harder than that to get Zelda's love!\" There was no mistaking that voice, Zelda was sure that it was Spryte talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up there to be sure, Zelda couldn't see Spryte from her point of view, the fairy must have been on the table. Zelda hadn't expected to see her with Link, but she wondered if this was in her favor? Since Spryte was so small already, Zelda figured she'd have a better chance of being seen by the fairy. She just wished that she could get Spryte's attention, thinking that that would make things much easier for her. But with her down on the floor, and Spryte all the way up on the table, there was little chance of that happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda shrugged and kept on walking to Link. She thought that climbing him was her only option at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why not just forget about her and come with me?\" Zelda overheard Spryte ask. Zelda cringed, how could she forget about the fairy princess's crush on Link? She wondered if that might make getting Spryte's attention not such a good idea. The fairy princess might just crush her to get her out of the way between Link and herself. Zelda gulped at the thought. Spryte wouldn't do that, would she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no thanks. Zelda's the one for me!\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Zelda smile. But then, something huge fell down next to her. The shrunken princess shrieked and jumped back out of fright. She noticed that it was... a huge meatball?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uup, Whoops!\" Link exclaimed as he suddenly reached down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it!\" Spryte chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda shot up at hearing this, she looked up and saw Spryte, and the fairy was flying down to her, or rather, to the food to pick it up for Link.

Zelda thought she must look as small to Spryte as Spryte did to her at her normal size. The fairy swooped down and grabbed Zelda, who screamed at this invasion of space.

She opened her hand and allowed Zelda to lay in her palm. \"Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you. Now-\" Zelda was cut off by a huge finger poking at her. \"Ah!\" She squeaked, and tried to push the invading finger away, but it was no use, Spryte was too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so small!\" Spryte said happily, almost squealing with delight, as she continued to poke and prod the shrunken princess Zelda. \"I never thought I'd find someone smaller than myself! And to have it be you, no less!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte smiled as she continued to play with the shrunken princess. But then she remembered something, and stopped her finger assault on Zelda. \"But wait...\" Spryte started. \"Didn't you go to the Triforce to shrink Link or Ganon, or something?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I've been trying to tell you!\" Zelda shouted. \"I went to the Triforce to shrink them, but it shrunk me instead! It said making me this small was a lesson, and not to rely on magic so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte burst out laughing upon hearing Zelda's sad story, much to the shrunken princess's displeasure. Zelda stood up and put her hands on her hips to show Spryte she didn't appreciate the way the fairy was treating her. Spryte saw this and laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spryte!\" Zelda cried. \"You need to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha..!

Spryte's action were beginning to get suspect, and she started to wonder if her earlier apprehension was not completely unfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a louder voice came from above the two. \"Hey, Spryte, what are you doing down there?\" It was Link who asked the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked up to see her hero looking down at her, or at Spryte rather, since she figured she must be too small to be seen from his point of view.

With a snap of her fingers, she said, \"That's a good idea! I know just how to take care of you!\" She smiled at the tinier Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spryte...\" Zelda said with trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte smiled at the little passenger on her hand again, and then closed her hand. Zelda tried to protest, but her cries were muffled by the walls of flesh that now surrounded her. Spryte ignored her and then used her other hand to open the top of her pink dress, then she raised the hand with Zelda in it over her cleavage and dropped the tiny princess in. Spryte watched with glee as Zelda screamed as she fell, once Zelda was safely tucked in between her breasts, Spryte patted her dress shut and smiled, content with where Zelda was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spryte!\" Zelda screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyrulean princess was now completely irate with her fairy servant, and was already thinking of ways to punish her for her disobedience. Those thoughts were only backdrops to the main thing on her mind, getting out of Spryte's cleavage. She struggled and tried to move, but it was no use. When Zelda had fallen into Spryte's dress, she had fallen straight down, and as a result, her legs and most of her lower body had gotten wedged between the huge, fleshy mounds that surrounded her. Zelda was effectively stuck until Spryte decided to remove her from her prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Spryte had flown back up to the table. She had given Link his precious meatball and was finishing up her own meal. As she ate, she enjoyed the squirms of her tiny passenger. She was thankful that she was so small, and that Zelda was even smaller, since it made hiding Zelda all the more easier to do, the whole time her and Link ate at the table he never suspected a thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte smiled at this \"victory\" over Zelda. She thought about how after fighting with Zelda over Link for so long, she now had her rival right where she wanted her. She beamed inwardly at all the things they'd do together, and, with Zelda out of the picture, Link was hers for the taking. Spryte sat back and relaxed, this day had turned out pretty nice.</span></div></div>",

Looking up at Spryte's looming face, Zelda could see the fairy was looking rather uncomfortable, she must've felt Zelda escaping. The Hyrulean princess smiled at this, she wasn't worried that Spryte would make any immediate moves against her, not with Link looking on, it seemed Spryte was just trying to ignore her for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her chance, Zelda clambered across Spryte's breasts to the side of the fairy's dress. She looked down, the drop to the surface of the table was far by her point of view, but not enough to seriously injure her, she hoped. Taking a deep breath, Zelda braced herself and jumped down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Spryte was getting more and more nervous, having not only felt Zelda escape, but also jump off of her. The fairy princess couldn't help but glance down to take a look, and sure enough she saw Zelda's bug-sized body running away, just inches from herself. Spryte was starting to sweat, she needed to get that unruly princess back, and fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Now what is it?\" Link asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nothing!\" Spryte quickly replied, eyeing Zelda's tiny form running away from her and to the giant. \"I just dropped something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte ran over to Zelda and tried to pick her up, but Zelda was too fast, and she missed! Spryte growled at Zelda and tried again, this time successfully getting her prey. She smiled wickedly as she brought the squirming woman up to her face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever try anything like that ever agai- Ow!\" Spryte squeaked in pain as Zelda bit the fairy's hand, interrupting her threats and causing her to drop the shrunken princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zelda hit the floor she took off running as fast as she could towards Link, she waved her arms high to try and get his attention, but it didn't seem to be working. Zelda could quickly see why, from the way he was looking Link seemed to be too preoccupied with Spryte. Zelda groaned, her plan to get away from the fairy had the unforeseen consequence of also getting Link's attention, but not in the way she intended!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spryte, what's wrong? Did you hurt yourself?\" Link asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... it's n-nothing...! Don't worry about it!\" Spryte stammered, rubbing her bitten hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who were you talking to?\" Link asked wryly. \"Were you talking to yourself?\" He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I was...\" Spryte said, barely paying much mind to Link, right now she was focused on getting Zelda back in her clutches. She eyed the ant-sized form of the princess, running along the table again, the tiny woman was almost at Link by this point, and Spryte knew she had to act fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long for the fairy to catch up to the much smaller woman. She reached down and tried to grab Zelda, but the shrunken princess jumped over her hand. Spryte was getting mad at her now, Zelda was too close to Link for her liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast!\" Spryte said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny fairy reached out and grabbed Zelda's tinier form off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Noo!\" Zelda cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda tried in vain the reach out for Link from Spryte's hand, but the fairy was too strong, and Zelda was pulled away from her hero and back to the clutches of the cruel Spryte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay still!\" Spryte shouted at her captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was too scared to do anything else, so she complied. Spryte grinned and stuffed Zelda back into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spryte? What are you doing?\" Link asked, oblivious as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte looked up at him, but says nothing. Instead, she just flies off, out of the window of the kitchen. Leaving Link to wonder what her problem was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in the air and away from prying eyes Spryte checked on her tiny prisoner. The shrunken princess Zelda was staying in her cleavage quite nicely, although she cured Spryte for doing this her, the fairy ignored her complaints and flew off again, giving her chest a pat before going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute Spryte reached her destination, princess Zelda's room. She flew up slowly to the window of the room to peek in and, when she saw it was empty, she flew into the room itself. Spryte landed on Zelda's bed, where she took the shrunken princess out. She again enjoyed the power she had over the formerly most powerful woman in Hyrule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your room, Princess!\" Spryte said mockingly. \"Didn't I say I'd take good care of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have I done to deserve this!?\" Zelda shouted through sobs, which made Spryte notice Zelda was crying. \"Why are you doing this to me, Spryte!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte looked down at the ant-sized woman sobbing in her hand. She sort of felt bad for making the princess cry, but...</span></div></div>",

Link would possibly treat me even worse than you! And my father.....no telling how he would react! Can't you just use your magic and...ohh what am I saying...your magic isn't strong enough...\" The faerie princess huffed as she buzzed around the shrunken princess' room like a fly while Zelda stood on her own dresser barely taller than her hairbrush! \"Excuse me but I just so happen to be very powerful in ways of magic princess faerie magic may not be as strong as something like the Triforce or Ganon's own but in a flash I can grow you back to your grumpy ole self!\" The princess screamed jumping up and down \"Then what are you waiting for Spryte? All this time you spent playing around with me! Come on turn me back already!\" The faerie huffed and grumbled to herself \"Humph it was just a bit of fun...sheesh can't you take a joke....hang on.....\" She thought to herself quietly(\"Why should I turn her back to normal when she would as usual lord over me and other tiny creatures? We faeries have spent all our lives fearful of things bigger than us....maybe it's time for me to even the odds just this once.....what harm could it do?\") \"Spryte,Spryte are you alright,aren't you going to turn me back to normal or not?\" A impatient Zelda cried not knowing that silently smirking to herself the faerie prepared to cast her </span></div></div>",

Zelda sighed in relief, thinking she was finally going to grow back to her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Spryte. I.. I..\" Zelda stammered when she saw that Spryte's magic was not effecting her at all, instead it was the fairy princess who the magic glowed around. \"Spryte..?\" Zelda asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, princess. I think it's about time Hyrule got a new ruler!\" Spryte told the shrunken princess below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gasped at Spryte's betrayal. She then got worried when she thought about what Spryte meant by a \"new ruler\" and was afraid of what Spryte's magic could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Spryte's magic started to kick in and it made her start to grow! Zelda watched horrified as the fairy who already towered over her started growing even more massive.<br>\r\nSpryte grinned happily to herself and let the changes continue. She grew to a foot tall, then in the next moment, 2 feet tall. Spryte's growth was rapidly increasing as her body got bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Zelda's room started to crumble around the growing fairy princess's body. The fairy princess herself wasn't hurt at all by the destruction she was causing, and she didn't really care too much either, she was just caught up in the awesome feeling of growing more powerful. Spryte looked down at the dresser Zelda is on and saw that she could barely even see the princess's tiny form now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You look even smaller now, princess!\" Spryte taunted the tiny princess Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spryte! What have you done!?\" Zelda shouted at the top of her lungs, but Spryte couldn't hear even the faintest squeak from Zelda's bug-sized form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't hear you! You'll just have to stay down there for a while, okay?\" Spryte told her giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte smirked at Zelda's miniscule form. Growing herself had made her feel powerful, and with Zelda out of the picture, there wasn't a limit to what she could do with her new stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Spryte growth slowed to a halt and left the formally tiny fairy princess huge at a whoppping 50 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's room was almost completely destroyed by Spryte's growth, but the damage was mostly contained to the walls which Spryte had bursted through, leaving the ant-sized princess relatively safe, but stranded on her own dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte stood tall over the denizens of the castle, and even the castle itself. The mega-sized fairy princess looked down upon the smaller sights, and wondered what do to with her new size first. She grinned at seeing the tiny people flee from her giant form, and it made her feel all the more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have done this a long time ago!\" Spryte said happily.</span></div></div>",

That annoying fairy is going to pay dearly for this Spryte's really gone off the deep end this time keeping me shrunk like this while she's now a giant....I got to try and stop her somehow Oh wait the Triforce...I have to get to it somehow...\" As she started running for one of the many holes in the floor looking for a way to get upstairs to the room where the Triforce was hidden meanwhile with the giant Spryte </span></div></div>",

But her enjoyment came at the cost of the people of the town. Spryte's giant size could not be contained in the city, so nearly every time she made a quick or careless movement, something in town was sure to be destroyed. Entire houses and shops were getting crushed or otherwise demolished by the playful fairy giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee! This is amazing!\" Spryte giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fairy continued to skip happily across Hyrule castle town, only somewhat aware of the destruction she was causing. She wasn't so heartless as to want to cause mayhem, she was just too caught up in messing around at giant size to really notice or care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the tiny villagers in town caught her eye. She was a small young woman, who happened to look a little like the princess Zelda. At Spryte's size, this young woman looked more like a doll to the fairy, and Spryte wanted to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" Spryte called out to the cowering woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte didn't wait for a response, instead she simply picked up the tiny woman off the ground and played around with the woman in her massive hand, shuffling her around a little roughly. The woman screamed when she was picked up, and then started to cry as Spryte \"played\" with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Spryte asked impatiently, poking the poor woman in her chest. \"I'm not going to hurt you! I just want to play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone! Please!\" The woman cried. Spryte frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" The giantess fairy snapped. \"You know you like Zelda, but you're not nearly as fun to mess with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte tossed the woman back onto the ground, causing her to fall some 10 feet before landing and bruising her body sore. Spryte didn't bother paying the poor little woman any more mind though, she just stood up and looked back at the castle. She grinned grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Zeeelda..!\" Spryte said in a sing-song voice. She stepped over the rubble of castle town and made her way towards Hyrule castle again.</span></div></div>",
