She had a thin, voluptuous, hourglass figure with well-endowed breasts. She had pink colored eyes, and long, light-pink hair which she wears in a braid that splits off into two strands starting at her temples and framing her face. She was considered extremely attractive and beautiful by the other gladiators<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a gladiator, she wore protective gear made of bronze which includes a scale armor bikini, a ridge helmet, and a pair of greaves. She wore a turquoise paludamentum and a pair of brown gloves. Her right hand was equipped with a medieval double-edged long sword which from the ground up almost reaches her shoulders. She also carried a rounded shield on her left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the fighter\u2019s preparation room, the ex-princess stepped through a long, arched hallway, heading towards the light and the sound of an audience\u2019s raucous voices. The \u201cUndefeated Woman\u201d had appeared in the colosseum with four cardinal walkways towards the stage surrounded by a moat of water. There were three levels of seating, packed with civilians from the kingdom. On the north side, there were three monitors angled in different directions with the screens portraying the pink-haired warrior stepping onto the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the screens was a platform where the announcer spoke to the crowd to commence the event. The brown-haired man had the appearance of a Spartan warrior, wearing a golden helmet, a breast plate, and a cape that was white on the outside and red on the inside. He was the commentator who would regularly commentate on the colosseum events live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen. Today\u2019s event is a once in a lifetime chance for one of our gladiators to gain her freedom. The Undefeated Woman, Rebecca, has agreed to undergo a dungeon trial where she will face all forms of obstacles and challenges. Five different teleportation circles had been prepared on the stage. She will choose to step on one of them which will transport her to the dungeon. If she can escape the dungeon, she will gain her freedom right then and there. But as she\u2019s undergoing the trial, we will have constant footage of her broadcasted to you all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were five teleportation circles placed along the perimeter of the circular stage, forming a pentagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <span class=\"cred\"><b>red </b></span>magic circle would lead to a volcanic-themed dungeon.<br>\r\nThe <span class=\"clblue\"><b>blue </b></span>magic circle would lead to an aquatic-themed dungeon.<br>\r\nThe <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>green </b></span>magic circle would lead to a jungle-themed dungeon.<br>\r\nThe <span class=\"ctan\"><b>yellow </b></span>magic circle would lead to a desert-themed dungeon.<br>\r\nThe <span class=\"cblack\"><b>black </b></span>magic circle would lead to a mystery-themed dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the center of the five colorful teleportation circles, Rebecca had to make a choice that will dictate the type of dungeon she would undergo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich should she choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The air felt uncomfortably hot to breathe down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the far distance ahead, there was a forest of towering protrusions of rocks, sticking up, standing as high as skyscrapers. A layer of foggy ash obscured the top, covering the sky in grey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her left, there was a massive skull-shaped formation with a glowing orange light emanating from the open mouth as if it were an entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her right, there was a large crater on the ground which served as the foundation for a large, rectangular tower made of dark steel. It appeared to be the only manmade structure she could find right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her rear, there was a large volcano with rivers of lava trickling down a steep slope, diverging and converging like a stream of water would, all pouring into a pool below. There were various dark spots along the mountainside which appeared to be caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above her, a swarm of silhouettes loomed in the ashes. They were likely kilometers away from her, but she could make out bat-like wings and humanoid shaped bodies, and they appeared to be flying towards her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hell-like region must be the dungeon she had be teleported to. The magic circle that brought her here was nowhere to be found.

There was a heavy downpour from the rainclouds in the grey sky, leaving her soaked. It was so cold that she could see a puff of air for each breath exhaled from her mouth. Her bikini armor was not suited for this chilly environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the far distance ahead, there was massive white wall that appeared to be made of pure ice with light snow dwindling from above. <br>\r\nTo her left, there was a massive waterfall from an icy sloped structure.

The audience, stage, and the sky were all tinted in a lush green aura until the world she once knows had been completely faded from her vision. Vertigo overwhelmed her senses until she blacks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up, finding herself lying on her stomach against a layer of soft grass with warm, humid air pressing against her bare skin. Lethargically standing up, the warrior held her sword and shield firmly as she observed her new environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing but towering trees she could see with exotic plants and fungi here and there. There was a slight drizzle from above as she stood beneath the shade of one of the enormous trees. The ground was uneven with wild mossy roots winding and twisting amount. Some of the branches above appeared almost like bridges that linked between the trunks. Vines dangled like hair. And there was a layer of light mist above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the far distance ahead, the layer of mist grew thicker, unusually so compared to the rest of the cardinal directions. The ground looked darker as if it were muddier. Was there a swamp over there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her left, she took notice of a ravine along the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her right, she could scent of smoke linger in the air as if someone had made a campfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her rear, the plants appeared to grow more and more exotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, she noticed a treehouse in one of the high branches, obscured by the mist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis jungle must be the dungeon she had be teleported to.

Her body was already beginning to sweat and finding a source of hydration was immediately prioritized in her mind.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Rebecca was born in the kingdom of Dressrosa as the granddaughter of the king. She once lived a happy life in a small cottage just outside of the kingdom. She used to pick flowers together with her mother and then sell them in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was six years old, a powerful crew of pirates had taken over her kingdom and usurped the king with a tyrant. Rebecca saw the royal palace burning. After two days on the run, she grew hungry and asked her mother for food. Her mother decided to gather food for them both, leaving her behind but promising to return shortly. But her mother never came back alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turned fourteen, Rebecca was captured by the pirates and was forced to become a gladiator at the Corrida Colosseum. Throughout the next two years, she earned the title of \"undefeated woman\" as she has never lost a fight, but at the same time, she was bullied by other gladiators. Her mother had taught her not to hurt people, so she won her battles by having her opponents fall out of the ring without directly injuring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer style of swordsmanship was completely defensive in nature, exploiting her opponents' strength and momentum to defeat them. Speed and evasiveness were her primary characteristics in combat, and as a consequence, her body showed no signs of scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone caught rebelling against the tyrant were placed inside prisons under the Colosseum, and were given the condition that any fighter who wins a thousand matches earns their freedom. Most barely lasted a hundred fights, and any attempt to escape would result in their execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow sixteen years old, Rebecca, a convicted gladiator and ex-princess, was offered a way to gain her freedom by traversing through a dungeon. She did not enjoy harming other people, and this would bypass the condition of needing a thousand wins. Thus, she accepted the rare offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gallery:</b> <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/nAQKXWD.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/nAQKXWD.png</a></td>",
