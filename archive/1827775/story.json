He was perfectly normal apart from being as big as a doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day he wasn't smiling as he walked thinking about his situation.<br>\r\nLately everything he tried went wrong, he though. Because of his size he had a lot of trouble to get along with other people, even though he tried his best to help.<br>\r\nHe had trouble making friends as everyone was too worried about hurting him and his knowledge about girls was very poor as he was only squished by them when trying to aproach them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about all of this he saw a granny about to cross the street and offered to help her. The old lady thanked him and tell him that he seemed like a quite special boy.<br>\r\nThe word \"special\" echoed in Arthur's head... That was true, he was special...he could do things no one else could, his greatest weakness could be his power....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could be a....a <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">superhero</span>! He was so inmersed in his new thoughts that he didnt even notice the old lady being ran over....<br>\r\nBuuuuuuut.....he had decided to be a hero so he began to wonder if he should get some kind of cool costume or where should he begin his career as a defender of the justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard someone's cries coming from the end of the street and he saw two figures in front of an ice cream shop..... </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://iarturoi.deviantart.com/art/Prologue-1-Arthur-281140133\" target=\"_blank\">http://iarturoi.deviantart.com/art/Prolo...</a></span></div></div>",

Sarah was happy too, she was in the refreshing environment of her laboratory with air conditioning. She was working on her latest invention, a machine developed to separate molecules depending on their affinities. It had been a complete success and she was trying to simplify so i could recognize now the bigger parts of different objects and basically dismount them. Inmersed on her work, brazing a capacitor she didn't notice the shadow that passed next the machine.<br>\r\nShe got up and stood up proud, in front of the open booth that was her new invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew!

She was also naked but she seemed angry and her hair looked different... The boy was flipping out with too much things to process when another girl got out and another one! The two girls looked alike but  they also seemed different... He fell to the ground butt first bleeding from his nose. Too much nakedness for him, he was completely stunned, so he stood there for a minute looking the machine.... it seemed like it was over, nothing else was in it so after some deliberation, he got up again and prepared to leave, considering it the wiser option given the fact that now four girls were now on the loose, they haden't paid him attention the first time when they didn't have clothes but that might change so he turned to find. </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://coconocotoco.deviantart.com/art/Arturo-y-Sara-capitulo-2-2-327561902\" target=\"_blank\">http://coconocotoco.deviantart.com/art/A...</a></span></div></div>",

Arthur couldn't help but laugh with the girl while spinning, that was until he found himself free falling.<br>\r\nThe girl who was holding him seconds before looked at her hands with surprise wondering what had just happened with her new friend while the little boy screamed flying in the air... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed against something soft with a loud BOING and then bounced back falling in a table, stunned. Then he looked up to see a humongous pair of boobs in which he had just bounced \"Whoa! They are hu...! I mean...\" he stopped as he saw the face of the girll who looked down on him... she seemed angry and her clothes made her look kinda badass. She was beautiful but didn't seem very happy with him crushing in her breasts.

Maybe you'd like to try getting up close and personal?\" She started lowering him a bit and opened her mesh shirt, letting exposed her breasts. \"No, thanks, I'm okay, I'll just go now\". She grinned, still frowning and let go of him \"I must insist\". He fell screaming while she let go of her shirt sending him crushing against her right boob, mushing his face right against her nipple and effectively silencing him. She laughed a bit \"What do you think about my ample bossom?\" She squeezed a bit her arm against her breast crushing him again. \"Mmmmphphhh\" She just looked down and sighed feeling the power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy wasn't going to give up this easily, not then, not ever. So he struggled getting his face more smushed against her nipple but finally letting him out from his prision escaping from one of the holes and falling with a cool pose in the table.<br>\r\n\"Why you little...!\" He didn't wait for her to finish and jumped down the table, running to get somewhere safe where he could plan something. The grumpy Sarah, not amused with the little pest escaping, chased after him. \"You are gonna get it!!\" He ignored her and kept running.

In that time he had tested out his new powers of survivability, sometimes intentional sometimes by accident. Walking down the street had become slightly more dangerous, as he now knew he couldnt die, his brain didnt seem as sharp to danger for jumping out the way instinctivly. <br>\r\nHe had spent hours stuck under the soles of various shoes, sat on various benchs by many women and was amazed by his ability to reform, he noticed the longer he was crushed the longer it took to reform. he had ended up mistaken for a lump of fleshy clay in a pottery shop a week ago and had been sculpted into a beautiful glazed pot. he wasnt sure if the glaze was what had held him in the shape or if it was the heat of the kiln but even after he had been accidently knocked off the shelf by a customer, it had taken him a good 36 hours to reform once free from the glazing. he hoped no one would mold him into something like that, he didn't like the idea of being stuck in a shape that was used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had run out of Sarah's lab so fast that he hadnt noted its location but he needed to get revenge on her. he kept his eyes peeled even on the shelf of the pottery store. Finally, dressed in his stretchy little green superhero costume, Arthur spotted her walking down the street. She had used a freeze ray on someone and taken their coffee from their grasping hand. the look of shock frozen on their face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for Tiny man to leap to action. He ran across the street towards her, jumping and dodging feet as he kept his sight on her. He couldnt catch up to her with her large confident strides. He was sweating heavily by the time she got back to her lair. he ran the last bit of distance as her door shut behind her. Leaping, he tried to get through, feeling the door pinch tight on his legs as they closed on him. <br>\r\nHe landed on his hands, his legs stuck, he glanced back at them as he heard a chuckle above him. Glancing up he saw Sarah sipping the coffee looking down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really thought you could sneak up on me in that bright outfit? You're not too smart are you tiny\" -she chuckled \"- or maybe you came back for more fun testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crouched down to avoid showing him her panties and pinched his head tightly between her finger and thumb, pulling hard, stretching out his malliable little body before his legs finally slipped from the doorframes grip, twanging back like a rubber band. she began rolling him into a little ball in her hand as she strolled into her lab more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm now...i could try out my transformation ray on you again...then again i could always mold you into whatever shape i wanted...hmm i planned to go to the pool and your suit is a nice colour...maybe i could stretch and mold you into a nice onepiece swimsuit. Hmm or a nice seat cushion...so many possibilities...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finished her coffee and had begun tossing his balled up shape from hand to hand casually while she decided what to do to him...</font></span></div></div>",

He could hear her opening and closing drawers, he could hear the russle of fabrics as she got changed before he saw her hand reach down and grab him. holding him tightly as she picked him up.<br>\r\nThe view he now got was surprising and alot better than his previous view. She was topless, smirking at him. He was confused before finally his brain caught up. <br>\r\nHe had stringy straps, he was twisted into two semi-circles. She had shaped him into a bra or bikini top of some kind. <br>\r\nHe could see the strings of a green bikini bottom sticking out from her jeans and realised he was going to be worn and going to be wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned him around, away from her breasts and he felt her grab at the \"strings\" tying them into a firm and tight knot, pulling him tight against her chest. He could feel her nipples sticking into his back as her hands covered him up, shifting him about to make sure he was positioned correctly. he struggled, only managing the slightest movement. no luck in loosening the knots holding him to her, but he rubbed against her nipples, causing her to let out a gasp and a coo \"oooh someone likes his new position i take it!!\" She laughed and her hands stopped covering him, but soon his vision was covered by a loose white top, the white fabric filling his view. he could only listen to the world as she strolled towards the nearby water park, feeling her breasts jiggle in his tight confinment. She had clearly done a good job on the sculpting, he held them perfectly and his struggles just made her nipples stiffen and poke him more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he got to see the world again inside the locker room, watching her stuff the clothing into a locker and stroll out into the park.<br>\r\n-\"Hehe ive never let a boy get this close to my heart before\" she joked down at you, smirking at your silent imprisonment, displayed across her chest with the world completly unaware she held a human life in her grasp. She certainly felt very powerful right now. He could do nothing to stop her. He was her toy, her plaything. <br>\r\nAnything she wanted. <br>\r\nRight now, he made a very cute bikini top. she wondered how long she could get him to keep his shape. She could wear him for jogging, swimming and just everyday wear as a bra. It would be interesting to see what happened to him if she ran him through the wash, and he was certainly comfortable enough to wear. Far softer with much better support than a real bra. She chuckled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hot day, as she cooled herself in the pools, he got soaked through, and as she laid about tanning and drying in the sun, she could hear a faint sizzle as his body heated up. unlike her, he had no lotion on him to protect from the sun. She was curious if the intense heat of the day would have any fun effects on him but she saw nothing. Eventually she head home, untying the knot and peeling him from her body, she dangled him by a string admiring her handiwork, his body had been molded into perfect cups to hold her breasts from the long day of being worn so tightly, no longer just flat semi-circles. <br>\r\nShe dropped him ontop of a pile of dirty washing and walked off to get changed. <br>\r\nHis body felt weird to him, he could feel the curves in his body even when she took him off, he was staring at differant angles now. the smell of stale sweat from the clothes under him made him want to gag, but he had no visible mouth right now to do so. he waited and waited for his body to reform, hoping to escape like last time and plan his revenge...</font></span></div></div>",

Mechanical arms with a deep scooping shovel came down at the pile and before he could even yell in shock he was scooped up with the clothes, the shifting motion of the mass of fabric sending him tumbling down as they poured over him from the shifting gravity, trapping him at the bottom of the pile once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe franticly grabbed at the metal below him, trying to hold on as it shifted and tipped the clothing pile into the automated washing system. the heavy mound of clothes hammered into him as he clung on to a screw head, his poor little arms stretching out painfully from the extra weight pressing down on him before he finally lost his grip, his spagetti string arms dangling limply as he slid down into the dark machine, landing softly ontop of the clothes before more fell ontop of him pressing down on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis struggles to get free were cut short as he heard the gurgle of water pouring into the machine and the soggy clothing sucking up the moisture added to their weight, pinning him in their mass like thick clay, then, the spinning began. round and round he spun, dizzy beyond belief as the pile deteriorated, slapping wetly against the metal walls over and over, poor Arthur was no differant, his body slammed hard against the unyealding chrome over and over, flattening him out again, twisting him over and over, his arms having no breathing space to reform. His body was flat but stretched out by the g-force he was being put through, he foolishly tried to hook his feet in one of the drainage holes of the machine but the speed he was going he just ended up with legs to match his spagetti arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity of being hit in the face by wet clothes and painfully spun around in a metal container the washing cycle came to a stop. Light filtered in as the ceiling opened up, the mechanical arms reaching in and scooping the wet clump from the machine, Arthur sighed, glad it was over...then he was dropped, the wet clothes slapping wetly around him as he fell into the dryer. he whimpered quietly as it began to spin, instead of water this time, he had to deal with intense heat. His body went red from the heat it was like being trapped in a oven. He blacked out from it. the machine carrying on its duty. after an hour the contents of the machine were poured out onto a short conveyor, arms scanning the shape of each item, ironing them smooth of creases and folding them to be stored away. Skirts, dresses, tops, the machine knew all the shapes. finally it came to the unconcious Arthur, his flat body twisted and misshapen, his arms and legs stretched out long like strings. it paused unsure of this irregular shape before deciding it must be damaged clothing in need of repair. he was lifted up by his \"strings\" and carryed to a repair station of the machine. It fixed him before ironing him smooth of creases, before he was folded up and put away in a drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly regained conciousness in the dark of the drawer. he could smell the scent of freshly cleaned clothes all around him. he tried to move but couldnt, his body hadnt reformed at all, the machines repairs was holding him quite firmly in his newly given shape. he tried to call out but his voice was quieter than usual, it was hard to speak. finally the drawer was opened and he saw a naked Sarah peering down at him. Her casual expression turned into a huge grin at the sight of him \"oh i had forgotten about you...hehe. looking good little toy\" she said picking him up to put on. he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror as she walked past it...</font></span></div></div>",

Sarah turned at the sound of his words, glancing over her shoulder at him and a smirk appeared on her beautiful but evil face \"my my, quite demanding for a thong. hmm i dont think i will, you didnt say please\" she slipped into a lacey black bra strolling over to him. \"please, please!!\" he cried out desperatly. she just chuckled \"too late, you didnt ask nice until told. you have to learn some manners\" she smiled picking him up between her fingers, pinching tightly at the knots causing him to cry out, her nails digging in. she lifted one leg into the gap between his bound limbs and his torso, then the other. Arthur cringed seeing his position \"at least turn me around to face the other way!!\" he pleaded but she just chuckled, her face hidden by her breasts from this angle. she pulled him up her legs, snapping the straps into place as his face pressed into her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe felt her pause \"hmm actually i will do what you asked\" he found himself pulled down her legs again and turned around. he whimpered knowing pleading again would be useless. he had meant for her to turn him around so he faced outwards, she in her wicked mind had decided to turn him so his face, rapidly shooting up her legs, went straight into her ass crack. he grunted as the cheeks tensed and crushed his head on either side as he slid between them as all thongs do. he tried to speak but he had no space and his face was crushed flat. all Sarah heard when she really tried to listen for it was the faintest grunt coming from her ass. she grinned, no one would hear his crys for help when she went out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe slipped into a nice dress and practically skipped out the door, happy in her torture of her new fun little toyboy. for Arthur however it was hell, each step crushed his head and upper body from one side, then the other. it felt hot in her ass and he was sweating like mad, which only made his flat little abused body stick to her slick skin more leaving no hope of wriggling loose. as the day went on he tried crying for help but no one heard him trapped deep between her plump ass cheeks. he listened to their muffled voices as she went about her day being evil, stealing candy from children, covering up stop signs on the road, pouring a cup of coffee onto a rack full of white wedding dresses. she was having a great day and all he could do was listen. some hero he was, trapped in her ass and acompanying her as she did her evil deeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfinally she head home, he could feel the sudden air conditioning even through the flesh pressing in on him. he was as flat as he could be, wedgied up her butt but she didnt seem to mind, probably because she knew it was far worse for him. he felt her grab his \"straps\" and pull him down. he stretched a bit as she kept her butt cheeks clenched, before he slowly slid out and snapped down like an elastic band. she stepped out of him and looked at him with glee, his face was smooshed into a little string, his body out of shape and thin too. she laughed \"well you certainly are more thong shaped now little toy boy\" she teased \"but what to do with you...i could keep you as a living thong forever, knowing that im really keeping my enemies close. hehe...or i could just crush you into the shape of an insole...i do have some very sweaty gym shoes that need some cushioning for my run tonight...\" she said, more to herself as she tried to decide...</font></span></div></div>",

After more then a dozen (could it have been even 50?) times he was silent when she asked that question, \"Whats that?\" she asked \"You want to know how to serve me?\" reluctantly he sighed and answered \"Yes Sarah\" she jumped up and down at his first sign of submission to her, her panties bouncing against her.

Of course that was a terrible idea because after a good 30 seconds of it, Sarah wiggled in her pants grinding and inflicting all sorts of pain his poor little body. \"Owww!!\" Which of course only came out as \"MRPPH\" Sarah grinned and sighed \"Ahh, much better!\" and so she walked to the gym<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo any person who was watching Sarah, she seemed odd as she skipped, hopped, jogged, and dance down the street, To Arthur he was in one painful posistion after another, with each squeeze, jump, and move he was contorted, twisted, and sliding between her cheeks of pain. He tried not to scream into her butt, A hero doesn't give in to the villain! But unfortunately, every time he braced for one type of pain, she would change the way she was moving, from dancing to skipping, to even bunny hopping. About half way there Arthur couldn't take it anymore and started screaming, over and over. Sarah was startled at the muffling she felt from behind her, but then smiled brightly and whispered behind her \" If you keep that up, I might walk more easily\" before turning back around and walking calmly, only getting a occasional odd look.  Of course Arthur struggled to keep quiet again, struggling against her again, which made Sarah even more happy to jump, skip and hop the rest of the way. \"Such a great day!\" she said to her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they got there, Sarah was energetic, ready to start her workout, however Arthur was ready to quit. He wasn't sure how much he could resist her anymore, especially with things looking like they were going to get worse and never get better. once Sarah was in the changing room, and by her self she decided to make Arthur a humiliating deal \"Ah! Wasn't that a refreshing walk? Hmm you seem to be a little worn out, and were only just starting! Tell you what shrimp, if you show me that you can be a good little thong, I'll give you a break! Allll you have to dooo is kiss! just give a couple of kisses to show you love your new place\" Arthur was beaten down, but he was not broken! \"No a hero would never kiss a villain, not on the face and especially on the butt!\" Of course it just came out as the usual \"Mrpph!\" and wiggling in her ass which was no skin off Sarah back. \"Ok then! off to the stair master!\" as she started to hop over to the machine she felt it. Subtle at first but his frantic kisses was getting easier and easier to feel \"There that wasn't so hard now was it?\" She grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took a seat and enjoyed the feeling of him back there for a bit \"Enjoying your break?\" she asked knowing he couldn't answer back \"You know, I think I like talking to you, your always so... agreeable!\" she chuckled. After half a hour of resting on a bench she then changed into her yoga pants shoving poor Arthur deep between her cheeks \"Now then all tight and snuggly? Just like you like it?\" she wiggles a bit while getting her sweat shirt on \"Now... what should I do?</font></span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve seen you before! Wanna try the sauna with us? It\u2019s rumored to be tough but I\u2019m sure we can handle it! The girls laughed.<br>\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s okay, I didn\u2019t have plans right now sooo\u2026. Okay! I\u2019ll even bring a surprise....\u201d The girls didn\u2019t really understand what she meant so they just smiled and waited for Sarah to get ready. She run to the locker room and changed cloth to towel, grabbing the little one and going back to join her new friends in the sauna chamber...<br>\r\nThey entered the chamber... it was incredibly hot in there! \"Oh my... it\u2019s so hot in here... and why are you standing?\" she asked... \"Oh, c\u2019moon, it\u2019s too hot to sit anywhere. Even towels are not enough\u2026 I think this challenge is a bit over our possibilities\"... <br>\r\nOn Sarah's face an evil smile appeared\u2026  \"You know... we HAVE something that could help\" She showed them Arthur...The girls looked at Sarah, confused, he is alive and he is mine, but most important\u2026. He is like rubber, insulating\u2026 and he can be stretched so\u2026 the girls started to understand and giggled \"Are you saying what I think you are saying? but how do we use him? He is so small\" ... Evil Sarah knew what to do\u2026 \u201cAaaw dummy! I\u2019ll show you! You see... to stretch him you just need too\"....Poor Arthur was going through hell... \"Grab his legs and arms\" Sarah said\u2026 \"I will grab his tongue\" she continues... The girls did as Sara ordered with a big smile on their faces... \"Now pull as hard as you can!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t that be painful for him right?\u201d one of girls asked... Arthur tried to meddle \u201cYeah, think about that!!\u201d \u201cOf course! And that's what makes it so funny\u201d Sarah said with a huge smile, showing everybody her amusement.... The girls then stretched the poor little one in every direction. \u201cSo what now Sarah?\u201d She thought for a second and answered \u201cNow we simply put him on the floor\u201d But won\u2019t it burn him? I mean the heat?\u201d Sara laughed \u201cYEP! And our cute butts will have a comfy seat!\u201d <br>\r\nSo the girls put Arthur on the floor, and then without Sarah saying a word they started stepping and jumping on him to flatten him completely facing up. Dianna, the brunette girl with the wide hips smiled devilishly while stepping on him again and again while Jeanne, the blond one blushed as she stepped on his face... \u201cOh boy, he screams so much...When he was perfectly stuck to hot floor, The girls looked at him and Rose pouted at his cries \u201cpoor thing...\u201d Sarah answered \"Hahahaha, he\u2019s like that all the time\" <br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

Smiling and laughing around \"C\u2019mon girls! Don\u2019t be shy!

A perfect massage machine!\u201d And she did something terrible! She stretched his tongue even more and tied it around her butt checks... each one of them.

Rose tied his hands around her ass, Jeanne his legs, and Dianna was left without anything and looking at the stretched boy who begged: \u201cPwease wet me gooo!

However, the majority of his body was squished into the bench as the soaking ladies left to get their showers. All he could hear was giggling before a door slammed shut, finally leaving the young boy to get a breather. It was hard, and the heat didn't help, but he could slowly feel himself shrinking to his original form. He couldn't believe his luck, but laid in the heat panting from exertion. He had a bad taste in his mouth and his entire body was sore. Before he could even think how he would escape this heated room, he heard the door open again. His eyes widened and he immediately whipped his head around to look at who he was expecting. A curvy woman stepped in. He felt in awe to see her long straight red hair fall down her back to her shoulder blades. Her eyes were a beautiful blue and he could tell even in the steam this woman wasn't wearing anything but a white towel. He swallowed heavily, shaking his head free of daydreams. He needed help and now, he wasn't about to stay in here where those awful girls would come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red headed woman stepped right up to the beach, Arthur screaming his lungs out until he saw the one thing that made his throat croak. She turned, her legs bending and her cream colored bottom was headed right for him.

His only hope of avoiding being crushed was to let the woman know that he was there, so she wouldn't completely crush him into oblivion. He opened his mouth and breathed in: Heeeee...\" *SQUAAASH* Meanwhile the woman had been preparing to relax in the sauna, a bit scared of burning her behind. She had decided to just do it quickly and stop thinking it, so with a little jump she had let her body fall... on top of the little boy.<br>\r\nHe saw his crotch coming down at around 300 miles per hour while his scream died. He was instantly moulded almost flat. She squashed his feet and part of his legs with her buttcheeks but all of his upper body had been squashed by her lips to a pancake. <br>\r\nArthur's face had been flattened between her lips effectively shutting him up and squashing him.<br>\r\nShe got a bit aroused but couldn't imagine what was happening, and imagined it was because of the heat in the room. But being the only one there she looked at the door, and started wiggling a bit in the bench. She bit her lower lip while she rubbed her rear, pleasuring herself. The little boy only guessed what was happening when things started to get a bit wet... after a second his whole body was steamrolled again and again while his face was crushed and all of him was almost being shaped around her figure.<br>\r\nHe tried to move but he could not even move a finger as she kept crushing his every existence against the bench of the sauna.

Finally it came to a point that she released, sitting there, her toes curled and her privates pulsating. She finally sighed, leaning back again and letting herself lean against the wall. Arthur, however, was having less fun. He couldn't even move let alone voice his pain and irritation. He tried to imagine as the woman became more aroused, he would become looser, but unfortunately it was the opposite affect. It almost seemed that he was being glued right onto her perfect skin and he could feel his legs almost completely between her cheeks. It didn't help the woman was putting all her weight on top of him, leaving those wet lips to keep him completely silent in his misery. </font></span></div></div>",

But I suppose I can let you tag along. Does that seem fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur couldn\u2019t have answered, even if he had wanted to. His face was mashed up against his thigh, and all the air in his lungs had been squeezed out. Adding insult to injury, he was getting sick from being constantly tossed and spun in the air. It was all he could do to keep from throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah feigned an interested expression as she placed one hand behind her ear, as if trying to hear him better. \u201cExcellent!\u201d she cried, clapping her hands together and crushing Arthur between them. \u201cI\u2019m glad you have no objections. Actually, you can even help me! Wait right here while I get ready.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout pausing, she licked Arthur\u2019s flattened body and slammed it on a nearby table. Giving him a sly wink, she scampered off, giggling. Arthur immediately began reforming himself, but it was extremely tough work. Not only was he flattened, but he was contorted as well, with all his limbs tied into knots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, despite the difficulty, Arthur had managed to both re-inflate himself and untie himself after only ten minutes. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t separate himself from the table. As he heard nearing footsteps, he re-doubled his efforts, but it was to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah entered the room, but to Arthur\u2019s shock, she was only wearing sneakers and a sexy pair of work out shorts. Her substantial breasts bounced as she walked towards him, and the swaying of her curvy hips was perfectly outlined by her tight shorts. Blushing, Arthur was so flustered that he didn\u2019t notice that Sarah was pointing the transformation gun at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was enveloped in a bright light and immediately began to feel himself change. Unlike when he was crushed into a shape, it wasn\u2019t painful: just strange. He became thinner and stretched out. His legs lengthened and joined, creating a circle, while his arms stretched up and over, eventually joining to his feet. His body and face merged and widened, while his skin turned from flesh to grey fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished transforming, Sarah picked him up and cooed, \u201cOoh! How kind of you? How did you know I needed a new sports bra?\u201d She lifted him over her head and slid her arms through the straps. As she adjusted herself, Arthur saw her breasts get closer and closer, until they blocked his view and he was hugging them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, Sarah admired her handiwork. \u201cPerfect!\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to go for a run!\u201d With that, she grabbed an mp3 player and headed out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sarah ran, Arthur was in torment. Every step she took left him in pain, as he strained to keep her heavy breasts in place. Up, down, up, down, they went, and every movement felt like it was going to break his straps. Meanwhile, not only could he not see anything, he felt smothered against her. She was incredibly warm, and after a few minutes of running, her sweat had completely drenched Arthur. He felt as if he were in the most uncomfortable sauna of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, on the other hand, was having the run of her life. Arthur was a great bra! He supported her so perfectly, that she felt like she could really go all out. She was practically running on air. The only downside was that as her bra got sweaty, it was beginning to irritate her nipples. But she laughed as she felt them get hard, as she knew it would be even more uncomfortable for Arthur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter forty minutes, Sarah eventually returned home. Tossing her pants and Arthur on the floor of her room, she quickly took a shower and changed. Refreshed, she came out of the bathroom and picked Arthur off the floor. \u201cEww, you stink!\u201d she teased, giggling and holding her nose. Pointing the transformation gun at him, she changed him back to his normal state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d she asked innocently. \u201cDid you enjoy helping me? Or were my breasts too much for you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur stood on the counter, still bathed in her sweat, battered and bruised. But he wasn\u2019t going to let her win. He was a hero, dammit! So, mustering all of his courage and gumption, he said, \u201cActually, it wasn\u2019t so bad, considering you\u2019re so flat-chested!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah froze, the blood rising to her face. After a few seconds she spoke, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said you\u2019re flat as a board!\u201d Arthur shouted triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah\u2019s knuckles turned white as she ferociously gripped the gun. \u201cFlat,\u201d she muttered to herself. Then she roared, \u201cI\u2019ll show you flat!\u201d <br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

Once again, a bright light surrounded Arthur as he began to feel himself changing. This time, however, an extreme sense of dizziness came upon him, and he quickly blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to, he could immediately tell that he was in a new shape. He felt swollen and heavy, as if he was a water balloon pinned to a wall. Wait, scratch that: two water balloons. His left arm and leg had become one balloon, and his right arm and leg were the other. His face felt stretched out all over his body, completely covering the two dangling orbs. His vision was filled with a fluffy whiteness, and he was practically deafened by the sounds of a beating heart. Every few seconds, he would hear the sound of someone breathing in, during which he would rise. When the person exhaled, he would fall again. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d Arthur thought, since he didn\u2019t have a mouth to speak the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! You\u2019re finally awake!\u201d The voice was incredibly loud, reverberating through his new body. \u201cI was worried something had gone wrong, since I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d Arthur recognized the voice to be Sarah\u2019s<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d He thought as loud as he could. Suddenly, his whole body began jiggling uncontrollably, as he heard Sarah giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha, let me show you!\u201d With that, Arthur felt himself being propelled forward. He could hear someone walking, and with every footstep he heard, he bounced a little. It was a bit disconcerting, and more than a little annoying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the footsteps stopped. Without warning, the white wall was removed from his face, and he found himself staring at Sarah, who had lifted up her shirt to reveal her bare breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you calling flat chested?\u201d Sarah teased. Staring, Arthur was astounded to see that Sarah\u2019s breasts had grown at least two cup sizes. How could that be possible? And something else was wrong too. He realized that he wasn\u2019t looking at Sarah: he was looking at a mirror. Then where was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally dawned on him when he saw Sarah poke her breast, and, at the same time, he felt her finger touch his face. \u201cNo,\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Sarah shouted gleefully. \u201cYou know, I thought about what you had said, and you were right. My boobs were a bit on the small side. Fortunately, you were kind enough to provide the material to make them bigger!\u201d Arthur\u2019s vision was blocked again as Sarah let down her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, even though I just showered, I think I\u2019ll continue my workout with some jumping jacks! Normally I wouldn\u2019t think of doing those without a sports bra, but I\u2019ve made it that you\u2019ll take all of the pain from my boobs. You\u2019re such a swell guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur tried to protest, but he was cut off as he felt Sarah jump into the air. His body was dragged up, and as Sarah reached the top of her jump, Arthur floated into the air, weightless. But that feeling was dashed as she came back down hard on the floor. Arthur was rocketed down but then whipped back up as Sarah jumped again. The pain was intense as he lashed up and down helplessly, his whole world never staying still for an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Sarah finally finished her jumping jacks. \u201cThat was great!\u201d she cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything at all! This is so convenient.\u201d Looking at herself in the mirror, she grabbed her newly enlarged breasts and admired them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d</font><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked around the lab, and resting her eyes on a specific drawer a grin slipped across her face. She walked over to the drawer, setting Arthur in a tall, empty glass to prevent him escaping. She rooted through the drawer, \u201cNow, where did I put it\u2026\u201d she said, tossing everything in the drawer aside. <br>\r\nArthur saw his chance to try and escape while she was distracted. He slammed his body against the side of the glass, until finally it tipped over and threw him out onto the counter top. He ran and hid in a box before the glass rolled off the counter, smashing on the floor and alerting Sarah to his escape. Sarah whipped around to the sound of shattering glass, to see her subject missing, and her favourite glass lying in smithereens on the floor. She ran to the counter, and tore wildly through everything searching for Arthur. She flung Arthur\u2019s box off the counter, and Arthur flew out when it landed. She sprinted over and pounced on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, Arthur gripped firmly by both her hands. \u201cWhy you little..!\u201d she trailed off, shaking with rage.  She stood silently, the vein in her temple visibly throbbing. She paced back and forth to calm herself, and after sometime, she kept still and that evil grin crept across her face again. \u201cOkay Arthur, we\u2019re going to do something creative, because I\u2019ve been told it would help regulate my anger\u2026\u201d she said, her grip tightening momentarily on Arthur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw him onto a counter top. He lay there, and as he was about to protest Sarah\u2019s fist came crashing down on him. Lifting her fist she revealed Arthur squashed and spread out into a sheet. She took the sheet and began to stretch him over a wooden frame. She hooked his right shoulder on one corner, and stretched his left foot to the opposite. She did the same with his other extremities, pulling him tight. Arthur felt his tiny body stretched in all directions, he felt as though he\u2019d rip apart under the strain. After much heaving from Sarah, He finally covered a 60x80cm stretcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, I like to paint, but good canvases are expensive. However, I figured you\u2019d be perfect, being so smooth, so stretchy\u201d she said, gently rubbing her finger across his taught form. She then flicked his body, and it resonated like a drum skin. \u201cPerfect\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur groaned, \u201cOw\u2026owwww...it hurts\u2026.\u201d, before Sarah slapped a generous helping of white paint onto her canvas. She spread the paint, coating Arthur from head to toe. He could see nothing now except white, he tasted only the paint. As it dried he found it increasingly difficult to move his lips, until finally they stiffened in place. All he knew after that were the brush strokes of Sarah: some light, some heavy and vigorous. Every one of them pushed him, stretched him further. Each one was almost like a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end a painting stood before Sarah: Blob, a study of Arthur. Groans could be heard from the painting. \u201cOh quiet, you\u2019re art now\u201d Sarah said dismissively. She pulled up a chair and admired her handy-work.<br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

Great, thought Arthur, I can\u2019t wait to see what it is this time. \u201cI going to\u2026\u201d she held for the drum-roll in her head, \u201ca party!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur started scheming; Perfect! While she\u2019s distracted with guests and fun, I can make my escape, or maybe even sabotage her evil lab! But Arthur\u2019s soliloquy was to be short lived. The familiar feeling of dread first returned when he felt himself being removed from his stretcher and folded up. The next thing he noticed was that he felt pinches all along one side. The pinches started to run along his body. Arthur panicked: what\u2019s happening?! They stopped suddenly, \u201cStupid shredder!\u201d shouted Sara, \u201cwhy do you keep jamming!\u201d Shredder?! After some \u201ctender-loving-care\u201d involving a hammer, the shredder whirred back into life. \u201cThere now, you\u2019re going to make some amazing confetti!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur could do nothing but groan.

He endured the unpleasant sensation of his dismembered form piling on itself, and the equally unpleasant sensation of being handled and scattered all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party continued into the wee hours of the morning. After Sara collapsed from exhaustion, one of her friends decided, rather enthusiastically, to clean up for her.

Sarah was backing away making sure not to get stabbed again. With each swing he put all his might. Sarah showed a face of shock and displeasure as she did not enjoy being the victim. Arthur however began to grow tired and needed to slow down his assault or he will be exhausted too fast. He faults and raises his tooth pick sword to cover his face. He used both hands to hold it in front of his determined face. \"What's gotten into you, freak!\" Sarah's fear turned to anger as she seemed ready to pounce on our hero. \"I'm no freak! But, your a monster!\" Arthur began to charge after Sarah, his sword held high like a samurai with their katana. As he charged forward he began to yell, \"Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!\" with the adrenaline coursing through his veins. Sarah however retaliated and began to swing her bare foot. Arthur watched as foot got closer and closer. In a flash it seemed her kick reached Arthur but at the last momment he leaped to the side dodging her right foot. The wind flew dramatically lifting his cape and blowing the strands of hair showing from under his helmet. He continued forward as Sarah regained her footing, she then lifted up her left foot to stomp down on Arthur. The bottom of her foot became the image inside his eyes as he knew he had to move. He leaped backwards to dodge her stomp. The ground shook violently as If the world was facing an earthquake. Arthur ignored the vibrations and ran to her ankle. Two quick grunts he made as he slashed her ankle and stabbed it. She bent over from the sting and saw how Arthur was right under her. She decided to drop down right on him. She let her body fall full force as her rear came down upon Arthur. Arthur felt everything freeze and slow down. Only the sound of his breathing and heart beat he heard. The shadow around him grew darker and darker. He had to run full force or else be squashed under Sarah's big butt! He saw no time to make it and slid forward like a baseball player to home base. He slides fast and under but his legs get caught under her buttcheek! \"aah, that hurts!\" Arthur screeches as Sarah just giggles. \"Gotcha! Now it's my turn to take charge little man!\" Arthur was face first into the tiled floor. He couldn't pull his legs out from under Sarah's butt. Luckily he saw his tooth pick infront of him. He reaches for his weapon as its his last chance to free himself and finish this fight. However as he inches closer to it, Sarah begins to move her tushie ontop of him. \"You're trapped little man, and this time, I'm going to leave you there!\" Sarah mockingly laughs as she tortures Arthur by slowly engulfing him under her perfect rump.

She continues talking about how she is going to punish him for his poor obedience and how everything could be easier if he just played along. Arthur was almost tempted to come out before reminding himself of how much joy she took in  bringing him pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be a way to make a run...\", his sentence gets stuck in his throat as the drums of her footsteps start to get louder as she comes to the corner of the room with the cabinet. His breathing becomes shallow as fear forces him to slowly back up as far as he can into the shadows. Unfortunately for him the small movements catches her eye as she crouches looking to were she saw something move. Her face is contorted into a scowl as he feels her eyes turn him into stone. He wants to move his body but the fear prevents him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well look what I found. A small pest that is trapped.\", she sounds like she is ready to kill as she reaches back behind the book case coming short of grabbing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no right to treat anyone the way you have! I don't care how smart you are.\", the boy squeaks out in response as he shakes in fear as her fingers are only inches from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to go home now and you wont let me, so you can't blame me for anything I have done to get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that so! Well I think that you need to understand that your home is here now, so you don't need to go anywhere.\", a smile spread across her face as she lays out across the floor.

It does not matter what you say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... my little toy I will give you two options for how this will end.\", she purrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option one you come out on your own and the punishment wont be near as bad, or option two I have to go through the trouble of moving the book case to get to you causing me to be even more mad at you.\"</font></span></div></div>",

His body starts to become similar to dough as she squeezes his body even harder. She raises the small lump of a boy from the floor with a evil look spread across her face. Her eyes are half open fixated on boy and her lips are stretched into a thin line as her fun had ended once Arthur decided to disrespect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\", she says putting a large emphasis on that one word, \"think that you should be great full that I haven't just gotten rid of you for not only hurting me once but twice.

You owe me a little fun.\", she purrs out as her cheerful attitude returns kneading the boy in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah\u2019s lips curl into a wicked smile as she takes the lump of a boy and toss him down onto the lab floor watching as his body splatter becoming more of a lumpy disc then a ball. She balances bringing one of her cute soles down on the boy giggling as his moans can be heard under her foot. She rubs him back and forth against the cold tile floor making his body stretch out to the sides as his face stays under her soles alternating between rubbings against her sole to rubbing against the hard surface of the tile. Sarah closes her eyes as her body tingles with excitement before leaning down to reach for the edge of the boy. She holds one end of him between her toes before stretching the other end of his body high over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's agonizing yelps fell on deaf ears as she spreads her toes out letting his body snap back on his body. He dangles helplessly from her grip his body malformed from her play. She starts to sing a upbeat tune flicking her wrist enough to cause the boy\u2019s body to spin around in circles keeping him from reforming. She takes her time walking over to the ray while playing with Arthur fiddling with the controls before throwing Arthur through the air trying to hit the table on the other side of the room, but to Arthur's misfortune she was too overzealous and instead his body splats hard against the opposite wall. Sarah sighs closing her eyes and shaking her head tired of having to do everything herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again you are beyond lucky! If you weren't so fun to play with then I wouldn't put up with all the trouble you keep causing, but hopefully we will fix that this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walks over to the wall grabbing Arthur as he starts to peel of the wall. She takes both of her hands to roll Arthur up into a tight little ball before setting him back onto the table in line with the ray. She reaches over her head with one hand bringing it down hard to flatten Arthur's body into a thin disc. She hops across the lab looking as cute as she possibly can with the excitement that runs through her bones. She can't hit the button fast enough before turning away from the bright flash of the ray.</font></span></div></div>",

Sarah quickly grabbed him and lifted him up, pressing him against her waist \"hmm...yep definatly my kind of thing. wanna see yourself?\" she said giddy with joy. she skipped merrily over to a mirror and turned him to face it, holding him up infront of her \"tadah!\" She exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldnt believe it. he was a skirt. He was pleated, black, sleek. He looked almost satiny with a mix of cotten. he noticed his eyes were on a attatched belt, his eyes making the frame of a jeweled belt buckle. Tthe eyes looked shocked but other than that he seemed to have no control over his new fabricy form. He was so in shock he didnt notice sarah was now only holding him one handed, slipping out of her clothes. He was snapped out of it as he suddenly plummeted, she lowered him down, slipping her feet in one at a time before sliding him up, his slightly stretchy waistline rubbing against her smooth legs. She wriggled him over her bubble bum and smoothed him out, tightening the belt buckle and giggled \"ooh i definatly like you like this toyboy. now lets find a cute top that makes you look even prettier!\" She skipped along, her legs kicking at him, causing his skirt body to go up and down from her movements. dispite having no stomach he felt a bit motion sick, though he had no mouth in which to express his discomfort, though she probably would have only been encouraged to skip more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to put up with her trying on over a dozen tops before she finally picked a simple tight black t-shirt with a sequined heart. the colour of the sequins matching your jeweled eyes. Sarah hummed to herself as she fluffed out her hair and checked her makeup. she grabbed her purse and slipped into a pair of black heels, confidently strolling out the front door planning to show off her new girly skirt to the world. she was in such a good mood. She loved having her new little toy to play with and experiment on, besides he was so small no one would ever find him even if they came looking, especially not with his current shape. She strolled through the marketplace quite happily, she even went to dodge around a small child with an ice-cream rather than taking it...</font></span></div></div>",

He was spending the day at home playing games with his friends over the internet like he does most days, but today he had the whole day to himself from his school work. He was your typical 20 year old guy with blue eye and brown hair except that he tended to be much more timid then most other guys leading him to never have the courage to ask any girls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was busying himself with playing his game with no cares in the world when suddenly a large whirl wind blew past him causing everything in his room to scatter haphazardly across the floor. Soon after the sudden gust he was pulled backwards in his chair not even having time to understand what caused the wind or what was going on before being yanked into a black hole that stretched from the floor to the roof dragging him through the event horizon to be flying through a black void. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew through space tumbling from head to toe being dragged along to some unknown place. After just a few minutes of his travels he catches a glimpse of another kid flying past him both of them traveling so fast to seem more like a blur then anything definable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after meeting the only other object on his travels he sees a large hole in front of him coming up fast. He tries to keep up right as he passes through the hole landing on a hard tiled surface smoke surrounding his body as his head starts to slow down from his crazy travel through the black hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he hears a girls voice as she playfully talks about someone paying for something not knowing anything of what she is saying let alone why she sounds like her voice is coming out of a sounds system. He still tries to regain his bearing when before too long some large pinkish sponge like object shoves into his chest knocking him on his back pining him in place. He squirms under this object not being able to move looking up as the fog clears to look in fear as the object that is pining him  down is a foot and that foot is attached to a very large and cute girl with dark hair and wearing a lab coat.</font></span></div></div>",

This is so starting to get on my nerves; when I find that small mouse of a boy he will be in big trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah acts as if she doesn't know where Arthur has gone in his new form. She giggles feeling him start to wiggle in desperation to get out of her top before she squeezes her breast together squishing the small mouse in between her breast. Sarah holds her arm over her chest keeping Arthur snug and tight in her embrace taking joy in hearing him squeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur is in a state of panic not knowing what is going on, disappearing in a flash to reappear in the lab in a new body. <br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it, not only was he back in his tormentors house, but as if things couldn't be any worst he was stuck as a mouse. <br>\r\nThe only thing he could do is keep his \"legs\" moving as the soft warm walls around him close in squishing the air out of his lungs making ever movement he has even harder. He tries to yell out in pain, but only squeaks leave his mouth in his futile attempt to yell for her to let him go. <br>\r\nThe pain stops as a light breaks the darkness and a hand descends from the source of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah has taken her time to make it back to the small glass jar enjoying ever little movement of Arthur's body. Almost sad that she has to take Arthur out from between her breast, but she perks up as she reaches in to clutch her hand around the shoulders of the mouse causing Arthur to squirm in her grip.<br>\r\nShe giggles in delight bringing him up to her face; a delightful smile is plastered on her face before shoving the mouse into the glass jar. She leans over placing a small kiss on the jar pulling away leaving a small mark from where her lips where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turns around with a spring in her step as she jumps on the controls to the side of the ray playing with the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I want to have a tiny pet mouse, I am not the kind of person that would babysit a whiny mouse all day.

You don't mind if they stink, do you, hun?\" she said as she narrowed her eyes with a smirk. She pressed on him with her cheesy socked heel.... rubbed him... she could feel his pleas and moans and whimpering under her heel. \"Awww is my foot being mean to you? Too fucking bad! Hahahaha!\" She raises and slaps her sole on him a few times.</font></span></div></div>",

He becomes numb as his mind just wipes his body flattens and the small grooves from her sole can be seen through is stretched body. He desperately tries to move his muscles just working on trying to move. Sarah's tongue sticks out as she giggles feeling the little bug under her foot still alive and moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! I wish I would of found you sooner because you make the best toy ever. I could go all day just playing with you like silly puddy. The only difference is that you scream when squeezed which makes you the better choice hehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah closes her eyes purring as she rubs her foot across the couch's arm feeling tiny Arthur wiggle only enough to let her know that he is still alive. Her eyes shoot open in a flash as a wicked smile spreads across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!.... hmmm...\", she purrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we give that ray another chance maybe this time I can make you into something like a personal massager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah swings her legs over the edge of the couch giving Arthur just a split second of rest before being her feet down against the floor. By this time Arthur was drenched in sweat out of his mind just focusing on this girl that holds him against his will. The few moments that he does get relief as she walks he protests what she is doing and that it is wrong. Arthur's complaints fall on death ears as Sarah not only does not care for the puddy against her feet, but she enjoys hearing him scream over him being happy. She slowly makes her way back into the lab slowly wandering through the house enjoying Arthur's pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks over to the table that the ray is pointing at to lean against as she raises her foot up. Sarah starts to pull off her sock smiling as she sees the form of her little friend stuck to her feet. Sarah picks at the edges of his body getting a hold to rip him off like a piece of tape. Arthur starts to reform long enough to get in a few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the most evil girl I have ever meet! Why is it that you are doing this too me because I will promise never to bother you again if you just let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiles shaking her head as her mop like hair shakes from side to side with her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\", she is cheery as she rolls Arthur into a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said you just make the perfect little toy. You just happen to have faith working against you with this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tosses Arthur onto the floor strolling over to her ray to point at him and hit the button only giving his body time to half reform.</font></span></div></div>",

He is actually growing! He grins thinking of how to escape now that he was about to be the size of a normal person.<br>\r\nHe opens his eyes confident only to see a Sarah's giggling face right above him. \"Why is she giggling, I'm sure I just grew\" - he thinks.<br>\r\nHe tries then to get up quickly but realizes that he cannot move. He is completely paralized. \" Hey what is happening!\" His vision was blaocked at his right and left side.<br>\r\nThen he realizes what had just happened: the colour, the feeling and his own shape.... He just became a chair! One of those big comfortable chairs with really soft cloth all over it, from the big back to the armrests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe actually had made himself one -he remebered- with the spare cloth and foam that he had found in a shop. And now he was one of them, only a chair, helpless and completely at the mercy of the evil girl to treat him however she wanted.... then he realizes something he hadn't really think about, chairs are used on, but jugding by my point of view...<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sees the chair talking to itself and finds it really funny. The boy had turned into a nice chair and the only part that resembled him was his face, flat on... the cushion...<br>\r\nWaiting fo her to plant her cute butt on it.<br>\r\nShe can't help but laugh in anticipation of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah begins to walk toward the chair. All the instincts of the boy tell him to get away but he can only look at the beautiful lady getting closer.<br>\r\nThen she begins to touch the arms of the chair, \"Wow, you're so soft, boy. I'm so lucky to be wearing this blouse\"<br>\r\nThe boy-chair looks then at her outfit, which wasn't at all the robe she was wearing before. She must had changed at some point while he was crushed in her sock and she was wearing a blouse, which he hadn't been allowed to see because of his imprisonment in the evil girl's sock. A white blouse that let a bit of transparency and that did not cover her legs.<br>\r\nArthur, could see her panties, which where now white and certainly small.<br>\r\n\"Seriously, when did she have time to change her clothes?\" -he thought-<br>\r\nThen he realizes that he is actually seeing the girl in more or less her underwear, and turns red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, really?? blushing?? I didn't actually know that cushions could blush. Well, no need to blush, you will have to get used to it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur sees her playing around a bit more sitting a bit on his arms with a wicked smile.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm really tired, you see? I think I'll have a sear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur begins mumbling: \"No, hey!...wait...listen...!<br>\r\nHis words don't make sense as he sees the round and perfect behind of the girl come down on him. He tries to move but he is completely unable to. As her ass comes down engulfing the cushion completely, he is only allowed to look at her crotch coming down right where his mouth is placed and the rest of her butt smothering his face completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl' pleasure is beyond words as she has absolute control over the living chair under her control. Humilliating him completely as she sits right on his face. Hearing the muffled attempts of the boy to say something that are squashed under her tush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, your face is the most comfortable cushion ever. I really love it, I wonder if I'll ever get up...\"<br>\r\n\"You are just a...!!!\"<br>\r\nAs Arthur has barely managed to get a little space to let his rage out and insult her she slams again her butt on his face. <br>\r\nAnd his words are muffled this time more effectively as she starts grinding her crotch down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk, ysk, didn't your mother told you that you shouldn't use swearwords?\"<br>\r\nShe laughs as he keeps trying to talk under her, it even ticckles her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I have to punish you then\"<br>\r\nAnd she keeps rubbing herself on the cushion while Arthur is completely humilliated at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll relax now\" she says with her butt on his face</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://coconocotoco.deviantart.com/#/d4wfddb\" target=\"_blank\">http://coconocotoco.deviantart.com/#/d4w...</a> (Comic)</span></div></div>",

Her evil grin spread across her face as she started to get up a bit and wait for him to try to say something and then drop herself smothering him again. She started trying diffferent games as he felt her butt cheeks clench, smooshing his mouth between them like a slightly puckered up apperance. She leant back in the chair in fits of giggles knowing he had was unable to resist as she began clenching and unclenching her cheeks on his face. She chuckled bouncing up and down on his face, slamming her jiggling cheeks into his face over and over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes she sighed leaning on the arm rest, resting her chin on a fist \"oh im bored of this now. what else to do with my little toy boy\" she looked thoughtful, occasionaly grinding against him to keep him uncomfortably occupied. finally her eyes lit up, she clicked her fingers. \"aha ive got it\" she stood up and spun to face him with a content little smug grin on her face \"hehe your a boy...so im guessing you would hate something girly huh?\" he looked up at her with a confused expression, a little dent on the cushion that was his eyebrow was arched. \"what are you planning Sarah?\" he asked, glad of the fresh air at the very least. she just chuckled -\"or should I just turn you back into a boy so we can go somewhere out, I would like to go somewhere...\" \"hehe oh well. Just stay still!\" she chuckled at her comment and strolled back over, picking up the ray turning it on his cushioned form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe was a bit reluctant to lose such a fun and comfortable chair, but she could always revert him to this later. after all, he belonged to her now. she fired the ray watching as he was engulfed once more by bright tingling white light. he felt his body arch and twist, expanding and contracting before hedropped down to the ground. As the light faded he saw her grinning down at him \"perfect. you turned out perfect!\" she said clapping her hands.

She rolls her foot around on the floor holding onto the door knob to further play with Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Arthur this turned out to be the perfect situation that you lead me too. If it wasn't for your little weakling knight act I would of never ended up with a small boy to experiment on. Even better now you are just perfect for playing with making you my little boy toy for my enjoyment.\", Sarah cackles at her own thoughts as she opens the door leading to a modest bathroom. She complains as she enters the room noticing how the sweat from her earlier jog is starting to dry leaving a layer of filth on her skin. The only thing keeping her from losing her happy mood is the feeling of clay under her foot as Arthur is squished with each step as the muffled sounds of her socked feet are heard through the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops short of the mirror above the sink admiring herself posing as she shows off her curves. She smirks as the thought of Arthur being lucky enough that she lets him be squished under her cute soles let alone to take a bath with her. She would rather not bath with him, but she may have some fun out of using him to scrub every inch of her until she is spotless. She skips over to the side of the tub to fiddle with the water controls. As she is distracted she doesn't even notice the small tickle as the boy's body starts to inflate making an odd pancake shape with a large ball in the middle. Arthur starts to think out loud to himself in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl is insane before too long she is going to stretch me to a point where I won\u2019t snap back. The problem is with her having so much fun I won\u2019t have a moment to myself to find a way out, but if I take any longer....\", he is cut off as the girl's weight is pressed down on him. The ball of her foot twisting his back into knots as she twists her foot back and forth like one would put out a cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't nice to have a conversation and leave the other person out little boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts her foot off the cold tile floor to peel back the sock revealing a flatten Arthur groaning from the pain. Sarah smiles biting the edge of her lip to pick the boy off her foot to become frustrated as his body is so smashed onto her skin that she has to pick at the edges of the boy to get a good enough flap to peel him off causing his body to be stretched even more from her pulling. The boy yells begging the girl to give him a break only to be rolled up like a small carpet in the girl's hands as she plays with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't want you seeing anything until I am ready for you.\", she almost sings in her playful voice.</font></span></div></div>",

He starts to try and make for the door, but before he can even think Sarah's foot is upon him. This time is different though this time she just puts enough pressure to keep Arthur in place. She sighs and rolls her eyes at how the boy acted being in the bathroom of a cute girl and still trying to scamper away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should just start enjoying yourself you know? I am having a ball playing with you and all you keep doing is yell and try to get away at every chance you get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur is pinned to the floor on his stomach as he tries to push himself up not even budging her foot. He yells in frustration at how this girl just toys with him, and all he wants to do is leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's enjoyable to you because you aren't the one in pain all the time. In fact you seem to like it when I am in pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur grinds his teeth the anger building in the pit of his stomach as this girl holds so much power over him without even trying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be like that there was a few good times as well hehe. Some people even pay for girls to walk on their backs, and here I am doing it free of charge because I like to keep you around.\", Sarah pulls off her top hanging over her foot that traps Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be a good boy and don't peak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winks down letting her foot off of the boy while letting her top drop down over top of him. Her giggling just gets louder hearing the muffled complaints of the boy as a little lump moves about her top. She hurries over to change into her swim suit that she has in the small bath room closet. For Arthur the only thing that he knew was going on is that he was now trapped with a heavy tarp like cloth material over top of him, and he doesn't think that he has enough strength from playing with Sarah to make his way out. He keeps his slow crawl in one direction just hoping that his luck will turn around as he hears the loud footsteps as Alice goes off somewhere else in the room. The sound of her feet slapping against the hard tile floor sending chills down his spine as he thinks back to the torture from earlier. His prison is pulled away quickly as Sarah happily greets him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready or not little guy here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur is about to let her know his complaints, but suddenly freezes with his jaw a gape as he looks up at Sarah. His heart begins to race and he can't find the words he was going to say as he sees the new two piece strawberry pattern swim suit Sarah is wearing. Arthur gulps as she reaches down giggling wrapping her fingers around his body without any fighting from Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.... we just have to get you ready for a bath because I don't want to have to deal with cleaning your clothes if they get wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe still stunted Arthur watches as she opens her palm letting him lay out, and her thumb and forefinger starts to close in grabbing the bottom of his shirt. She pulls up almost ripping his arms off taking his shirt off before tugging on the bottom of his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to undo your jeans before I tear them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks raising an eyebrow noticing how quiet the boy has gotten since she picked him back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, it may be a good idea to close your mouth before I put my toe in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggles as the boy shakes his head undoing the buttons on the top of his pants letting her pull them off leaving him in his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea.... I guess uh..... I might as well go ..... along with this since I don't have a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur blushes looking down at the palm of her hand making her feat of laughter grow. She walks back over to the bath tub to sit Arthur on the edge as she climbs over him to lay out in the water. Arthur can't help but watch as her body passes over him causing a mixed group of feeling to bubble around in his chest. He looks off to the side away from Sarah as she sighs settling into the bath. Arthur is beyond confused at this point of what he should even do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I had this idea that I could get you to help scrub me a little, but I am not really sure where to start...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah ponders giving a cute little expression as she taps her chin looking up at the ceiling.</font></span></div></div>",

She reaches over with her fingertip to lightly brush against his side causing him to jump in surprise and her to giggle in excitement. Arthur feels almost lost since this is the first time that she hasn't just smashed him since he came into her house. He heart starts to beat faster as he actually tosses the idea of doing what she says in his head debating with himself on if he should do what she asks or not. He looks up to Sarah seeing a sad pouting face of this girl that has tortured him all evening, but at that moment all he can think of is this indescribable feeling deep down to wanting to stay with his torturer. He can almost feel the heat come off his face as it turns red from embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...suppose it wouldn't hurt just this once....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah has to bite her bottom lip to keep from yelling in glee at the boy's obedience maybe she wont have to hurt him as much as she thought she would. Sarah turns around to scoop a small piece of shop in her finger nail bringing it over to lay beside Arthur. The small piece is like a entire bar of soap to him. She leans in close, her breasts resting on the edge of the tub in front of Arthur as she leans down to kiss the top of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See if you would just listen and relax instead of always trying to get away than we could have fun sometimes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah lays back content on seeing the blank expression on Arthur's face leaving him staring back at her. She lets her feet rest at the end of the tub hanging on the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead little boy get started...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah purrs watching Arthur shake his head snapping out of his stupor. Arthur feels like he is about to go crazy everything he once knew change except for the fact that he is still going to end up under her feet. He reaches down grabbing the small wet lump of soap before looking down to Sarah's legs that are lifted out of the water. There has never been a site yet to compare to what is in front of him.</font></span></div></div>",

He just couldn't place what it was he was feeling maybe it was just him trying to accept that he was stuck in this situation until Sarah decides to let him leave, but more over does he want to leave now? He almost seemed detached from the world around him while Sarah was also detached from her surroundings. Not by the thought of if she liked Arthur or not, but by the fun she was having with her little pet. She starts to wonder how willing she could make Arthur to his torture if she started flirting with him a little. She has already seen what changing into a bath suit could do to the little guy. He was practically like a little sheep following her every whim. As she watch the little guy come closer to her feet she almost wished that he would fall in the amount of fun she could have would be unbearable. Like having her own squeaking live bath toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word Arthur looked up at the monstrous soles that stand before him now he really knew that he was crazy agreeing to this. He gulped and took the little piece of soap in his hand and started to scrubbing her hill. This task didn't seem all to unreasonable considering to Arthur every ridge in her sole is large enough for him to almost get a finger into scraping out the grim that as built up. As he worked Sarah was in a state of bliss not knowing if she should grab Arthur and play with him or force him to do this all night long. The thought of her skin wrinkling up did not sit well with her though. She slumped farther into the water causing her foot to press against Arthur catching him off guard as she barley pins him against the tiling on the wall of the tub. Small grunts escape from Arthur's mouth, but overall he did not say a word to her. Instead with the lump of soap still in hand he continued to scrub fixation on his task. He even tries to climb up her foot squirming as he tries to make his way from where he was trapped alerting Sarah that something wasn't right. She perks up looking down and noticing how he was wedge. She smirks at her pet readjusting herself to let him slide from under her sole, but not enough to make it easy on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur finally pulls himself up with a final grunt hugging close to her sole scrubbing as he climbs. The little piece of soap dwindling as he goes across until finally he there is none left in his hands once he reaches the top. That doesn't seem to stop him as he starts to rub against each one of her toes just enjoying the feeling of hugging each one. That is until he notices Sarah staring straight ahead at him with a look in her eyes that froze him where he stood. </span></div></div>",

Sarah just smiled watching the poor boy unfold returning to his original shape as she talked, \"Okay I want you to get all cleaned up for our big date tonight. I have a good idea of what I want to do, but I want to keep you guessing because that would make everything so much better!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Sarah wasn't even hiding the joy that she was feeling from toying with the small boy. Arthur on his part just looked up in awe at the evil girl trying to read her face to guess if she was telling him the truth or if she was trying to trick him. It didn't take long for the water to fill up to Arthur's waist making a nice large pool for him to bath in as Sarah gave him wink moving off to clean up for herself. This gave Arthur time to think for himself as he started to splash water all over his body to try and clean off all the gunk that he picked up while being in Sarah's sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There really isn't much getting away from the girl since I can't really climb up the slick surface of this bowl. Not like it would help anyway because she could easily catch me and then I would be in worst trouble....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was now starting to talk to himself trying to keep low enough so that Sarah couldn't hear him. A chill ran up his spine as he heard the girl start to sing while she bathed her voice causing all the torture from earlier to flood back into his thoughts almost as if he was reliving the torture all at once. All Arthur could do was splash the lukewarm water in his face to clear his thoughts followed by the sudden scare that Sarah gave him as he looked up. He was so distracted by his wondering thoughts he never even heard Sarah coming over to look down upon the little Arthur still trapped in the wash bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well little guy, you seem to have had enough fun washing up for our date. I think it is time to dress you up for this restaurant I have been wanting to try forever. It is a little high class so we can't have you walking in looking like you have just been stepped on. Good news for you is I think I have the perfect idea on how I can bring you along with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't for the sight before Arthur he may have been beyond petrified of Sarah's words. Looking down at Arthur was the same girl from before but this time she was cleaned up and wearing a towel around  body to keep decent. The towel covered anything from being seen but for poor Arthur it had the effect of hugging close to Sarah's body stunning Arthur with the sight of Sarah's body.</font></span></div></div>",

The only thing that her actions did was causes her anger to grow as she wasn't used to not getting what she wanted, and now more than anything she wanted Arthur to struggle and plead for her to let him go. A few times while pacing through the house she even passed by the kitchen thinking over the idea of using a few of the sharper instruments to see if she could get Arthur to wake up. The only idea that stopped her from torturing the poor little guy was than she wouldn't be able to play with him anymore if she got carried away with her fun. Her eyes light up with a devious fire behind them as she lowers her gaze to the small mass of skin and clothes balled up in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess~.... If you aren't going to wake up and give me the common curiosity to pay attention when I am playing with you than I will just have to tuck you away somewhere until you wake up. Lucky for you I am nice enough to not mind carrying your little itty bitty body around with me until you do decide to snap out of your stupid groaning fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was already in nothing but a green tank top and a matching par of panties from having to take her clothes off to clean them after her run for the day. She wasn't dressed to impress Arthur in the slightest instead Sarah just did not see Arthur as a person. He was more like a toy or stress ball that belonged to her, so Sarah could do and say anything she wanted to say to Arthur without a second thought. She gave Arthur one last shake picking him up to in front of her face with that smile that would cause a man to freeze from the evil mischievousness behind that grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last chance to make me change my mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur dangles between her fingertips not a word or sound coming out of his mouth. Sarah shrugs feeling that she gave him plenty of time to give Arthur a chance to change her mind. Even though she wouldn't even listen to his pleas anyway, she just wanted to hear some kind of reactions to judge how good of a job she was doing keeping him in pain. Sarah reaches around with her free hand to pull the waist band of her panties open leaving a gorgeous view of two round firm hills that had been covered by the thin material. She dangles Arthur over the opening letting go of the small guy letting him hit the fabric sliding down to wedge in between her cheeks causing a fit of giggles as she feels his body slump nicely into her panties. Sarah gives a little shake to her waist as the fabric pulls Arthur farther between her cheeks giving her a whole new sensation as she walks around keeping a small mental note of where he is, so Sarah can bring him back out for some more fun once he wakes up.</font></span></div></div>",

The intense weight of her entire body pressing down on him. Luckily, her socks provided cushion for our rookie hero Arthur. Sarah soon began to rub her foot into the ground and stand on one leg. She giggled so sweetly and innocently that you couldn't believe how mean she was, more accurately evil! Arthur was being grinded under her sole, experiencing excruciating pain. His body was being polverized for a couple minutes until Sarah finally came to a decision. \"Ooh I know! I can punish you and maintain my slender body.\" with that said she began to jogg out of her laboratory. Each step only seemed to hurt more and more. For Arthur it felt like a track dropped on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-15 minutes later- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah arrives at the gym with a gleaming smile of purely white teeth. She changed from casual cloths to her workout gear of black sweatpants and a black track jacket. On the back of her jacket read \"Princess\" while on the back of her firm behind read \"Evil\" she was dedicated to her intentions. Arthur however remained under the sole of her foot, his time under there should be enough punishment but it didn't seem Sarah was done with him. She entered the gym and quickly scoped out for an open treadmill. Three were open, as Sarah rushed to take her spot. She lands on the tread with a loud -Thump!- she sets the machine on for a 5k run (3.1 Miles) and starts her workout. She had a large purse with her and from it pulled out her iPod. As she sung to her tunes peacefully running Arthur had to use this time to create a plan to not only free himself but be sure Sarah stops her ways. Earlier he imagined a black hole that sucked up her doomsday remote.  Mabye he could do it again? He focused on a black hole sucking Sarah up and off the treadmill. No luck though. Mabye something else? Was it a fluke? He tried imagining her to stop running but she instead began to speed up! Kicking fast and puffing hard to maintain. As the pressure and pain took toll on Arthur he could no longer focus on freedom. Instead he tried to hold out and endure this abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Arthur's dismay Sarah ran for 23 minutes non stop. She walked off the treadmill tired and exhausted. She went to a fountain for water and remmembered her little toy. She took off her sneakers and pulled off her socks. They stuck well to her feet and were moist from sweat. Once off she couldn't help laugh and fall down on butt. She cringed from the little fall but was still smiling when she saw tiny Arthur's body stuck to her foot. The sweat super glued him on face first to her feet. She stood back up and scrapped her feet on the gyms carpet. After three scrapes Arthur peeled off. Flat like paper he remained on the ground. She picked him up and quickly moved him away. \"phew, so do you still feel like a hero?\" Arthur was unable to reply due to his flat and exhausted form. \"well I still feel the need to workout, so how about some...\"</font></span></div></div>",
