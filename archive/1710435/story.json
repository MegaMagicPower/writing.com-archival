You try to open the door, but it doesn't open. <br>\r\nGuys,\" you scream, \"the door it won't open.\"<br>\r\n\"Shhhh..... do you hear that?\" said one of your friends. <br>\r\n\"Yeah let's get out of here!!!\" said your other friend in a terrified voice.

Suddenly you feel the house vibrate a little, then a lot more, and then a whole lot. Then everything is quite then you feel the little house going up the food falls on the floor you try to grab it from fall when you suddenly realize the food is fake. <br>\r\nSuddenly the front door walls open up revealing a huge, hungry-looking eye staring at you. You coward into a comer terrified of the huge eye then you hear a deep voice say, \"Looks like I caught my supper for tonight.\" <br>\r\nYou start to shiver knowing what you are now to the huge creature. It then reveals more of it's face and then it's body. <br>\r\nIt was a giant and you where no bigger than it's index finger. It's pants were old and had holes in them and it's shirt was way too small for it's huge belly.<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" said the giant licking it's lip, \"how shall I have you? Fried? Boiled?....Or raw?\" You grab the courage to say, \"Neither.\" <br>\r\n\"Your right,\" said the giant, \"you shall be seasoned to perfection my tasty little morsel!\" The giant laughs and closes the front door wall imprisoning you inside and then the house starts to shake as the giant walks. <br>\r\nAfter about 2 hours of constant moving you feel yourself being lowered the front door walls open again and you are meet by once again the huge eye as the giant says, \"it's time for my dinner my little friend,\" then a huge hand appears to grab you.

You turn to see another young boy in the corner trying to escape, but the giant grabs him between his two fingers and lifts him out of the cage by his shirt. <br>\r\nThe boy tries to struggle free from the giants hand, but it was no use. The giant lifts him to his eye level and says, \"snack time my tasty, little friend.\" The boy screams, \"No don't eat me, please!\" <br>\r\nThe giant opened it's gaping mouth when suddenly the boy shouts, \"Eat this,\" he then through a grenade down the giants throat hoping that the giant instinctively gulped down the grenade, sending the incendiary explosive deep into it's body. <br>\r\nThe boy allowed himself a smirk, anticipating the explosion that would rip the giant in half. The giant stared curiously at the small boy, puzzled by what it had swallowed. <br>\r\nThere was a loud bang, and the giant's belly swelled slightly for a moment as the grenade exploded harmlessly in it's stomach. The giant blinked at the curious sensation inside it's big belly, and then grinned at the boy. <br>\r\nA chill was sent down your spine as you watched what the boy did to the giant, \"But, that should have blown you tummy to pieces,\" you said, \"why didn't it work?\" <br>\r\nThe giant's grin momentarily disappeared from giant's lips as it opened it's mouth and let escape an uproarious belch.BUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRP! The giant laughed, \"that tickled!\" \"Nice try my little friend,\" said the giant patting his belly, \"but, the stomach has been through so many explosives you can't even count and all failed miserably,\" licking his lips he said, \"now, where were we?\" <br>\r\nThe giant lifted the boy over his open mouth, the boy struggled to find a way out, but the giant let go of him and he fell into the giant's mouth you watch helplessly as the giant tastes the boy for a few minutes before lifting his head and swallows hard you can see the a huge lump in the giant\u2019s throat the giant uses it's finger to trace where you the boy is. <br>\r\nThe lump disappears, but the giant traces the boy, pass it's chest and into it's stomach once there it pats it's belly and rubs it gently. The giant lets out a satisfied burp. \"buuurp!\" The giant licks it's lips and says, \"your next my tasty friend,\" and then he leaves the room laughing. <br>\r\nYou try to find a way out when suddenly.........</span></div></div>",

You quickly grab it and right before the giant grabs your shirt you whack the giants hand as hard as you can. <br>\r\nThe giant's hand retreated and stares hard at you, but then smiles, \"a little fight in you i like that,\" he chuckled and tipped the cage on it's side making you lose you balance and fall on you hands and knees.<br>\r\nThe giant's hand comes again, but you whack with the stick again causing the hand to retreat again.<br>\r\nYou look and say that the cage door is open and you quickly run to the door jump out and make a break for an exit, but the giant stops you by putting it's hand in the way of your path. <br>\r\nTurn to run the other direction when that way is blocked by a hand too and you realize that you are trapped behind hand walls. You look to the only opening of you hand cage and see the giant smile, \"as much fun as this really is,\" he said licking his lips, \"it's dinner time.\"<br>\r\n\"But...but you just ate a boy,\" you say to the giant. \"Yes, but he wasn't very filling,\" said the giant. <br>\r\nThe giant suddenly had and idea, \"say would you rather be stuffed or be left as is?\"<br>\r\nYou say....</span></div></div>",

Do we have a deal?\" The Giant asks you. \"I think we do.\" The Giant places food in front of you. \"Enjoy.
