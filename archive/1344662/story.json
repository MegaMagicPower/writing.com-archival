You following suit right after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you feasted your eyes on something that you haven't seen before.<br>\r\nIn the station was a giant black beast of a locomotive, coal black to be more exact.  It was a 4-8-8-4 (four leading wheels, two sets of eight powered wheels, and a trailing set of four wheels) and probably something that you couldn't possibly fathom going against.  On the coal car the words \"Visons of Mahler.\"  Your friend Scorch probably had the same opinion as his long tung hung out limply from his open jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that you like our new employie'sssss locomotive\" came a silky smooth voice of a female naga slithering up behind them.<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tipany!\" Scorch jumped into attention.<br>\r\nMrs. Tipany, your boss, pointed at a very tall human, about seven foot tall, wearing a black cloak with  long white hair and a thin face that looked like it had endured many years of hard work and pain without getting a single wrinkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our new employee, Mr. Viost Von Ripenstoosh,\" Tipany introduced \"but he prefers to be called Vio though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't rea;ly like him at first, there was somthing not... right about him.  Like a constant feeling of being watched and haunted.<br>\r\n\"Make shure you get along\" Tipany said \"because he is very essential as our loads are getting bigger and heaver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a hard time seeing yourself calmly having a conversation with the man, there wasn't anything wrong, but you couldnt get settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after talking too Tipany you</span></div></div>",

No how small it was though it was a two man job to work, you, being the smarter of the two, was the overall operator and handled the gauges while Scorch handeled the hard labor like working with the firebox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach and every day you did much of the same thing, deliver raw cotton to the factory on the other side of town, then you delivered the mail to a town really close by, and then some other random jobs that can all be summed up as a \"fetch quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday on the other hand, your train had an extra box car to the load that had the words \"Clockwork Shipping\" painted on the side.

The town of Claxton was actualy less of a town and more of plot of land covered in abandond homes and buisnesses that looke like new while everything else was dead.  This is what happens when the government tries to make a town without testing the toxins in the ground and local well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of strange isn't it\" you asked to no one in particular.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Scorch asked<br>\r\n\"That we are actualy delivering a box car to a place that is supposedly abandond\" you replied, you then looked forward to see the drop off point, a...</span></div></div>",

Everyone looked down the track to see a large cloud of black smoke coming from a train that was some distance away.  You notice that even Vio was watching it with great intrest before hopping in his train \"Mahler\" and started it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was up as the runaway train in question was actualy blowing it's whistle, giving out a haunting howl.<br>\r\n\"Is it me\" Scorch asked as he squinted his eyes to get a better look of the train in question \"but does that locomotive have teeth?\"<br>\r\nSure enough, the front of the train had curved metal fangs as it's exterior dripped with a grey slime.  The boiler of the 4-10-2 looked like it had ribs while the cab glowed with a red light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you saw \"Mahler\" start to leave the station, Vio was going after the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then</span></div></div>",
