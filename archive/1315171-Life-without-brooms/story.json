No one would ever know what happened, and It's not like those two were important or anything.\" Everyone in your community has the same attitude to NMO's as Juliet does. They believe that all NMO's are useless beings capable of nothing more than destruction. \"The Council said that they'd give you your powers back in a year if you behaved\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown at what your friend said to you. \"You just don't understand. Even if they are NMO's they still have a family who I imagine care for them very much. How can we allow that kind of thing to happen?\" Juliet shakes her head. \"I'm not saying that you're wrong. I actually agree that something should change, but talk like that won't give you your powers back. There's nothing you can do without your powers anyway. So just be good and wait until they give you your powers back\"</span></div></div>",

The problem with most Witch toys and devices is that so many of them require magic just to use. The Witch community you currently live in is actually just outside of a rather big NMO city in England. NMO's don't tend to go there however, due to the magical enchantments set around the outsides of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, however, you forgot that you have no way into the city, other than your own two feet. You begin walking anyways, because you realize how boring it's going to be without something to do. Luckily the skies are clear, and it's a rather warm day. You find the road that leads directly to the city and begin walking along side it, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having walked for an hour you realize that the city is still a significant distance away and your feet are starting to get sore, but you're still determined and you've already spent an hour walking, so you continue on. Shortly after you see a car pull up alongside you, The driver's side door opens up and you see a man who looks to be in his early twenties step out of the vehicle, \"Hey kid what are you doing walking out here all by yourself?\" He looks down at you, he's at least a half foot taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no kid! I'm seventeen.\" you respond a little annoyed already from having to walk \"I'm heading into the city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe Smirks arrogantly at you then gives a hearty laugh \"Well I'm heading into the city myself, need a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look past him and into the vehicle and notice a backpack, perhaps he's a student. Plus if you got a ride you may be able to get home before nightfall. On the other hand he might have darker intentions then just giving you a ride, and without your powers you'd have a difficult time defending yourself.</span></div></div>",

You move it to the backseat as he gets back into the car. you are about to ask him what's in the bag when he says \"What's your name kid, Where are you from?\" You frown as he calls you a kid again. He clearly enjoys that nickname for you. You tell him your name begrudgingly and tell him that you're from a small town down the way a bit. The man gives you a skeptical look but begins the car, and pulls it back onto the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stay silent for a the next couple of minutes, It's very awkward and you're certain that you should say something, you spend a couple minutes just looking out the window. It's been quite some time since you've travelled by car. You think your uncle owned one when you were little, Usually you'd just travel by broom if you needed to go somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you don't travel much.\" The man points out. you look at him stunned for a moment \"Why do you say that\" He chuckles to himself. The way you look out the window, It's easy to tell\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh  as you sit in the cramped car. all cars seem crowded compared to the wide open sky. \"Are you from the city?\" you ask him politely changing the subject, Trying your best not to give away who you really are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes actually, I've lived there my whole life.\"  you try to add something to that but cannot think of anything smart to say. Again the two of you ride in silence, after a few more minutes he turns on the radio and you listen to music the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get into the city he speaks again \"Where should I drop you off at?\"  You hadn't really thought that farahead yet and weren't sure where you wanted to go. \"I guess anywhere is fine\" He looks at you, but you're not sure exactly what the look on his face means. He pulls the car over a few blocks later. \"Thank you\" you\" You say  as you open the door to get out. You step out and are about to close the door when he shouts \"Wait!\" You turn around confused \"My name is David,\" You feel stupid for not even remembering to ask him what his name was, \"I'm having a party tonight, You should come along.\" He passes you a piece of paper with his name and address on it that you hadn't even seen him write. You take the Paper and close the door without confirming with him. Then you start walking to find what you originally came searching for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will you go to get something to keep yourself entertained with?</span></div></div>",

You give a little sigh of relief, glad that he's going away. Unfortunately you are mistaken. The passenger side window slides open as he drives his car slowly up beside you. \"You'll be walking for at least another three hours\" he advises you as you continue to get annoyed by him. \"I don't care\" You shoot back picking up your pace, which doesn't really seem to affect anything as he is driving beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stares at you for a moment more then shrugs \"Have it your way\" He rolls up the window of his car then begins to drive away. You watch as the car dissapears into the distance as you continue your trek towards the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later, you finally reach the city limits, your feet are aching from the four hour walk, your body isn't used to having to walk for that long.  The sun is starting to set as you continue to walk. You've been to the city only a couple times before so you begin to walk the most familiar path into the city along the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you find a bench to rest on to let your feet recover. You sit down and lie your head back, tired from the heat. You close your eyes momentarily to relax. That was your intention, but you slowly fall into a slumber and begin to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your eyes, you notice it's dark out,  \"shoot\" you say as you sit up.

When someone's looking for answers, what's a better place to search then a library teaming with them.\" Fueled by a sudden spark of hope you turn at the next street. <br>\r\n     The Library looms three blocks ahead. To a NMO it appears to be an abandon hotel, but that's just the glamor the Elder's use to keep it hidden. If they didn't, well let's just say it would be a disaster. In all actuality it is an astounding piece of architecture. It somewhat resembles a Roman cathedral, with giant marble colums and a triangle top like the parthenon. Only, the sculptures tell the story of the first wizard's battle against the NMO's and not the Gods of ancient Greece. In that time they knew about us and used our powers to better themselves. You can't help but long for life in that time. If you had committed your \"high treason\" then, no one would of batted an eyelash. Unfortunately you were not born in that time, and you did not get off that easy. The story of your life. you try and swallow the regret rising like bile in your throat. you should not have been punished for saving someone's life, NMO or not. <br>\r\n     you head for the quartz steps with a reinforced purpose. \"I will not stand aside and let them treat human beings as if they were creatures to waste!\" you tell yourself with a new sense of vigor. You climb the steps and reach the front door. Behind it is a crotchity looking witch sitting behind a desk. She wears her unusually large glasses balancing low on her beak-like nose. Her lips are pursed in something similar to a grimace against a ghostly pale face. Her wispy gray hair is escaping from her bun in every which way, giving her a sort of rabid look. you're already intimidated. <br>\r\n     You try to look calm as you walk by, but hear a none too subtle throat clearing. \"I need your name please.\" Her keen glare stops you in your tracks. \"M.. m.. my name?\" you stutter.<br>\r\n     \"Yes, what you call yourself? Company policy.\" She looks impatient. \"Since when?\" I try to sound polite. <br>\r\n     \"The Chief Council of Elders established the policy a few days ago. Now if I could have your name?\" She is peering at you over her ruby-rimmed glasses now. you're confused. You quickly tell her your name hoping that you don't sound as nervous as you feel. \"I am sorry you are not on my list of magical beings. However you are on the list of recently terminated. I can not allow miscreants in this establishment. The security guards will escort you from the building.\" Now she's smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was an ancient language that NMOs can not see or even understand but you knew what to look for and could read it. One article in particular caught your eye...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'In a mountainous region of Scotland, known as the five sisters, an archeological dig discovered what the NMOs described as an ancient buried mansion. This confused the NMOs and they dug further to find the inside fully intact and untouched even though it had been buried. Two men were sent in to explore the mansion only something was triggered. One man returned from the sight, hysterically claiming the buried mansion was cursed as no other man returned...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard rumors that a powerful ancient magic was lost to the witching world centuries ago.\" you whispered, pondering. \"If that buried mansion holds that lost knowledge and I can return it to the council, they may favor me and grant me my powers back as a reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea had a certain appeal as you knew what to look for when it came to magical traps and how to avoid them, even with no power of your own. You decided to make the attempt, packing everything you thought you might need to raid a magical home without magic. \"It'll be a challenge.\" you assured yourself. \"NMOs have proven themselves powerful in many rights, maybe I can get a feel of that power and understand them more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you had everything prepared and you had ordered the fight to Scotland, stating it was for a holiday to ensure the council did not try to stop you as it could be 'too dangerous'. \"They act like everyone's mother.\" you muttered, walking out to a taxi. \"Oh, well. Off to my 'vacation'.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was worse, you sensed this was not natural. \"I didn't dress for this.\" you whispered, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you spotted a tall gentlemen, holding up a sign with your name on it. You walked up to him and he seemed to recognize you immediately. \"You are right on time, miss.\" he said with a smile on his face. \"I am William. Welcome to Scotland, we were told you were interested in the buried mansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\" you replied, surprised. \"How did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled. \"The council watches after all of their members, powered or not.\" he said, kindly. \"They are actually relieved that you are going onto this 'vacation'.\" he paused. \"We can talk more on the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, understanding that talking about magic in front of NMOs makes them nervous, and followed William out of the airport to his car. Once on the road, minutes later, William said, \"The two archeologists who vanished into the mansion were college students, all NMOs.\" he sighed. \"The team had four members total, the one who managed to get away is now missing as well as the third member of the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has the NMO authorities stepped in yet?\" you asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weather conditions.\" replied William with a deep frown forming. \"Everyone has the feeling this is not natural but we witches know that it was caused by magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something inside the mansion?\" you asked, guessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what the council believes.\" replied William. \"I have been authorized to provide you with a few magical items to help you but no magic power, the spell used to 'turn it off' for a year can not be reversed. It has to run its course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas what I might encounter there?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a legend.\" replied William. \"Thousands of years ago, an unknown group of NMOs tried to obtain magical power with four stolen mystic stones, each holding the power of one of the four elements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you asked. \"NMOs don't know shit about real magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You don't need to know or understand much to work magical artifacts.\" said William with a sigh. \"Briefly, they underestimated the power of the stones and unleashed raw magical energy onto the world. NMOs can not absorb raw magic and you know from your teachings that such magic is very cold. If not contained, it could place the Earth into a second ice age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"Why did the stones release raw energy?\" you asked, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe NMOs who stole the stones, not having any magic, did not have the knowledge to focus it into something they could absorb.\" replied William, simply. \"You have that knowledge so you can focus that magic long enough to have a chance to stop the portal from being opened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Portal?\" you asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raw magic exists in another realm along with magical creatures such as dragons, unicorns and the such.\" simply,  William replied. \"Witches can channel into that realm and use magic. The stones opened a portal to that world, allowing the raw magic that exists there to spill into our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did they close the portal so long ago if they did not understand magic?\" you asked, curious.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way they knew how.\" said William. \"They kidnapped a young woman and threw her into the portal as a sacrifice only they did not know that the woman was a witch. She sacrificed herself to seal the portal... from the other side. Only, as revenge, she buried the entire town, including the mansion, to prevent the stones from ever being used again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is deep.\" you said, rattled. \"Do you think those four NMOs may have found the stones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just hope they're merely trapped in the buried town.\" said William. \"We'll be at the dig sight in about five minutes, good luck, miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"I have a feeling I'll need it.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the same time, you feel a small amount of magic within you. It was not much but it was definitely magical power. \"Curious and more curious.\" You mutter. \"At least I have some magic to use in an emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back to the car and open the driver's side door to sense more magic inside.

The eight ball vanishes, leaving the regular shifter and you feel more magic within you. It was a very small amount but it did boost your confidence. You look about for clues to find a set of keys on the passenger seat and a magical item, an enchanted mirror. Taking a chance, you pick up the mirror to find a woman's face looking back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, brave soul.\" she says. \"Whoever you are, where ever you came from, go back while you still can.

It was more to set up a base camp than anything else.
