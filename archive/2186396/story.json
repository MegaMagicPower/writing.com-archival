School was a drag and for what, taking a bunch of college classes that had nothing to do with your desired career? These teachers acted entitled and snobby even though your giving them money and this isn't highschool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing up your tablet, you smile as you see some of the furry art you drew. It was times like this that you calmed down and breathed. But sadly you had to get some rest and put your tablet on its charger. Crawling into bed you huffed as you thought of all your drawings before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know things were about to get big....and furry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat anthro do you wake up to looming over?</span></div></div>",

The giant seemed to be lost in thought as he stared at the notepad. The fact that he wasn't paying attention to you made you feel a little at ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the wolf turned around and walked to the other side of the room. His booming footsteps shook you to the core. \"Just how big is that thing?!\" You thought quickly getting to your feet and running away. You didn't have a plan but you did know that you had to hide somewhere quick. Looking ahead you saw what appeared to be a massive pencil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer you realised that you were shorter than the pencils thickness! \"Wait, is this world big or am I small in this world?\" You wondered. Suddenly you felt the booming footsteps again and they were getting closer. Panicking you ran to around and hid behind the pencil praying the wolf wouldn't see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Carl I understand the materials for the job have been order.\" The wolf said in a tired voice. Peaking around the corner of your hiding spot you saw he was talking on the phone to someone. \"Yes, I will be on site tomorrow.\" You could make out another voice on the other end of the phone and that person sounded pissed. The wolf and this unknown person talked a little more before the wolf hung up and practically slammed the phone onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force caused you to yelp and fall over. \"What a dickhead.\" He growled and reached for the pencil you were hiding behind. Your heart sank when the pencil was taken away revealing your presence. \"What the?\" The wolf leaned in and snorted in disgust. \"Another damn bug?\" The wolf crossed his arms. \"I've been crushing you little ants all day in my garage I swear that exterminator I called doesn't know how to do his job.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf grabbed a nearby magnifying glass. \"Well, lets see what type you are before I introduce you to my boot little guy.\" He said hovering the massive piece of plastic and glass over you. The wolf leaned in and muttered. \"What kinda fucking bug is that?\" He wondered. Awkwardly you raised your hand and waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf jumped back and yelped in fright. You screamed as the magnifying glassed crashed landed beside you. Thankfully it missed you completely. The wolf slowly approached again and hesitantly reached for the magnifying glass. He hovered it over you again and muttered. \"What are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat and said I a polite voice. \"H-hello my name is Zack and I'm a human.\" The wolf just tiled his head. He saw your lips moving but couldn't make out any words. Slowly he leaned his head in closer and hovered his fuzzy ear directly over you. The size difference was terrifying but you managed to choke out. \"Hello my name is Zack and I'm a human!\" You said louder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf pulled his head away and looked at you in surprise. \"Y-you talk!\" He boomed above making your ears ring. \"Yes! Please don't shout!\" You groaned covering your ears. The wolfs ears folded in realization. \"Sorry.\" He said in much quieter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, err what are you, why are you so tiny and why are you in my garage?\" You explained to the wolf that you had no idea how you got here and how you don't why your so small and that you just woke up here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf gave you a funny. \"So, your some tiny alien that just magically appeared in my garage?\" You rubbed the back of your head. \"Sorry but that's really all I know I swear I'm not lying!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid the wolf believe you?</span></div></div>",

Deep manly voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while you wipe the sleep form your eyes you clearly hear one of the what you assume voices as it said, \"Aww, what a cute little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he sure is adorable.\" Another voice remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why is he so small? Do you think something happened to him?\" A thrid deep voice commented, with concern clearly in it's tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this you finally are able to get a clear view of who was talking about aong themselves. However, upon doing so you let out a loud gasp as you see four giant sized heavily muscled anthro guys surrounding you. But when you take a closer look at them you see that one of them is a raccoon who is wearing only a pair of jean shorts, you then look to the far right and see a German Shepherd who is only wearing a speedo. This was followed by a panther only he was wearing a pair of tight pants. Lastly there was a skunk who was also shirtless who was wearing a pair of sweatpants. You then find yourself blushing upon realizing that all four of these anthros are shirtless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then find yourself being gently picked up by the anthro skunk. And once you were brought to his face you saw his features looked a bit aged like he was in his early 40's. In fact that loked to be the case for all four of these anthros. And as you knew this meant that four of these super buff anthro men were what were known as \"Daddies\" very \"Big Daddies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were brought out of your thoughts when the skunk asked you, \"Hey little guy, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, y-yes, sir. I'm okay.\" You meekly replied, as yet again you found yourself blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you saw the skunk wave his free hand in the air as he responded back with, \"No need to be shy. Also there's no need to call me or any of others sir, son.\" You saw that same free hand place itself onto the center of his huge pecs when he added, \"But I we'd best introduce ourselves to you. The name's Stan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw the raccoon give you a soft smile as he told you, \"My name is Roger, little guy. And I'm glad you're okay and not hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked over at the German Shepherd and saw him bounce both of his huge pecs in your direction once he had said, \"And my name's Frank, little man. It's nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the panther wink over in your direction when he bowed and introduced himself with, \"And I'm Marcus. It's a pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that you know our names, what's your's little guy?\" Stan asked, which caused you to look back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my name's Will. And it's nice to meet all four of you guys.\" You told the four giant anthros males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Will, since you seemed to show up out of nowhere I think all four of us can agree that you'll be staying with us in our duplex with us. This way we'll know that you're safe.\" Roger told you, with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well thank you. But do all of four you really live in a singel duplex together?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not exactly.\" Frank pointed out, which caused you to look over at him. And up doing this he want on with, \"Because you see little man, Stan and Roger live on this side of the duplex while Marcus and I live on the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But since all four of us have been friends for years we all decided to all rent out a duplex together. So we sometimes hang out on either side of the home without any issues.\" Marcus explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" You let out, as you processed that information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you did this you heard the skunk's voice again when he asked, \"However, even though we now have a fifth cute and young little roommate I think each of us should spend some one on one time with you, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I agree. And it's works out since we each have different jobs that have different schedules.\" Roger pointed out, with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe the little man wants to spend time with all five of us big sexy daddies?\" Frank asked, while he flexed his huge muscled for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think either option sounds lovely.\" Marcus agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Will what will it be?\" Stand asked you, before you saw all four big anthro daddies look at you with excited smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was quite a lot to take in. However, it seemed like your dream with coming true in a way. But now the question was who would you spend time with first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a moment you just stare at their mature, handsome features, somewhat still convinced that this must be a dream. A dream come true no less. Its not possible that 4 hot furry daddies double your height and at least 3 times your weight would be so willing to get you to move in with them... was this for real..? gosh, even if it isn't, you're deffinitely not complaining and start weighting your options with a grin on your face and butterflies in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst - there's Stan, the dreamboat skunk that helped you off the floor so kindly, shirtless showing his powerfully built albeit soft looking white chest and belly, no definition but barely any fat as well, just a comfortable looking white midsection with pure black everywhere else, making it really difficult to see any muscle definition, even if you're sure that by his sillouete, he's just as massively muscular as his roomates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes keeping going down and down his gorgeous front and you see that despise him wearing some loose sweatpants, his thick tighs still bulge inside and gosh, your face actually gets really hot and flushed red after noticing the immense yet casually concealed bulge inside. He's MASSIVE and going completelly commando! He sees how red you've become and grins at you, casually shifting his weight from one foot to the other, so that his cock and balls would also shift heavily inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly avert your eyes, trying to hide your painfully hard bulge and looks at the racoon besides him, Roger's his name you recall, noticing his sweet face and his caring look underneath his dark facial mask. He's wearing only a pair of jean shorts with frailed rim, pulled taught by girthy tighs and his - gods, him too - also very impressive bulge jutting out, and calves bigger than your entire torso underneath. Of all 4, he's the de facto smallest but that barely means anything to guys their size, his impressive physique is carefully conditioned for definition, looking amazing in his gray, black and brown short coat. He looks happy that he got your attention on him and winks, flexing and posing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger looks like a cool, chill guy to be with, but you still want to weight your options, you're still super flustered but super happy to be able to pick and choose amogst dreamy gods like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is the German Sheppard, Frank, and he was already striking poses and jerking his hips and his -FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFuck you cant even describe it, how is this real??? Its immense and looks so heavy and so hot, the bulge goes almost to his knees but also arches a good foot forward inside his comparatiely tiny, overflowing red speedos, you're not sure if he's some kind of bodybuilder or lifeguard- at his roomate Marcus, that is seductively caressing his chest with one of his midnight black paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both notice you staring and Frank starts posing for you instead - he's the tallest, but also the most massivelly built guy in the room, and apparently the biggest show off too. He's grunting as he flexes and with one eye squeezed close in concentration asks ''So you like the biggest, little man? You're deffinitelly gonna like me and Marcus's room, we could even make you a god like us if you wanted! But I think it would be better to have you on top of us worshipping whenever we're free after work instead'' he boasts, his bulge coming to life dangerously close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything, Marcus pushes him back, bending over to be eye level to you - his ass pressed firmly to Frank's now hidden but no doubt hard as diamond bulge and his face centimeters in front of yours. His gorgeous visage, calm eyes and alluring minimal smile calming you down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then says ''He's just joking, my dear, he likes to impose on new guys - <i>specially</i> if they look so interested and exotic as you'' he winks and continues ''I agree that it would be a thrill to have you with us, and if he goes overboard you can count on me to keep you safe from his antics'' he says confidently, making small circular motions with his powerfull, perfect bubble butt on the dog's package, which now you see has extended past the middle of Marcus' beautifully built back, the panthers' tail teasing around Frank's neck and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind's mush at this point, they're amazing. Perfect even. You got jackpot big time. It's so perfect, no matter how much you think it over you can't make your mind. You're a little aware of what your next words might do, but you say them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''W-why not all four?'' you begin saying, trembling with emotions ''You all look like amazing guys and it wouldnt be fair to just pick at random the hottest'' this got a few raised eyebrows and flirty glances going again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Are you sure you know what you're asking, son?'' asks the dreamy skunk ''Are you sure you'd be able to handle all of us..? Even in turns?'' he continues devilishy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I think he meant as in spending some time with all of us to see which he connects best'' corrects Roger, giving a soft elbow blow to the skunk's white side ''I approve, he's super tiny but he should be able to choose what he likes in the end. I won't forgive you guys if you break him tho, just a warning'' he finishes resolute. It seems like he respects your desires but also cares for you, to the point of fighting his friends to keep you safe if they try something dangerous with you for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, I don't like sharing, but if it's the way to showing the little guy who's in fact the best, why not? I'm deffinitely not losing'' agrees Frank, now shamelessly hugging Marcus from behind and grinding into him, kissing the panther's neck and biting his dark round ear lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Purrrrrr.... not everything has to be a competition you know, you dog'' the model of a panther purrs ''let him do as he wishes, Im sure he wont be disappointed either way'' he winks at you then closes his eyes and continues enjoying Frank's treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe it. It actually worked! All 4 musclebound dreamboat daddies are in for some sharing, you get to experience them all fully! No less, they probably will compete now to see who takes you first~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move closer and closer until you're almost directly under them now, they all stop and look curious as what you're up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sooo, since Im staying with no one yet, where can I spend the night?'' you ask innocently, well aware of all you're doing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''My be-!'' starts Frank excited but is quickly slapped in the head by the fit raccoon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''He can stay the sofa-bed in our room upstairs'' Roger states surprisingly possessive, already moving his arm to pull you into his frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why your room, dare I know? Its not like he'd not be safe and sound with me around!'' the panther protests while struggling free of Frank's hold and pulling you in from the other arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Guys, guyss! Stop this, its silly!'' Stan gets in between the two argueing titans of fur and muscle and frees you ''It's saturday, lets just do like old times and sleep together on mattresses down here! Neutral territory, no one works tomorrow... and before <i>any</i> of you ask, its not gonna be a normal sleepover, just movies and sleeping tonight, ok?'' he finishes staring intently at one particular dog<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What? I wasnt gonna ask for an orgy tonight..!'' complains an still annoyed Frank ''hm... hmm...... okay, I was gonna ask for that, but we dont need it tonight if we have a new guest!'' he caves under Stan's intense gaze, who looks satisfied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But, are you sure you want a sleepover tonight? We'd need to move all the furniture around and carry the matresses over here'' nags Marcus surpisingly lazy of a sudden<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah Im sure, it'll be a piece of cake - and we can show off a little to the boy as well'' Stan confirms, and with that they all scramble and start making preparations for the night<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow them around like a eager puppy helping whatever way you could, but being so much smaller, their mobilia just wouldn't budge; so in turn you spend the next 20 minutes just watching the show of 4 strong beasts carrying stuff around and making beds on the floor in front of a large flatscreen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What do you wanna watch?'' asks the Roger curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whatever you put, make it cool - with explosions if you can find any - just dont put any of this sobby, romantic stuff okay?'' says Frank, ironically suggling behind Marcus, who's purring happily hugging a giant pillow. Geez, they sure seem very close, you muse devily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, what's going to be?'' asks Stan also curious</span></div></div>",

Little did you know the entrance was actually normal size and you in fact shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground began to lightly thump and the sound of crunching gravel ranged out. The source was coming from the cave and grew more intense as a colossal figure stepped into the light. You gasped at the sight of a giant Charizard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering over you, the Pokemon was different from its original. Charizard's body was more human in structure, his orange scaled bod had a muscled physique. His arms were long and were toned at the biceps. He had large pecs and the usual round belly had a six pack colored in a lighter creme. The clothing holding the large bulge was a mere jockstrap above his thick thighs and in front of you was his large feet with plump soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard's snout was slightly covered by his large pecs with orange nipples.

Looking up your eyes widened in shock as you saw a dressing room fit for a giant! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were multiple casual clothes draped over numerous chairs and fancy suits all hung up in a open closet. You soon heard a door click, and looking at the giant inhabitant entering the room, your jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant had the body structure of a 6'7 tall man, however his body was covered in yellow fur and his head was that of a Pikachu! Looking at his body you couldn't help but blush. The anthro Pikachu had a defined six pack, a pair of bulging biceps, two large pecs, and a pair of large feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dressed in a tight orange and black fighting suit that squeezed his muscles, allowing a clear view of them. In his right hand was a mask with the same colors as the suit. The Pikachu ran a paw through his messy hair as he brought his hulking body to a mirror, giving you a view of his muscled back and firm rump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They put up a good fight, but In the end I still won!\", the anthro spoke passionately as he flexed both of his arms, making the veins bulge out and his tail wag happily. His voice was deep but had an energetic flare to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu suddenly turned around, walking to the desk you sat on. You watched in amazement as the muscle god began to loom over you. Looking up the face of the Pokemon was mostly covered by his large pecs. You decided getting his attention might be the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um hey! Down here!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu's ear twitch and he looked over his strong chest down at you. At first he squinted his eyes before leaning down. The Pikachu raised an eyebrow at you. \"That noise. Was...that you little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu's face suddenly lit up as he grinned. \"I can't believe it! Can you speak again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H..hello\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu let out a cute chu~ as he smiled at you. His eyes suddenly widened and he gasped. \"Oh sorry! I haven't introduced myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching a fist, the Pikachu hit his toned chest and grinned. \"The names Zapp! I'm the fifth time Pokemon Tournament champion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my name is Ryan. And I'm a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp looked at you awe. \"Whoa! I've never seen your type before, I wonder if there are human type fighters. Are they as tiny as you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sweatdropped at Zapp's misconception of you being a pokemon. Still you should roll with it. \"Um yeah, but I'm not really a fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I see, hehe I was kinda worried. Fighting you at this size might hurt you....oh but don't worry I'd never hurt you Ryan.\" Zapp chuckled rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt a wave of sadness. You suddenly are in a new world and tiny. Zapp seems nice but would other pokemon be the same?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan? You ok man?\", Zapp asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's just....I don't know how I ended up here and being lost is kinda scary.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt a smooth and furry warmth rub your head. Looking up, you saw Zapp rubbing your head with his thumb pad. He gently smiled at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't get sad now, I'll tell you what I'll look after you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp gave a toothy smile. \"I'll keep you safe Ryan, you won't have to worry when your giant buddy protects you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling gratefully and blushing, you nodded and Zapp gave a thumbs up<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAfter some time, you and Zapp began to chat. Within minutes, the Pikachu acted like everything was normal. He drank from a water bottle and kicked his large feet up on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are all Pokemon in the tournament so....buff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm not all of them. There have been a few lean champions, my trainer just gives me a strict routine to follow. In the end I get all this!\", Zapp smiled as he flexed his biceps and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your head down to hide your blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you decided to........</span></div></div>",

One had an anthro Pichu sitting on Zapp's shoulders. Both were in casual clothes and smiling.  The next one had a Raichu in a white tuxedo with a Pikachu in a wedding dress. The Raichu was holding the Pikachu's head to his chest.  The last one had Zapp in his fighting outfit, and next to him was an anthro Greninja in a yukata. Zapp had his arm around the Greninja and both were kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're looking at my photos?\", Zapp asked, his voice bringing you out of your observing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and soon pointed to the photo of the Pichu. You then looked up and over at the giant anthro Pikachu and asked, \"Is that your son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp chuckled at the question before he replied, \"No that's my little brother Spark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised a little while you followed up the frist question with, \"So then, are those your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....they are.\" Zapp let out, to which you noticed his voice had gained a sad tone to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you saw the Pikachu looking at the photo with a sad gaze. This prompted you to completely face him before you asked him, \"Zapp? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question seemed to break him out of his dazed like state as he replied, \"Huh? Oh yeah sorry Ryan. It's just....looking at that picture brings up some bad memories.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\", You asked, while you noticed Zapp began to rub his fingers together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents....passed away a few years ago. Spark was only a baby when it happened.\", Zapp explained, to which he rested his fingers back on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to also form a sad expression on your face when you told him, \"Oh. I'm sorry Zapp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp shook his head before he reassured you with, \"It's ok. It was hard at first taking care of him and trying to finish school. But luckily I was scouted to become a fighter, and now Spark is one of my best supporters!\", Zapp then began to speak passionately again as he crashed his knuckles together and kept on going, \"When I hear him cheering for me, i have more then enough strength to win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled at his energy as you commented back, \"Yeah I can relate in a way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after you had uttered these words though you saw the heaivly muscled Pikachu give you a curious exxpression when he asked, \"Oh Ryan, do you have a sibling too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. I grew up in a orphanage. Me and a lot of older kids helped take care of the younger ones. Though in the end they were adopted while I wasn't.\" You explained as the past memories began to plague your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt Zapp scoop you up in his palm, before hugging you by pressing you against his right pectoral. His loud heartbeat and soft fur put you at ease. Both of you sat in silence, though you could hear light sniffling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard Zapp's voice when he let out, \"Thanks for the talk with me, Ryan. It's been a long time since I could open up to someone like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had told you this Zapp then set you back down on the desk, and you and him smiled at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of time had passed the mood lighten up quite a bit. Zapp had even taken off his top to let his muscled torso breath. You decided to ask about the last picture when you asked him, \"So who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon asking this question saw the anthro Pikachu bring up one of his huge arms while he rubbed the back of his and admitted, \"That's Kaeru, he's currently my ex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Currently?\" You wondered, while you tilted your head to the side out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp then moved that same arm away from the back of his neck and scratched his cheek when he confessed, \"Yeah, he left to go tour the regions about a month ago. We figured it'd be best to take a break and try to reconcile when he gets back.\", Right after this though the Pikachu leaned back in his chair. He suddenly clapped his hands together and looked back down at you and added, \"Alright, we visited the past enough for one day!\" Zapp placed his palm beside you. And taking the offer you crawl onto the soft paw pad. Standing up from his seat, he made his way to the closet and began to pick an outfit. This made you realize that he seemed to be dressing up to meet someone. You then saw Zapp look down at you again when he went on with, \"Hey Ryan, wanna meet....</span></div></div>",

However, if the anthro Pikachu was taking you with him, then you obviously didn't have a choice. And along with that the giant electric mouse seemed to be excited to introduce you to his trainer. And so with keeping that in mind you looked up at him and replied, \"Sure, I don't see why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! So just let me get dressed. Then we can go and see him at a local diner that's close.\" Zapp said, with joy clear in his voice as he grabbed a sleeveless shirt and a pair of jeans before walking back towards the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he had done this you were then gently placed back onto the wooden surface and he walked a few feet away from you to get changed. While he did this though you quickly looked away to give him some sort of privacy upon seeing him remove the bottom part of his wrestling gear. However, from the corner of your eyes you could easily see a large bulge inside of a pair of tight looking red underwear. This caused you to blush a deep red as you saw him blush a little as well once he had saw you look away. You then heard the giant anthro Pokemon let out a light chuckle of embarrassment while he let out, \"Oh sorry about just changing right in front like that, litle guy? I guess I'm just so used to there being no else in my dressing room with me that it's kind of become a habit of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing his explanation you let out a light cough to get rid of your blush when you replied, \"I-It's okay. But um anyway what's your trainer like, Zapp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a little while you heard nothing but silence from the giant anthro mouse. That is until you saw his shadow go over you again and he placed his hand in front of you to get onto it again. And as you did this you saw a bag that was over his right shoulder which you figured he had put his wrestling gear into as he told you, \"Well, my trainer is a pretty strict guy when it comes to getting me ready for my matches. But outside of training his one of nicest people I've ever met. He was even one of the people who suggested I become a wrestler to support myself and my little bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see. In that case then I can't wait to meet him.\" You responded back, while Zapp began to walk out of his dressing room after closing the door to it.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIt took about ten minutes or so until Zapp arrived at a small diner with you still in his right hand. And once he had entered the room you heard an deeper voice then Zapp's greet him when it commented, \"Ah, there you are, Zapp. Glad you could make since we've have to go over tactics for your upcoming opponent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to look towards one of the tables in the diner. And once you ahd done so you felt your eyes go wide in both shock and amazement as the giant Pokemon that was walking towards both you Zapp was in fact a heavily muscled....</span></div></div>",

You saw that he wore jeans that stretched over his toned legs and noticeable bulge. On the top part of his body he wore a button up shirt with the top four buttons undone, which gave you a glimpse of his black furred pecs. The sleeves seemed to be painted on with his bulging biceps. And when you saw his face you saw that it had a few lines along the features and a little bit gray in his cream fur thus showing his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Pokemon then proceeded to grasp each other's hands while their biceps were flexing as they smiled at each other. Zapp then followed the Arcanine back to the table while keeping you leveled with his strong chest. And after both of them had sat down, Zapp looked at his trainer with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, before we start I wanna introduce you to someone!\", Zapp excitingly said before holding his palm with you on it out to the Arcanine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously looked into the dog Pokemon's eyes. The Arcanine's eyes narrowed, thoroughly examining you. You decided an introduction was needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..hello sir! My name is Ryan!\", you called out, trying not to stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine brought his face closer to you. You could feel his hot breath blast your body, and his dark eyes stare into yours . Eventually the Pokemon leaned back and looked at you with a slight smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I know me and Zapp are tall but this is just ridiculous!\" The Arcanine joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Zapp begin to laugh and you looked down as your face heated up. Bringing your head back up you saw the Arcanine bring one of his giant fingers forward and smile at you when he told you, \"Nice ta meet cha kid. The name's Blaze.\" You slowly grasped the furry finger and gave a shake before giving a grin and nodding.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAfter the introductions, Zapp set you on the table. Giving you a below view of the two giants and their occasional flexing. The both of them discussed battle tactics, mostly about Zapp facing rock and grass type anthros. They would occasionally make small talk on other topics while also asking you for your personal thoughts on certain things. And as three of you chatted away you also took bites out of Zapp's berry pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the table shifted as....</span></div></div>",

Be back soon! Oh and Ryan, you can have the rest of my pie!\", Zapp cheerfully said as he rushed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you saw Blaze gazing at you. He soon brought his orange paw down to which you climbed onto. The Arcanine rested his head on his other paw as he looked calmly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...do you compete too?\" You asked, trying to start a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze chuckled before giving you a friendly smile and answered back. \"Not anymore, but you better believe I was back when I was in my prime. I had an eight year winning streak! But now I help out Zapp and make sure he gives his all.\" Blaze then finished it up with by flashing you a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awed at the Arcanine words as commented, \"Wow l thought you fought in tournaments too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gave a good flex with his bicep, making you see the veins pulse through the fur when he told you confidently, \"I might not compete anymore kid, but these muscles aren't going anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your blush come back before a thought struck your mind. You then looked up at the fire type dog and asked, \"So, how did you and Zapp meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gained a somber smile while he asked, \"I'm taking it he told you about his family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this you nodded your head which caused Blaze to sigh before he explained, \"Well when I met Zapp he wasn't the same happy Pikachu. Back then I saw a kid struggling to finish high school and take care of his brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted a worried expression to form on your face as you wondered, \"Didn't he have someone to look after him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze closed his eyes and sighed once more before scratching the back of his head. He then told you, \"No. Zapp had just turn eighteen and it was either getting separated from his brother or becoming his legal guardian. All that stress can mess up someone his age, and so I told him to meet me at the gym. When we worked out I told him to turn all his stress, anger, and sadness....into strength. With that strength we discovered his passion of fighting and entered him into tournament fighting. Now, he has a good source of money and a passion for fighting that rivals many senior fighters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Blaze's story, you felt amazed but also sad. Not only could you relate to Zapp's past, but you felt even more separated from your old life. Blaze picked up on your dillema as he felt water drip onto his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, You ok kid?\", Blaze asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....so..rry\" you let out,, as you sniffed and then rubbing your eyes. And once you had done this you went on with, \"It's just....i can relate to Zapp and I wish the bad memories didn't come....back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could remember all the young kids you helped raise at the orphanage. How they cried and wanted you to be adopted with them. But you had to put on a fake smile and persuade them to go. And once you were old enough the owners of the orphanage helped you get into college. Although you quickly found out that it was quick stressful when trying to take a lot of classes at one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon felt a cool surface embrace your body. This caused you to look up to which you saw Blaze had pressed his snout against your body and closed his eyes. He thne comforted you with, \"I can tell. You have negative feelings as well. But it's okay, I helped Zapp so now....I'll help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after saying this Blaze then brought his head up and smiled at you. You soon smiled and wrapped your arms around his snout feeling the warmth from his body.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nA few minutes had passed before you and Blaze moved on to another topic as the fire anthro dog said, \"So I'm thinking we can start with some sit ups and maybe you and Zapp can spar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the match would last a second! All he would have to do is stomp me!\" You pointed out, with a worried look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't condone cheap tactics!\" Blaze explained as you took another bite of pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the wait, there was a line!\", Zapp called out as he arrived back at the table. You and Blaze just smiled at the Pikachu. You would wait until the next training session to tell Zapp the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the two anthro Pokemon........</span></div></div>",

To which Blaze got up to pay at the counter while Zapp held you close to his chest to hide you. Once that had been done the two anthro Pokemon then walked out of the diner into the bright lit night streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, so you still up for that nightime workup?\", Blaze asked Zapp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu gained a surprised look before looking down at you with a sheepish smile as he admitted, \"Ah man, sorry Ryan. I forgot me and Blaze were gonna hit the gym after we ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head up at the anthro electric mouse while you reassured him, \"It's okay. In fact I think going to the gym would be cool. I'm hoping we can have a workout together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing you say this you saw Zapp gain a happy grin while he said, \"Really? Man I can't wait! I can show you my moves and compare muscles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Blaze just smiled as Zapp happily ranted. You were only here a few hours, but you came to like the giant Pikachu.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n You soon realized that  since it was nightime there weren't many other anthro Pokemon out. Because of this Zapp placed you on his large broad shoulder. Having a view up here allowed you to see all the brightly lit up buildings and signs. And on the way to the gym Zapp told you about this city. It was called New Kanto, and was the largest city in the region. It functioned mostly as a place for visitors with numerous stadiums, restaurants, hotels, and activity centers. Most of the anthro like Pokemon were actually tourists as the few residents here were either celebrities like Zapp or workers running the facilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the three of you arrived in front of a large white building. This cuased your eyes to widen in awe as you commented, \"Whoa, that's the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze chuckled before he replied, \"Yep, not only does it have the best equipment, but you also get the chance to relax in the bath house when your done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp gently grabbed you and held you to his chest as they entered. Once inside a Machamp gave a friendly greeting before giving them both keys with thier name on it. And after a bit of walking had been done you were finally removed from the yellow chest fur as Zapp placed you in a locker and said, \"Hey sorry about that. You gonna be ok working out in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still were wearing the clothes from your world. A pair of jeans with a black and yellow shirt. You nodded up at the Pikachu, receiving a grin in return. To which Zapp then began to strip out of his attire. You blushed as the anthro mouse's huge furry muscles were revealed right in front of you to see. And upon bending over to pick up his clothes you saw Zapp's underwear ride up in between his firm cheeks. The Pikachu then put on a black tank top and gym shorts, and a pair of leg guards that went from his shin to the bottom of his paw. Finally he took the longer fur on the top of his head and pulled it back into a small ponytail. He then placed his hand down for you to which you then carefully walked onto Zapp's warm palm. Blaze walked next to Zapp wearing similar attire. As they walked out of the locker room you looked at the other anthro Pokemon that were in the weight room. There was a buff Lucario lifting weights, and a surprisingly muscled Snorlax doing push ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then!\", Blaze announced, as he clapped his paws together along with gaining a more serious look.  You then saw his gaze move to you when he added, \"Now Ryan, if you're going to work out with us then you need to work just as hard as we do. Even if your small that doesn't mean I'll go any easier on you.\" You gave a nod In understanding to which Blaze gained a slight grin before he kept going with \"Okay, I'm thinking we can start with........</span></div></div>",

Especially since they were huge compared to you. As a matter of fact when you looked back over at the anthro Arcanine you noticed that besides having slightly larger muscles then the anthro Pikachu, he also seemed to be about five inches taller then Zapp. This caused you to realize that he would be at seven feet exactly if he was at a normal human height. However, these thoughts were quickly put to the side when you saw the buff Pikachu look down at you when he asked, \"So are you ready to start working out, little buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer though you heard a very deep voice when it interjected with, \"I know it's not any of my business. But I do not think making that human use the same equipment is very smart. Which I'm surprised either one of you didn't take that into account. I mean I know you both train hard. But there is surely an easier way for that little one to become stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that had been said you felt Zapp turn around to face whoever had said this. And upon doing so you realized that it was the heavily muscled Lucario you had seen earlier. And as you took a better look at him you noticed that he seemed to be about a few inches taller then Zapp, but shorter then Blaze, which to you meant that he must be six feet and ten inches in height. However, unlike both of them he seemed to have the largest and most defined muscles out of the three. But once you had stopped starting at the tight looking black workout shorts he was wearing you saw that he had put down the weights he had been lifting and was wiping his forehead off with a towel. While he did this you heard Blaze let out a light chuckle when he commented, \"You know I wouldn't expect anything less from you, Lucas. Since you always did look out for the smaller people once you became a fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that had been said you saw the two anthros shake hands before Zapp also shook his hand before he told him, \"It's good to see you again, friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to see both of you as well. But if you are both going to workout then please allow me to hold onto that small human for you. Because I'd hate for him to get hurt by accident.\" Lucas suggested, as he extended a hand towards the Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing so though you saw a sad expression on the well muscled anthro's face as he let out, \"Sorry buddy, I guess we won't be working out together after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not true, Zapp. I mean sure I might not be able to do any weight lifting. But I'll find another way to workout. Like doing some yoga or something.\" You reassured the anthro Pikachu, to which he handed you over to the very buff Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that had been done you saw Zapp grab two dumbbells before he started to lift some weights. And when you looked over at Blaze though you saw that he was instead going to flit a pair of even heavier looking dumbbells. And once you had made eye contact you saw the older anthro wink at you before he started his own workout. Upon doing so however, you heard Zapp let out a light chuckle before he started to push himself even harder. And if you hadn't known any better it seemed like the two of them were trying to impress you or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to blush and look away while you thought to yourself, <i>\"No, there's no way that both Zapp and Blaze are interested in me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Actually that is exactly what they are doing, little one.\"</i> Lucas mentally replied, which caused you to look back up at his smiling face. Once you had done this he continued, \"Forgive me for invading your aura like that young man. But I just thought you should know the truth is all.\" You then felt a light blush spread across his face while he added on, \"And if I am being honest I also feel that our auras match up well together even though this is in fact our first meeting with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, really? That's interesting. I wonder if I trust you three because you've all been so nice to me, even after only just meeting each other.\" You confessed, as you looked up at the heavily muscled Lucario as best you could. And upon doing this you added, \"Oh, and my name's Ryan by the way. It's nice to meet you, Lucas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had told him this you saw a proud smile form on Lucas's face before he replied, \"It is nice to meet you, Ryan.\" You then saw him bounce each of his massive pecs one after another and continued with, \"I see. Then I suppose you wouldn't mind if you and I became closer with one another would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure. I don't see why not.\" You replied, before you saw the Lucario nod in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had done this however, you soon realized that the heavily muscled Lucario was about to get closer to you by......</span></div></div>",

The concept of getting in a bath with the buff Lucario made your body start to heat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp gave a happy grin, before flashing a thumbs up. \"Ok! Have fun Ryan!\" , the Pikachu happily said to you before resuming his lifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze however, had a knowing smirk on his face. \"Yeah, have fun kid~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas then walked across the room to enter the locker room. Making his way to a blue colored locker, Lucas opened the metal door before placing you inside. You then watched as the lucario stepped away and pulled his gym shorts down, before tugging his dark blue jock strap off as well allowing his black furred member and balls to pop out. You looked in awe as the long limp penis rested against his bigger then life balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding up his gym wear, Lucas looked down at you with a slight blush. \"Little one, It be best if you undressed now. If not, then your clothes will become drenched.\" Your blush darkened as you nodded, removing your jeans and shirt before folding them up. Now naked you stepped onto Lucas's outstretched palm, seeing that he now had a white towel wrapped around his waist. The Lucario placed his workout attire in his locker before closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas then walked over to a different door, opening it to reveal a long wooden hallway. The Lucario placed your body on his collar bone, letting you feel the warmth from the thick blue neck. Lucas walked down the hallway, looking at the doors and seeing them have a red mark on the lock. Finally he found a lock with a green mark. Opening the wooden shoji style door, you and Lucas made you're way in before he locked the door and put the both of you in warm steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large room had wooden stools lining the wall as well shelves holding numerous soaps and folded towels. Finally the center of the room was a large bath. The large square looked big enough to fit ten large anthro Pokemon, steam was rising from the surface confirming it's perfect temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to a table, Lucas grabbed you and set you down on a table, the Lucario removed his towel once again showing his manly glory. Lucas then scooped you up and placed you on the floor in front of his black furred toes. You looked up in awe as Lucas's hulking body loomed over you as he peered over his creme colored pecs, smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Have no fear Ryan, i'll be able to sense your location through our aura connection. I just need to gather a few things, you can head over to the water.\"</i>, Lucas said mentally as he turned back to the table. You began walking to the large body of water, taking a second to look over at Lucas's toned back and firm rump. Arriving at the ledge to the bath, you slowly lowered yourself in immediately feeling the warm water relax your body. After a minute, you heard Lucas's paw pads slapping the tile as he approached. The Lucario then arrived at the ledge, you watched him slowly get in and created waves with his hulking body. Swimming over to the front of his pecs, you watched Lucas sigh and close his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creme pecs went half a foot out from Lucas's body, you swore the water was rippling from his massive heartbeat. Surfacing slightly from the water was his two big pink nipples, you couldn't help but swim over and boldly touch the soft mount on the right. The pec suddenly bounced creating a wave, looking up you saw Lucas looking down at you with a small smile and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry Lucas!\", you quickly apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas just chuckled. \"No need for that Ryan. A dear friend of mine said that intimacy between two beings is a path to a strong connection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Lucas bring his hand up from underneath you, letting water fall between his fingers as you were brought to his face. \"I believed that bathing would help our connection, but if you want we can do more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario bounced his pecs as his voice gained a seductive tone. You blushed brightly, being close to Lucas was one thing but....the prospect of doing more then that compelled you. You gave a nod to Lucas who in return smiled more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas then lifted his buff body out of the warm water before sitting on the edge with a loud slap of his butt, leaving his legs in the water. The Lucario then lowered you to in between his thick thighs, having the blue fur walls tower over you like a canyon. You were only a few inches away from Lucas's manhood and notice his member begin to harden and rise. You saw the pair of balls rested underneath, looking bigger then you. Lucas then placed his hands on his thighs before leaning down and flexing his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, little one what would you like to do?\", the Lucario spoke slowly with a thick blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of what to do. Lucas had a impressive penis, that begged for attention. There were also the large balls. However, you also took note of his large butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas......</span></div></div>",

Because I assure you that I won't force you to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. For if you wish to stop then we can stop here if you'd like.\" The heavily muscled Lucario answered back, with an understanding expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing such words from the anthro Pokemon only fueled you evne more as you let out, \"I-I want to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter uttered these words you saw the Lucario nod his head before you stood up and slowly made your way to giant member that was towering above you. And seeing it only made your heart beat faster as you extended your hands towards that had began to shake a little. But once you had placed your hands on it you weren't for certain if Lucas had felt your touch since you were so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you soon learned that he in fact had felt your touch once you had heard him let out a low moan while he said, \"Yes, little one. Just like that. But if you need to Ryan, take all of the time you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused your blush to deepen while you let out, \"Okay....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right when you were about to start and rub your entire body against Lucas's penis the heavily muscled Aura Pokemon had quickly move you away from that part of his body due to the fact that the door was being opened.

But Zapp really wanted he and I to join you guys in the bath. So can you let us in?\" Blaze asked from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this had been said you saw and felt the heavily muscled Lucario get up out of the water while he replied, \"Of course.\" He then saw him look down at you. And upon doing so he wmlied and then winked atyou while he mentally went on with, <i>\"Well, I am quite disappointed that you and I weren't able to truly enjoy or finish our bonding time. However, I am certain we shall have another chance to do so someday.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to blush before you saw him unlock the door and let the other two muscled anthro Pokemon into the room. And once they had walked into the room he closed the door and locked it again. You saw him turn around to face both Zapp and Blaze to which you felt your blush deepen in color when you saw well muscled anthro Pikachu remove his towel with his back to you which gave you a very good view of his wide muscled back along with his firm yellow furred butt. And when you turned to look away you then saw Blaze with his back to you to which you saw hi mane like hair that went down to his shoulder blades. And like with Zapp you saw his orange and black strapped butt, however, since his tail was large and fluffy it blocked most of it from your view. You then did your best not to become hard when Lucas walked back to the water and sank into it. Because once he had done this you then saw the other two anthro Pokemon's muscled bodies along with their large balls and currently soft members that were on top of them with Blaze being black in color while Zapp's was yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you soon calmed yourself down when both of them got into the water and let out sighs of relief. Right after they did this though you saw Zapp look over at you when he asked the Lucario, \"Hey Lucas, you don't mind if I hold onto the little guy now do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not.\" The heavily muscled Aura Pokemon replied, before you found yourself being handed over to the well muscled anthro Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that had happened you and the electric Pokemon started up a conversation while he gently rubbed the top and back of your body with one of his fingers. But while he did this Blaze looked over at Lucas with a smirk while he started a telepathic conversation and asked him, <i>\"So how far did you get with the kid, Lucas?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not that far thanks to both you and Zapp showing up when you did.\"</i> The heavily muscled Lucario slightly and bitterly shot back, before he let out a sigh. After doing this he added, <i>\"Although please understand that I am not mad or anything. I'm just disappointed. However, I am certain the little one and I will have another chance to finish what we had started today.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh? Are you sure about that. Because if you ask me I bet the kid could use a big and strong Daddy figure like me in his life.\"</i> The well muscled Arcanine countered, while he crossed his arms over his large chest. He then continued with, <i>\"And besides I'm certain Zapp cares for the kid too. So I guess to the winner goes the spoils huh?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, I suppose so.\"</i> Lucas mentally replied, now with his own smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty more minutes had passed until the three giant anthro Pokeon had left the bath area with you still in Zapp's hand.

The only Pokemon still out were late night workers and drunk partygoers being put in taxis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to show you my home!\", Zapp gave a toothy grin as he approached a large apartment complex that had very few cars outside of it. Though you did remember the Pikachu saying that only celebrities and workers live in Neo Kanto. Entering the building Zapp made his way up to the tenth floor by elevator, though he pouted since he wanted to take the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to a white door with a Z, The Pikachu unlocked and opened it. Inside was a large living room with two long couches, a flat screen, and a balcony. You widened your eyes, just how much did Zapp make from fighting?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nii-san?\", a tired squeaky voice suddenly called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp in the next second quickly pulled the neck of his shirt, before gently pushing you into the crevice between his pecs. You still could see over the neckline of the shirt as the furry muscles lightly squeezed you. The Pikachu gave a small pat on his chest, before turning towards the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the pecs you saw a familar Pichu standing in a entryway. He had black and yellow Pjs with messy fur on the top of his head. He rubbed his eye and yawned as he looked tired. You remember now, this was Spark from the picture on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp gave a warm smile. \"Hey buddy, what're you doing up?\" Zapp approached his brother before picking him up and carrying him on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't sleep, then I heard you enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into a room filled with toys and posters of fighters, Zapp laid his brother down and tucked him in. Rubbing Spark's head, \"Well get some rest, you got that playdate with Mizu tommarow.\" Giving a nod the brothers wished each other good night as Zapp left his brother's room. You smiled as you replayed the scene. The Pikachu was really the whole package nice, buff, and cheerful. You hoped when you returned to your world, Zapp and his friends could be with you somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp soon entered what you presumed to be his room, with the trophys and photos of him and other anthro Pokemon. Using two fingers, Zapp pulled you out of his pecs and looked at you apologetically. \"Sorry about that. I didn't know how I'd explain you to him.\". You shook your saying it was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp placed you down on his pillow before walking over to a dresser. Your blush returned as the Pikachu stripped out of his clothes before putting on a pair of sweats and a small tank top that hugged his pecs and abs. Laying down in front of you, Zapp layed his pecs on his folded arms as he smiled at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight was really fun, Ryan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" You replied as you nodded smiling in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp then looked off in thought out loud to himself, \"You know maybe I could make you a little bed.\" He then went on with, \"Oh, and you can come to my matches next week!\" He then had a bit smile on his face when he added, \"And next year Lucas and I are going touring around Hoenn. So I don't see why you couldn't come with us too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing all of this caught you off guard as you weren't expecting the anthro Pikachu to have thought up all of these ideas for the two of you to do. And so you felt you had to be truthful as you replied, \"Zapp, that all sounds great. But don't you think you're thinking too far ahead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after you had uttered these words though you saw the Pikachu's ears drop as he frowned and looked to the side before he admitted, \"Oh yeah, you're right. I'm sorry, Ryan. I gues I got ahead of myself there. It's just...I feel really close to you, Ryan. Even if we've only knwon each other for one day so far.\" Zapp's head turned back to you. You could see a small blush and his eyes watering a little when he added, \"Being with you, I feel happier then I've been in a long while. You, Blaze, and Lucas are the only people I can open up too. When in public I have to be a powerful fighter, and at home I need to act strong for Spark's sake. And I just feel like I need to keep you safe since you're staying here from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears began to drip down his cheeks, as Zapp let out his emotions. You couldn't believe it Blaze was right, Zapp wasn't always the cheerful Pikachu he showed to be on TV. He had pain heat he had not dealt with yet. And so you walked forward towards Zapp's folded arms, and embraced them. You then reassured him with, \"It's ok Zapp, I know you still feel hurt. But I promise, it's all going to be ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt yourself get scooped up by the yellow furry fingers. You were then surprised as Zapp pressed you against his lips. Although shocked, you found yourself melting into the kiss as his lips massaged your body. Pulling you away, Zapp was smiling and blushing deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Ryan, but no matter what I'll make sure that you're happy here.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nSoon after, Zapp turned off the lights and layed down. He then placed you on his right pectoral before covering you with his right paw. You felt comfortable listening to Zapp's strong heartbeat and feeling the weight of his furry hand. You felt a warmth inside you, a feeling that told you to stay close with Zapp. Falling asleep with the giant brought safety to your mind.<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThen before you knew it the sun rose, and with it........</span></div></div>",

And right after the first phone you felt and saw Zapp get up before he gently removed you from his right pectoral and placed you onto his pillow. Once he did this you saw him reach over and grab the cellphone that was on his right nightstand as he let out, \"Hello?\" Upon uttering that somewhat tired greeting you saw his ears shoot upward before he added, \"Blaze?! Why are you calling me at 9 in the morning?\" The well muscled anthro Pikachu's head then moved up and down when he went on, \"Oh, you're heading over here? Wait, your heading up the stairs right now?! Okay, I'll be at the front door to let you in. But please try to be quiet since Spark is still sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the conversation was done you saw Zapp turn off the cellphone and then place it back onto his nightstand before he stood up and then faced you on the bed. After he did this you saw a sheepish smile form on his face while he confessed, \"Well, this wasn't exactly how I expected my day to start out.\" He then placed a hand down for you to get onto as he continued, \"But oh well, I honestly should have seen this coming since Blaze has always called me early in the morning when I needed to train for a match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head in understanding before you asked, \"Yeah, that does make sense. But did he mention why he was heading over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually he didn't.\" Zapp let out, before you saw he was standing in front of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that happened you saw the giant anthro electric Pokemon turn the knob and then open the door. Doing so revealed the well muscled anthro Arcanine, who was wearing a pair of tight black pants and a white button up shirt. Which you quickly noticed that a few of buttons were left undone which gave you a view of the fire type Pokemon large chest. This caused you to blush a bit while Blaze said to Zapp, \"Hey Zapp, glad to see you and the kid are up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it kind of couldn't be helped since you called out of the blue like that.\" Zapp let out, while he let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing so you saw Blaze release a light chuckle before he replied, \"Yeah sorry about that. But you see I wanted to stop over and pick up the kid. This way I can spend some one on one time with him before the three of us hang out with Lucas again today. Of course that is if it's alright with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to look up at the well muscled Pikachu as you weren't for certain how he'd react. However, to your surprise you saw him give his trainer a big smile as he told him, \"Sure, I don't see why not. Besides this'll work out great since I have to take my little brother to play date in a few hours. Once I do that though I'll shoot you a text message on where to meet both Lucas and I at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" Blaze responded back with, before you were then gently handed off to the well muscled Pokemon canine. Once that happened both you and Blaze waved goodbye to Zapp. And while the Arcanine began to walk away he kept going with, \"So kid, I know I apologized to Lucas yesterday. But I should apologize to you to for interrupting you and Luca's \"fun time\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um that's okay. W-We didn't end up getting that far...\" You confessed, now with a deep blush on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's good to know.\" The well muscled fire dog told you, with a smile on his face. Mentally though he added on, \"Besides now I have a better chance at winning you over. At least I hope I do, pup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your blush had went away you looked up at the giant fire Pokemon and asked, \"So what exactly will we be doing together until we hang out with Zapp and Lucas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had uttered these words though you saw Blaze look down at you with a big smile on his face when he told you, \"Well Ryan, I was thinking you and I could spent some time together while I do some.....</span></div></div>",

The Arcanine looked forward as he walked but continued to talk, \"Yeah, it's been awhile since I got a new pair. I tried one of my current ones on and it ripped with one flex!\" Blaze confessed, followed by letting out a annoyed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do I come in?\" You asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming a little, you felt the pec you were up against bounce a little. \"Well kid, I think the best swimsuit is one that gets the wearer a good look at. So I'm gonna need you to tell me which one looks best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your body heat up. Blaze was going to model some swim wear and needed your opinion. You got a good look back at the bath, but still felt eager at seeing more of the Arcanine's 7ft hulking body. And eventually the both of arrived at a clothing store. You peaked out as a anthro Sylveon in a pink suit excitingly greeted Blaze. After informing the fairy type of his problem, the Sylveon eagerly shoved different swimsuits into Blaze's toned arms and escorted him to a change room. Gently picking you up between his thumb and finger, Blaze set you on the bench. You looked up in awe as the Arcanine unbuttoned his shirt and fully exposed his pecs and abs. He then tugged his black pants down with a little difficulty, leaving his toned orange legs on display and now looming over you only in a black jock strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll start with......this!\" The fire type anthro dog announced, while he picked up one of the suits, Blaze walked over to the mirror in the changing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as he slid down his jock strap, giving you a side view of his large manly glory and firm rump. Looking away to allow some privacy, you heard Blaze slightly grunting and finally letting out a relieved sigh. Hearing this prompted you to look back over to which then you saw the Arcanine in a pair of ankle length swimwear. The back had a small v opening, allowing his tail and top of crack to show. The suit clung tightly to his thighs and bulge, as Blaze placed his foot on a stool and flexed his bulging muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw him look at you when he asked, \"Hmmm, a little tight. What do you think little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh um, yeah it's very tight!\" You stuttered, as you blushed furiously. Blaze soon walked over to pick another suit. Bending over his large butt looked ready to rip the fabric as it sat a few inches away from your body. Unknown to you Blaze smirked and \"unconsciously\" swung his hips a little, bouncing his cheeks slightly. Blaze then put on a speedo next which appeared to hug his bulge and running up between his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that's better\" Blaze let out, before he gave a relaxed breath and proceeded to bounc his pecs and gave a good bicep flex.  You couldn't help but look away. The Arcanine's body pulsed and breathed power. You didn't notice Blaze walking over until you heard him chuckle above you. This caused you to look up him to which you saw him looking down at you over his cream furred pecs as you saw Blaze had a sly grin on his face when he added  \"Ya know kid, if you want.....you can check out my body.\" Blaze then placed his palms on the wall and leaned forward thus filling your sky with his abs and pecs. The Arcanine then smirked at you and kept on going with, \"So if there's anything you want then this daddy can give it to ya.\" You flushed, but there was no fear just awe. Blaze showed affection to you as well. Zapp was nice and hot, but Blaze was more dominating and had a body that could give the greatest pleasure. This was bad, your feelings were so conflicted on what to do. Hopefully you can come to terms with this feeling. Blaze soon stood back up and chuckled and ended his fun with, \"Well maybe not now, but if you ever what to get \"adventurous\" I'll be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nBlaze soon tried on the rest on the swimsuits, including a thong (which was more like a piece of string). He soon made his purchase and was given a cheerful farewell by the Sylveon. As he walked out of the store with you in the previous pocket, his phone suddenly vibrated. Checking the screen, Blaze grinned and began walking while he said, \"Zapp just texted me, told me where to meet him and Lucas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we meeting them at?\" You asked, to which you looked up at Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze grinned down at you as he said..........</span></div></div>",

Although just the thought of the three buff anthro Pokemon walking around in speedos made you excited. However, you did your best to control this side of you since you were stil unsure of who you were attracted to the most. Becuase you knew taht you liked Zapp and Blaze, and even though you hadn't spent much time with Lucas, you couldn't deny that the Lucario obviously liked you just like the other two did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh to try to calm yourself down while you thought, <i>\"Okay, you can do this, Ryan. All you have to do is spend more time with these three hot anthro Pokemon guys. And maybe you'll be able to figure out who you like the most.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes though you were broken out of your thoughts when you felt two of Blaze's fingers lift you up out of the pocket and then set you down onto a bench in a huge locker room. Once that happened you saw both Zapp and Lucas looming over you with big smiles on their faces. But when you realized that the two anthro Pokemon were wearing nothing more then speedos you couldn't help but blush. And upon a closer look you saw that Zapp was wearing a black speedo while Lucas was wearing a bright red speedo. And when you heard the anthro Arcanine let out a light chuckle you turned and saw that he was wearing one of the swimsuits he had modeled for you, that being a purple colored one. However, the one thing that all three had in common was the fact that their swimwear was clinging to their members and balls which caused large bugles to easily be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you stared you soon found yourself being lifted up into the air again before you were gently placed onto Zapp's open palm. Once that happened you looked up at the well muscled eletric mouse when he asked, \"So are you ready to have some fun while poolside, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure. But I don't have a swimsuit. And what if someone sees me? Won't cause a lot fo unwanted attention?\" You confessed, as the three each grabbed their towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry little one, because since Zapp and I are fighters and Blaze was a former champion we were able to request to enjoy the pool to ourselves for a few hours.\" Lucas explained, while the three walked out into the empty pool area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" You let out, before the three set their towels down onto three nearby folding chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that had been done you soon found out that the muscled anthro Pokemon had decided to......</span></div></div>",

They both nodded, and Zapp set you down onto his towel covered chair. In addition the Pikachu opened up a magazine with different fighters and placed it in front of you. The trio walked a good distance away thus leaving you to read the magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's up?\" Zapp asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze crossed his arms as he closed his eyes and answered back with, \"I take it that we all feel a certain way about the little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be correct in that regard.\" Lucas responded, followed by a nod of his head in confirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing this a grin spread across the anthro fire dog's face as he told the two other anthros, \"So then I have a proposition. A little race for a night with the little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp and Lucas looked at each other and nodded. If they gave some alone time with you then chances are the connections built could strengthen into more then just intimate bonding.  Blaze smirked as he began to walk back while he added on with, \"Oh, and just so you know I don't intend to go easy on either one of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have it any other way\" Zapp said with a determined grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas gave a small smile and commented, \"I can sense the adrenaline exuding off of us. I can't help but feel excited.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nYou sat on the fluffy towel while reading the magazine Zapp gave you. On the right was Zapp in his fighting outfit, listed below him was all his victories and notable facts. The left side had Lucas dressed in a black gi, similar feats listed as well. On a previous page, Blaze was featured dressed in a orange robe with red flame designs. The sound of the anthros returning brought your head up as they loomed above, a eager glint in thier eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen saw Blaze look down at you when he said, \"Sorry for the wait kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and reassured him with, \"It's ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, we were wondering if you could help us out with something.\" Lucas asked, which caught your attention right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity caught you at the request. \"I asked these two to a race, could you be the referee?\", Blaze asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly agreed, much to thier delight. Scooping you up, Zapp carried you to the side of the pool before setting your body near the ledge. The ground shook as the giants rushed to the end and got into a starting stance. The three had thoughts racing through thier heads as they waited to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I haven't felt like this in a long time. I will get closer to Ryan!\"</i> Zapp thought to himself, as he got himself ready for the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas had his closed his eyes and then quickly reopened them when he wondered to himself, <i>\"Our aura feels one when we're close. Is this what true love is?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Get ready kid, this daddy is gonna be all yours!\"</i> Blaze mentally remarked, while he grinned and bounced each of his massive pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand made sure you a safe distance from the edge of the pool, but stilll close enough to where they could see you as you shouted, \"Ready, set, GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three anthro Pokemon then blasted into the water, soon emerging and rustling the water with thier toned arms and legs. They seem to be neck and neck, passing then falling behind by a inch. The anthros didn't relent as they reached the wall and turned back to the start at full force. A nice long night with you awaited one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, furred fingers touched the ledge. Your eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winner was.......</span></div></div>",

However, this did not seem to be so as three muscled anthro Pokemon each began to up out of the pool which caused the water to run through their matted fur and large muscles. Seeing this though only caused you to blush as you wondered what was going to be in stored for you while being with Lucas until tomorrow morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd although both Zapp and Blaze looked disappointed you were reviled to see each one of them shake the other\u201ds hand before they made their way over to you.

The Lucario soon approached a small wooden building, peaking out from the pocket you saw a country style building with shoji doors. It was strange, a rural style home in the middle of a metropolis city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it might seem strange, but the designers took my saying of making it feel like home to the extreme\", Lucas said in a slightly embarrassed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding open the door and closing it, Lucas picked you out of his pocket and placed you on his large palm. Although you grew up in a city orphanage, you often saw pictures of the homes out in Viridian forest and Lucas's resembled them perfectly. As he walked into the living room, you saw photos of a larger Lucario and a small Riolu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my father and me when I was little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up as Lucas spoke. He soon sat on a sofa and looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo how did you get into fighting?\", you hesitantly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas smiled as he looked off. \"My father trained me since I was young. I learned not only his combat, but his aura techniques as well. He even gave me our family's gem stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had said this you saw a large gray colored stone next to the photo of Lucasand his Father which made you smile a little as you told him, \"Wow, it's very nice stone, Lucas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thnak you, Ryan.\" The anthro Aura Pokemon replied, before you saw his red eyes fall onto you. He then went on with, \"But now that we have this entire night to ourselves what would like to do, little one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused a blush to form on your face as you let out, \"Oh um well, I'm not sure what we could do honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter uttering these words you saw Lucas's two massive pecs bounce as he let out a chcukle and reassured you with, \"Do not worry little one.

He then brought up his left leg making his thigh bulge, before passing it over you to the other side of the bed. he then sat his firm rump down a few feet away from you, making the bed bounce and placing his right leg on the bed. Both of Lucas's blue thighs stood above you on both sides like canyons, leading to his giant black crotch with a penis already beginning to harden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario then bounced his creme pecs and placed his hands on the top of his thighs, looking down at you with a eager glint in his eyes. \"Now then, we can enjoy ourselves. After all....we have the night together~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, your blush no longer of embarrassment but excitement. Taking off your clothes you walking down the blue trail to his crotch, the shadow of Lucas's penis began to cover the area as you stood in front of his balls. Your sky was filled by his shaft, only seeing from the sides Lucas putting his arms behind his head. You soon began by snuggling up to the testicles, sinking into the warm furry flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas began to feel you rubbing into his sack, he bucked his hips as a small wave of pleasure hit him. you then started to climb up his penis, almost struggling with how thick it was. Your body started to hump the large organ, Lucas's panting grew louder as he bend his knees and clenched his butt. The Lucario licked his lips as his blush darkened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of dripping aleterted you to the precum that started pouring out of Lucas's slit.You took this as an initiative to hump the penis harding and lick up the sweet and salty cum that dripped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow soon covered you as Lucas wrapped a black paw around you and the penis firm but gently. He then started to rub his foreskin up and down, making more precum hit you and feel the pulse from the cock as it tensed up. Your body heated up as the large muscle released it's heat and smell onto you, making you hard as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye..es just...li..ke....THAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with a loud grunt, Lucas released a wave of white cum from his penis, landing on his sheets and thighs. As you were pulled from the penis, most of your body was drenched in semen and musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas brought you to his face, he had a blush with a tired smile. The Lucario then sticked out his tongue and slid it over your body covering you in saliva and massaging you with the giant wet muscle until you were clean. He then guled the cum down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was amazing little one. Thank you for the pleasure\", Lucas smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..eah i enj..oyed it too.\", you panted out. <br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAfter your bonding, Lucas cleaned you and himself up and changed the sheets. He then layed down and placed you on his right pec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe it be best if we sleep now. We can think of a way to tell Zapp and Blaze about the plan in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and closed your eyes, starting to fall asleep to the heartbeat beneath you. \"Good night Lucas\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sleep consumed you, one of Lucas's fingers started to rub you head affectionately. \"Sleep well little one.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you found the ground was no longer furred and beating but soft and cushioning. Your body was now resting on a giant pillow instead of Lucas's pec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the room then opened and The Lucario walked into the room dressed in a blue tank top and black sweats.

And once he done this he then mentally told you, <i>\u201cI can just by reading your aura that this news not only surprises you, but you are worried as well. However, please do not fear little one. For as you know he and I have had many matches and yet we are still very good friends.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to sigh in relief as you let out, \u201cWell that\u2019s good to know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had muttered these words you felt movement as Lucas began to walk. You then heard him grab his gym bag and walk out of the door to which he locked it and was on his way with you hidden in his sweatpants pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty minutes had passed before you felt Lucas remove you from his pants pocket. Once he had done this you took a look around and saw that you were in the Lucario\u2019s locker room. However, before you could get a good look around you were handed over to Blaze, who greeted you with a large grin on his face when he said, \u201cHey kid, hope you had a good time with Lucas last night. Because while he and Zapp are taking part in their match you\u2019ll be hanging out with me.\u201d He then began to walk out of the locker room after you and he had wished Lucas luck. But as once he had shut the door he leaned in closer and whispered, \u201cSo did you miss your Daddy, boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the heavily muscled fire dog\u2019s comment caused you to blush as you nodded your head up and down giving him a wordless yes for an answer. After doing this you heard the Arcanine let out light chuckle before you realized that you were now inside of his locker room. Which when you looked around you saw that it was modesty in style with only a few posters and one large locker and armchair. But as you looked around Blaze took the chance to sit into the chair before turning on the monitor to watch the fight between Zapp and Lucas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once it had turned on you saw both Zapp and Lucas in the middle of the ring both in their fighter gear before they shook hands and went to opposing corners in the ring. But while you stared at the screen you once again heard Blaze let out a chuckle before he told you, \u201cHey kid, I think I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d And what\u2019s that?\u201d You asked, while you did your best not to blush upon thinking of something similar happening between you and Blaze just like the pervious night with Lucas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you looked up at the grinning Arcanine\u2019s face you were shocked when he said, \u201cYou know what kid, I think....</span></div></div>",

Blaze then set you down onto the edge of the seat cushion, already warm from his body. You watched in awe as Blaze began peeling off his tight red short sleeve muscle shirt. He made sure to flex his black furred abs and make his neck fur ruffle by bouncing his huge pecs. The fire daddy then pulled off his jean shorts letting you see a black thong doing a poor job at containing his junk. As he pulled the strap forward, Blaze swung his large hips and brought the small undergarment down. The large penis and balls popped out and bounced against his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply observed the godly figure before you. Blaze's body towered into the sky, bulging with power. With one simple move the Arcanine's muscles flexed and enlarged with the veins pulsing. You watched as Blaze squatted down and his thighs flexed. Even when squatting, Blaze's height made his manly glory go above the seat cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" Blaze asked, in a deep seductive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which you could feel his natural dominance come out as he watched you admire him. The Pokemon stood back up and turned around, giving you a view of his muscled back and his large firm butt. His creme tail was moving excessively in excitement. You watched in amazement as the furry rump filled your sky and pass over, followed by the giant balls. The cushion shook and rose as Blaze sat down and both of his thighs crashed down beside you. Tumbling from the shift in the ground, you fell into the warm furry wall that was Blaze's thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike with Lucas, Blaze's legs were more closed and his penis was already standing tall. The cushion shifted as Blaze swayed his butt cheeks side to side, finally stopping with a heavy sigh from the buff Arcanine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze brought his arms behind his head, making his biceps bulge. He then bounced his black pecs and looked down at you, a little speck in comparison to his large body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA seductive smirk graced his face when he asked you, \"So little man, what fun do you want to have with your fire daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but swallow a lump in your throat before you replied, \"Well Blaze....</span></div></div>",

Besides this Muscled Fire Daddy would do whatever his boy wants.\u201d Then before you knew it you saw Blaze pull up the foot rest on the chair which caused him to now be laying in it. You then felt your blush return as you were gently put in-between the fire type anthro Pokemon\u2019s huge black furred pecs. You then leaned your head up against the white fur that was right above his chest. Once you did you felt one of his fingers gently rub the top of your head while he added in the form of a question, \u201cComfy, boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, very much so.\u201d You replied, before your blush darkened. After that happened you continued with, \u201cYour muscles are so huge and well defined, Big Daddy....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying this you felt the two pectorals squeeze you a little bit before Blaze let out a slight growl of lust and said, \u201cMmmm, yeah Daddy likes it when you call him that along with complimenting the hard work I\u2019ve done on my body over the years.\u201d To your surprise though you then felt the giant fire dog up out of the chair as he went on with, \u201cAnd as much as I\u2019d love to rub one out while you rubbed and kissed my muscles I think we\u2019d best wait and do that another time, pup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you say that, Blaze?\u201d You asked, while he began to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon doing so he sat back down into the chair when he pointed out, \u201cWell, it\u2019s because it seems Zapp just beat Lucas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to look at the TV screen and see the well muscled Pikachu with his right arm being raised in the air in victory. However, within a few seconds you found yourself being removed from between the black furred before you found yourself being gently pressed up against Blaze\u2019s lips in a short kiss. And once he had pulled you away from his face he winked st you and said, \u201cBesides I need to figure out the best time and place to show you how much your Arcanine Daddy really cares about his special human boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay. I-I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d You muttered out, before the two of you heard the doorknob to Blaze\u2019s locker room being open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while both Lucas and Zapp walked into the room Blaze\u2019s warm breathe hit your entire when he whispered, \u201cGood. Because Daddy is looking forward to it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your best to keep your emotions in check before you saw Zapp and Lucas approach the two of you while the heavily muscled anthro electric mouse said with excitement,\"Hey Ryan, I've got great news.</span></div></div>",

However, you just picked only one of them to rub before you made your way down his right leg and then got down onto the bed and in between the dog's heavily muscled legs.

Up intill you hadn't ever been in such a state of arousal except for Lucas, but Blaze was such a Daddy and had the passion to make anyone feel pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Blaze arrived in a big white tiled room, there was a separate area to shower and a bath tub on it's own. The huge anthro walked across the tile towards the tub, Blaze then set you on the ledge to the tub. You looked up as Blaze leaned forward to turn the knob and start letting the water run, the large black balls hung above looking ripe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a strong impulse suddenly and reached forward to touch the warm furry testicles. The large thighs suddenly flexed and Blaze let out a pleasured growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grh~ Nice touch kid, but let's relax for now. We can always go for round two another time.\", Blaze had a knowing smirk as he reached between his legs and scooped you up, holding you below his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buff anthro then slowly began getting into the now filled tub, let out a heavy sigh as his large muscles were submerged in the warm water. Blaze leaned back in the tub, his knees stuck out as his large body still was slightly larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were set against the pecs so that you could float in the water and have the firm muscle as a ground. You could hear the mighty heartbeat behind and felt the heat from Blaze's body join that of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaze?\", you suddenly asked. The pecs lightly bounced and Blaze let out a deep hum to show he was listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...wanted to say thanks. I really enjoyed the intimacy you shared with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze chuckled and reached a finger down to rub your head. \"No problem kiddo, Daddy wants to make sure his boy feels the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relaxed into the soft finger pad and smiled as you enjoyed the warmth of your fire daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon.....</span></div></div>",

Once that happened you were then gently cleaned by your big daddy via a washcloth and some body wash that he had gotten and then lathered up into the cloth. And once he saw that your entire body was covered in suds along with your hair you felt a rush of some water go over you from Blaze's other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he had looked over you again you saw a big smile spread across the fire canine's face as he pointed out, \"Alright, looks like you're nice and clean. So now it's my turn to clean myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then found yourself blushing when you saw him set you down onto the edge of the tub and then wink at you. You then were treated to another kind of show as Balze proceeded to wash various areas of his body. But not while also flexing his huge muscles for you every now and again. And once his body was good and covered with soap suds you saw him go under the water for a moment before he slowly stood up and let the water fall down his body. You then saw him reach over and gently dry you off with a nearby hand towel. And once he had odn ethis you saw him get up out of the tub and let the water go down the drain while he set you down on the counter and he dried himself off.

Watch some T.V and relax?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze chuckled and reached down and scooped you up, bringing you up close to his colossal body and stopping before his large pecs. \"Of course little guy, your daddy will keep ya nice and warm~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and smiled at the deep sexy growl. Blaze started walking with his heavy steps to the living room, occasionally glancing down and bouncing his huge pecs to entertain you. Soon the giant anthro arrived in a lavish room with a large flatscreen and numerous photos of victory poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze then lowered his bulky body onto a soft couch, adjusting his muscular form before letting out a deep sigh. The anthro then gently placed you on one of his black pecs, his paw lightly hugged you to the muscle with the soft and warm fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the T.V, a few other fighting matches were shown. You couldn't really hear the announcer as Blaze's strong heartbeat boomed from his pecs.

The Arcanine hummed as he bounced his huge pecs and felt your tiny body snuggling up to his chest. Looking at his ringing phone, Blaze grinned as it appeared Lucas was calling him. Putting a buff arm behind his fluffy head Blaze hit answer while relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Lucas good morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good morning Blaze I hope you and Ryan are doing well.\", Lucas warmly chuckled from the phone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Blaze lightly squeeze you with his pecs again as the daddy hummed. Blaze feeling you were awake by your movements soon reached in and gently plucked you out before setting you on his huge black pec. The buff Arcanine looked down at you with his sexy grin before he clicked on the speaker button on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me and the cub are doing going good, right kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon felt Blaze rubbing your head with his soft finger, you smiles as the large phone was held before you. \"Yep Blaze is taking great care of me! We had a lot of fun....last..night.\", you soon blushed as you remembered the passionate moment you shared with your fire daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze licked his lips as he also remembered the moment he soon chuckled as he stroked your back getting a purr out of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas meanwhile chuckled as he rubbed his chin. <i>\"I see, I'm glad you two had a nice night. I wanted to ask, what time would you like to come over so Ryan could spend the night?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Arcanine scooped you up into his warm paw as he sat up and threw his legs over the side of his bed. Blaze placed you on top of his broad shoulder as he brought the phone to his ear. \"Hmm I'll swing by around...three. Me and Ryan will come by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok understood, I'll see you then and have everything prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze grinned as he stood up slowly to not risk unbalancing you. \"Cool I'll see you then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying their goodbyes, Blaze put his phone on the charger and lightly grabbed you into a warm fist. The bulky giant held you in front of his large chest while flexing his pecs. Blaze grinned as he looked past his large muscles at you. \"So did you have a nice sleep Ryan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and tried not to blush as you saw the handsome face above the huge muscles. Blaze began walking to the bathroom, his furry muscles flexing with esch step of his toned legs. Arriving in the bathroom Blaze set you on the counter before he grabbed the the waistband of his boxers. A blush returned to your face as you stripped and saw Blaze winked and swung his hips as he pulled down the boxers, his large penis soon popped out with his balls resting against his thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright cub, let's get washed up.\", Blaze soon held his palm down allowing you to hop on before going over to his shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soon set on the shower floor, in the shadow of Blaze's huge body. The water flowed over the furry muscles and little water actually hit you as not only was there his muscles getting hit by the water, but Blaze's member looming above having water dripping over. As he scrubbed his body with soap, Blaze grew a sly grin as he made sure to flex his biceps and go in between each of his abs. The daddy also turned around and flexed his toned back and rubbed his firm butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good while of cleaning and flexing his muscles for you, Blaze bend over and scooped you up. Stepping out of the shower, Blaze grabbed a towel and gently dried you with the corner. After you were dried Blaze set you in his palm and wrapping the towel around his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he exited the bathroom and started walking back to his room, you couldn't help but look at the few drops of water running down the muscular torso. Blaze soon arrived in his bedroom and set you on his bed before walking over to drawer. The Arcanine's tail was moving as his large butt pushed against the towel. After pulling out some clothes, Blaze dropped his towel and stood in his furry muscular nudeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze soon pulled on a black undershirt that made his huge muscles look painted on and some cargo shorts over some red snug boxers. The muscular Pokemon soon scooped you back up and put you on top of his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ryan let's not keep Lucas waiting.\", Blaze rubbed your head as he smiled and grabbed his phone before walking out of his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze soon made his way through the city, the sun bright and buildings lit up as the city life was bustling. Passerbys didn't see you strangely probably just due to how small you were compared to the large pecs. You and Blaze soon arrived at Lucas's house and just as Blaze was about to knock on the door, his phone buzzed with a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking his phone, Blaze let out an annoyed sigh. \"Damn, sorry kid but I just got a call from Jubilife city. They wanna discuss some more about the trip, they said it's urgent so I gotta go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, feeling kind of sad that you had to be departed from the fire daddy so soon. Blaze soon picked you up before lightly pecking you with his lips and smiling at you. \"Don't worry Ryan I'll see you again soon, you and Lucas have fun now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soon set down in front of Lucas's door and looked up at Blaze as he loomed over you with his muscular bod. \"Lucas should be out in a sec, he is pretty in tune with your aura.\", the Arcanine let out another annoyed as his phone went off again. \"Alright I hear ya! See you around kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground then lightly shook as the giant walked away as you watched the muscular anthro leave. You soon faced the towering door and thought of what Blaze said, could Lucas really sense you outside his house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah Ryan you've arrived.\"</i>, the familar voice of the Lucario spoke within your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door soon opened and you found yourself facing the large black paws of Lucas. A blue glow soon surrounded you and you felt yourself rising off the ground and going passed the black sweatpants and blue and creme colored muscles of the Lucario's muscular torso. Lucas warmly grinned as he set you on his large palm <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ryan are you doing alright?\", Lucas asked as he walked into his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and nodded as you relaxed on the warm palm. \"Yeah I can't wait for the trip with everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas hummed. \"Yes visiting my home region with my friends is something I look forward too. Of course now that we have the night together I am very happy about that as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as you could feel Lucas' excitement through the aura link between him and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas soon decided to....</span></div></div>",

I don't view you as some creature to look after, i see you as someone i care for...deeply. When your aura aligns with mine i feel more at peace then ever.

You'd eventually slide down but first you wanted to give more love to his pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the right nipple you began to rub the smooth column almost as big as you. You heard Lucas let out a deep quiet moan as he felt your tiny hands caress the hardened pink appendage. Lucas lightly bounced his pecs as his heartbeat began to pick up from his increased ecstasy. The giant Lucario gasped and felt a shock of pleasure as you suddenly licked the nipple, the large penis twitched as your toungue dampened the warm pink column. See Lucas letting out hot breaths and shifting the ground by clenching his huge muscles, you decided to make your way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the edge of the pecs you started to slide fown the creme fur and came face to face with the valley of Lucas' abs. While his face wasn't visible you could hear the giant Lucario let out a moan as you started to rub the furry and firm ab. The sweaty smell rose from the numerous muscles as Lucas heated up from the pleasure he had coursing through his large muscular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way to the top of his first ab pack, you could see the large member in the distance. Surprisingly only a small drip of precum was falling from the tip. You smiled as you went in between the abs, taking a smell of Lucas' sexy odor before kissing the firm muscles. Lucas threw his head back as he felt your tender kisses, lightly hugging you with his firm abdominal muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Lucas, are you holding back on release?\"</i>, you spoke through the aura link. The booming moans momentarily ceased as you felt a flow of energy return. <i>\"Y-yes Ryan...i wanted to cum together with you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as you pressed another kiss to the abs before they stopped their light squeezing. Climbing out you began to rub and kiss the lower rows of muscles, feeling Lucas flex each row as you slid into each row. Finally you climbed over the final hill of ab valley to come before the towering blue and black tipped penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your legs shake as a wave of arousal came over. Lucas wanted to cum with you and you felt prepared as him. Still where should you help him cum?</span></div></div>",

And so you carefully walked down to the giant heavily muscled anthro Lucario's right thigh as you carefully then proceeded to climb up the cock. However, when you started to to do this you heard the Aura Pokemon let out another moan until you were on top of his cock. After doing this you then started to rub yourself against his cock which only caused him to moan out in pleasure again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was made even more clear when you heard Lucas's voice inside of your head when he told you, \"<i>Little one, if you keep this for much longer I doubt I'll be able to hold off for much longer....</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Okay then I have an idea big guy. So if you can i wnat you to take a hold of me and put my halfway into the slit of your cockhead. I-If you're alright with doing that of course...</i>\" You suggested, as a dark blush spread across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you didn't get a response from the heavily muscled anthro Pokemon. But after a few seocnds had passed you saw one of his giant furry hands come down and then take a hold of you. You then were moved ot his cockhead where you were in fact put halfway into the slit. And once that was done you then started to thrust your hips inside of it while you rubbed and licked the outside of it. This seemed to do the trick for both of you as you let out a loud moan and let yourself release your load into Luca's cock. You then heard him let out a loud howl as he released his own load which caused you to go falling out of the cock. But thankfully you landed onto the Lucariou's massive right pec as he shot his load all over his massive body as you caught your breathe. And after some time had passed and the afterglow had went away you felt him gently take a hold of you as he got up and went into his bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were then gently cleaned up by the heavily muscled Lucario, who smiled at you and mentally told you, \"<i>Thank you Ryan, that was amazing.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Y-You're welcome Lucas..</i>\" You replied, as he gently dried you off and then put you down onto the bathroom counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then watched as he walked into the shower and then closed the shower door. You then watched as he cleaned himself off as well. This lasted for about fifteen minutes until he stepped out and dried himself off. You were then gently picked up again and put down onto his nightstand as Lucas put back on his black undergarments and then picked you up again and got into bed. You were then put between his massive pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt one his giant fingers gently rub the top of your head as he let out, \"Good night, Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Lucas.\" You replied, to which you both went to sleep for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning though you were both surprised when Zapp.......</span></div></div>",

You soon woke up a ringing noise came from a nightstand by the bed. Lucas opened his eyes, blinking the sleep out of them before reaching over to grab his cellphone off the charger. The Lucario hummed curiously as he gently bounced his pecs. \"Ah it's Zapp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked as you heard the Lucario's voice, it did seem early for the Pikachu to be calling up. Lucas soon reached into his pecs before plucking you up and setting you on top of the muscles. The Lucario gave you a smile as he answered the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Zapp, is everything ok?\", Lucas asked worried about his friend, it had just turned 7:00 and whenever the Pikachu broke his sleep schedule it tented to be because of something happening in his personal life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu however answered in a happy tone. <i>\"Morning Lucas! Don't worry I'm doing ok buddy, i just wanted to check up on Ryan i kinda missed him hehe.\"</i>, Zapp let out an embarrassed chuckle from the other line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas smiled. \"That's nice, don't worry Ryan is doing well I'm sure he's looking forward to spending your night with him.\", the Lucario said reaching down to rub your head while he talked. You hummed as the soft furry finger rubbed your head and you laid on thr creme pec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Awesome! I'll be at your place around noon ok?</i>, Zapp excitedly said before giving a goodbye, Lucas gave one as well before hanging up. The Lucario then scooped you up up into his palm before lifting his buff body out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems we have some time before Zapp arrives, why don't we have breakfast before enjoying some leisure?\", Lucas asked holding you at level with his creme buff chest. You smiled and nodded. \"Yeah that sounds good, what did you have in mind for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas hummed as he arrived in his kitchen, the pokemon set you on the counter. The looming anthro gave you a kind look over his his pecs, love in his red eyes. \"I enjoy a good breakfast my father would make before our training, I'm not too much of a cook but i hope you enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large pokemon began to move around his kitchen, gathering various ingredients and tools before moving near a stove. You watched curious about the food but also blushed as with every movement Lucas was flexing his huge muscles as he cooked away. You watched the Lucario cook, his buff back and round rear facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Lucas came back over woth a dish before scooping you up and bringing you to a table. Setting the back of you on the table you looked in awe at the dish, it was eggs with a side of rice and what seemed to be slices of a oran berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas this looks amazing what are you talking about not being a cook?\", you smiled as you looked at the tasty dish. Lucas smiled as he grew a tinge of pink on his cheeks. \"Thank you little one, please help yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the muscular anthro shared the dish, you enjoyed the eggs with spice on it as well as the sweetness of the oran berry. Lucas watched happily as you enjoyed his meal, loving that you were giving him this kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enjoying the delicious breakfast, Lucas brought you to the couch. The Lucario brought out a book before setting you on top of his hill of abs. The two of you sat in a comfortable silence as Lucas flipped through the pages occasionally reaching down to rub your back as you relaxed on his firm stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what a relationship with Lucas would be like. He was kind and wanted the best for you and humans, but could you really be in a relationship with anyone from this world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time soon flew by and a knock came from Lucas' front door. The Lucario hummed as he plucked you up. \"My the time certainly past, well now let's go greet Zapp.\", the Lucario said setting you on his shoulder next to his thick neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up the door showed Zapp in work out clothes, wearing grey sweatpants and a black muscle shirt that squeezed his buff torso. The Pikachu smiled as he waved. \"Hey guys sorry for the wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas smiled as he picked you up. \"No need to apologize Zapp, i trust everything was cleared with Spark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu nodded. \"Yep Mizu's family agreed to watch over him, just wanted to make sure he didn't feel scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you were set on the yellow furred palm, you looked up at the buff electric mouse as he brought you to his face. \"Bye Lucas! Thank you for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario nodded and smiled as Zapp carried you off. Remembering the action they had last night Lucas sighed as he wondered what would a future with you be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp smiled as he suddenly slipped you into his large pecs and gave a large hug. \"I can't wait to spend the night with you Ryan! It's felt like it's been forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as the pecs gently squeezed you, it seemed Zapp was going to.....</span></div></div>",

After that all you felt was him walking through the gym until you felt and heard him sit down. You then felt more movements before you were taken out from between his pecs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you were set down onto his rock hard abs before you saw him lay back and then start to remove a bar with massive weights on it from it's rack and started to lift up and down which caused his massive muscles to flex as he brought the bar to his body and lifted it upward each time. You watched him do this for quite some time before he let out a sigh of relief and put the bar back down onto the rack. You were then picked up by him gain and taken over to a treadmill. YOu were then placed down onto the main planel of it before you heard it start up and the giant anthro Pokemon started ot run on it. But while he did this you couldn't help but blush as you saw him smile down at you with a very big smile as he ran on the treadmill for about an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was done you were picked up by Zapp again to which he then start to walk into the locker room for the gym.

In fact upon a closer look you saw that it was open to where you could see outlines of his huge pecs and rock hard abs that were currently being blocked by a nice looking dress shirt, and along with this you saw a pair of nice looking black dress pants on him too that covered his largely muscled legs and his obvious huge bulge. This prompted your face to turn a bright red before you saw his red eyes lock onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to let out a gasp of surprise as he smiled at you and removed his reading glasses and put them away to which he also closed his book.

Either by having people come in pick them up or by deliver which other works at the shop handle.\" The anthro Ninetales explained, as a warm smile showed on his face.

The giant Ninetales as now was handsome and his large muscles were shown under his clothes. Now you would joining him a bath where both of you would be nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkahi smiled and lightly bowed. \"Of course, you and Kyle can finish your meal while I go prepare the bathhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai grinned and nodded. \"Thank you dearest friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Flareon then walked out, his fluffy tail moving with each step as Akahi went off the prepare the warm bath. You looked up to see Kasai bringing his gaze to you, he smiled warmly and brought you another spoon of omurice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating the delicious food you decided to ask a question. \"Kasai, you have a bathhouse in your mansion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai let out a deep almost embarrased chuckle as he brushed a strand of yellow fur out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, When my parents had the mansion built they wanted there to be pieces of their old home. They had previously ran a bathhouse and inn in the mountains, they always enjoyed housing guests and having them be warm in the cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was very sweet, Kasai's parents must have come a long way from where they one were. You had never been to a bathhouse so while you where flustered about being naked in a tub with a giant buff ninetales, you were excited to experience everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending a few more minutes eating the delicious foot, a knock soon came from the door. Akahi entered his jacket was off and he had his sleeves rolled up to show some of his red furred biceps. He had slight drops of water from preparing the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is ready for you Kasai and Kyle.\", the anthro Flareon said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai stood up as Akahi came over to grab the now empty food cart and wheel it out. Kasai laid his paw on the cart, you slowly crawled on and sat in the warm palm and tried to hide your blush as the ninetales held you before his large chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales walked out of his room with you into a large hall. Kasai turned to Akahi and gave him his thanks before the Flareon smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you both enjoy it.\", Akahi said before bringing the cart back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai walked the opposite way, his tails seem to sway in excitement as he curled his fingers to keep you secure. You looked to the dress shirt looking very painted on as Kasai's pecs in their entirety were visible and lightly bounced with each step he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Kasai came to a door that unlike the one to his room was sh\u00f5ji style, with thin steam coming through. Opening the door your eyes widened as the room was in fact very large as if a normal size livingroom. In the center was a small pool that was in fact the bath that looked to be able to hold ten people. Lining the walls were shelves holding different things such as soap, lotions and towels all above drawers to hold clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to a shelf, Kasai put his paw so you could walk off. You looked up in awe as Kasai slipped off his yukata folded in up before slipping in the drawer. You decided to prepare yourself so you began stripping out of your pants and shirt, after slipping off your underwear you felt the warm air hit your junk and let out a small shiver of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blush returned as you looked up to find Kasai completely shirtless, his face was now slightly covered by his big yellow pecs. His six pack crunched slightly as he moved his body to fold his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Kyle you've finished.\", Kasai smiled down at you, not affected by your nude form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded flushed. \"\"U-um yep I'm ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai chuckled and scooped you up, letting you feel his fur all over your body. The ninetales then squatted down and let you slide onto the tilted floor. You watched in awe as he stood back up and toward over you, his face now covered by his still clothed bulge and his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go over to the bath and get acquainted with the water, I will be over once I completely undress.\", Kasai grinned as he watched his tiny guest below him move away from his large feet and towards the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked over to the bath ledge and took a seat you wondered of what was yet to come. The ground would lightly shake from Kasai moving meaning he may be done soon. You decided to take a glimpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back was a amazing sight. Kasai being shirtless had his muscled back showing, and now the buff anthro had no pants on. For underwear, Kasai was wearing a fundoshi so his large firm butt cheeks had no coverage and as he turned around against the fabric was a outline of a large penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling off the underwear let Kasai's manhood be free. The large yellow penis with a red tip was rested on a pair of large balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai stated walking over, his member and muscles shifting with each step. The towering buff body soon stooped and loomed over with the Ninetales foot paws on both sides. He grinned as he squatted down and let you crawl onto his palm again, he then slowly got into the warm bath and let you into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd love to hear more about you, dear Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure.\" You told Kasai, as you sat down and then began to tell him your life before finding yourself in this brand new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis included your days growing up and everything else that came along with that. Although you made sure to not mention that Pokemon of any kind. Even anthro like ones like Kasai and his butler weren't real since you weren't sure how the anthro fire fox would react to such news.

You sat below dressed as you remembered vividly just how defined the Ninetales' muscular form was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon were being held once again by the warm palm as Kasai exited the bath house area, being greeted by the cool air of the hallway. Kasai smiled as he held your tiny body close to his large pecs, his tails swished gracefully as he walked down the halls and felt the soft carpet beneath his foot paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we've had a good wash together Kyle, I feel that I should show you around my large home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and looked in awe as Kasai walked into a large rooms with multiple tables and bottles of alcohol hung on the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a get together room, if I ever have friends or visitors over we usually commute in this area. It also has a private room reserved for two Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flushed as the private room was red in color with a bed. It was possible this may be a room for budding lovers, maybe a human and a pokemon could bond here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buff anthro then brought you to another room, this one had multiple photos over the walls. They were a mix as some resembled renaissance-esk paintings while others took on a classic Japanese artsyle. Tall book shelves stood at the end of the room, as Kasai walked towards the books you saw a mixture of books talking about different regions, art, and government structures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my reading room, having beautiful and thought provoking pictures tends to help me focus. These pictures are a mixture as I want everyone to be able to connect somehow, rather it be family or love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up as Kasai was In a state of thought. He was correct, some pictures featured gatherings of get togethers, with many people laughing in joy. Young starter Pokemon being cared for by their parents. One in particular must have been Kasai's as it showed him as a youngling being hugged by two older Ninetales as he smiled. A warmth was installed upon seeing him and his family so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro Ninetales soon found the painting you were looking at, a sad smile grew on his face as he walked over to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, this was painted when I had just evolved. I sometimes forget that father and mother are....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Kasai close his eyes in sorrow, seemingly remembering bad memories. Slowly you crawled over to his thumb and warmly embraced it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai looked down in surprise before smiling and bring his palm to his face. He hummed and nuzzled you with his snout. You weren't flustered by this and instead felt a deep warmth from the affection shown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Kyle, I apologize for being melancholic. Memories of sad times often rise within me.\", Kasai smiled as he lightly kissed you and brought you back to the level of his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai soon left the room and walked down the lush halls.

And when he opened it you were then greeted by the outside again. However, off in the short distance you saw a large greenhouse. You found yourself wanting to ask him about this, but before you could you felt Kasai walk over to it and then open one of it's door and walked inside of it which gave you a wonderful view of all of the flowers that they had.

Akahi wasn't wearing his suit but a white tank top looking rather snug as his large pecs and firm abs looked very prominent. His large red furred thighs were being clothed by tan shorts that hugged his bulge and shapley rear. Akahi's buff arms stretched as he reached down and picked up a basket with assorted plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flareon smiled as he brushed his top fur out of his face. \"Ah yes, while you and Kyle were in the bath I received a call for a collection of the finest flowers on account of a wedding. I wanted to make sure everything was as fresh as possible.\", Akahi looked over his large pecs at you in Kasai's palm. \"Have you been enjoying your stay Kyle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned and nodded. \"Yep he's been showing me around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai smiled as he held you before the basket of fresh flowers. \"Me and Akahi grow flowers from various regions such as Sinnoh, Kalos, and others. Many Pokemon from out of town ask for our plants for any celebration they are planning. I find it nice that we can raise such beautiful plants and let others enjoy them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you listened to the Ninetales' soft tone, hearing his happiness and gratitude to live a life. Kasai soon brought you to his face and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always loved nature, it has so many beautiful gifts to grant us. My parents grew up appreciating the Kanto land and I guess you could say it passed onto me hehe.\", Kasai chuckled as he looked over the large group of flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very nice, I kinda grew up in the city so I don't think I have that much experience.\", you rubbed the back of your head, the beautiful world of Pokemon and bright nature was nice but foreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai lightly rubbed your head, giving you a chest full of warmth. \"Don't worry Kyle, I promise you will enjoy your time here.

Of course he made sure to point out that they did pay for the items once they were delivered, which was the same for when people who are going ot get married asked for either flowers and berries.

It was a slightly large room with decorations of edo style paintings, showing anthro versions of the numerous legendaries. The room's main fascination was the numerous amount of instruments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a display were traditional instruments such as a shakuhachi and Biwa among with drums. As well as the more elder instruments were European instruments such as a piano, chello, and violin. Kasai smiled at your look of awe as he walked over to a couch and sat down, bringing you to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...do you play all of these Kasai?\", you asked looking up at the handsome Ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai chuckled as he rubbed your head. \"I'm more experienced in the instruments of Kanto, i have dabbled a little in the other region's music but I'm not as skilled as the other musicians i heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular giant crossed his toned legs as he looked around the room, smiling. \"Whenever i have guest from around the world visit i like to hear what beautiful music they enjoy playing for others. Melodies can help calm the spirit and put ones energy into a beautiful chorus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hummed as you listened, Kasai had so much kind insight on many things. He truly must make people feel welcome you included. Rubbing the back of your head you looked up to the giant. \"Kasai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kyle?\", Kasai asked humming and looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lightly blushed. \"Could you...maybe play something? Uh only if you want to though!\", you waved your hands nervous about asking of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai warmly smiled as he leaned down and nuzzled you with his snout. You flushed before smiling at the affectionate rub. The Ninetales soon pulled you away and brought you down to the cushion next to him. Standing up to his towering height to wear you could see ever muscle being hugged by the clothes such as Kasai's abs and pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Kyle i would love to play for you.\", Kasai happily said as he walked over to his instruments his tails swishing in an excited manner. The giant soon walked back a shakuhachi in his large paws. You were soon scooped up into his paw as he sat down. Kasai set you on the top of his pecs as they were out pushed against the clothes so much were you had a nice seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai closed his eyes and took a deep breath before beginning to play the instrument. A soft and hollow sounding tune began to fill the room, the wooden instrument turned the breath of the giant into a alluring tune that pulled you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flute sounded beautiful but it also carried a sorrowful tone with it, a strange sort of sadness. Kasai's eyebrows furrowed as he played, the instrument was also nice to play but it brought back it's nice memories with it as well. How his parents would play for him, telling him to remember the melody and they would be in his heart and to bring people together with the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Kasai's sadness through his song, you turned and hugged the warm neck of the giant hopeful that some kindness would hopefully help. The tone soon ceased it's song, Kasai placed his instrument on the table and smiled as he felt your hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooping up from his neck, the Ninetales pressed a light kiss to your head. Giving a kind grin at your tiny body in his palm. \"Thank you Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and nodded. \"Thank you for playing, I'm sorry if it brought up anything sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai shook his head and hummed. \"Do not worry little one, i was told this music would bring others together.

I thought it be pleasant for all all of us to share some pleasant conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkahi nodded and chuckled as he grabbed a plate and began to gather his own share of food. \"That is true, last i remember we ate together as children. It's a nice throwback and more delightful now that we have a new guest.\", the Flareon said as he cut a piece of his nori roll and set it before you, rubbing your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner atmosphere was full of good energy as the food was full of deliciousness. You all enjoyed the fresh and warm rice, rolls, and salads thst were rich with flavor. Both giants generously put pieces of their food before you, giving the mouthwatering dishes small enough for you to feast on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very delicious Akahi!\", you said in awe up at the fire evolution. The Flareon grinned as he saw your cheeks stuffed with food and smiling. After swallowing it you suddenly grew concerned. \"Wait what of we don't finish it all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai warmly smiled as reached down to rub you. \"Do not worry Kyle, any leftovers we have are preserved and given to the orphange in town. We don't enjoy wasting food so we give it to others so that they can enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up in awe between the two buff anthros. \"Wow you two are amazing! You help out others and everything here has a special purpose. Thank you.....for allowing me to stay.\", you finished giving a small bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai felt his chest warm up as he gently scooped you up, bringing you to his snout and nuzzling you. \"Your welcome Kyle I'm glad you feel comfortable here. Helping others is what my parents and Akahi's had taught us. Kindness is a beautiful action that can lift up anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkahi smiled as he watched the two, there was undoubtedly a loving connection.

You then saw him walk into his bathroom and close the door behind him.And so you waited on the nightstand for about five minutes or so until you heard the bathroom door open again and you saw Kasai reemerge from it now wearing the purple pjs which looked very tight on fire fox's heavily muscled body. You were then picked up by the anthro Pokemon again s he walked over to his bed and then laid down onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then found yourself blushing a bit more when the heavily muscled giant Pokemon said, \"Well Kyle, I think you and I should.....</span></div></div>",

I want to thank you and offer you some fun in gratitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing at the deep sincere words of the giant you thought of everything. Kasai showed you care and kindness after only knowing you for a day. Showing such warmth, kindness,....love. Smiling through your blush you nodded up at the handsome anthro. \"Y-yeah thank you Kasai, i would love to have fun with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai grinned as he brought you to his handsome face, he began to nuzzle you with his warm snout. You felt warmth fill you at the affectionate gesture, before Kasai lowered you to his mouth and whispered. \"No need to thank me, I'm happy to give a gentlemen's love to my little human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai than gently pressed his soft lips to your body, easily kissing your tiny form. You giggled as the kisses both tickled you and tenderly massaged your body. Lightly pressing yourself into the top lip you kissed it best you could as it rubbed against you. Kasai hummed as he lightly rubbed your back with his furry fingers as kissed you. Sticking out his toungue a little, the Ninetales licked you with the warm muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away, Kasai smiled as you sat on his large palm. \"Did you enjoy that Kyle?\", the Pokemon kindly asked. You smiled as you still felt the sensation of the warm kisses. \"Ye-yes i did, it felt really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai chuckled before bringing you down and setting you on his firm thigh with the surface of soft silk. This also had you in close proximity of the round bulge. The Ninetales looked over his buff chest at you. \"I'm glad you liked it. Now i believe we should get more intimate....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbuttoning the top of his pajamas, the purple material was quick to separate with the large muscle pushing against it. Soon all the buttons were undone and Kasai's furred pecs and six pack were freed and casting you in their shadow. Kasai soon pulled off the top and stretched his large muscular arms over his chest. Picking you up, Kasai than placed you on the bed before getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have put these on so soon but i didn't want to surprise you by walking in nude Kyle.\", Kasai chuckled as he grabbed the waistband of his pajamas and began pulling them down. You looked in awe as the large and firm rear of the Pokemon showed, followed by his toned legs. As he lifted his legs to pull off the bottoms, you could see the large balls of Kasai before his cheeks closed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blush turned red as you soon had the towering buff gentleman naked. As you looked up at the large muscular features you began to slip your clothes off, figuring offering the same intimacy was fair. Kasai smiled as he bend down and filled your sky with his large pecs, the anthro picked up both his and your clothes, quickly folding them and putting them on his nightstand. You felt both embarrassed and warm as you saw the currently limp form of Kasai's penis resting against his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on his bed, Kasai scooped you up and set you on his large pec before hugging you to the muscle with a warm paw. The Ninetales closed his eyes and smiled as he hugged your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kyle...</span></div></div>",

Then why don't we start out here shall we?\" The heavily muscled nine tailed anthro fire fox suggested, before you found yourself being placed onto his gigantic right pec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this had been done you slowly started to stand up on top of the massive pectoral muscle. And upon doing so you could right away that the muscle was very firm and yet soft thanks to the fur from the NInetales. So before you did anything you just took the time to stare at heavily muscled anthro Pokemon body as compared to you it was like mountains or deep valleys of fur and muscles. However, as you were more so paying attention to Kasai's body you failed to notice when you fell down and in between his two gigantic light yellow furred pecs. After this was done you then felt the two gigantic mounds of muslce gently squeeze against you along with Kasai's voice when he asked, \"Are you alright, Kyle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm okay.\" You reassured him, to which you then gently gave inner parts of the pecs a rub with both of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this you then felt the pecs gently squeeze against you followed by hearing the buff fire fox letting out  ahmm of bliss to which you then continued to walk until you were outside and between his two pecs. Once there you walk over to the Ninetales right nipple and start to lick and rub it until it's completely hard. And as you do this you hear Kasai let out a moan of pleasure as you look over and see him rub his left hand over his left nipple until hard as well. With this done you then turn around and start to walk down and between each rwo of the Ninetales six pack abs. And as you ddi this you made sure to rub each ab one at a time which you knew pleased the giant anthro Pokemon as he moaned each time you do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand once you had reached the end of his abs you saw his now rock hard cock and massive balls behind it. This caused you to swallow a lump in throat and just at the member for a bit. Before while you did this you soon found yourself being picked up by Kasai.

Seeing the large and mighty manhood you felt yourself slip into lust as you nodded. \"I-i would really like that Kasai, you have an amazing body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai let out a grunt of pleasure, hearing your cute praises already was making his cock swell with lust. He needed to give this pleasure to you and him now. \"Thank you Kyle, i promise you won't be disappointed by a true gentleman's pleasure.\", the pokemon smiled as he gave you a quick tender kiss to massage and relax you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being tenderly kissed with the anthro's soft lips he began to bring you down his large muscular body. You could see Kasai's eagerness as his firm abs squeezed and flexed with his breath. Soon you were placed before the towering penis of the pokemon, it looked as high as a typical house. The yellow shaft went up to the pink tip that twitched as Kasai grew a larger erection due to your close proximity of his large manhood. You stood still for a few seconds, just admiring the sheer size of the cock. From his gentlemanly aura who would've guess that besides muscle Kasai had such length and girth on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought out of your gazing as Kasai's warm and large paw slowly pushed you towards the base of the cock. The redness from your face grew darker as you felt the firm and pulsing muscle as Kasai wrapped his paw around the dick. You could smell his scent strongly with both his palm and cock squeezing you into the warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai growled as a shock of pleasure went through him, despite your size the presence of you moving against his cock made him more lustful. Taking a breath, Kasai began to rub his large dick, not squeezing hard but just enough to keep you held in his jerk off session. You moaned as you were lightly squished and pulled up and down with the yellow base. A wet drip from above signaled precum beginning to drip from the tip of the cock, the watery drops began smearing over as Kasai started rubbing faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai continued to growl in pleasure, his lush bed began to creak as he moved with each rub. He curled his toes into the covers and bounced his large rear and pecs as he let out hot heavy breaths. More drops of precum flung off onto his thick thighs as he neared climax, his cock throbbed as you were simultaneously humping the hot skin and felt extremely turned on by the powerful cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shout, Kasai's pink tip let out a burst of cum like a blast. The warm semen spreading onto his thighs and down his base. You had a orgasm in sync with your sticky semen being swallowed by the Ninetales. Kasai breathed as he relaxed on his bed his eyes shut as his red snout let out relieved, pleasured breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext....</span></div></div>",

After doing this he then added on with, \"Though before we go to bed for the night we'd best clean ourselves up first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing this you just sat on the anthro nine tailed fox's hand as he walked into a nearby door and into a bathroom. Though this was different then the one with hot tub in it since this looked just like any other normal bathroom.

You were then dried off with a nearby hand towel and set down on the counter. AFter that had been done you saw Kasai walk into his shower and the turn on the water and let it go over his massively muscled body. And thanks to the fact that he had glass doors on top of the tub you could see every muscle and curve on his body as he cleaned himself off. And by the looks on his face the anthro Pokemon knew you were watching him as he flexed various muscles or showed off certain body parts like his backside, pecs, or cock and balls at some points during his shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once Kasai had washed off all of the soap suds and shampoo from his hair you saw him walk out of the shower and then dry himself off.

I think it'd be best if I showered before we did that.\" He then lifted up his free arm and hten flexed it before he added, \"Because as you can see I've gotten prety sweaty after finishing up my workout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um, alright Shadow. That's not a problem.\" You reassured the anthro Pokemon, as he walked into the bathroom after closing the door and turning on the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the Houndoom look down at you with a happy smile on his face before you were gently placed onto the bathroom counter. And upon oding so you realized that Shadow's huge purple covered bulge was right in front of you. You found yourself when you saw the anthro fire and dark type undo the puprle jockstrap and remove it from his body which gave a very close up and clear veiw of his two huge orange furred balls and currently soft orange and black headed member. You then looked up saw once you saw Shadow toss the jockstrap into a nearby clothes basket. To which then the huge anthro Pokemon proceeded to push open the clear glass door rhat he had in his shower. This again gave you a very good view of not only his huge and wide black furred back which had gray bone like markings across it. Although you had also noticed it on that was around his neck, wrists, ankles, and a few markings on his tail too. You also saw and blushed upon seeing his two very firm and muscled buttcheeks which were black furred on the outside while the inner part was orange in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he had gotten into the shower you saw the Houndoom close the glass door and then turn on the water. However, once the heavily muscled anthro Pokemon stood in the water you thought you saw him look over at you and then wink at you before he started to flex various muscles. And you were for sure you hadn't been seeing things when Shadow had rubbed body wash over his pecs and then bounce them as the water fall down onto them removing the body wash form his body. Although that was the last thing you saw since you found yourself blushing a dark red which prompted you to turn around to give the huge Pokemon some privacy so that he could focus on making sure he got clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after 20 minutes had passed you heard the water being turned off and the glas door being slide open as Shadow let out of content and remarked, \"Ah, there's nothing better then a nice hot shower after a very long and hard workout session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to look over back over at the HOundoom, who you saw had dried himself off with a towel, and had now wrapped it aorund his waist. You then saw him walk back over to the counter before you saw one of his huge hands set down in front of you. Seeing this caused you to smile as you got onto it while Shadow made his way to his bedroom after making sure you were in the center of his hand. And once he had reached his bedroom you were set down onto a dresser that was level with his pecs as the heavily muscled Houndoom had decided to.....</span></div></div>",

You blushed slightly in embarrassment, but Shadow smiled and lightly bounced his pecs before he started to pull on a pair of black gym shorts. The shorts were snug and went mid thigh, you could see a slight outline of his large member against the black cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom then slipped on a white tank top over his bulky torso, his large black furred biceps were uncovered and the neck line was low enough that you got a view of his pecs that were squeezing the shirt along with his row of abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow then laid a palm down for you, which you crawled onto as he held you before his big pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed the back of your head. \"U-um I'm sorry for staring Shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pecs then bounced as Shadow chuckled. \"Don't be sorry Ben, I'm actually flattered. I enjoy working out and seeing you look at me from below is really a nice feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as Shadow gave you a warm grin.

I decided to become one after I got this big. I know I could have picked anhy jobs that involved heavy lifting. But there's something really satisfying about doing a lot of different muscle poses while wearing either a jockstrap or a speedo on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, I see.\" You let out, as a blush spread across your face after hearing what the giant anthro had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you soon found yourself blushing a even darker shade of red upon seeing Shadow wink at you as he commented, \"Glad to see that you like that, Ben. So besides you getting to watch my routine from the sidelines. Maybe I'll practice at home sometime. And I know that both of us would enjoy that a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I-I guess I would....\" You let out, as Shadow walked out of his house and then used a key to lock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had done this you held onto his neck as best as you could while the giant heavily muscled anthro Pokemon canine began to walk away form his house and onto the sidewalk.

And thankfully it seemed like none of them noticed you due to be right next to the dark and fire type's large neck. Or if they did they didn't seem to ask Shadow to stop walking so that they could get a better look at you.

The black furred body had a firm six pack and large pair of pecs to top them off. On his large thighs and biceps were the yellow rings much like a Umbreon's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crimson eyes of the buff anthro looked up from his pulsing bicep as he saw Shadow's reflection in the mirror. He soon turned to show his muscular front as he wipped from sweat from the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Shadow I was wondering when you arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow smiled as he crossed his large arms. \"Hey I always make time to flex with the guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon grew a small smile on his serious face. \"Yes you never back down on your promises.\", the crimson eyes suddenly locked onto the crook of Shadow's neck, you lightly gasped as it appeared he saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow....is that a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom chuckled as reached up and scooped you into his warm palm. You didn't feel fear, after all Shadow wouldn't expose you to any harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've always had a keen eye Lune, this is Ben I found him while working out and promised to take care of him.\" , Shadow then smiled down at you. \"Ben this is Lune, we've been bodybuilders buddies for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLune smiled and bowed his head a little. \"It's a pleasure to meet you Ben, I trust everything is alright with Shadow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and flushed at the deep voice. \"Um...yes! Shadow is really nice and takes care of me! I'm glad he found me when he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow smiled and bounced his pecs, hearing his little buddy have so much trust in him was a warming feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLune smiled warmly. \"Yes he always looks after the ones he cares about. Your truly lucky Ben.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Shadow placed you in Lune's warm large palm as he went to put his clothes in the gym lockers. You looked over the large black pecs at the dark type anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lune....how did you know I was a human?\", you asked curiously, it seemed humans weren't in this world so how did Lune know you were one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon lightly chuckled. \"Well Ben I often study old stories from the ruins of different regions. Some talk of tiny creatures called humans that grace this world. While a legend there have been rumors of Pokemon secretly taking care of them. It's a tad embarrassing but I'm a bit envious of Shadow, having a human in one's care is said to bring true happiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awed at that, so other humans came here as well? Strange but an interesting situation, maybe these legends had truth to them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Shadow returned, wearing only his jockstrap.

I think that spot should be a good enough distanceAnd so you .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why exactly would that matter?\" Lune asked, now tih a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It matters because I want to show my little buddy how big and strong I am by doing some different poses. You can join in as well if you want to, Lune.\" Shadow explained, still with a tooth filled grin plastered on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this caused you to look over at the heavily muscled anthro Umbreon to let out a light chuckle before he stood next to eh heavily anthro fire and dark type canine and replied, \"Very well, but I let's try and not go overboard alright? Since I know you only want to do this to show off I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I can't help it that I'm so huge.\" Shadow remarked, before he brought one of his biceps to his muzzle and then proceeded to kiss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw the heavily muscled Houndoom wink in your direction. This caused you to blush which only became a darker shade of red as you saw the two heavily muscled anthro Pokemon start to do various poses.

Numerous mats and dumbbells to aid in the buff anthros fitness of becoming more buff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow and Lune soon sat down on a spare bench, in front of them sat dumbells of various weights and sizes. The large Houndoom soon lowered you down and set you between his large thighs. You felt headed but also calm from being in close proximity to your protector. Sitting down, you leaned against the firm and furry wall taking notice of how Shadow's bulge twitched and he hummed. Although you couldn't see his face past his large pecs, you could tell the Houndoom was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow felt a wave of warmth as he felt his little buddy relaxing against him. Being so calm with him must mean you really trust him. The buff pokemon grinned as he pulled up two dumbells, giving one to Lune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom and Umbreon began lifting up the weight, their biceps pulsed as with each pump the large muscles flexed. You watched in awe as Shadow let out gruff breath and his abs and pecs flexed as he breathed with each lift. The orange and black muscles showed their strength as they stretched and shed sweat from the workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lune let out a grunt from the lift, his crimson eyes saw you admiring Shadow's buff physique.

So you'd best take off those clothes of your's little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright...\" You replied, before you found yourself trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for thsi was because both Shadow and Lune were taking off their respective jockstraps. This however only caused your blush to get darker in color as you saw both of the heavily muscled anthro's wide and muscled backs to you. Not only this, but it also gave you a clear view of both Pokemon's large, muscled, and very firm looking buttcheeks. Although since they had been wearing jockstraps to begin with it's not like their backsides had been completely covered or anything from the start. However, you quickly decided to try and not stare them as you got to undressing, and once you were done doing so you folded up your clothes and put them in a small corner of the locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after you had done this you were left completely naked just like they were. However, you still found yourself letting out a gasp of surprise when you turned around and saw both Pokemon's large balls and currently soft members. Well Lune's was soft at least, Shadow's orange and black headed cock was completely hard. Thankfully though both anthro Pokemon wrapped their towels around their waist before you were gently picked up by the anthro Houndoom and was held in forn to fhis massive chest again. You then watched as the two headed to a door that was a bit away from the locker room area.

It's one of those food spots that's a gem to eat at!\", Shadow grinned as he brought you up and set you on top of his huge pecs. Lightly rubbing your head, the buff anthro then went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diner was mostly empty with only a few costumers. There was light cheery music playing and the waiter gave a friendly hello. You weren't spotted as not only were you tiny but Shadows fur and huge muscles hid you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at a booth, Shadow set you down on the table letting you see the looming Houndoom set his chin on his pecs as he smiled down at you. \"You know Ben, back in the sauna i wasn't just flirting. If you really want you can check my body out up close when we get home~\", Shadow grew a sly grin as he flexed his bulging bicep, stretching the sleeve of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed but smiled, remembering the towering buff Houndoom's huge body. His bouncing pecs, thick thighs, large bulge, and firm butt.....sighing you tried to shake off your red face as you heated up. \"Y-yeah that sounds great Shadow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow grin widely as he bounced his pecs and rubbed your small body with his soft finger. \"Great, trust me Ben we'll both enjoy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a waiter came over, Shadow placed you between his large thighs to hide you. The bulge of the buff giant sat before you looking more inflated which means Shadow is already getting excited, well you are as well with your boxers feeling tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow soon made his order while you sat with the thighs looming over like a canyon, you couldn't see Shadow's face as his large pecs blocked it. Soon you were plucked up and set back on the table. The service here must be quick as on the table was a grilled sandwich with some fries, freshly cooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom then tore off a piece of a fry and gave it to you, you thanked him and enjoyed the warm and salted side. Shadow smiled as he began to gladly share his food with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon....</span></div></div>",

Once he had done this you watched as the giant anthro walked back over to the table and gently picked you up and started to head back to his home all with a big grin on his face. Seeing this though only caued you to blush as you weren't exactly sure what the heavily muscled fire and dark type dog had in mind. But from his earlier comment you knew it was most likely something naughty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd about fifteen more minutes had passed until you found yourself back at the HOundoom's home. You then watched as he unlocked the front door and walked inside before shutting and then locking the door again. And once he had turned on some lights you then noticed that the Houndoom was heading into his bedroom. You were even more surprised when you were set down onto the largest dresser that hed which was level with his top row of abs. You then saw him bend down a bit to grab some clothes from the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him look down at you and then wink at you before he said, \"I'll be right back Ben. I'm just going to change so that our \"fun\" can get started tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, that's fine....\" You let out, as a light blush spread across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this you saw him walk out of his bedroom and head into hsi bathroom to change.

Shadow grinned as he stood before the dresser and leaned forward to put his large pecs before you. \"So Ben i figure I'd treat you to some poses before our fun begins. You were quite fond of mine and Lune's competition earlier~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redness didn't wane from your cheeks at the deep voice booming down from the wide broad shoulders and round pecs. Still Shadow was nothing short of muscular and you found quite a fondness to the Houndoom's sexy and caring personality. Awkwardly smiling you nodded. \"Y-yeah that sounds good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow's eyes lit up as his thin tail waved to show his excitement. Backing away from the dresser now had the bodybuilder furred muscles in full view, down to his large feet up to Shadow's handsome horned head. Running a paw up his thick thigh Shadow smirked sexily. \"Alright, let me give a special show just for you.\", with that Shadow brought up his large arms and flexed the furry biceps. The buff biceps pulsed and bulked as Shadow flexed and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunching forward had the numerous abs crunch. Shadow smiled as he felt his muscular stomach flex before bringing his face up that rested just a few inches from you. Looking up from the orange abs to the handsome Houndoom made your chest heat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how long have you been a bodybuilder Shadow?\", you timidly asked the buff anthro. Shadow stood up and threw his buff arms behind his head and bounced his huge pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming the Houndoom looked up while still flexing his buff pecs. \"Wellll since i was a teenager i had always loved fitness, though i took the career option seriously after turning nineteen. Ever since then I've been loving this! Putting work into your body is an amazing feeling, not to mention...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow soon turned around, showing his muscular back cased in bone and large firm butt. The Houndoom slyly grinned over his shoulder before waving his hips to bounce the round ass. \"I think posing this buff body makes a certain someone excited~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt both weak and excited, seeing the poses of the giant muscular anthro brought an arousal to your body. Watching this mountainous Pokemon flex his muscles was both forgein and amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back around Shadow smiled as he gently plucked you up with his fingers.

It's been a blast and I want to try my hands at it. Shout out to <span class=\"clblue\">TheGamerSwordsman</span> for helping me be confident in adding furry chapters, thank you my friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here's the set up, you will pick an anthro and from there you will go anywhere. You a human, are brought to a new world, shrunk and have towering anthropomorphic animals walking around.This world of giant anthros could be a normal city, a fantasy kingdom, or a futuristic world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm also adding Pokemon and Digimon options. You can pick the already anthro ones or you can pick anthro versions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpdate (April 10, 2018)<br>\r\n- Me and TheGamerSwordsman will be putting up edited chapters from the interactive Friendly Male giant pokemon. The reason being new rules have been put up saying that sexual content isn't allowed, so we will edit our chapters slightly and put them here. If you seen those chapters and see them here know that its intentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo rules!<br>\r\n- Male interactions only<br>\r\n- Anything goes, except scat or piss<br>\r\n- Keep the ages of characters doing grown up things above 18<br>\r\n- Please add at least a paragraph to chapters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, read on and enjoy!<br>\r\n</td>",
