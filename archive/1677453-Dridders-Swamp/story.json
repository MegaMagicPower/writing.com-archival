Although he is 16, Skylar spent most of his life as a slave for a king. The King was not evil or cruel, he was nice. It was the King's guards that gave him most of the trouble. The King never knew about it, but he was tortured daily. One day, the King called on Skylar. Skylar walked into the King's throne room and kneeled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called me sire?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skylar, you have been my slave for over 13 years\" started the King. \"You have obeyed every order, completed each task, and did it extremely well. I think it is about time that you deserve some freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire?\" Skylar seemed overjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skylar, I am setting you free. There is a family in the next village over that will accpet you. You will be sent there this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar jumped up and cheered. Some of the knights walked over and grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you act this way in front of the King!\" said the one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knights! Settle down!\" yelled the King. \"Skylar is overjoyed. I almost guarantee you that if I said you get unlimited beer for a month you would do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar laughed a little, and the guards backed up. Skylar walked up to the King and shook his hand. \"Oh thank you sire!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, I'm not your master anymore. You are your own person now. But, if anything is needed, please contact me or the princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do my lo...I mean, King Darwin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar stopped shaking his hand, and left the throne room. Later in the afternoon, Skylar walked outside. A carriage was waiting for him. It wasn't a royal carriage, then it would cause attention. The princess was waiting in front of the carriage. The princess was at the age of 18. She had orange hair, blue eyes, and freckles. She was wearing a long, pink dress, and a gold tiara. Skylar bowed to her before he went into the carriage, and the princess peered in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all I can do for you now\" said the princess. She handed Skylar a smal sac. Skylar slightly opened it, and many gold coins appeared. \"This is for you to but some proper clothing when you get to the next village\" she continued. \"I will miss you Skylar. You were almost a brother to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will miss you too Princess Izellia\" replied Skylar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage went off, but an the princess waved. When the carriage was out of sight, Isellia stopped and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wish I could tell him that in order to get to the village you need to get through Dridder Swamp\"</i> thought Izellia. <i>\"Skylar would be very lucky to make it out of that swamp alive.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage rode off. Skylar fell asleep in the carriage. Sudedenly, the carriage jerked and halted to a quick stop. Skylar got up, and looked out. The horse and the carriage driver were gone. Skylar slowly got out and wandered around. He was in a dense, dark, moist forest. He started to walk backwards and look around quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello...?\" he said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar backed up into what looked like a giant spider web. Skylar tried to get out, but it was impossible. Above him, came down a...</span></div></div>",

There was a human dressed in rags for clothing. His hair was blue, and he was right beside the carriage. He was screaming for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Where did this human come from?\"</i>though Jade. <i>\"That one pulling the cart ran off when he saw me, and I grabbed his horse. Maybe this human was in the cart. But, why would the one leave the other?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade slowly crept down the web to approach the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar kept trying at the web, but he couldn't get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone help!\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then felt some other vibrations on the web. He stopped moving, and looked up. There was a creature that had the upper half of a human, but a lower half of a spider. The spider half was green and had eight skinny legs. The human half was obviously female. She had pale skin, dark green hair, and bright green eyes. Her nails were long and were green as well. She had large breasts, even though she had the appearance of a teenager. Skylar did not know what to do, he just stayed there frozen in fear. The creature crept closer to him, where she was within arms length. She then reached her arms out towards Skylar.</span></div></div>",

The creature slowly turned Skylar, to face her directly. Skylar dared to look, but he did. The creature's eyes seemed to glisten when she stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why isn't this thing eating me?</i> Skylar thought. <i>I have never seen this creature, but it sure looks dangerous</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the creature walked further down the web, and finally placed Skylar down. She released her grip, but Skylar still remained frozen. The creature looked at him worryingly. Finally, she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Skylar a little, but he finally replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm f-fine\" he muttered. \"Wh-Who...Wh-Wh-What...are...you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm what sone might call a Dridder. A Dridder is a mythical creature that is half human, half spider. Most of them eat humans as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar backed up a little, but the Dridder put her hand on his shoulder. \"Don't worry\" she said.  \"I'm not like that. However, I am going through some changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Like w-what?\" asked Skylar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, during my teenage years, I will experience some growth spurts.

Most of the more violent Dridders are awake at night, so you will be okay. But why were you in that carriage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was once a slave, but I was released. The King was sending me to the next village to a new family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd...I thought everyone knew about the outside path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outside path?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a path that runs around the outside if the swamp. Dridders never attack outside of their territory, so most travelers take that path. I wonder why you were on this path...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar didn't know either. Either the king or princess did not know, or they did it on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, they would not have done that. The King and Princess loved me. They would never have done that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun started to go down, and Jade looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you are not traveling now\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now I won't\" replied Skylar. \"Just wish I had somewhere safe to sleep for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stay with me. I sometimes collect stuff from humans that they drop, and I think I have something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade reached out and gently grabbed Skylar. Skylar did not move, he knew Jade was not going to hurt him. Jade climbed up her web and entered a large room made entirely out of silk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very talented\" said Skylar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade giggled as she continued down in. In the room of web was a pile of different objects. Jade went threw these objects, and pulled out a bed. It already had sheets on them, but not neatly. She placed the bed down, and Skylar climbed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" she replied. \"I'm just happy that I'm not alone tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade crawled up one of the webbing, and quickly fell asleep.

The scary thing was that all three were at least twice your size. Skylar was certain that he just became dridder food and his life was over. He almost started crying until you heard Jade's soothing voice. \"See girls? This is the guy I was telling you about! Isn't he cute?\" the other two giggled again. Skylar was confused \"Jade? Is there something I'm missing here?\" Jade smirked and said, \"Skylar, These are my two friends. This is Kyria\" the blue skinned one bowed, saying \"Pleased to meet you, handsome. *giggle*\" you blushed at her gesture, and Jade continued. \"And this is Myrraiah.\" the bigger one patted your head, and said \"You can call me Myrrah, if you'd like, cutie! I KNOW we'll be together for a looooooooooooooooong time!\" she kissed Skylar's cheek, and he blushed violently. they giggled again, and Jade told him why they were here. \"These two are some of the sweetest dridders in the entire swamp! when i told them about you last night they just HAD to get a look at 'cha!\" Jade unwraps your web, and both Myrrah and Kyria hug you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Skylar was at ease, finally. \"These two look completely harmless. they cant be man-eaters!\" he thought. suddenly, Myrrah belched, rubbing her tummy, and saying, \"Sorry, pardon me. those humans i ate won't stop kicking!\" Skylar's eyes shot open in fear, but Myrrah continued \"I wonder who they were after? they said that there was a slave that was hiding in the swamp. something about dragging his dead body on a chain when they found him, they'd drag his corpse back to the king or what not. i don't know. they were tasty after i peeled their shells off!\" It hit him like a runaway train. \"The driver... he wasn't eaten, he left me in the swamp to die! No! It can't be! Unless... oh, those knights. i should have known they'd do this to me. jealous bastards. I mean i serve for years, yet they get more priveleges than me. and they're STILL jealous? At least i'm better with these three. I mean they ARE pretty nice and cute.\" As Skylar finished this thought. Myrrah suggested, \"Howabout we pay their home a little visit? I mean, they should be nice to us with our cute little friend here!\" Myrrah patted his head, and he agreed. \"Let's get going, then!\" Kyria put Skylar on her back, for him to ride on. and the four of them headed off to the castle of your former servitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A couple hours pass, and the four friends reached the castle. \"This is it, my friends. please wait out here while i bring a couple 'friends' out to 'play with you.'\" Myrrah smiled and Kyria hugged Skylar. as he headed into the castle, the three dridders decided to tell a ridiculous story to pass the time. \"So there's this doctor riding an ice cream cart with wings...\" (dridders do tend to have outrageous imaginations). Back in Skylar's point of view, the whole town was carrying on as usual, until the guards saw him; the two that were with Skylar upon his release. the fat one's jaw dropped. \"No! Impossible! You should be dead!\" the tall one was speechless, but had his hand on his forehead. Skylar was furious, and with good reason, too. \"So you admit it! You tried to have me killed! \" taking a deep breath, Skylar asked \"would you like to see how i survived? You two would never believe this in the least!\" snickering, the two leave their posts, and follow Skylar to the gates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The three's story was wrapping up, with Kyria as the ending narrator \"...when suddenly the artist had a stroke! The glittery monstrosity no longer existed and the doctor was saved. his quest could carry on and THAT would be a story all in itself!\" out of ideas at the moment. the three began laughing and laughing and laughing. \"this story can really screw someone's brain over!\" said Myrrah. Wiping a tear of amusement from her eyes, Kyria responded \"Yeah, and what makes this even better? I was writing it as we went along! This was the craziest story since last week. you know, the one with the guy in the world between insanity and reality?\" catching her breath, Jade said \"I remember. the guys who fought monsters by firing tree stumps when they bent backside first at them. not to mention the snails with jet engines and the random guy on a bumper car popping out of nowhere and in the strangest places. that was classic! If only Sky wa... Oh hey baby!\" he smiled as she acknowledged him. Laughing, he said \"That story you were telling; i heard bits and pieces of, but it was hilarious!\" bowing, Myrrah asked, \"Sky, Are these your friends?\" becoming angry quickly, he said \"far from it! I figured you'd be hungry, so i picked up the two who tried to get me killed!\" Kyria's tummy growled, and Jade began sealing them in silk. the men screamed, but it was too late; they were wrapped tight. Kyria grabbed both of them and spoke. \"Hey, Myrraiah? which one do you want?\" looking at both men, Myrraiah licked her lips and said \"i think i want the plump one! just make sure you peel off his shell before enjoying him! they taste so much better that way!\" Kyria smiled and began to strip him of his armour (like a peach or a banana). The bigger one began to plea with her. \"Please don't eat us! We'll worship you if you spare us!\" Myrrah thought for a few seconds, and replied \"Sorry, plump little snack. But you tried to leave my friend here for dead! Nothing personal, just family matters. *giggle* ah!\" Myrrah dropped the big guy into her mouth, tossing him around with her tongue. \"mmmmmmmmm.\" Myrrah was basking in his flavor, but her stomach demanded that she swallowed. in one gulp, the man's fate was at hand. slowly, but surely, the fat guard slid into Myrrah's belly. with a plop and a gurgle, Myrrah was satisfied. patting her tummy, she sat down and rested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kyria was done peeling the taller guard out of his plates, revealing a skinny, little body. \"Awww. not much meat on you. oh well. a snack is still a snack, no matter how scrawny.\" as she opened her mouth, the man begged Kyria to spare him, promising her his riches. Kyria closed her mouth and listened to him. \"If you let me live, i'll make you worth the royalty i serve!\" Kyria was interested, and asked \"Where is it?\" the guard said \"it will come soon. please wait with me while it comes?\" Kyria smiled, and replied \"Deal! and you can wait for it in my tummy! *giggle*\" the guard was terrified \"No! Please! Don't!\" Kyria quickly popped the naked guard into her mouth, and gulped. she burped a little, but it was so cute to Skylar. \"Did he taste good, Kyria?\" She smiled and said \"Oh yes! Very much so! now how about the four of us go home and get you nice, big and strong like us! you can still be a Human if you want!\" Skylar was puzzled, as he never knew anything about this sort of thing. \"You can actually do that?\" Kyria answered \"Oh yes, little one! Whenever a dridder meets a special human, we can give them a little nip and they'll grow as we do! You are one VERY lucky human, as only a handful recieve this gift!\" Skylar jumped in excitement. and Myrrah, who was watching, said \"Then it's settled! let's go home and make you bigger!\" So the four of them head off into the swamp, to make Skylar as big as them, and oh so happy with his new family of three gorgeous dridder friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"URP! *giggle* Excuse me!\" said Kyria. You smiled at her cuteness, and asked \"Kyria, Jade doesn't eat humans, and the three of you are friends. So why do you and Myrrah? I'm not judging; just curious!\" Myrrah smiled and explained it clearly to you. \"We were taught that humans were the mightiest and best prey in the entire world. However, since we have a human friend, we'll only eat those humans who try to hurt or take you away from us. unless, of course, you're ok with us eating your kind!\" Smiling, Skylar admits, \"I'm okay with it as long as it's just you guys. I gotta be honest, you two are so adorable when you're nice and full!\" Myrrah hugged Skylar tight, and as the sun began to reach it's zenith, they reached home sweet home. Jade was happy, as the past couple days were the best in her life. \"Now then, let's get started!\" she suggested. Kyria and Myrrah nodded. Skylar was placed in between the three, and his transformation was close at hand. the continuation of Skylar's life, however, is only a matter of \"perspective.\"</span></div></div>",

Up until now, she hadn't eaten a Human before, but now that Skylar asked, her lips moistened at the thought, and she licked them instinctively. He looked tasty in her eyes. \"Sure. Do you trust me to swallow you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria and Myrrah giggled. Jade was about to eat her first Human, and they got to witness it. Good thing it was happening here, and not out in the swamp without anyone to help Jade in eating Skylar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade approached Skylar and picked him up. She opened her mouth wide, giving Skylar a nice view of her throat. She licked him, enjoying his taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. You taste good.\" She said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to swallow.\" He said in a matching tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade smiled and put Skylar's head into her mouth. The taste of his full head giving her a much better feeling than just a small section of it. She swallowed up to his shoulders, feeling his taste through his clothing. She swallowed again, and was up to his chest. Her friends holding him steady as she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar didn't struggle at all during this. He actually found it to be strangely pleasant <i>I never thought I would enjoy this...</i> Her throat had looked so inviting, and her tongue felt nice along his skin. The warm confines of her mouth and throat soothed him. It wasn't long before all of him was curled up inside her stomach. He found it to be quite comfortable and ran his hand along Jade's stomach wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade let out a small burp and patted her belly.\"Mmmm. You were really good, Skylar. Thanks for letting me eat you.\" She yawned. Signaling her body's need for rest while it tried to digest it's newest meal. \"Let me know when you want out. I doubt you want to be digested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about that. I'll let you know when I'm ready to come back up. It's kinda nice in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade blushed, and her friends giggled. \"oh, Humans.\" Myrrah said in a joking tone.</span></div></div>",

After that bit of fun the dridder went off on her eight spider legs to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira opened her eyes when they reached the large cave the dridder lived in. Webs covered every surface, designed by the dridder herself to her liking. There were about dozen semi-cocoons like the one she was trapped in now, and about nine of them had people in them; another was even occupied by a lady elf. She seemed to be the only calm one; some of the captives wept in despair, others begged for release, and others still were too frightened to even speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dridder fastened Kira\u2019s cocoon to the webbing, conveniently next to the elf before heading deeper into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the \u2018Spider\u2019s Lair\u2019 as I like to call it.

She may keep you as you are like a trophy, she may use you for her sexual pleasure, she may keep you as a slave, or she may eat you. I was the first being she caught when she was first hunting, so she\u2019s kept me as a memento of that day. Since that day I\u2019ve watched her build her home and have seen hundreds of people come through here, but none of them have left. They\u2019ve all been eaten or died whenever Violet was too rough on them.\u201d Aziya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira didn\u2019t like the sound of any of those possibilities, especially the salve one. She\u2019d just gotten away from one cruel overlord, she didn\u2019t want to be under another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook on the bright side, she placed you near me. That may be a sign that you\u2019ll live a relatively long time here.\u201d Aziya said comfortingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d Kira moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several days Kira nervously anticipated the time when Violet would do something with her, but that time didn\u2019t seem to be anytime soon. Violet would come by every-so-often, but only to gaze at Aziya for a time before leaving. During those days Kira and Aziya became good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one morning Violet came to their area with plans in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are those plans?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kira looked at it and wondered if this would be her document before if she dies or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't stay here forever, I got a show to put together and a home to go to.\" With that the man struggled abit before a silver-like blade poked out of the spider silk. He motioned it back and forth until the silk-cocoon was opened. He  jumped out and landed on the ground with a light 'thud'. He then dusted himself then started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! your not just going to leave us here, are you?\" kira yelled.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rina was a peaceful dridder. A<i> GIANT</i> peaceful dridder who stood at an amzing 150 feet tall! Despite her huge size, however, Rina always felt that it was wrong to pick on anyone just because they were smaller than her. She had carved out a fairly good reputation for herself, and many humans came to her for assistance if they were being tailed by a massive predator. Of course, not everyone knew that she was peaceful. There were still plenty of people who had never even heard of her, and as such were incredibly intimidated by her. The human that she was about to meet was one of these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started as an ordinary day. Rina was out hunting for some deer that she could have for dinner. Being the gentle soul that she was, Rina would never eat a human, and deer were just as filling as far as her appetite went. They had become a staple of her diet, as they were fairly common in the woods next to the swamp she lived in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rina was searching for a snack, she saw a plume of smoke poking above the treetops. She immediately recognized it as the smoke from a human's campfire. Rina had lived in this swamp for her entire life, and over that time, she had learned that many other dridders saw the smoke from campfires as a giant sign saying \"Eat Me!\". She knew that whoever this human was, they were in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the compassionate creature that she was, Rina immediately set out in the direction of the smoke to rescue the human. She eventually came to a large clearing, where she saw a small tent and other camping equipment set up. The one thing that she didn't see, however, was the human camper. Just as she was starting to wonder if she was too late, Rina saw some movement coming from the tent. She carefully picked it up and dumped the human inside of it out onto the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young human woman was absolutely terrified, and began to cower in fear. Rina tried to stroke her back with her index finger to calm her down, but the human only got more scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please Miss Dridder, don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little human, I'm not going to eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you capture me like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see... Most dridders aren't as nice as I am. That campfire of yours is basically a signal to tell them where they can find a free meal! Speaking of which...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina then bent down so that her head was only a few inches away from the ground, and proceeded to blow out the campfire like a birthday candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that's much better. Now anyone who saw that smoke will know that someone else already got to you. By the way, my name is Rina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... Thanks, I guess... My name is Elisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Elisa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina then extended her index finger down for a 'handshake'. Elisa grabbed it and returned the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Miss Rina, if you don't mind me asking... Why did you help me? Don't most dridders eat humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you can just call me Rina. Well, to answer your question, yes... Most dridders <i>do</i> eat humans. Personally, I never really saw what was so enjoyable about it. After all, it would be cruel to take the life of another sentient being just for a snack! Your species doesn't taste that good either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that you <i>have </i>eaten a human before?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! I've tasted one out of curiosity once, but I've never actually eaten one. Please don't be afraid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Alright... So Rina, what are you going to do with me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking that I would just let you go on your way, but you're welcome to come with me to visit my home if you want... I always enjoy making new friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...  Well... I think that I'd like to...\"</span></div></div>",

But the war hadn\u2019t gone well for the humans, the dridders were too strong, smart, and knew the terrain of their swamp too well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it came down to her to make peace.

It was night by the time Arianna and Zanik finished talking, since the swamp was more dangerous by night than it was by day Zanik insisted that Arianna stay there for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Arianna heard voices outside her room. But she paid them no heed.<br>\r\nIt was Zanik and a pair of dridder gaurds that were talking outside Arianna\u2019s room. \u201cAlright let\u2019s go over the plan one last time.\u201d Zanik said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe both head for the human city, delivering the treaty to their king. We\u2019ll tell him that we were attacked by the beasts of the swamp on our way there and that the human princess was killed by the beasts.\u201d The first guard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen during the night we sneak into the king\u2019s chambers and kill him.\u201d The second guard said with eagerness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, make sure you\u2019re just seen not captured. Meanwhile I\u2019ll deal with the human princess. Without their leaders the humans will be quick to fall.\u201d Zanik finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose plan is this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here the pain began to grow worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just do to me?\" Arianna quivered as Zanik came closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZanik brought her face close to Arianna's and said, \"Just relax. I'm only giving you a better life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZanik's words didn't calm Arianna down. In fact they had the opposite effect. She didn't even want to know what Zanik had done to her, but knew whatever was going to happen will happen regardless of what she felt. She curled into a ball closed her eyes to help calm herself before becoming immobile. For Zanik, this was perfect and saved her some trouble.

She looked away and began to sob out of pain and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZanik scuttled a little closer and said, \"Don't be afraid. Once the change is complete, the pain will fade away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her legs were becoming one, the shape of them started to become a little more round. As Arianna looked through her teary eyes, she noticed that Zanik was starting to seem a little bigger as well. She took a quick look at her hand and realized that it was looking a little smaller as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shrinking?\" Arianna gasped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZanik shook her head and said, \"You're not shrinking. Your age is just regressing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU DO!\" Arinanna managed to scream out and began to sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Arianna's cries actually began to get to Zanik a little bit. She thought she'd enjoy seeing the human princess squirm, but knowing what Arianna's future held really altered perception of Arianna completely. She went right over to Arianna and placed a hand on her shoulder to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh. It'll be okay. Once you're transformation is complete, you will feel better. I promise,\" Zanik said and then planted a little kiss on Arianna's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, this seemed to do the trick. Arianna began to sit back and let the tears stop flowing as much. Her legs were completing their fusion and were beginning to round off into the shape of a spider abdomen. Just as that finished, eight spindly legs suddenly emerged from the underside of the abdomen causing a new wave of pain for her. It didn't last long however as at this point the pain became too much for her and she passed out. She continued to shrink as her body then began to take on a bright glow. Zanik looked away for a moment due to the brightness. But as she looked back, she was overjoyed by what she saw.</span></div></div>",
