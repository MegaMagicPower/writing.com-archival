            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Lyn\" target=\"_blank\">http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Lyn</a></b> Here is the main page for Lyndis, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with the character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly wake up, unsure of where you were previously or even what you were trying to do. Everything looks strange and alien, and you really have no idea what just happened. You see a few moderately large green strands that reach up to your chest, but the rest of the area is fairly open and flat, with various shades of greens and browns fading into the distance. Then you look further past you, and you nearly fall over when you see what looks like a nomadic hut, except it was far larger than any building or structure you\u2019ve ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then your memory starts to clear up a bit, and you recall your journey to the distant plains of Sacae, as you were ordered to observe and record the various kingdoms and lands of Elibe by the nobles of Ostia, as you were a scholar serving your home kingdom. And you remember that when you neared a Sacaen village, you were stricken with a terrible headache, so you stopped and sat down on a rock. And anything between that and now was a haze, so you figure that you passed out. And now it seems like you have more to worry about than a simple headache, because you somehow shrunk down to a miniscule level. Looking at the blades of grass again, you figure that you were no more than 2 inches tall, which was a frightening prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could decide where you should go next, you saw the flaps of the hut open, and an incredibly massive and beautiful woman walk out of it, shaking the ground around you with her thunderous steps. She seemed to be dressed in Sacaen attire, and from what you remembered from your studies, it seemed that she was a member of the Lorca Tribe. She had long flowing green hair, which was tied in a high pony tail, and matching piercing green eyes. You felt absolutely awestruck, and you couldn\u2019t even will yourself to shout up to her, from being so mesmerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the mystery Sacaen woman started to speak, saying \u201cAhh! The winds are flowing softly, and I feel like luck will be with me today. But for now, I should prepare some tea, before I go out to hunt for the day\u2019s meal.\u201d And then she quickly returned to her hut, and you knew immediately that you had to get her attention, because you knew that it would be impossible to fulfill your task, let alone survive, at this strange and dangerous perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were glad that the Sacaens built their huts in the manner that they did, because you would never be able to get through a normal door because of your size, and yet you were also not small enough to crawl under a door if you would have needed to. After a few minutes, you enter the Sacaen woman\u2019s hut, and you see her sitting down while she waits for her tea to heat up. As you walk closer to the woman, you notice that she wasn\u2019t wearing any shoes, and you were surprised that her feet seemed so smooth and delicate. You would have imagined that a Sacaen, with all their nomadic traditions, would seem much hardier and rougher. You wonder if it was a natural trait of the Sacaen people, and if it was a blessing that was passed down from their crusader ancestor, Hanon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get even closer, you pass her leather boots, and the scent that radiates from them is incredibly strong. You begin coughing, not expecting to experience such an intense aroma from a pair of feet that looked so soft and smooth. But before you could react, the Sacaen woman\u2019s feet started barreling right towards you, and slam into you, causing your head to be jammed between her 2nd and 3rd toes. Your head was held like a vice, and she would periodically scrunch her toes, as your presence was only able to cause an unconscious reaction out of her. They seemed to grip at your head like a mere pebble, and you were treated as ruthlessly as one would expect as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, her toes did not seem to carry the same intense odor as her boots did, even if he did notice a light similarity. He felt like he was being surrounded by nature, and it seemed natural for a woman who completely embraced the simpler life of nature. But he still noticed the overpowering smell that her boots carried, and the two aromas mixed in the strangest of ways, although you didn\u2019t seem to dislike it. It was an odd concept, to be thinking that way about someone\u2019s foot, but you ignore your opinion on the smell, and try and focus on a way to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could think of anything, she dragged her feet back under her chair, bringing you with them, and you felt the pressure increase as she put all the weight of her legs onto the balls of her feet. She then began to grind the balls of her feet back and forth, completely smothering you in her toe flesh, as she was completely focused on her heating tea. Your body was harshly pressed into the ball of her foot, and your head and face was crammed between both of her immense toes. For some odd reason, you didn\u2019t feel all that much pain, even though you were sure that you should have been dead by now, and you wonder just how you\u2019re still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the woman shouted, \u201cIt seems like the tea is finished. Perfect!\u201d She then shifts towards her table, lifting her legs in the process, which subjects you to strange pressures pulling at you from all directions. (they wouldn\u2019t know what G-force is anyway) When she stops, she crosses her legs, allowing her left leg to dangle over her right, causing you to be held in the air as well. You cannot look down, because her toes gripped your head even tighter than before, but you considered it a blessing, because you had no desire to see for yourself how high you were being kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she poured her tea and prepared her lunch, she happily wriggled her toes, giving your head a vigorous massage. Before she began to eat, she said \u201cPlease provide me with your blessing, spirits of the plains, and guide me in my hunt.\u201d She then remained silent for a few moments, and she was completely still as well, including her long and slender toes. You were happy that you got to hear a Sacaen practice their natural customs like this, but you\u2019d much rather be able to have a conversation instead, especially if it provided you some respite from this strange torture. Then she started to drink and eat, while her toes excitedly played with their new toy, while their master was none the wiser to your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could hope for would be to escape from this mess, and properly get this woman\u2019s attention. And as you think, you hear her mumble to herself \u201cSometimes, I get tired of this repeating life on the plains. I wonder if I could ever have an adventure, like my mother and father did when they were young.\u201d You could clearly understand this woman\u2019s desire for adventure, and you are sure that you could provide her with one if you could ever gain your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling alone, from Ostia all the way to the distant plains of Sacae, was fascinating for sure, but it was also incredibly lonely and sometimes even depressing. Luckily, you didn\u2019t ever run into any bandits or brigands, and you even met friendly people at the various towns and villages during your journey. But those days on the road, by yourself, were rough on your morale. Maybe this occurrence was an act of fate, but before you could continue pondering, the Sacaen\u2019s toes squeezed your head one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the woman said, \u201cNow that I\u2019m finished, I should head out to find something for tonight!\u201d You hope that your luck changes, and you have a chance to escape from her toes\u2019 clutches, and maybe even get her attention before she heads out to hunt.</span></div></div>",

This is how I will start her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra lay on the former battlefield she felt herself bleeding, the wound was bad but not fatal. In truth she'd rather have gone with Lyn but at the same time she was having a difficult time keeping her 'Princess' persona up. The Twintailed Cleric sighed as she lay. \"Well...\" She huffed. \"I can call down lightning yet I can't heal my own wounds, maybe one of the dead soldiers has some medicine on them? She pushed herself up and limped over to the nearest body, no luck, the second, nothing, third, nope. She was tired, not dying but tired, although falling asleep would be a bad idea with this wound. Dragging herself with the will she had left she found a mage's body. \"Now wouldn't this be-\" She picked up a strange spell book, it wasn't any sort of dark arts nor was it fire or anything like that, no this was simply 'growth' \"I might be able to use this?\" She shrugged. The red river reminding her there were worse ways to die. The book was no more than blank pages which must have been loose or damaged in battle perhaps As they scattered in a simple breeze, however they didn't go far instead they looped right back around and clung to her vanishing as they did. One page remained. Serra was really glad she knew how to translate the mysterious language it was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speakith the spell and one page will vanish, thy body reborn of new flesh and strength, you shall double in power without human needs, breath need not be drawn, food not consumed, Thy body in perfect health and clean. Be sure to don thy favorite armor or gown before using.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not have the fortinue of choosing.\" She moaned. \"Oh well here we go. Htworg!!\" She whispered as she felt her body pulse, she began to notice the world becoming smaller out of the 10 pages she had she felt as if one had vanished, her body seeming to mutate accoring to the book and her robes growing with her. Her wound healed as well she grew still \"I could catch up to Lyn now haha!\" She let out a laugh. \"Oh Lyn...I do believe I shall grant you the honor of my help!\" She called as she began walking in their general direction, the now 1,000ft tall Claric smiled brightly. But did she find them?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Eliwood and his comrades had escaped death upon Dragon's Isle. The vicious battle with Nergal's henchmen and the Marqess of Laus had left heart wrenching scars in Eliwood and his close comrades. Having evaded destruction by a Dragon, they fled to a small port town that was far away from the Black Fang's main force in Lycia. There the group rested and prepared for their next battle with the evil assassins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ninian layed silently in her bed at the inn. Her worries and sorrow over being so weak in human form left her in sadness. She was alone in her room, the door was shut and the fire burned peacefully as she layed there. She had a face of despair as she thought to herself. 'Lord Eliwod does so much for me. After his father gave his life in order to stop Nergal, it was him who carried me in his gentle arms all the way to Fargus ship. And he has always aided me when I need him most, ever since we met that time a year ago.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The beautiful dancer thought back to when she had met the young lord. Eliwood had fought bravely and defeated a horde of Black Fang assassins that had captured her. Single-handedly he crushed a army of 50 soldiers with no trouble. And then he carried her away from them in his arms. Even her brother Nils worked hard to make sure she was always safe, putting himself in danger for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But now he didn't all sorts of help. 'The power of Nergal is great, and with every passing moment he grows ever stronger.' Ninian thought sadly. 'Unless I become stronger. I will only be a burden to him.' She believed this to be true. That she was nothing more than extra weight that would be the doom of all those around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'If only I was bigger and stronger. Then I could fight alongside him. Maybe even a bit older  too.' Ninian blushed as she imagined a older and more busty version of herself. Casting spells and fighting alongside the young Red-haired lord that she loved ever so much. 'But there is nothing that could grant my wish.' Knowing this, she layed down and fell asleep. Hoping her rest would ease her troubled heart and restore her stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the young Dancer dreamed, she began to have visions. Of what, she was not sure. But she was certain that she was engulfed in a fog of cold and icy mist. \"Is anyone here?\" Ninian called out to her surroundings. Nothing but icy mist and more icy mist was around her. And only the cold breeze could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n [Do you Desire Strength?] A mysterious voiced called out from the mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hearing the voice, Ninian called out to it. \"Hello? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n [Do you Desire Strength] It said once again to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. I desire the power to protect the ones I care about.\" Ninian replied. She didn't know why, but this voice reminded of the voice that brought her to this world. A voice of someone she knew long ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n [Then I shall grant you strength] The voice said as everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quietly Ninian awoke from her deep sleep. Hours passing by like they had just happend. \"What a strange dream.\" Ninian spoke as she rubbed her eyes. 'It's not like a dream can grant my wish.' She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But then she saw it. At the end of her bed was orb. It laid right at the end of her feet. And inside it was a glowing frozen mist. All most like the dream she had had last night. \"Who put this at the end of my bed?\" Ninian thought as she got out of bed, grabbing the orb into her hands gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It glowed a bright light in a flash. \"AAAH!\" Ninian called out as she dropped it. The orb survived it's fall and landed with a thud. But began to roll under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What did that thing just do?\" Ninian pondered. 'It was probably nothing.' She decided after a few minutes of thinking. And so she decided to go downstairs. She was feeling much better, stronger even. And she had a sudden urge to go see Eliwood...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Azura was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembers the feeling of her body dissolving into water as she used her necklace's power to assist her comrades in Nohr and bring peace between it and the kingdom of Hoshido; at the time, it was a truly painful feeling on her body, and yet Azura felt glad throughout that pain, knowing that her power would end the conflict of the two kingdoms and assist her friend Corrin in saving the world, as the legend of Yato foretold. Now, her time was spent as a ghostly apparition, her spirit traversing around the world, unable to interact with anyone, only an observer as she watched the results of the Nohrian conquest unfold around her. She was glad to see Xander, now King of Nohr, keeping peace and a fair, brutality-devoid rule among the people as his younger sisters, Corrin and Elise, had wished for the kingdom; it was a sight that brought her joy, alongside watching her royal \"sisters\" &amp; \"brothers\" trading in their weapons for books and quill pens, and watching her husband, the Hoshidan ninja Kaze, and her children, Shigure and Midori, relish in the peacetime as a faction of Corrin's retainers. Azura was a little sad knowing she died without letting Kaze know, without wishing her children goodbye, or saying she loved them one last time, but the desperation of the final battle presented no chance for final words, and she knew that even if they didn't know she was dead, they all truly loved her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, Azura found herself in Castle Krakenberg, observing Elise, the royal who called her \"big sister\", getting ready for bed after an exhausting day of playtime. The young royal kicked her legs back and forth while sitting in front of her vanity, happily letting Camilla brush her hair while she brushed one of a small doll in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for helping me get ready for bed Camilla! It's soooo hard to brush my hair now that it's so long!\" The older, purple-haired princess giggled at her younger sister, enjoying their time they spent together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for my darling little sister; I'm just surprised you can manage to tie all this hair up into those pretty pigtails, and with the dyed strands in such a perfect helix too!\" Elise was gladdened by the compliment, never shy to nice words directed towards her. \"And how is the hair of that darling little doll you're working with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just doing fine!\" Elise answered with glee, \"Big Sis has such pretty long hair, but it is kind of a pain to run a comb through sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Big Sis! Here, look!\" With that, Elise turned around and handed Camilla the doll she had, allowing Azura to take a better look at it from over Camilla's shoulder. The doll was a perfect knit replica of Azura, with a fine white fabric sewn to be her dress, beautiful blue strands of yarn for her hair, and a wide knit smile with beautiful onyx eyes. Camilla felt a small murmur in her chest, finding Elise's childish love for Azura to be quite adorable, and a small smile crept over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now I understand, you meant Azura.\" Camilla ran her fingers across the dress, respecting the craftsmanship of the doll. \"Elise, you wouldn't happen to have made this yourself, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it! Hold on a second, you're gonna love this!\" Elise leapt off her chair and ran over to the corner of her room, next to her bed, and directed Camilla's attention to a small dollhouse. Elise pulled away the wall of the dollhouse, opening it like a door on a hinge, and began pointing to the dolls inside her home. \"You see? I made all of us for this house! There's me, you, and Corrin in the tea party room, Xander's right there in the living room, Leo's in the kitchen, and Father's on that big sofa! The real Father, not that spooky monster thing from before.\" Camilla came closer and looked at the display she was presented, admiring her little sister's work and love of her family combined into one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my! This must have been a lot of work for you! Now where on Earth did you find the time during all our marches to make this?\" Camilla handed off Elise the Azura doll she held, and the little princess set the doll inside a bedroom, tucking her in and closing the dollhouse's wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the dollhouse I had Effie buy for me from a toy store, and she and Arthur helped me knit these dolls together when Leo yelled at me for using up the royal funds on toys; he was a mean dummy, so we made him last.\" Elise looked inside the window of the dollhouse, smiling as she looked at Azura. \"Big Sis was a last-minute addition. It took a couple spurts of time to do it, but it was so worth it, cause now we're a big happy family! Big Sis even gave me some of her hair to tie in with the yarn to make her more real!\" Azura couldn't feel it in her ghostly cheekbones, but she knew she was smiling at Elise's love towards her. Elise sat on her bed, unruffling her pajamas as she got ready to lay down for bed. \"Hey, Camilla? When is Big Sis going to come back to us?\" Camilla felt a sense of worry, not expecting the question presented; she knew Azura was dead, Corrin having spoke to her, Xander, and Leo in confidence, and was sure the young princess would not be able to handle or understand the information, despite seeing her own share of corpses in her time. Camilla sat down on the bed next to Elise and wrapped an arm around her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elise, that's a little...tough to answer. Azura has...gone away on a trip for a while, and she's not exactly going to be coming back anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it's like you and Selena?\" Camilla bit her lip, remembering Selena's departure; she had told Camilla that she was from a different world and had to urgently go back home, and had taken Odin, Laslow, and Peri with her, the latter two having gotten married under their time as Xander's retainers. The thought was a little depressing, but Camilla understood it, and at least she had the knowledge Selena was alive and well, as well as a pair of friendship earrings shared between the two of them and Beruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...different, sweetie. Sure, she's on a long trip, and we might not see each other again, but you see, they had to go back to their hometown, where as Azura is just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Just' what? Camilla, you're not making any sense.\" Elise started to tear up a bit and puffed her cheeks out. \"Did she go back to Hoshido after the war? To see Sakura again? Does she not like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Elise,\" Camilla answered, stroking her sister's face, \"Azura loves you very much, I know that for certain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why is she gone? Give me one good reason why we can't be a family again!\" Camilla took a deep breath and exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Elise, I can't explain it; sometimes, grown-ups just do things for weird reasons, but I promise you, we're still a family, and the day will come where we're all a family once again. Do you understand, little sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really...\" Elise answered, feeling dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's hard, but I promise that you'll always have Corrin and I around to love you. We promise to love you twice as much until Azura comes back, to make up for her absence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cross my heart and hope to...well, let's just say it's a sisterly promise.\" Camilla leaned into Elise and held her finger in front of her face, quitting her petting. \"Now, how about the two of us take you shopping tomorrow in the slums? We'll buy you some toys, chocolate, and new clothes, but only if you get right to bed and brush your teeth tomorrow morning, promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Camilla leaned into Elise and kissed her forehead, before removing herself from the bed and walking to the door. \"Goodnight little princess, I love you!\" Camilla unlit the lamp in Elise's room and left, leaving Elise to her own thoughts in her moonlit room. Azura looked upon Elise, sorrowed that Elise couldn't see her back or that she could never interact with the young princess again, and her heart felt truly wrenched when she watched the young girl begin to cry. Elise looked up at the moon out her window, looking at the sky in the surprisingly clear Nohrian night, and silently asked why things had to be why they were. Just then, a shooting star shot across the sky, surprising Elise. She remembered Corrin had told her Hoshidan stories about shooting stars and how they could grant wishes, she felt now was her chance to get the answers she needed; Elise clasped her hands together and began to pray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mr. Star, please bring back Big Sis to me!\" prayed Elise, \"I don't care how, I just want to have a happy family again, we've already lost Father and almost lost Corrin, so we really need this one! Please help me out here, I just want her all to myself so we can play together again, with Camilla, and Corrin, and Xander, and even Leo! Thank you Mr. Star! I need to get to bed now, goodnight!\" From that, Elise leapt into her bed and stuffed herself under the covers, sobbing herself to sleep softly. Azura watched this whole scene unfold with sorrow, before feeling sleepy herself, an odd sensation considering she didn't require rest anymore; she willed herself to close her eyes and let her mind go adrift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Azura \"awoke\", she instantly felt different, actually feeling a ground under her, feeling the air around her. She ran her hands across her body, feeling the flesh of her arms and legs and the fine cloth of her dress and stocking, alien feelings to her after she became a spirit; Azura rubbed her face, trying to \"wake\" herself, and pondered the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm alive...\" She grasped for her pendant, but could not find it; inwardly, she relished that the tool of her demise was free from her person. Azura began to look around, trying to make note of her surroundings. \"Where...Where am I...?\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing Azura noticed was that the room she was in was a pale pink color with white moldings bridging the walls to the floor and ceiling; though the room wasn't lit with a lamp, the color was so naturally bright that it almost illuminated the room, allowing her to see. The second thing she noticed was that she was laying down in a bed, white and green, fluffy as ever, and she was tucked under the covers with such precision that it felt like she had done it herself. Removing herself from the bed, Azura stood up, relishing the feeling of her bare feet touching solid floor once again, and begun to think to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't remember a single thing after my death...\"</i> The songstress looked around the room and tried to make sense of where she was; in all throughout Nohr and Hoshido, she had never seen a house colored or arranged like this, even for the nobility who could afford it. <i>\"This place is unfamiliar to me, where am I? I'll have to look around and investigate.\"</i> Slowly, she walked towards the door to the room, careful that there were no traps, and gripped the doorknob tightly; the sensation of touching brass was another pleasurable feeling to her, where previously, all she could do was phase through matter, unable to interact with the world around her. Opening the door, all Azura could see was darkness, the halls unlit with seemingly no lamps she could illuminate the halls with; she began touching the walls, partially to feel out where she was going, partially to enjoy touching things again, and eventually made her way to a stairwell. Slowly, she began to step down the stairs, careful not to slip and fall, and eventually, she reached what she assumed was the ground floor. Going through the first doorway she found, Azura carefully snuck into the room and used the shadows to conceal herself as she looked around the room - what she saw caused her eyes to grow wide; in the darkness, the familiar hairstyle and shining crown of one of her greatest comrades, his figure sitting on a chair and staring out the small window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xander!\" Azura yelped with glee, forgetting she was supposed to be stealthy. The songstress giggled a bit and smiled wide as she came closer to the Nohrian royal. \"Oh, forgive me for my outburst, it's just...I never thought I would see you again, it's been so...\" Azura trailed off as she looked at Xander, sitting in the same position, showing no movement or sign of emotion; something was clearly wrong. \"Xander?\" Azura reached over and touched the royal's shoulder, and upon feeling him, quickly dashed in front of him to confirm her suspicions; the Xander she spoke to was nothing more than a felt doll, crafted with precision to look like the royal, face crafted in a permanent smile with shiny, beady onyx eyes. \"Wha- What is...?\" Azura trailed off as she heard a thunderous yawn come from outside the home, startling her as she never heard anything like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Morning already...?\" The voice sounded familiar to Azura; carefully, she approached the window and knelt over, concealing herself save the top of her head, and was shocked to see the outside world. Outside the window there was another, gigantic bedroom, crafted from stone and lit only by a pale, cloudy light through a single window; out of the corner of her eye, Azura could see a gigantic figure rising from the equally giant bed, wiping her eyes and rolling out of the bed before walking over to a separate bathroom, slowly and groggily. Azura looked at the giant's seemingly short stature, blond hair, and strands of purple clashing with her bright pink pajamas; bells went off in her head as she knew exactly who the giant was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Elise?!\"</i> Azura sunk below the window and sat with her legs to her chest, arms gripping her dress tightly as she tried to calm herself from the sight. <i>\"How did Elise get so huge? This has to be a trick, she couldn't have gotten so...\"</i> Suddenly, memories from the night before began to flood Azura's mind, memories of Camilla &amp; Elise, memories of the shooting star, memories of the dollhouse; as the memories came fast, Azura looked up at the life-sized doll of Xander, and the truth hit her like a arrow. \"This is the dollhouse.\" she spoke. Another thought entered her mind. \"I've become tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura placed her hand to her forehead, she had no idea how to cope with the situation she was presented with. Slowly she got up and walked over to a sofa at the end of the room; a doll of King Garon sat on the sofa, smiling in a manner the King Garon she knew never would, unsettling Azura a tad. She pushed over the doll to the floor and begun to lay down on the sofa, trying to make sense of the situation that she found herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Alright,\"</i> she thought, staring up at the dark ceiling, <i>\"Not only am I suddenly alive, but I've shrunk to the size of a doll along with it. What could've caused this to happen?\"</i> Azura thought about the shooting star again and remembered Elise's wish, it was clear to her that that was what bought her back to life. Further, she thought about the doll Elise made - the doll made in her image contained bits of Azura's hair and was placed in the same bed she found herself in, meaning that somehow, she managed to completely replace the doll, becoming a living person through its body; Azura reached her arm skyward and grasped her hand, feeling the sensation of flesh once again, just to confirm she wasn't made of felt. The songstress closed her eyes and giggled, finding humor in the situation she was in. <i>\"So I'm now a living doll, is that it? Midori always did tell me she wanted a doll of me when she was little, the gods above sure do have an interesting sense of humor.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked out the window from her sofa, looking into Elise's gigantic bedroom once more; she could hear the young princess humming a tune to herself from the bathroom as she brushed her teeth. At first, Azura thought of the peace in Nohr and the efforts to rebuild Hoshido Xander had instituted, thoughts that made her smile, but then, she began to have other thoughts, dreadful reminders of the world under the Bottomless Canyon, the world she knew as a home. She remembered the monstrous false Garon, the possessed corpse of Takumi, the invisible soldiers that attacked her son; all of these were signs that another war was going to come, one that could destroy both Nohr and Hoshido in the blink of an eye unless she did something. There were two thoughts she cursed; one was that her pendant was gone, which not only meant she would no longer die through her songs, but no longer have power in them either, the other was that she was 8 inches tall, and at her size, she would be unable to do anything meaningful to save both kingdoms, even the journey through the lake would take forever for her to swim through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"There's no choice,\"</i> Azura thought, <i>\"I'll have to find my way to Corrin, she's our only hope.\"</i> Azura tapped her foot against the wooden frame of the toy sofa, thinking just how she could get to Corrin in this state. <i>\"I know the layout of Castle Krakenberg well, but I'm not able to phase through walls anymore, nor go completely unnoticed. Death could await me yet again if I make one false step, or rather, if someone else makes a false step...\"</i> Then, Azura heard Elise close the door to her bathroom, she tilted her head to look out the window and could see her groggily stumbling over to the vanity, mumbling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another boring day...\" grumbled the young princess, pouting as she begun to tie up her hair. \"I'm happy for Xander's peacetime, but I miss the thrill of our adventures together as a family, out on the field, fighting monsters and saving lives. Most of all, I just miss Azura...\" Elise yawned as she pouted to herself, struggling to pay attention as she twisted her big roll of hair into a spiral; suddenly she got more heated as she looked into the mirror with awake determination. \"You know what Elise? Today, you're going to ask Corrin to help you look for Azura! You march right into her room, give her your best hug-a-snug attack, and say 'I wanna go find Big Sis'! Yeah, that's what you'll do!\" Elise finished tying up one spiral and pushed up on it, admiring its poofiness before moving on to the next batch of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura watched all this from the sofa and slowly stood up, thinking to herself as she did so. <i>\"If I let Elise know I'm here now, then she can take me to Corrin with little danger.\"</i> Azura thought over the implications about this; if Elise took her to Corrin, then she would be involving Elise in her journey, marking her for death with the invisible soldiers. Furthermore, if Elise were to accidently speak of the other world outside of the world itself, she would disappear like her mother had years before; she did not wish that fate upon the young princess. <i>\"I couldn't bear to do this to Elise, no matter how strong a fighter she has become. And yet, she is my only way through this castle safely, and if she still doesn't know what happened to me, it'll break her heart...\"</i> Azura mulled over the choices presented to her carefully, weighing the outcomes, before reaching a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"Well, here goes nothing...\"</i> Azura slowly moved to the window of the dollhouse and watched as Elise finished the second drill of her hair, working herself off the chair of her vanity and moving to the dresser. Carefully, Azura opened the window and took in a breath of air, preparing her voice. \"<i>You are the ocean's gray waves, destined to seek life beyond the shore just out of reach...</i>\" Elise stopped gathering her clothes, recognizing the tune resounding throughout her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That voice...!\" Elise looked around in a hurried manner, trying to look for the source of the song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yet the waters ever change, flowing like time, the path is yours to climb...</i>\" Elise came closer to the dollhouse, tracking down the music's source, and began looking out the window over the toy house, expecting the voice to be from across the pit of Castle Krakenberg. \"Elise, down here.\" In response, the young princess looked downward, spying the tiny figure of Azura looking up at her. Slowly, Elise knelt down, eyes wide with shock, lip quivering, and spoke slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Sis Azura,\" she spoke in disbelief, \"Is that you...?\" Azura took a deep breath, confirming she was a living thing to the young princess, not a toy, and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Elise.\" Azura eloquently spoke, \"I'm home.\" Elise looked on in shock as Azura began to climb out the window and stood on the desk, facing her far larger sister with a calm expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so...You're so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny?\" Azura asked, finishing Elise's sentence for her. \"Yes, I suppose I am, aren't I? It's come as a shock to me as we-\" Azura was cut off by Elise quickly snatching her up and bringing her to her cheek, slightly rubbing her body against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>CUTE!</b></i>\" The sharp contrast in Elise's moods put off Azura, and the songstress completely lost whatever calm composure she had, literally shaken up by her sudden shift in position. Wriggling between Elise's hands, Azura tried to compose herself once more and get comfy; Elise noticed this and opened her hands, palms up for Azura to sit on, and smiled down at her older sister. \"I can't believe it! You've come back to us Azura! And you're so <i>adorable</i> to boot! Oh man! I should run off and go tell Kaze right now, he'll be so happy to see-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No!</i>\" Azura shouted, stopping Elise in her tracks. Azura inwardly cursed her reaction, her intent was to continue hiding in this state, she was certain that Kaze would be upset with her having disappeared &amp; died without a word, and equally shocked to see her like this; quickly, Azura thought up a way to stretch the truth and tried to get Elise to run with it. \"I mean, at this size, of course Kaze will be shocked to see me, we don't want to scare him, would we? Elise, we should just take things slow for now and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Azura! All husbands would be overjoyed to see their wives again! Even if you are super tiny!\" Azura cursed her luck again. \"Oh, but maybe I should take you to see Corrin first, she was so heartbroken after you left!\" Azura begun to panic - Elise's overzealousness could easily cause an uproar in the castle of her return, especially if Corrin was around someone, which was very frequent in her frequent trips outside the castle to inspire the troops and act as a Nohrian mediator; if she was going to get some one-on-one time with Corrin, Azura had to nip this in the bud, quickly. \"Oh, did I wake up too late again? Corrin might already be done with breakfast and on her daily walk through town...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Elise, that could be true, so if you could just sit down a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I really need to get a clock for this room. Oh well, guess we can just see Kaze for now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elise, that's not a good idea, if you would just list-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but he could be busy running errands like he usually is. Maybe if we just go see Cami-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Elise. Listen to me.</b>\" Azura's voice was low, but stern, commanding attention from the Elise as she sat upon the young princess' palms. Azura took a deep breath and begun to explain herself. \"I was dead, Elise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was dead, I gave my life up to save you all in our last battle. Nobody else knew aside from the rest of your family. If you were to show me off here, it would cause a panic, and I can't afford-\" Azura was again interrupted by Elise's actions; this time, she was clasped tight between Elise's hands again and being shook up and down in agitation by the young princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You big dummy!</i> How could you leave us like that, after all we've done for you?! Nobody asked you to die for us!\" Azura felt like she was going to hurl any moment, but her shaking suddenly stopped, and she begun to hear sniffles from Elise; looking up, Azura could see the princess' face covered in tears. \"H-How could you leave me like that? We were supposed to be a real family again...!\" Elise took one of her hands away from her grip on Azura and begun wiping her face with it, sobbing while doing so. Seeing this, Azura managed to free herself from Elise's single hand, no longer focused on holding the little songstress, and she carefully walked up the span of Elise's arm, coming up to her shoulder. The tiny woman begun stroking Elise's cheek and spoke to her soothingly, causing her to open her tear-sealed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dry your tears Elise,\" she spoke softly, \"There is no need to cry. It was specifically your wish that brought me back from death, our bonds as a family that let me live. Your doll has now become my body, it is the symbol of the bonds that we share together, and I swear to you, so long as I live, I'm not going anywhere anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Promise?\" Elise said through chokes of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise.\" Azura spoke with a smile, \"No more secrets between us. We can become a family once more.\" Elise smiled and dragged Azura closer into her face, sitting down on her bed and hugging Azura for a short while as the little songstress stroked her face and sung to her in a soothing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wait,\" Elise asked as she tugged her boot up her leg, trying to reach around her large-rimmed dress, \"It was that big dumb pendant that killed you in the first place?\" Azura sat adjacent on top of the dresser, her legs hanging over the dresser's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct.\" Azura responded, clutching her chest where the pendant used to be. \"It was a gift from my mother, a remnant of a place we used to go to together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what, a vacation spot? Did you find it in a cursed stall run by a gypsy?\" Azura closed her eyes and remembered the tale of Anankos, the world under the Bottomless Canyon which used to be her home, the curse that prevented her from speaking of it outside of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I can't say, for now at least. It's a secret I must carry, but once we find Corrin, I'll be happy to explain it to both you and her.\" Elise puffed her cheeks and pumped her fist skyward, as she commonly did when heated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad that stupid piece of junk is gone! No more family break-ups, that's what I say!\" Azura shook her head for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elise, you don't seem to understand,\" Azura retorted, \"I need that pendant for my songs to have power, especially now more than ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-uh, I said no more family break-ups, okay?!\" Elise, now fully dressed, stood up from her chair and flexed her arm, grasping her bicep muscle, and gave Azura a strong, determined look. \"This time, you're gonna let us save you from whatever it is you gotta fight! I've been getting stronger too you know - I can now do <i>fifteen</i> push-ups in a row!\" Azura looked unimpressed at first, but soon her expression broke into a smile and she giggled at her larger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's right,\"</i> Azura thought, <i>\"Corrin's Yato holds considerable power now, and she's been hardened through the trials we've faced. Even then, our siblings have grown considerably as well, I'm sure they would be able to quell the madness that threatens our world.\"</i> Azura stood up, ready to get on the move once more. \"Alright Elise, I'll trust you on this. Please, could you carry me around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Elise scooped up Azura in her palm, but before the songstress could relax, she felt herself being tilted downward and fell off Elise's palm into the open collar of her dress, pressed close against her chest. Azura held onto the hem of the collar and looked up at her sister, face a little reddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elise! Don't you think this is a little...close?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Azura,\" Elise giggled, \"But I don't actually have any pockets on this dress! Safest I can manage while also keeping you hidden, just make sure not to wiggle too much, and you should be fine.\" Elise begun walking over to her door in an upbeat manner. \"So, where to first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take me to see Corrin, Elise,\" Azura responded, \"I have to see her as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want to see Kaze first?\" Elise asked, \"I'm sure your kids must really miss you. You can't hide from them forever, and I'm sure they won't hate you for being dead all this time.\" Azura mulled the thought over in her head; Elise was right, she couldn't keep herself hidden from her family, and both Kaze and her children were strong warriors who helped them through their war on Garon, they would be extremely instrumental in their journey to the other world, as would all the other allies she had fought with, shared meals and stories with. \"It's your call Azura, I'm not gonna push you or anything, just gonna walk you around.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Azura's eyes shot open at the sight before her. She recognized the ground she was on. The material. She looked up and her fears were confirmed. Castle Krakenburg!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any other scenario, she would be glad to see the home of her family. In this case however, she saw it in a totally new perspective. The castle still outsized her but not to the same extent that it had before. The ground she had been laying on was the entrance bridge to the castle, of which she took up the entire length!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook in fear looking around in confusion. Fortunately, it didn't appear anyone was around. She placed her hand over her face to control her breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. Calm down,\" she told herself. \"Think, think.\" How do I fix this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't be seen like this. She had to get away. She looked up the pit. Could she climb it? Not like she had much choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she climbed as silently as possible. It was hard work even at her size. She had been dead for so long that she was unused to her muscles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finally reached the top, she looked around for any people. Fortunately, it was past midnight and no one was there to witness the Titaness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed over and stopped to catch her breath. Once she found it, she moved as silently as possible through the streets towards the gates. This would normally be very hard for someone of her size, yet due to her years of dancing, she was soft on her toes. Of course the added height did create a slight tremor even at her slowest pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of the city, she finally took off running at full speed as far from the city as she could. at her height she could move unimaginably fast. Of course since she was no longer tiptoeing, she shook the ground every time her foot impacted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stopped at a lake, similar to the one where Corrin had followed her into the other realm. She laid down to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do? I can't show myself like this to my friends?\" She then rethought that. \"Can't I? After all, who else would be willing to help? Then again, I don't fully see how they could.\" She then remembered Elise's wish to bring her back. Though she doubted this was what the young princess had intended, whatever she had done appeared to have worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should go back. No that would cause too great a ruckus. Maybe I should find someone to find my family and bring them to me? Oh but who? Oh Kaze. If only you could see me now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to sleep it over, unaware that she in fact had not gone unnoticed. Someone had seen her leave the city and had followed her discreetly, and was now staring at a sleeping friend, back from the dead, magnified beyond proportion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How I am going to explain this to Kaze,\" Corrin muttered to herself.\" What do I do? Should I wake her up now? I know it's been a while but still.\" Corrin took note of the size difference between them. Waking the giantess dancer from her sleep might be risky. What if she rolled over on top of her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just let her sleep until morning, when she's thinking more clearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?</span></div></div>",

She was quite good at moving quietly due to years of experience and possibly her absence of shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped at that moment and came to a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I wear shoes? And while we're there, why doesn't Azura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStoring that puzzle for later, she continued her approach until she found herself within reaching distance of Azura's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just had to stop now and stare. She had thought nothing could awe her after the war, but seeing her friend like this was... well, it was almost as weird as her absence of shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Corrin reached out and touched Azura's exposed back. She pulled back when she noticed the giant body react, giving something like a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Azura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the dancer began turning on her side. Corrin ran and leaped out of the way but her cape got caught underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off! Damn it! Why do I even wear this? It doesn't do anything for me. It makes no sense. Like not wearing shoes! Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Corrin had that thought, she felt Azura's massive hands close around her waist and pull her close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azura! Hey Azura! Let go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet Kaze. Just another few hours,\" she mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azura! It's me Corrin. Wake your butt up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Really?\" She giggled in her sleep. \"Sure honey. If you insist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Lost in thoughts all- mph!\" Corrin found herself pressed up against Azura's massive lips, apparently mistaken for Azura's husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What?\" Corrin was pulled away from the lips and found herself staring into Azura's shocked eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin?

I just had it on my mind. I mean, I don't really know what else to say. It's just...\" She paused and took a deep breath. \"It's good to see you Azura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiled. \"Likewise.

Putting her hand on her hand, and staring at her fiercely. \"Everyone will be overjoyed to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Azura sounded uncertain. \"Are you sure they'll be ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they might be shocked, but you're their family. They'll adapt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could do that or...\" Azura thought for a minute. \"There is somewhere we could go. Somewhere that might have a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin nodded. She knew where Azura meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we aren't gonna decide tonight. I say we sleep and decide in the morning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura smiled. \"In that case, you can lay here.\" She leaned onto her back placed Corrin on her chest. \"After all that time apart, no way I'm going to let you go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin grinned and laid her head down on Azura's chest, her giant hand coering her and keeping her warm, her chest lulling her to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura laid awake for a bit longer, contemplating the future. What would she do? Did she dare return home to see her family, or go with Corrin in search of a solution?</span></div></div>",

Looking up, she saw her larger than life friend's face covered entirely by her blue hair in disarray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin grinned and slowly untangled herself from the giant's arms. Or rather she tried to, unsuccessfully. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't break free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Azura. A little help here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess giggled. \"Not yet Kaze. Five more minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azura! Wake your ass up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty naughty.

Not just the inconvenience of it, but how would the city react?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin nodded, saddened the reunion would have to wait , but understanding Azura's reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's off to you know where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura nodded and stood up. Corrin's eyes widened at the sudden size difference. Azura noticed her shock and inquired about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just, up until now I haven't seen you at full height. It's just a bit overwhelming you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura gave a disturbing smile at that and actually walked closer to the miniature princess, putting her feet on either side. Corrin had to til her head back to look at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you're right  This is Different. From this height you look  like a little doll.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands on her knees and leaned over her tiny companion. \"Would you like that Corrin? Would you like to be my doll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin held up her hands and walked back a few paces from the grinning colossus. She trusted Azura, but those jokes which might have been funny once before took on a whole new meaning at that size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come on Azura. You're so eager to shrink back to normal, you shouldn't get into the dominatrix role.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura frowned. \"Dominatrix? What in Nohr does that mean? I'm just messing with you my little dragon. It's just in case I can't find a cure.\" She winked. \"I'll need someone to snuggle with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin's face flushed. \"Ok first rule. Don't call me little dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why not? It fits you so well. Seiing how small you are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not small! I'm just... little boned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura grinned again. \"And little bodied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin sighed. It seemed the power had gone to Azura's head. The new her was definitely a lot more mischievous than the old one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then. I have to ask. How did you follow me before. I doubt a normal sized human could keep up with me and I don't see a horse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to turn into a dragon to keep up with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose you can ride on my shoulder. We have a long way to go to the ravine. But it should take less time at my height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin nodded and took another step back as Azura kneeled down with her palm flat. Corrin took a deep breath and got on. She almost lost her balance as Azura lifted the palm to her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All set?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin tied a strand of the long blue hair around her arm to keep herself steady and looked to the massive face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready. Oh. And one more thing. When this is all over, you stay, all right? I don't want to have you disappearing all over again. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, little dragon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Azura began walking east, laughing at Corrin's yells of anger and the two set off, together again,</span></div></div>",

The pair waving her off before Azura turned her attention over toward Kamui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my love.\" the two sharing a kiss, afterwards Kamui apologizing again if she interrupted her talk with Flora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it was a simple morning chat between the two of us. I asked her to look in on Kana and Shigure who are helping with the cleaning of the mess hall. Flora agreed and that's when you showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see.\" Kamui quickly stated with a nod, \"I'm sure they're fine.\" The princess added with a slight chuckle Azura soon joining in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case before we do is there anything you want to do first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess asked her beautiful wife.</span></div></div>",

She looked around taking in a deep breath before turning around to look at her wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it you wanted to show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know my singing has many unique powers. But through my experimentation, I have found another power which is unlike anything I've witnessed before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamui's expression turned to one of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you not to sing anymore! Did you forget what happens to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, my love, I know better than anyone. But it's necessary to keep you and the rest of my friends alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the war's over. Why do you need it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For anything. You never know. But I assure you. I am not doing it frequently. But once I learned of this newest trick, I had to show you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamui sighed. \"Well, you put yourself at all this risk. I might as well give you this much. Now why are we here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura flashed a malicious grin.  \"Oh this is for your safety, where no one can accidentally walk through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamui blanched. \"Safety!? What exactly do you plan to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura kept smiling. \"You'll see soon enough. Now if you can just stand here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led her love to  the center of the room and placed a circle of sticks around her. Kamui was beyond confused at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Azura stood back and held her fingers together like a window looking through it at Kamui. \"There. I should be able to tell where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell where I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well depending on the dosage here. I've tested this on many different animals and they all had a different scale afterwards. Depending on your scale after this, I need to be able to know where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kamui was starting to get alarmed. \"What are you talking about? Do the kids know about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kids are away sweetie. Don't worry. They don't know anything. No one else does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one?\" Kamui could not hide the worry in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura walked forward and cupped her lover's face in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kamui, Kamui, my dear. Don't you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamui looked her in the eyes. \"Of course. I just wish I knew what I was getting into.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see soon enough. Just stay in the circle and you'll be fine.\" Azura walked back, cleared her throat and began to sing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Kamui's head began to throb. She felt dizzy and started to sway. However, she remained in the center true to Azura's word, as her wife danced and sang words that she couldn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was just her, but she could make out her wife's footsteps more and more. The noise created from her dancing started getting louder and louder like she was stomping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally though, nothing was changing on Azura's end. The song mistress continued dancing and singing. All the time with her eyes on Kamui. Her excitement growing as the change occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamui suddenly noticed something off about the dancer. Was it just her or was she growing ever so slightly upward? She couldn't tell because her head was ringing  from the singing and the increasingly intense noise from her wife's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura's eyes widened in excitement even as she continued dancing and singing. She had tried this before on animals before, and it was always a shocker. But from what she saw, it was having a far greater effect than on any of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt about it now. Azura was growing, or rather Kamui was getting smaller. She looked up in shock at her ever increasing titaness of a wife. Her dancing now earthquakes and her singing now a deafening bellow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Azura couldn't go on. She collapsed down on her bed, panting from all the exertion. She knew she had probably done some serious damage to her body with that song. But the results were worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious to see what those results were, she sat up in bed, and looked down at the circle of sticks, her legs dangling over the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped in shock, she couldn't see her! She must have gone overboard this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled a lens from the bedside table and slowly got down on her hands and knees on the ground. She slowly inched her way over to the circle and peered down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura was worried. She had meant for a mere 30 mm at least! This was way beyond that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my little lover,\" Azura muttered looking through the lens at Kamui, \"how small are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Azura started to muse to herself, \"Wh- what do I <i>do</i>? there's no telling what is happening down there, and if anyone else comes this way...\" she couldn't bear to finish the thought. \"P-please try to stay put down there, Kamui. I'll figure something out I swear!\", attempting to reassure the tiny girl, though it was impossible to tell if it was any use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, in the nano-world below the singer's colossal feet, Kamui was suffering from a major anxiety attack, as the world around her had turned into a huge blur of objects and beings that seemingly reached to heights she had previously thought impossible. Matters only got worse as Azura's feet began to have huge, sudden spasms that most likely was an unnoticable twitch to those of ordinary stature. For the dragon, however, this resulted in an enormous cascade of debris to fall from the dancer's toes, most likely made up of dust, pebbles and other, organic materials that Azura had picked up as she walked about barefooted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a cacophanous voice strikes at Kamui's tiny ears. As the tiny girl looks up, she can see Azura's mouth <i>move</i>, but could not make out what she was saying, hearing only a booming bass-like sound leave the dancer's mouth, forcing her to cover her ears. Whilst up in the realm of humanity, Azura was only trying to tell the little one to stay put while she leaves to find someone that may be able to help. With that, the singer gets up to leave, most likely a mage or healer of some type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giga woman had barely given a thought to the dust dragon beneath her feet. Whilst she had fully expected the singer's feet to be powerful, she didn't expect them to move past so quickly, though thankfully she had braced herself just in time to not get thrown into the air, and stay in the circle laid out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the room, at least 15 minutes pass before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I will be doing so, but that does not mean you cannot still use her Japanese name!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors start to return, prompting the tiny Corrin to jump to her feet in preparation for what could come. It only seemed to be a single pair of feet once again. \"Perhaps she just left to replenish herself and get her energy back! Yeah...\", Corrin said, not entirely convinced of her own reasoning. To her, the tremors seemed... different. They sounded a little heavier and faster, and seemed more distinct than the pounding of Azura's bare feet were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal door is suddenly swung wide open, directly colliding with the dresser next to it, and creating a whirlwind to sweep across the room, forcing the tiny girl to brace herself. The footfall-based tremors got worse and worse, starting to knock Corrin about, until the last footfall lands directly behind her, missing by barely a couple of inches, and sending the little dragon flying upwards at an astonishing rate! Using the height to her advantage, Corrin tried to discern who the perpetrator was, but could only see a black, rising expanse, that seemingly went up for miles! It's only when the object backed up into a more revealing position, that the top of the expanse becomes even remotely visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToes. All five could now be made out in clear terrifying detail, each ridge of the toes hundreds of metres apart, the underside of the nails in full view, each with very little signs of dirt accumulating beneath them, meaning this person has cleaned themselves at least somewhat recently. Looking further up, Corrin could just about make out the general shape and length of the legs, along with a vague look at the clothing this person wore. The long, dark blue cloth piece hanging from the seemingly female figure's waist rings a bell in Corrin's head. This huge, monstrous foot belonged to Hana, one of Sakura's (Corrin's younger sister by blood) retainers and a fledgling samurai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin\u2019s fall was cut short as Hana\u2019s foot had edged forward just enough for her footwear to end up directly beneath you. Upon landing on top of the samurai\u2019s black sandals, the little dragon met with a sight that really brought everything into prospective. She had seen Hana\u2019s toes before, both from before and after Corrin\u2019s shrinkage. But this was different. The biggest toe appeared to be at <i>least</i> hundreds of times larger than she was, and the moments where Hana subconsciously flexes them were terrifying beyond belief as they seemingly flew up for miles, only to crash back down, causing shockwaves strong enough to make the tiny girl wince in fear. There were plenty of other horrors to speak of, though Corrin made sure to at least try to block out the appearance of underneath the samurai\u2019s sweating feet, complete with dead skin and crushed items, both alive and dead.  The little dragon began to feel like she was in a different realm altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, way above Hana had at least come into the room for a reason. \u201cCorrin? I thought she was in here for sure\u2026 We were going to spar soon, too!\u201d Hana says to herself, unaware that the one she was looking for was right beneath her nose; or feet, in this case. Would Hana decide to stay and wait to see if Corrin comes back, or will she leave to continue searching, tiny half-dragon in tow?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A light tap for Hana, however, was absolutely cataclysmic for the microscopic dragon on her footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Corrin, it was as if the entire planet was violently shaking. The black earth beneath her rose up at a nearly incomprehensible speed, sending her tumbling toward the flesh mountains that were the young samurai's toes. As quickly as the sandal had been raised, it descended back to the floor. Before Corrin could even begin to get her bearings, the ground beneath her disappeared and she found herself being forced back down. The immense ceiling formed by Hana's middle toe slammed her back into the sole of the sandal. The dragon princess was so small that she was in no danger of being crushed by the digit that was bullying her, but \"harrowing\" was nonetheless too a mild a word to describe the experience. And then the foot rose back up again. Hana's foot tapped several times, slamming the poor little dragon princess between entire worlds of footwear and toe like a minuscule rag doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Hana finally stopped tapping her foot, \"I bet she's already at the sparing grounds waiting for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin rolled onto her back, panting and exhausted. Her vision was blurred, and the dim light under the canopy of the samurai's toes wasn't clearing it any faster. <br>\r\nShe had no idea how she'd managed to get through that unharmed. Whether it was her dragon blood, an effect of Azura's song, just the sheer amount of small that she was, or some combination thereof, nothing appeared to be broken and she wasn't in any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the giantess above her didn't stay still for more than a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope she hasn't been waiting for me long,\" Hana fretted as she dashed out of the room towards the sparring grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being thrown skyward, this time the force of the rising foot tossed Corrin backwards towards the sweaty hell she had glimpsed beneath Hana's sole. She barely had a moment to feel the terror flowing through her before the monster that was Hana's foot swallowed her completely. It was as if the universe itself had collapsed on her, entombing her beneath an infinite expanse of sweaty foot flesh. The force of the mighty retainer's first step, the collision of a sandal that stretched further than Corrin's eyes could see and the ball of a foot that could rival the scale of Naga herself, completely obliterated the senses of her victim. The simple tapping of the colossal foot had been a scarring experience, but being trampled by a sprinting woman millions of times her size was on a whole other level. Corrin passed out almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHana reached the sparring grounds only to find it empty. It was always deserted around this time, which is why they had chosen it today. The samurai stamped her foot in disappointment, once again pulverizing her unconscious passenger. \"Oh well,\" she sighed, \"I'm already here. I guess I'll just get started on a practice dummy and hope Corrin joins me later.\" She reached for a practice sword on a rack nearby, totally oblivious to the fact that Corrin would be deeply involved in her \"solo\" sparring.</span></div></div>",

The dummy rattled noisily on its support even as Hana returned her sword to its place on the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew!\" she sighed, wiping gobs of sweat from her brow as she walked over to a bench at the far end of the room. She was disappointed that Corrin had never joined her, but she couldn't help the sense of pride that came with a good training session. Now she deserved a rest. She plopped down on the bench and kicked back, relieving some of the pressure on the prisoner beneath her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin had only just come to, the horror that her situation hadn't been a nightmare was setting in, and things had somehow gotten worse. The princess hadn't had time to notice the scent of her unwitting captors feet before, but now, after her intense workout, the smell of Hana's massive feet overwhelmed her senses. She was practically floating in a sea of warm foot sweat that had already soaked her from the hair on her head to the sole's of her own bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin's only thoughts in this moment were to somehow make her way to freedom. She had no way of knowing that the nearest exit from under her friend's gargantuan soles was miles away, but her survival instinct compelled her. She felt too weak to stand, and she knew the shock waves created by Hana's movements would inevitably knock her to the ground anyway, so she crawled desperately through the darkness in the direction she hoped would be the quickest route to freedom. Her best chance to escape would be while Hana wasn't moving. The dragon princess scrambled pathetically through the knee-high sea of perspiration. Even on all fours, the tremors of Hana's toes colliding idly with her sandal knocked Corrin face first into the sweat, forcing her to hold her breath in the fragrant liquid between labored breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humiliation of the experience paled in comparison to her growing fear. If she lived through this, she would probably smell like Hana's feet forever, but she would gladly accept that eventuality if it could mean being free of the sweltering pitch black swamp that threatened to become her permanent home, or worse: her grave. Minutes passed with no sign of light, and she began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hana!\" she called out, wasting air that she knew was precious in hope of any kind of aid. She crawled a few more feet, but of course the response she was hoping for never came. \"HANA!\" she screamed. \"PLEASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few yards. \"HELP ME!\" Nothing. The darkness' complete indifference to her struggle was maddening, and Corrin's terror was soon accompanied by frustration and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DOWN HERE!\" She continued to splash through the unending mire of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M UNDER YOUR FOOT, HANA!\" Splash splash splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE!\" Splash splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU HAVE TO FIND ME!\" splash. \"SAVE ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her frenzy, Corrin quickened her pace, but tripped, her face dipping violently into liquid beneath her for a moment. She coughed and spluttered, her pace slowing down again. Tears begin to well in her eyes, though they were impossible to distinguish from the sweat that dominated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" she sobbed, \"I don't want to die down here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplash. Splash. Splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't belong down here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplash. Splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT A BUG!\" she finally screamed. And then she froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she wasn't a bug. She wasn't <i>even</i> a bug. She was so much smaller than that. She'd seen how thoroughly dwarfed she was by the digits of Hana's foot. Corrin barely qualified as dust by comparison. She practically deserved to be forgotten under Hana's sole and washed away with a drop of sweat, never to be seen or heard from again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin sat back on her knees, defeated. Tears melded seamlessly with the layer of foreign sweat already covering her face. She sobbed quietly for a moment. Then shook her head. She couldn't be thinking like this. She wasn't dead yet. Even if things were hopeless, they could always be worse. She could have been stuck inside Felicia's thigh-high stocking, or trapped deep inside Setsuna's knee-high boot. The sweat-coated princess shuddered at the thought. Who even knew if the flighty archer ever remembered to take those things off? She was on a sandal. By definition there had to be a way off. So she had to try. She was dehydrated, no doubt. That certainly couldn't be helping her mental state. She hadn't been paying attention to how thirsty she actually was. And then she realized she was surrounded by water. She had to survive. So she did the unthinkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent down, her nose a few inches above the lake that surrounded her. She inhaled deeply, but there was no discernible difference between the scent of the bodily fluid and the ubiquitous aroma of feet that seemed to permeate her entire universe. She lowered her lips to the water and began to drink. She expected to feel complete revulsion as the liquid passed over her tongue, but the mouthful of sweat simply tasted like warm water with a vague hint of salt. It was almost delicious given how thoroughly parched she was. She gulped it down greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat back on her feet. Taking in the full weight of how humiliating what she had done really was. She had just willingly drunk several mouthfuls of her own friend's foot sweat, and even somewhat enjoyed the flavor. If she lived through this, she could never speak a word of it to Hana, no matter how inexplicable the fact that Corrin would probably be foot-scented for the rest of her days became. She would confide in Azura, of course, although given her wife's sense of humor, she would probably never live this down. Her wife would probably teasingly ask for foot rubs or, given her penchant for lakes, jokingly offer to let Corrin go for a swim under <i>her</i> feet. Maybe she'd have to, Corrin thought morosely. She still had no idea if Azura could reverse the song's effect on her. But that would still be preferable to this. Even if she had to live out the rest of her days swimming between her wife's toes, she'd give anything to be noticed. To be known. Azura would go to the ends of the earth to make her feet the perfect home for Corrin, and she'd certainly never forget she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs twisted as her thinking had become, it was comforting. And comfort always brought Camilla to mind. Corrin's elder sister was occasionally extreme in her methods, and her doting could become tedious, but there was nobody in the world she felt like she could trust as much as Camilla. No matter what happened, Camilla was always there for her. Corrin could always turn to the Nohrian princess for guidance, support, love, or just unconditionally having her back. Even in the worst of times, Camilla would let her rest her head on her lap and stroke her hair until it seemed like all of her problems went away. She wondered what that would be like at her current size. Laying on her truly big sister's nearly infinite thigh, staring up at her beautiful face as if it were the sky. The thought brought her peace. Even at this size, Camilla could be no danger to her at all. She blushed as an image entered her mind, of Camilla gently plucking Corrin's dust mite-like body from her lap, and lowering her into her cleavage. By all accounts her sister's breasts should be terrifying at her size, if not already so at normal size. But even though they would be practically flesh planets by comparison, Corrin just couldn't picture them bringing any harm unto her. She pictured the armored boots that her sister wore. Even then, there was no contest between that and any of the other boots she could be trapped in. Camilla's hygiene was immaculate. It probably smelled great inside her sister's boot, she probably didn't sweat at all, and her feet must be so soft that being stepped on would feel like a hug from a pretty cloud. As implausible as those assumptions may have been, they brought Corrin further comfort. No matter what happened, she'd get out of this, and her wife and big sister would take care of her, even if she never returned to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts might have been indecent, even unhealthy, given the crush she'd always suppressed on her stunningly attractive big sister. But being lost or squashed under the sweaty feet of an unwitting giantess was far more unhealthy, so she quite literally bigger concerns at the moment than potentially incestuous thoughts. She'd already married her cousin anyway. Why stop now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as Corrin had finished steeling herself, in her own unorthodox way, and resolved to press onward, Hana stirred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweaty samurai opened her brown eyes and slowly sat up, stretching both arms above her head with a slight moan. The motion caused her sandal to tilt forward, and far below her the microscopic dragon princess was suddenly caught in a raging river of sweat flowing towards the toe of the footwear. Corrin had no idea what was happening as she was submerged beneath a torrent of foot juice, tumbling head over heals in the rapid current. Finally the current slowed enough for her to force her head above the water and, after gulping down more of Hana's sweat, filled her lungs with air. As the tide of flowing sweat lost its momentum, Corrin spilled out onto the soggy black surface of the kingdom that was Hana's sandal. She was momentarily blinded by light filtering down from above, and realized she was back under the samurai's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin was relieved, but Hana wasn't settled yet. With a flick of her ankle, the swordswoman kicked her feet up onto her heels. Corrin was sent skyward, but was blinded by the transition from only partial light, leaving her with no idea what her trajectory was. She landed with a soft thud, face pressed into a soft sweaty surface that was somehow even more fragrant than the cavern she had just escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHana looked down at her toes in admiration; working up a sweat always filled her with pride. She began to wiggle them, unbeknownst to the plight of her shrunken friend trapped between them.</span></div></div>",

Well all I need is if you or Lady Azura would be willing to have the incantation tested out on yourself. I promise it's nothing deadly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia quickly pointed out when she spotted the look of question and concern on the princess and songstress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Kamui exchanging another quick glance with her wife before agreeing to help out the young mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you for your celestial assistance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia thanking the armored royal with a soft hug, Kamui simply smiling as she gave the girl a soft pat on the head.

It was odd yet pleasant possibly because of the slow steady speed of her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura already having to crane her head just a tad bit as her spouse was already half a foot taller then normal, she almost felt the need to point out such a change in height to Opehlia yet the blonde girl seem to be in total control of her spell so the blue-haired woman held her tongue in check as she continued to watch her love grow higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamui meanwhile was thankful that her armor was holding up well even as she grew taller. She was already taller then any member of her family and the princess was admittedly beginning to worry that things were going a little too far until she capped around twelve or so feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Ophelia had finished without any error so Kamui simply stood still taking in her new height and that proportionally her body had grown to better match her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess that means I'm technically \"bigger\" then Camilla now, she thought amusingly trying to fight off the blush on her cheeks. Afterwards she shifted her view over to Azura who stood in awe at her giant wife Ophelia meanwhile content with the outcome as she yelled her thanks to the bigger princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I'm glad everything worked out, I think.\" Kamui mentioned with a slight chuckle as flashed something of a smile, although she still felt a bead of sweat run down the side of her bigger yet still beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes I couldn't ask for a more astounding outcome. Thank you so much for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Ophelia seem to leave an important detail that Azura felt she should mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how exactly does Kamui return to her standard size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde was caught off guard for a moment until she pointed out that the incantation's effect lasts a few hours but she should be fine afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few hours?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamui and Azura yelled out simultaneously. All of a sudden the fun aspect of being much taller was now becoming a bit more troubling. Neither were sure if Kamui could go on a few hours at her new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey cared for Ophelia they really did but as they all began to return home both Kamui and Azura were starting to wonder if instead it would have been a better idea to simply find and drag Soleil out of the Hot Springs...</span></div></div>",

There was a single woman in the group and she was wearing a turquoise skirt, had silver hair, and was wearing a huge bracelet on her left arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming with me to get more supplies guys\" Corrin sounded Exhausted as he addressed the four strangers. he had been working for eight hours straight without stopping. the four shook their heads<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"a problem shared is a problem halved\" the blond one said with a refined accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its the minimum of my services Corrin\" The radiant look-alike told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You helped me before, so now its my turn.\" The spiky haired one said in a low almost emo tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"after hearing your current situation i had to help.\" The silver-haired girl added in with a voice devoid of emotion much like Corrin's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin smiled and looked up at Selkie who was wide eyed and confused. \"There's the victim, My wife Selkie\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelkie waved nervously, and everyone smiled then waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa who're these people?\" Kana asked. \"are they your friends?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin pet her hair \"you could say that... these people are here to help me.\" Corrin looked back at them before focusing on Kana again. \"You guys should introduce yourselves already\" he said with a smirk, but they couldn't see that though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ike, although you might have guessed that already\" The radiant hero introduced himself before crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Cloud\" The spiky haired one said before affixing his gaze on the blond haired one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go by Shulk ma'am\" the blonde haired one bowed before Selkie prompting an eye roll from Corrin and Selkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may call me Ciel\" The silver haired one said solemnly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get moving before it gets too dark out Corrin\" Cloud stated before sauntering off towards the nearest town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we won't be much longer Selkie\" Ciel put before following Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin, remember what i said: this isn't permanent i've seen things like this before.\" Ike reassured him before starting on the road behind Cloud and Ciel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If i see anything bad i will not hesitate to tell you\" Shulk gave Corrin a determined look before giving Selkie a fist pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be going now selkie but we're going to bring you something to eat before we work any further alright?\" Corrin gave his wife a weak smile before catching up to his travel companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's too nice for his own good...\" Selkie worried. \"all this for me?\" She looked down and sighed, Awaiting his return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/music1.png\" alt=\"*Music1*\" title=\"Music1\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">-\u007f<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Conquest(Ablaze)</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are!\" Shulk called out to Selkie waving his hand. \"we got you something to eat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelkie perked up upon hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin,Cloud and Ike were all each carrying two giant barrels filled with <span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><b>STUFF!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRGH!\" Cl\u007foud and Ike set their barrels down with an audible Thud. Corrin set down his barrels and collapsed on the ground from exhaustion.

He must really love you.\" Cloud said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us and the others finish the renovations\" Ciel told Selkie \"Please make sure he gets the rest he deserves\" she requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoy your meal!\" Shulk said before heading into the portal to the Velvet room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be heading back now too. Call me if you need anything\" Cloud walked into the portal after Shulk with Ike and Ciel following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>dummy! you didn't have to do all of this for me</i>. Selkie teared up while hugging the tired corrin to her face, she parted his hair and gave him a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up a barrel that even at her size was pretty heavy! <i>How did they carry this?</i> selkie thought to herself before trying its contents. her verdict: Amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter scarfing down the last barrel Selkie checked up on Corrin who was beginning to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Corrin sat up groggily <b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">!</font></b> \"I fell asleep?! Dammit i need to-\" He was silenced by a giant finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you're not going anywhere buster!\" Selkie asserted herself and kept corrin in place much to his shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selkie i need-\" he started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">You need rest!</font>\" Selkie wasn't having any of it \"If you love me then you'll go back to sleep! you're exhausted, I can't stand to see you like this!\" Selkie's voice broke and she didn't recognize it until corrin looked guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right... I've been focusing so hard on remodeling and trying to keep you happy that i didn't even consider how you must've felt seeing me like that... I'm...so sorry!\" in a surprising turn of events Corrin ended up crying breaking his stoic demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's okay. Don't cry\" Selkie soothed him \u007fadn his crying ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, i must be a horrible husband\" Corrin wiped his and met his wife's 'are you serious' look. \"I just cant find the words can i?\" Corrin gave a weak chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do me a favor and shut up! That's not the Corrin i fell in love with! I like the struggled emotions, I like the stoic tone, And most importantly I love you just the way you are!\" She cuddled Corrin to her chest and gently laid on her back. \"lets get some sleep, we'll talk more in the morning\" and with that Selkie fell asleep.

Another Showed her wearing an outfit reminiscent of the hero king fighting against Someone with long green hair holding a staff. Another fleeting image showcased Kaden taking Shulk on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here in the Outrealm arena heroes from all over duke it out for major bucks, or charity... where's the fun in that?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been but a mere 4 months since Grima was stopped, the Dark Dragon who threatened to destroy the world had been sealed for another 1,000 years by Lucina's father, Chrom, and his best friend, Robin. Robin had fully intended to destroy the dragon himself, being of the same blood, at the cost of his own life, but Chrom forbade it, believing in the strong bonds friendship could overcome rather than saving everyone at the cost of one's life. Lucina had intended to strike Robin down to prevent the future premonition of her father's death, but in hindsight, with Robin's unmatched tactical ability winning a bright future for the next 1,000 years, it was the right decision to believe in her father's friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that day 4 months ago, Lucina had married her close friend, Gerome, the wyvern-riding son of Cherche and Gregor, crafter of her signature mask, and childhood crush. The two could not return to their time, the same fate regarding their companions from the future, so Lucina had decided to settle down with Gregor in the Wyvern Valley of Valm to enjoy a quiet life together. Lucina's family, especially mother, Sumia, and sister, Cynthia, had wished the two would have chosen a home closer to Ylisse, but taking care of the wyverns was a joy to both Lucina and Gregor, so the Ylissean Royal Family let the two be; Cynthia had especially taken frequent vacations from her job in the Pegasus Knights to visit her beloved sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, Lucina had been out gathering wood with Minerva, Gerome's beloved wyvern, to prepare for dinner, Gerome out hunting for deer, bears, and other meat to prepare. It probably would've been more effective for Gerome to use Minerva in hunting, but he considered himself a proud husband, and wanted to become a man Lucina could rely on without a giant dragon crutch; in truth, he also thought Minerva and Lucina bonding was the cutest thing he had seen, and wished to progress the relationship. Lucina flew through the skies, wind blowing through her long blue hair, Falchion sheathed at her side, satchel of logs at her backside, as Minerva flapped her giant black wings through the night sky. Lucina moved a hand from Minerva's reins to brush her hair back, her face was in an ear-to-ear smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The breeze feels so good, doesn't it girl? Gerome must feel blessed to have a partner like you to fly over this beautiful landscape with.\" Minerva let out a loud roar in approval, a sign of the two bonding well. Lucina had felt so jealous of Cynthia to have learned how to ride a pegasus from mother, to feel the wind blow through her hair, to see the amazing geography of the world from the sky; she felt relieved that the nightmare of Grima had ended and she was able to enjoy herself in such a manner she had never been before in the ruined future. On this particular night, a meteor shower had erupted over Wyvern Valley, beautiful rocks from the vast space had shot across the sky in beautiful trailing whites, a sight that many would call a miracle of nature; Lucina let out a gasp and let her smile grow wide as she saw how close she was to the shower of glowing rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA meteor was about to clobber the airborne duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina quickly tugged Minerva's reins and the dragon dodged out of the way in response, the meteor almost striking Minerva's wing and shooting the two out of the sky. They watched as the large rock plummeted towards the ground and impacted itself in the Earth, taking an acre of trees with it. Where the two currently were was far from where Gerome and Lucina had built their dream home, etched into the side of a mountain, built from wood and stone with a stable for Minerva to stay, but its only flaw was how high up and far it was from the vast woodland. Lucina figured it was best to go home as usual and help prepare a fire for dinner, but a rebellious streak took over her judgment for a minute, curiosity had struck her for such a rare event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not every day we see something like this. What do you say girl? Would you like to investigate?\" Minerva lowered her neck in agreement, almost as if a nod, and descended towards the impact site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two reached the massive crater where the meteor lay, the wooded area had burned out from the impact, and the area glowed an eerie green that emanated from the mirror. Lucina had dismounted herself from Minerva and approached the meteor, sliding down the earthen crater to get a closer look. The rock was huge, almost the size of her body, so Lucina could only approach and touch the rock, breaking off a souvenir would prove to be tough. Lucina had placed both of her hands onto the face of the rock and stared at the glowing monolith, almost entranced by its glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so pretty...\" Lucina cooed, enamored by the natural beauty, \"I've never seen anything so beautiful...\" Suddenly, the rock shook, causing Lucina to remove her hands from the face of the stone. She quickly removed Falchion from its sheath and prepared to leap back, when suddenly the rock exploded into a bright green light that filled the crater like a sphere, knocking Lucina back and blowing Falchion out of her hands. Minerva, concerned, roared and lunged closer as the light dispersed, expecting to burn a creature that may have knocked her master's wife back, but when she entered the crater, she found the rock had completely shattered, leaving nothing behind and no visible signs of anything that exited. After confirming nothing was out of the ordinary, Minerva moved towards Lucina and licked the young woman's face in an effort to wake her, Lucina quickly coming back to reality with the wet, sulfur-smelling saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Minerva...\" Lucina had removed herself from the small crater of dirt she left by her impact and dusted herself off, she looked for Falchion and sheathed the blade once again after removing it from the ground. She looked at the explosion epicenter where the rock once stood and moved her hand to her head, shaking off a headache; she didn't expect the meteor to do that at all, and it'd be a tough experience to shake off. Lucina looked down at her body for any signs of bodily harm, but couldn't find anything. \"I don't have any wounds, I don't feel in pain, but...It's strange...\"</span></div></div>",

Ah!\" Lucina cried out in pain and dropped to her knees as she clenched her body tight, responding to the pain of her clothes digging into her. <i>\"What is this this feeling?! Is this from that light?!\"</i> Lucina wondered what was happening to her body as she heard the sound of tearing cloth, felt her gloves burst at the seams, toes burst from their boots, and cloth pauldrons tear away from her shoulders; her eyes grew wide as she saw Minerva, a wyvern regarded highly for her massive size and stature, slowly getting smaller as her clothes tore away. <i>\"I-Is Minerva shrinking?! Is the whole world shrinking?!\"</i> Lucina felt her belt and sheath break from her waist and her tunic starting to tear, her boots and gloves had completely burst, and tears were beginning to form on her onesie she wore under her tunic, exposing her toes to the Earth shifting under her feet; by this point, Lucina had arrived at a far more logical conclusion. <i>\"That can't be it, I must be growing! That light made me grow!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina let out more gasps of pain as she felt her ornate headband snap off of her head, not a pleasant feeling considering it was made from metal. Her tunic made a fault down the backside before splitting apart and falling from Lucina's quickly expanding frame, exposing all of her sweater-like onesie which had formed holes and tears from the young woman's expanding mass. Minerva backed up as she watched Lucina get even bigger and felt powerless as she gazed upon the pained face of her master's wife, her fingers digging into her skin out of discomfort, her body slowly rising above the charred remnants of the trees. Eventually, the onesie burst, and Lucina let out a cry of relief, finally free of the binding confines of her clothes, and got down on her hands and knees to let the Earth shift under her body. After roughly a minute of growth and grunts of discomfort, Lucina had finally stopped growing and collapsed onto her belly, letting out a sigh of relief; there was no way to measure it, but the once-petit princess was now a massive 60 feet tall, completely nude with the ground her only cover<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina raised her head from the ground and gazed upon Minerva, the wyvern retaining a stoic look, but feeling worry for her fellow rider; the first thing Lucina noticed was how adorable Minerva was at this toy-like size. <i>\"S-So cute! She looks like a puppy!\"</i> Lucina shook away the thought from her head and quickly came back to reality, she was still quite surprised about how she had grown, yet the horrors of the Grima-ruled future had an everlasting effect on her psyche, and she could not be fazed by her new size. Lucina sat up and moved her hands to cover her privates, her face turning red at the thought of any travelers or brigands laying eye upon her large naked figure, and looked around at the landscape around her, amazed by the sights of the wilderness from her vantage point; maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina gazed down at Minerva, still grounded and staring up at her fellow rider, and spoke; \"Looks like I won't need to ride upon your back to see sights like this anymore, huh Minerva?\" Minerva puffed smoke out of her nostrils and rotated her head in another direction, almost in a jealous manner, causing Lucina to giggle at the dragon's childish reaction. \"Alright, we'll see if I can return to normal and ride with you again.\" Then the thought crossed Lucina's mind: What if there was no \"normal\" anymore? She picked up Falchion which lied by her side, still sheathed, and gazed upon its toothpick-like size. What if she was stuck like this? What if she was a giant for the rest of her life? What if she'd start emitting that same light as the meteor and causing others to become like her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if Severa got this big?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thought especially made her shudder, nobody wants a large, angry Severa stomping around screaming about perverts staring at her naked body, it's bad enough Owain has to deal with her, even if she did miraculously pacify herself around him in camp during the war. Lucina slowly rose up, hands still clutching her privates, and Minerva took flight in response. Lucina placed Falchion into the satchel of logs that lied upon Minerva's back and locked eyes with the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case Minerva,\" the giant princess spoke, \"We need to get back home, there's no need to make Gerome worry about us. We'll figure something out then.\" The wyvern roared in agreement and began a soar towards the couple's home in the mountains, Lucina following right behind and easily catching up with the dragon, even at walking speed. The journey was normally long for a normal-sized human, but Lucina, now a giantess, could clear the distance of Wyvern Valley in mere minutes. The two continued back home, hoping Gerome would maintain his solemn attitude at the visage of his huge wife.</span></div></div>",

Lucina gently took Gerome's offerings when presented, unfolding the sheets to try and match them up to her body; her heart sank a little when she saw how tiny they were, almost comparable to handkerchiefs, though a little larger in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this...Really all we have?\" Lucina moved her lips into a frown and tried to stretch her mouth as far back as possible, in order to show her discontent and slight embarrassment. Gerome fumbled a little at his wife's response, and tried to compose himself a little, his face a little red from seeing Lucina's exposed, now-massive, yet still relatively flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all that we have. I tried to bring out as much cloth as I could.\" Lucina sighed at Gerome's retort and started gathering the pile of cloth, all the color white except for her cape. She looked around for anyone who might have been watching before gazing back down on her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around.\" Gerome abided by his wife's orders and turned around, folding his arms as he waited; all he could think is that if it were anyone else, they probably wouldn't be able to take their eyes off Lucina's body, and might be crushed into a fine paste by her massive angry fist - it was a good thing he was a level-headed person. Lucina stood and began to wrap everything she had around her body, starting at her lower regions before moving to her chest. She was able to tie enough sheets around her bottom to cover her nudity, but when it came to her chest, despite her chest's relatively small size, she couldn't get the tied sheets to fully link together without strain; Lucina took a look down at her favorite cape, the Mark of Naga emblazoned upon its face, and cursed at her solution. She took the cape and tied it to one end of the sheets before wrapping it around her chest and tying it to the other end; her makeshift bra was now complete, the Mark of Naga on her cape now the centerpiece of it, sure to attract attention to what little cleavage she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Lucina said, \"You can look now.\" Gerome turned around and his face turned red when gazing at his wife's visage, he was a man of a limited and refined vocabulary, but his mind was stuck on the word most brigands and ruffians would use: \"Sexy\". Lucina sat down, now a little more content that her privates were fully covered with no aid from her limbs, and began speaking to Gerome again, trying to figure out a solution to this situation. \"We have to find some way to fix this. I was thinking we should go to Ylisse to find a solution, Robin or Aunt Lissa would be able to figure something out with their magic, no?\" Gerome wanted to agree with Lucina's logic, but it would prove hard to accomplish this at her current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right,\"  Gerome retorted, \"But we would have to charter a boat to cross the ocean in order to get there. I mean no offense, but it wouldn't exactly be easy to sneak a giant woman onto a ship without causing a disturbance. You might even sink it.\" Lucina bit her lip at Gerome's reasoning, he was right, they'd have to figure something out if they wanted to go to Ylisse; she also managed to hold back from slapping Gerome for that last bit, not wanting to break his spine on impact. Lucina closed her eyes and thought for a moment, before coming to a second conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tiki lives in Valm, right? Perhaps she's seen something like this in how long she's lived, she's even close to Naga when it comes to a natural divine ability.\" Lucina thought that even if she hadn't seen this sort of scenario before, the power of the Divine Dragon could fix it, or at the very least, manage it, in case she started growing out of control again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good idea.\" Gerome figured that was far more manageable of a solution, but couldn't help but think Robin could do something better, having the blood of a godlike dragon himself and a tactical mind that could help hide report of a giant woman being spotted across the continents. \"It's your call Lucina, I'll do anything to help you with either option.\" Minerva let out a cry of approval herself, the three of them were in this together now. Lucina closed her eyes to weigh her options; tactical genius and family support, or the Divine Dragon's power and possible historical background...</span></div></div>",

Minerva, to me!\" He whistled. The dragon flew over enthusiastically and Gerome quickly mounted. The dragon flew up beside Lucina, who was rising to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina smiled at the toysized dragon and her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you did not wish to rely on a giant dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not, but I would not match your stride otherwise.\" Gerome said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina took a stride and Minerva followed after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I was merely jesting. In truth I am happy to have you both with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome relaxed and smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be like the long walks we used to have together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina's stride settled into a steady pace. A human would have trouble keeping up with her, but Minerva did not, not even needing to fly at her full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Lucina  looked to the landscape and started reminiscing for a while, before she suddenly looked serious. \"I had also wanted to visit Tiki, though under different circumstances. I hope she will feel I was worthy of the Hero King's name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome ordered Minerva closer, now flying right by Lucina's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You inspired all of us and helped save the land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a group effort.\" Lucina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it was for Marth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Robin and Chrom played a larger role than us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome waved a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your part was as vital as there.Without you Chrom would have lost his life and Robin would have been consumed by Grima.  You should be proud of what you achieved, if you hadn't gone back our future would still be bleak and hopeless. There's no one I admire more than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina leaned over and kiss him, her lips large enough to cover the majority of his face. Gerome was speechless and even wearing that mask, it was clear how flustered he was. In spite of the situation, Lucina could not help but giggle. Gerome worked so hard to appear always appear serious and stoic, so she could not help but enjoy glimpses of his other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome soon regained his composure and the two continued to converse. With Lucina's long steps they soon reached the Divine Dragon Grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina cautiously approached, stepping over the trees and called out for Tiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Lady Tiki? Are you here?\" Lucina tried to be quiet as she could, in case Tiki slept as she usually did, but at her size, her voice had become quite louder than usual, and could easily awake any person in the area. As Lucina focused her gaze towards the ground, she found Tiki, fast asleep in a meadow, surrounded by flowers, she almost gave off an aura of life that seemed to make the flowers tall and healthy. Lucina didn't want to wake the sleeping manakete and get her in a grumpy mood, but she needed her help more then ever. \"Lady Tiki-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" From behind a nearby tree came Say'ri, the princess of Chon'sin, and personal aide and friend to Tiki; she spoke in a low shout as not to wake Tiki and wiped sweat from her brow, a clear sign she was training her swordsmanship. As she came back to reality, she spoke directly towards Lucina, \"Princess Lucina, please mind your voice as not to awaGYAAAAH!!!\" Say'ri screamed and fell backwards upon the sight of the 60 foot Lucina, clad in her skimpy outfit, husband and dragon flying at her side, almost toy-sized in comparison. Say'ri rubbed her eyes before continuing, \"L-Lucina?! Is-Is that really you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina let out a small giggle at the small princess' reaction before breaking into another whisper; \"Yes Say'ri, it's me. And, uh, please mind your voice as not to awake Lady Tiki.\" Lucina chuckled a little at her joke while Gerome just moved a hand to his head and shook it, Lucina's sense of humor in the Shepherds always was hit-or miss. Say'ri's face flushed red and she looked to make sure Tiki was still asleep; out like a light, almost dead. She took time to compose herself and brush off her outfit before returning to her talk with Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well,\" Say'ri continued, still visibly shaken up by the sight of the giantess, \"It's not every day you see a comrade in arms at such a size and, um...attire.\" Now calmed down to a more manageable state, she continued; \"Now, what brings you here? I thought you and Gerome had settled down in Wyvern Valley for a quiet life together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lucina retorted, \"Can a friend not visit another friend to talk?\" She gave a false huff, having fun with the conversation, before returning to her serious demeanor. \"But to be honest, it's about my...condition. I was hoping Lady Tiki could provide insight to what's happened to me, even possibly a cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand why you'd come. However,\" Say'ri turned to Tiki and continued her thoughts, \"Lady Tiki is in an important slumber right now, I'm afraid you cannot wake her in this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Lucina responded, curious of the importance of Tiki's nap, \"Is she performing another ritual to further her Divine Dragon powers?\" Anything that would help protect the world from the dark forces that may threaten it, Lucina figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Say'ri bit her lip, not ready for how Lucina may react. \"Lady Tiki...Partook in a Chon'sin feast, and sampled too much of the turkey and ale. I'm afraid she'll be in a bad mood if she awakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all?! I'll be in a bad mood if I'm stuck like this!\" Lucina got low to the ground and started childishly banging her fists on the earth, sending shockwaves through the ground in an effort to awake Tiki. \"TIKI! WAKE UP! I NEED YOUR HELP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud! Cease immediately!\" Say'ri began fuming herself and started yelling at Lucina. \"If you don't halt your noise right now, I'll take up my blade and make you stop!\" The two began to childishly argue with each other, the noise miraculously not awaking Tiki, but wearing on Gerome's nerves. As the noise reverberated through his ears and grew ever so louder, something inside Gerome snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOTH OF YOU, QUIT IT WITH THE WHINING!\" Both girls stopped at Gerome's outburst, they've never seen him get so loud before, as aggravated maybe, but not loud. Say'ri cursed and looked at Tiki, hoping she wasn't awake; she was still as dead as a corpse, not even a snore erupted from her mouth. As Gerome and Minerva landed upon the ground, a cloud of pollen fluttered through Minerva's nostrils, causing her to let out a small, high-pitched sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, quiet, quiet, quiet!\" Tiki awoke in a cranky mood, looking ready to turn into a dragon at any moment. \"Honestly, you don't see me sneezing around everyone when they're sleeping!\" She let out a small hiccup and rubbed the sleep from her eyes. The first thing Tiki noticed when returning to the world of the living was the giant Lucina. Not even fazed, she spoke; \"Oh, Lucina, hello, you look taller. And what is with those clothes?\" Everyone gathered around Tiki and Lucina began to explain what happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see, so a meteor made you a giant? I guess that's strange, but I've never seen a meteor up close before though...\" Tiki rubbed some more sleep out of her eyes and mumbled a little, prompting Lucina to retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me for disturbing your rest, but I felt you were the only person who could help me. Well, the only person who could help me without causing a scene in a city. Can you help me in any way?\" Tiki yawned a bit and pondered Lucina's situation, wondering if there was anything that could help.</span></div></div>",

They were rude and greedy in their method to attain the treasure, and when they finally found a village elder who knew of the elixir, they were pointed to the content of Akaneia. Eventually, they found the elixir, but instead of immortality, the hunter began to dwindle in size rapidly, regretting all their bad deeds, until all that remained was a pile of rags.\" Say'ri finally opened her eyes again. \"I always believed it was a tale told to introduce the concept of karma to the children. If it's to be believed, then I'm sure it'd get you back to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akaneia was the name of Ylisse thousands of years ago,\" commented Tiki, \"Back when Mar-Mar was alive. We heard a tale similar on our travels, but I never put any thought into it myself.\" Lucina was glad to hear there might have been a solution to her problem, but was equally distressed by the story's context.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But even if it were to exist, what would stop me from shrinking too far? I may end up half my normal height, the size of a doll, or...\" She trailed off her thought as everyone fell silent, not wanting to finish the grim thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case,\" Gerome spoke, breaking the silence, \"It seems we'll have to travel to Ylisse anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Lucina nodded in agreement, \"It seems we'll have to charter a ship to cross the ocean with.\" Lucina turned toward Tiki and bowed, doing the same in kind with Say'ri. \"Lady Tiki, Say'ri, thank you for your help. Please tell us if you remember anything else out about the tale.\" Both girls bowed in kind and watched as Lucina strode off, Gerome and Minerva flying behind her. Tiki moved her hand to her chin and pondered for a moment, before turning to speak to Say'ri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where Lucina and Gerome settled, do you not? I wish to travel there, this talk of the meteor has gotten me curious on the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my lady,\" Say'ri inquired, \"Didn't you say that there was nothing you could do about Lucina's condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I kind of lied a little.\" answered Tiki. \"I didn't wish to get the young princess' hopes up. There's nothing in my power I can do now to decrease her size, but that's only because this phenomenon has never been encountered before. If we could harness the power of growth in some manner, maybe we could forge something similar to a Dragonstone allowing her to shift her sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that possible, my lady?\" Say'ri asked. \"Wouldn't a stone make her even larger at her current size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily, with the blessing of Naga, there's a chance we could reverse-engineer the meteor's power. Lucina's base state would be as a giant, but the stone would allow her to shrink back to her normal size, almost like a magical charm.\" Tiki transformed into her dragon state and beckoned for Say'ri to get on her back. \"We'll have to study this phenomenon and transport the raw material to Naga. Brace yourself, we may even have to get huge ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You just want to get big to eat more of the feast, don't you?\" Tiki coughed a little before responding to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what gave you that idea?! Ha Ha! Ha...\" Say'ri shook her head and sat herself upon Tiki's back, ready to navigate to Wyvern Valley and look for the meteors. Tiki took flight and soared off at a quick speed, one that could easily outmatch even the largest of wyverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina and Gerome took a moment to rest in a field for a bit, trying to formulate a plan to get to Ylisse. Lucina sat down on the ground and leaned back to lay down, shaking the ground a little on impact and feeling the tiny fields of flowers rubbing along her backside. Minerva landed next to Lucina, Gerome sat upon her back, leaning forward and resting his chin upon his arms. Lucina's face, normally solemn on the walk, broke into a smile as she closed her eyes and took in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The breeze is so nice. This is good, isn't it?\" She turned towards Gerome to see him nod in agreement, face solemn, a sign he was deep in thought. Lucina adopted a disappointed expression and puffed her cheeks out; she plucked Gerome from his mount and raised him above her chest, watching him squirm around trying to break free. She pulled out her bra and tucked Gerome in, making sure he was tight in, and removed his mask from his face; his face was red and his eyes looked a little panicked, Lucina could only giggle at her husband as she looked down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What's the meaning of this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee-Hee! Sorry, sorry!\" Lucina ended her giggle fit and spoke a little calmer now. \"It's just that you looked so stressed ever since I got this big. I figured that after all that occurred at the Divine Dragon Grounds, you needed something to help you relax.\" Gerome wouldn't call it \"relaxing\", he felt embarrassed being so close to his wife's chest, and even more embarrassed to be without his signature mask, which always hid his emotions from others. He took time to calm himself a little before continuing to talk with Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for my outburst before, I was just worried for your well-being, Lucina. I know this 'shrinking elixir' seems to be our only solution, but I'm worried it'll backfire. I don't want to lose you, especially after we lived through the horror of the future.\" Lucina felt Gerome's words and felt a warm sense of love in her chest, the warmth transferring to Gerome's body; the two lovers both felt this event helped them become closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your words please me Gerome, but if Say'ri and Lady Tiki were to be trusted, this is the only way.\" Lucina felt an even bigger smile crawl onto her face. \"Besides, Father, Mother, Aunt Lissa, and Robin live in the continent as well, if we told them about our problem, they'd be sure to help. It'd be nice to see the other Shepherds as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Our problem'?\" Gerome grimaced. \"Lucina, you're never a problem for me, you're the ray of sunshine in my dark life.\" Lucina blushed and hugged her chest tight, Gerome felt the crushing weight of his wife's arms and gasped for air when it was all over. \"In any case, we'll have to charter a ship. Our best option without sneaking onto a ship would to appeal to Virion in Rosanne.\" Gerome didn't like this option too well, Virion could barely keep his eyes off his wife Olivia in her dancing attire, he didn't particularly like the idea of Virion ogling his half-naked wife at her current size. Not to mention Cherche and Gregor took up residence in Rosanne after the war; it was petty of him, but he didn't particularly like seeing his parents again, he had no clue what to say to them, nor did he want to know what his parents eccentric reactions to Lucina would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I could swim.\" Gerome just looked up at Lucina puzzled at her suggestion. \"I'm serious! We all saw the various island chains across the ocean, I could probably go 12 hours swimming without rest, we could take refuge on each island as I'm swimming, and at my size, we could clear the distance easily in a few hours. This could minimize the risk of me being seen.\" Gerome was still puzzled with Lucina's suggestion, but she had a point, stealth was vital in this ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your call Lucina, I'm with you either way.\" Minerva cuddled up against Lucina's face as if to be a part of the conversation. Once again, Lucina was faced with the vital decision, she weighed her options carefully before deciding...</span></div></div>",

I suppose that is one good side...\" Lucina said sadly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more steps  a troubling thought entered Lucina's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, won't my appearance frighten the people of Rosanne? Not to mention other lookers.\" At the thought of it, Lucina blushed and Gerome clenched his fists. Gerome flew closer to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we near Rosanne we'll go on ahead.\" Gerome said. \"We can explain the situation then get you to sea as quickly as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It's settled then, let's go swimming!\" Lucina removed Gerome from her bra and gave him back his mask. \"Gerome, can you and Minerva navigate for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" answered Gerome, as he re-mounted himself on Minerva's back. The wyvern took flight as Lucina got up from her comfy rest and prepared to march. \"The ocean is eastward, are you sure you can do this?\" Gerome was still skeptical at Lucina's suggestion to swim, but Lucina only looked back with a smile on her face and burning confidence in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! We've all trained for the worst battles back in the future, this will be child's play!\" The couple nodded at each other and marched towards the sea. When they finally arrived at the Valmese shore, it was completely empty; no ports, no ships, no people, just a patch of nature where the surf linked the land and ocean. Lucina took a few breaths before breaking into a sprint and diving into the ocean, the first thing she noticed was how cold and salty the water was. Gerome watched as his wife shivered before speaking up, focused on her care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still up for this?\" Lucina looked up at Gerome, trying to stop her teeth from chattering, before answering back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, it's fine, I'll get used to it...\" Lucina had remembered when the Shepherds all went to the Hotrealm to relax a little during their journey, the Outrealm Gate's time-ignoring system allowing a break in their busy schedule, the water had warmed to her body temperature when she swam during that time, she figured Gerome wouldn't know since he opted to stay in the rest cabana instead of going for a swim with the other Shepherds, she couldn't blame him for worrying since this was his first time seeing someone frolic in the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep watch from up here then,\" Gerome answered, \"I'll fly down towards you to give you directions.\" Gerome pulled out a telescope from a satchel at Minerva's side, used initially to keep watch for Risen and Grima in the future, now used for navigation, and held it out as if to signal Lucina he and Minerva were ready. Lucina nodded and pointed her body forward, breaking into a front crawl and charging through the churning waves at a high speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was vast and blue as the trio continued across the ocean, Lucina swam strong and elegantly, not even breaking a sweat as she reached her 8th hour at sea, as Gerome kept lookout with the telescope. The faint speck of an island came into view from the glass lens, and Gerome beckoned Minerva to descend as he saw it, stopping next to Lucina's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An island is up ahead, bear right and keep going forward.\" Lucina had no way to say she agreed without taking in a whole bunch of saltwater, but her expression spoke more than enough to Gerome. He and Minerva ascended back to their original position and Lucina picked up her pace, eager to rest with her husband and discuss what to do when they reach Ylisse. By the time they hit the island, the sun was beginning to set and the sky was a deep orange; Lucina reached the shore and lied down on her stomach, gasping for air, as Gerome descended to her face. Lucina looked at Gerome with a smug grin and coughed up a little seawater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I could make it.\" Gerome huffed and Lucina giggled in turn. She flipped to her backside and sat up, feeling the chilling breeze across her body. Her \"clothes\" were soaked, she prodded at the damp cloth with her fingers, trying to get the seawater to drip from the sheets, her arms shivering as she moved them around her body. Gerome took notice and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nightfall's coming. I'll gather firewood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Lucina smiled at her husband as he strode into the forest just off the beach, wielding a large axe in his hand. Minerva cuddled up to Lucina and puffed flames from her mouth, hoping the heat would help dry the young princess off. Lucina moved her damp hand to Minerva's back and stroked the wyvern's scales, Minerva purred in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen nightfall came, the three gathered around a large bonfire, Lucina nude once again, lying on her stomach to keep relatively modest, her sheet undies hanging from palm trees to dry. She prodded at Gerome with her finger, causing the wyvern rider to blush, and giggled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really do need to show your feelings more, it's cute.\" Gerome fidgeted and mumbled at this, causing Lucina's giggles to pick up in pace and volume; she could've sworn she heard Minerva give something similar to a chuckle too. Lucina stared into the fire with a smile on her face, reminiscing about the good times she shared with the children of the future. \"You know, I appreciate everything you've done for me.\" Gerome nodded, face solemn once more, before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my wife, I'd do anything for you.\" Lucina shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that, just everything in general. You crafted my mask for me, saved me from Risen, you even sewed my favorite doll back together when we were children.\" Gerome became even more flustered at the last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia said she wouldn't tell anyone!\" Lucina laughed hard at Gerome's response, never expecting him to get so worked up over the scenario. When she calmed down, she gazed directly at Gerome and pulled him towards her massive face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sisterly bond, you know? But I really do appreciate it, so thank you Gerome. You're more than my husband, you're my best friend.\" She gave Gerome a big kiss, her massive pink lips consuming the front of Gerome's body before pulling back; Gerome's face was red, but Lucina saw the smile upon his face, she could tell behind that mask that he was happy to be here with her. Lucina looked up at the stars, the sky was dark blue and the moon was full, it truly was a beautiful scene, one they couldn't find in the future. \"In any case, it's getting late, we should probably get to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" answered Gerome. He gave Minerva a signal and the wyvern took flight, flapping her wings over the flames to put them out, so the forest wouldn't catch ablaze in the middle of the night. Lucina moved her hands over the top of some palm trees and tore a bunch of leaves from their treetops. She gave Gerome a large leaf to use as a blanket while she kept the rest, scattering them over her body as she lied on her back, enough to cover her body's sensitive areas and protect her from the cold. Gerome removed his mask and placed it in Minerva's satchel, he sat down and pushed his back into Minerva's side before draping the leaf over his body, the dragon cuddled next to her master like a sleeping dog, curled up into a ball. Gerome looked at Lucina with a smile on his face, she looked back, smile on hers as well. \"Goodnight Lucina, I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do I, Gerome.\" The two lovebirds then drifted off to sleep, ready to continue the journey the next morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The couple were awoken the next morning by the sound of a ship's horn. They looked around, seeing what appeared to be a merchant ship sailing to Valm. On boarda group of rowdy sailors. gawking, whistling  and Leering at Lucina.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucina instinctively covered her body with her hands <br>\r\n\"Stop gawking at me you scoundrels!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sailors did not gawking, and their cheers and jeers only grew louder <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucina blushed, she climbed into the water to further cover herself. She though of trying to grab the ship, but it was far out of reach of her arm and she wasn't sure she could swim fast enough to catch up to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome did not watch passively. He gnashed his teeth together and shouted. <br>\r\n\"That's my wife, you louts!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ruffian shouted back, loudly enough for the duo to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha your wife? How do you make love to that thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both glowered, while the boat erupted with laughter. Neither of them would stand for that, Lucina swam towards the boat as quickly as she could, while Gerome whistled for Minerva, mounting and charging at the ship like an arrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva could not possibly understand what was going on, but she growled, clearly receptive to the anger her masters felt, and those were causing it <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMinerva flew over the ocean, racing ahead of Lucina, even as she did her finest breast strokes, flying at the ship like an arrow, while Gerome reached for his lance. <br>\r\nThe sailor's laughter turned to gasps of panic, and several crewman ran to the cannons, for even a merchant ship needs to defend itself from pirates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Gerome nor Minerva were deterred, dragon and rider moving as one, now moving in graceful zig zags, while Lucina dived under the waters, but continued swimming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he was directly above the crew, his lance ready, while Minerva bared her fangs, with the same readiness to strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew gaped up, their expressions fearful. After watching his flight and seeing the way Gerome held his lance, it was obvious the rider was no rookie. The crew ran for cover, seeking safety below deck. Gerome chased after the loudest heckler, easily out running him and knocking him over with Minerva. He held his lance over him, as Minerva did the same with her jaw and impressive row of teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing for his life, the sailor got to his knees, and raised his arms as though praying for his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait- please-\" He grovelled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t kill me! I'll give you whatever I want!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome grunted.  <br>\r\n\"We're no thieves, all I want is for you to apologize to my wife and acknowledge her as a human being!\" Gerome pointed with his lance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina,was closing in and bobbed her head out of the water, glowering at the man as though she was a sea monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sailor glanced at her and his trembling increased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course m-miss giant lady-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Lucina!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,miss Lucina.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome place his lance inches from the sailors throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now apologise to my wife.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am sorry miss Lucina.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe looked at Lucina, whose was now wearing a monstrous scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-for staring, and whistling and uh- please don't kill me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him out of here!\" Lucina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go.\" He withdrew, flying into the air but shouted down to this. \"And tell the rest of the crew this, remember next time that a person no matter how big she is, or we'll make you sorry you were born!\" Gerome yelled after them. Minvera growled something in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship sailed away faster than any ship the duo had ever  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two were so busy with the hecklers that they barely noticed Lucina catching up to them until she was almost there, hearing a loud splash below them. Lucina smiled up at them. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Thanks for standing up for me.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe dived down to her, until Minerva was close enough to nuzzle Lucina's face. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it, what kind of man would I be if I did not?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucina placed a hand to chest. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Thank you. I have never been in a situation like this before.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nGerome blinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can only imagine how strange the whole giant thing must be, but you've never had men leer at you before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina was surprised at her husband's surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not often, why would I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome's mouth opened for a second but he quickly closed it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You really don't see it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina stared blankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Your're-\" Geromme hesiated, choking back the words, not used to showing much affection. \"Your.. you truly don't know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina cocked head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome turned his head to the side, looking at her peripherally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Beautiful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Lucina said dryly. \"But you're just saying that to make me feel better.\" <br>\r\nGerome whirled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you truly believe I am one for false flattery?\"\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina gave it a second of thought before responding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not. But what do you see in me that you would call beautiful?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuffled in his seat, clearly embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to-\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucina slumped down and frowning as she stared at the ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I suppose not....\" she looked down at the ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Gerome growled and threw his arms in the air. \"I don't normally do this, so listen to me! I said I felt the way I did about you from the moments I first laid eyes on you and if I have to prove it then so be it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome circled around again, stopping at Lucina's hair. He lifted a handful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first thing caught my eyes, were your long blue locks, which always seem to shine no matter what you went.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always took pride in my hair.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew back to Lucina's face. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Then their was your face.\" He touched Lucina's face. \"It was uh- very shapely.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucina frowned. Gerome fidgeted. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I said I'm not very good at this!\" <br>\r\nLucina laughed. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I remember. You said you were no poet. All the same, I appreciate the effort.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nGerome tried to continue as though he hadn't mistepped <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yes, there's something I like about your face that even if I can't find the right words. And I've always liked your eyes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina smiled. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"My hair and my eyes, they have always reminded me of father.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"When you phrase it like it sounds kind of wie-\" He cut himself off when he saw Lucina glare. \"I mean-\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucina shifted back, her posture becoming less tense <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I do appreciate your effort, Gerome, I would be surprised if my body could turn the heads of many men, even at this size.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"It certainly drew the attentions of those sailors.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pursued her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, but they had been at sea for a while, and perhaps it was merely the sight of a giant maiden in the middle of the ocean...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You sell yourself short.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAgain she blushed and folded her arms around her chest,  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"But I lack.... curves.\" Her eyes darted as she said it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nGerome couldn't help but look as she inadvertently drew attention to that area. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>Not at this size</i> he thought to himself, but was not so tactless as to say it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"There is more than a woman than curves, or Tharja would be the most sought after women in the army.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina chuckled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"True enough..\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well then Gerome,\" Lucina said while standing up, not bothering to cover herself knowing the ruffian sailors were gone and completely fine with Gerome seeing her naked body, \"I think we should continue our trip to Ylisse.\" She took her makeshift underwear off the trees she left it upon and stared at them for a minute, before looking into the island's vast jungle. \"Actually, do you mind if I frolicked around the jungle a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\" Gerome answered. Lucina smiled and nodded and walked off into the jungle with her undergarments in hand, while Gerome sat upon Minerva's back. \"Come Minerva, I wish to do reconnaissance.\" Gerome didn't want a repeat of what happened with the sailors, he thought it'd be best to circle the island and find a safe route for travel. Minerva bellowed in agreement to her master's wish, and the two took to the skies and began to circle the island. The two flew around for about 3 hours before Gerome was confident with their solitude and travel route, he touched back down on the beach and waited for Lucina to get back from her nature walk. It was only a mere 3 hours later until the ground shook, a sign that Lucina was done with her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerome, I'm back.\" Gerome turned around to look at his wife, he didn't expect to be blown away by the image of Lucina after her walk. Lucina had finally donned her sheets, but had decorated them with the flora of the jungle; palm leaves hung from her ties like the ends of ribbon bows, her makeshift bra and panties were bordered with flowering vines, the flowers in varying colors, a large necklace of colorful flowers was draped around Lucina's neck and hung down to her chest, and a large rafflesia flower had found itself nestled into Lucina's hair, right next to her left ear. Lucina held her arms together behind her back, rubbed her legs together, and blushed as she addressed Gerome. \"So, uh, w-what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, good. It looks good on you.\" Gerome's answer would normally make any woman think twice about their fashion choice, but Lucina saw the blush on Gerome's face and could hear the stammer in his words, she's been around him long enough to know his reaction was sincere. Lucina giggled and relaxed her body a bit with the knowledge the edits to her clothing weren't awful to Gerome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Gerome,\" she answered warmly, \"I just thought my outfit was looking a little plain, so I wanted to splash some color onto it, and so we could remember our time together here.\" In truth, Lucina really did this for Gerome, figuring he'd rather see her in a brighter outfit than plain, faded white cloth; she was just afraid she'd overdo her fashion edits, since Sumia had always thought Lucina had too much of a...flashy fashion sense. \"I just hope I didn't burn too much daylight with my venture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" answered Gerome, \"I won't rush you. You're your own person Lucina.\" Lucina smiled at Gerome's words and faced the ocean, ready to continue the trip. She fixed the flower in her hair to keep it taught and broke into a sprint, making an impressive leap from the shore before gracefully diving into the ocean. Lucina began a quick front crawl as Gerome and Minerva soared behind the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor 8 hours straight, the trio crossed the ocean before reaching the mainland of the Ylissean continent; by the time they arrived, the sky was night, and various ships could be seen by a dimly lit harbor, luckily not able to see the trio at the distance they were out in the ocean. A humid air was palpable in the night sky, it almost felt dry, like sand lined the air. Lucina squinted her eyes and saw a group of guards armed with lances on the port, clad in a mild amount of armor and tunics emblazoned with a symbol of 6 purple eyes, crossed together with a zigzagging pattern; Lucina grimaced at this emblem, she knew far too well where they were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlegia. The desert kingdom of the Grimleal, who worshipped Grima like a god. It was this nation, under rule of King Validar, and the Mad King Gangrel before him, that almost plunged the world into ruin by reviving Grima and bringing his dark power to a head again, which almost destroyed the world. Nowadays, the nation had become a mere shadow of what it once was, it was now a lawless nation ruled by nobody but the ruffians that lived there, and the population had dwindled heavily when the Grimleal had fed themselves to Grima to increase his power; the nation still managed to find business as a trade nation and was a popular rest stop for traders, pirates, and thieves, but much of the desert kingdom had relinquished its land to the desert that it came from, and various surrounding villages had expanded into the territory, now happy that their peace would no longer be tainted by the Grimleal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina felt anger burn up inside her at remembering the horror the nation plagued Ylisse with, but she managed to keep herself calm, not wanting to blow her cover to the ruffian continent. She looked around for a safe haven and found a large bridge she could swim under, the gap between the water and rock easily allowing Lucina's head and shoulders to fit under it and Gerome and Minerva to soar under it; the trick was just finding out how not to be spotted by the guards or citizens. Lucina turned towards the wyvern rider and wyvern and motioned for them to follow her, they quickly darted under the bridge and found hiding spots in the shade, Lucina clinging herself to a wall and Gerome and Minerva perched on a ledge under the under the bridge, close to the river leading out to the ocean. They heard two guards walk above them and kept quiet as they listened close to their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did ya hear?\" spoke one of the guards. \"That merchant ship headed to Valm came back earlier this evening, crying about a 'sea monster' that attacked them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like, was it a serpent or a dragon or something?\" responded the guard's colleague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, that's where it gets freaky; the 'monster' was a giant woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That's stupid. You're stupid. There ain't anything like a 'giant woman' out at seas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling ya, the chief sailor said she was going to swallow him and his crew alive unless they left that island they were sailing close to.\" The guard spoke more excitedly, \"I tell ya, I wish those wenches down at the tavern were that huge, I'd love to climb up the front of her legs and crawl right into-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah! I don't want to hear that crap! Keep it to yourself!\" The other guard was clearly bugged by his colleague's lewd imagery. The other guard merely chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it, it'd be hot though, wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, I guess it would be...\" The other guard was defeated by his colleague's words, but quickly went back to his serious demeanor. \"But we got a job to do, alright? No more thoughts of giant wenches on the job, I don't want you getting distracted by your stupid lewd daydreams, or the chief will have our asses!\" The two walked off, and from under the bridge, Lucina and Gerome were clearly distressed by the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Lucina whispered. \"Those sailors started a rumor, it's going to be harder to sneak past the nation with people on the lookout for a giant maiden...\" Lucina was especially offended by that middle part the guards spoke of. \"And what was with that 'swallow him alive' tale?\" Lucina thought to herself, <i>\"I should've eaten him if he was going to start this rumor...\"</i> She shook off the thought, not particularly enjoying the thought of eating someone whole, it went against her nature, her code of ethics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to be swift getting out of here,\" whispered back Gerome, \"Do you know the way out of here?\" Lucina looked around and closed her eyes, she remembered that time from two years ago when she invaded Plegia to try and save Aunt Emmeryn, memories of the city came back to her and she opened her eyes again, staring down further at the river, opposite to the ocean's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember,\" she spoke quietly, \"If we continue down this river, it'll flow into a canyon. We should be good to travel into Ylisstol if we avoid the villages on the way there.\" She thought a bit more, and corrected herself. \"Actually, we could manage to stop in Themis, Maribelle's mansion is there, we could easily spend the night as we talk to Robin about this.\" After the war, Robin and Maribelle had bought a large mansion in her home of Themis with all the excess war funds, ready to enjoy a married life together; the parlor and ballroom could easily fit Lucina at her massive size, and the vast vineyard could easily feed Lucina with all the grapes and wine the duo had access too. Gerome thought it over before responding to Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we'll stop in Themis to see Robin and Maribelle.\" He could see the clear advantage at taking refuge at the two's castle-like mansion, and if anyone could sneak a giant woman into the castle of Ylisstol without the citizens reacting negatively, it would be Robin. Gerome looked and listened for more guards before waving Lucina on, the coast was clear. The three swiftly moved up the river, hoping not to alert anyone in Plegia as they moved towards the canyon.</span></div></div>",

Even if some lowlifes see you and assume the worst, what are they going to do? You were more than capable of looking after yourself before this happened,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. the Falchion is no more than a toothpick to me now, but my body itself should prove a formidable weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, and even ignoring that, you've always been a survivor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I suppose I've had to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of us have, but you were the best among us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It pleases me to here you say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey traveled on. Gerome noticed Lucina had been silent for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? You haven't said anything for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina stopped, twitching her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just.. what if I am stuck at this? Will I ever be accepted again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome opened his mouth to speak, but Lucina raised a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you will always love and accept me, but will everyone else? Once glance at me and those sailors assumed I was some terrible sea monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome clenched his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were just small minded fools. I never mistook you for a monster, nor did Say'ri or Tiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does not seem like much could phase Tiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am certain Robin and Maribelle will not either.\" He hesitated for a second. \"At least I think Maribelle won't...\" he cleared his throat and hastily corrected himself. \"But Robin has always made the right calls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Robin has an open mind. I'm sure Maribelle will get quite a fright from my appearance,, but I've heard Lissa vouch for her many times. She is a good friend and a dependable person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. With the two of them on our side, we will make sure no one treats you like a monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they will happily provide their finest hospitality, though I do not wish to eat them out of house and home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have plenty to spare and you are one of us, they will not consider it a burden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinvera had been quiet for much of the trip, but suddenly started growling. Lucina stroked her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is Minvera?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome clenched his teeth and drew his lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be smelling risen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome looked around, seeing a large group of undead warriors shambling towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still haven't wiped out all the risen.\" Lucina assumed a combative stance, instinctively posed like Marth, despite lacking her Falchion. \"At least I can put this body to good use!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful Lucina, you're strong, not invincible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina ran towards the Risen, while Gerome charged. He reached the enemy first, skewing one through, but Lucina soon caught up, her every step boom across the area, and when she was in reach, it was a simple crushing the enemy beneath her feet, while still pulling back from those who got too close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome fought his hardest, slaying several Risen, but could not come close to the rate his wife was destroying, stomping or kicking them, while still moving with a speed and grace that seemed to contradict her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the Risen were no more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina, tried to wipe the remains of the her opponents off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I will need to find a way to wash, and a way to secure my privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er- Yes....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina rubbed her feet in the sand, trying to get more of the mess off, or at least cover it. Despite this annoyance she was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Few things are better stress relief than destroying those things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome flew level with her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you were a great fighter, but I had no idea you could move so quickly and with such agility, even at this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smiled widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am well trained and well practiced.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maribelle sat at the table of her 3rd floor terrace, taking occasional sips from her teacup, admiring the serene night sky, dimly lit by candles lining the veranda. She had just finished a busy day of legislature, wine shipments, &amp; parenting duties and found herself quite tired by it. <i>\"It feels good to get a spot of tea after putting the children to bed.\"</i> thought Maribelle. While the future versions of Brady and Morgan, her children, had differed in age, they somehow ended up being born as twin brother and sister in this timeline; Maribelle occasionally pondered if this was because the Outrealm Gate's interference had caused a rift in the timeline to be, but either way, she was happy she could love both of her children the same amount at the same time. As she drank, her beloved, Robin, had come to join her on the veranda, wiping away some sweat on his forehead and greeting his wife with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now Robin,\" spoke Maribelle, \"You're absolutely drenched from work today! You're not even wearing your signature coat! You really don't need to work the vineyard, that's what we have service for, no?\" Robin poured himself a glass of tea and laughed, beaming with that signature smile that always lit up the Shepherds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense Maribelle,\" answered Robin, \"Everyone deserves a break in life, even the vineyard workers, and it's a great boost of morale for work. If I can just take over everyone's duties and let them rest, then I'm more than happy to harvest the grapes on my free time.\" Maribelle only could smile at her husbands sincere kindness, he truly was the Shepherds' rock during their marches against Plegia and Valm; it was this same tact and kindness that caused her to fall in love with him when Robin prevented the Grimleal from chopping her head off those 2 years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are too kind, dear.\" she spoke warmly. \"Then perhaps you wouldn't mind caring for Morgan and Brady when the season begins to wear down? It does exhaust me so, the constant feeding and lullabies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be my honor Maribelle.\" answered Robin. Maribelle closed her eyes and sipped her tea with a grin on her face, Robin chuckled after taking a sip of his cup and unloaded his thought onto Maribelle. \"Hey, you know what would be goofy? If our children were to grow up like their future selves, and our timeline's Brady ends up marrying Cynthia and our timeline's Morgan marries Inigo too?\" Maribelle opened her eyes and suddenly adopted an expression of shock, as she spit her tea all over Robin's face, leaving the tactician confused. \"Well gee Maribelle, Cynthia and Inigo aren't that bad...\" Maribelle's face looked white as a ghost, her eyes were wide, her jaw was agape, her hand shook as the teacup rattled; Robin suddenly adopted a look of concern. \"What's wrong Maribelle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Uh, Uh...\" she raised her free arm as she stammered and pointed behind Robin, her free arm also shaking wildly. Robin turned around to look out the veranda, expecting the worst, but hoping to see just the night sky and unobscured view of the veranda and servant house. Robin's eyes grew wide and he jumped back, falling out of his chair and hitting the floor of the terrace with a loud \"THUD\"; he moved his hand to his head, gathering his thoughts, and spoke with slight shock in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Lucina? Is that you?\" Robin looked straight at Lucina's massive face, covered in a slight blush, her fingers wrapped around the railing of the terrace; she spoke calmly to respond, very much expecting this reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's been a while, Robin, Maribelle. I, uh, bought Gerome and Minerva with me too.\" Robin got up to look over the veranda, leaning next to Lucina's head, Maribelle had remained in her chair, her body and face frozen into position; Gerome and Minerva looked back at Robin from the ground. Gerome waved to Robin, the tactician waved back, still trying to comprehend what's going on. \"The, uh, front door is locked. We knocked, but got no answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, uh, let me get right on that.\" responded Robin. The front door to the mansion was large, more than enough for Lucina to squeeze through if she crawls in, and the ceiling was high enough to support her size if she sat or kneeled down. Robin got up and ran out of the room to open the front door, Maribelle remained frozen in place, her chair leaned backwards and she hit the floor, still in the same pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire group had gathered in the mansion's parlor, Lucina, Gerome, Robin, Maribelle, and the various butlers and maids employed in the couple's service; Minerva had to wait outside due to a strict no-animal policy, Maribelle was being tended to by two maids, fanning her and applying a bag of ice to her forehead as she sat on a chair at the top of the stairwell. Lucina had just got done explaining her story to the mansion's residents, from the impact of the meteors, to the talk with Tiki, to the sailors, to sneaking to Plegia, all the way up to entering the mansion. The butlers and maids looked on in awe and spoke with enthusiasm in their voice, clearly responding to the giant princess better than their master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" spoke a maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can rocks from the stars even <i>do</i> that?\" spoke a butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the brand of Ylissean royalty?\" asked another maid, looking at Lucina's left eye. Lucina froze up, she had forgotten about her eye's brand and the problems it may cause if someone were to spot her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina is Chrom's daughter from the future,\" spoke Robin, trying to defuse the confusion, \"That brand is a birthmark to prove her lineage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! So it's like Young Master Brady and Young Madame Morgan, correct?\" responded the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" spoke Maribelle, now fully revived, \"Lucina was an important hero in the war, I expect the utmost treatment from you all, despite her...condition.\" Maribelle moved her hand to her forehead, still trying to wrap her head around the idea of a meteor turning people into giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry to impose,\" Lucina spoke, \"But we needed your help Robin, as well as a place to stay. We realize it's rude, but do you mind if we stayed here for the time being? Until we could get into Ylisstol to see Father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" spoke Robin, \"You're a friend to us all, you and Gerome are allowed to stay here for as long as you like.\" Maribelle nodded her head to agree, but she felt like she was going to have a heart attack to let Lucina sleep on the floor of her mansion almost nude, especially with the floors just waxed, and she didn't like the idea of allowing Minerva to stay in the horse stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you both, we're truly grateful.\" responded Lucina, smiling ear to ear. Gerome had a slight grin on his face too, happy to relax in a warm home once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some ground rules, dear.\" Maribelle spoke, now a little more calm, grasping the situation better. \"I'll allow you the ballroom to sleep, Gerome may join you too, but you are to leave the windows shut and the blinds closed so nobody can see you, and absolutely no tearning any cloth for use as a blanket.\" She faced Gerome and continued her ultimatum, which felt like a rant. \"Minerva will be allowed in the stables, provided she doesn't go after any of our horses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva's a nice girl.\" responded Gerome, a little offended at Maribelle's words, though he knew she only said it because of her mild neurosis. \"She won't even breathe on your horses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, thank you.\" Maribelle continued looking at Gerome, not finished with him in her speech. \"And while you're here, you're to help us with the vineyard, but only you, I don't want Lucina working in her time of need.\" Gerome looked annoyed, but Robin spoke to him cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Gerome, I'll show you the ropes, it really is fun to work the fields!\" Gerome always thought Robin's glee and optimism was foolish and unbecoming of a tactician, but the man gave results, so he couldn't disrespect his nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Lucina, dear?\" asked Maribelle, looking directly in Lucina's eyes, \"Will you allow my tailors to make something more...<i>decent</i> for you to wear? I mean no offense, but you look like a greenhouse threw up on you.\" Maribelle grimaced at having to say that, feeling Brady had rubbed off on her, Lucina merely smiled, knowing full well her fashion choices weren't the best in the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the offer Maribelle,\" spoke Lucina gently, \"But I don't wish to impose on you. My outfit allows my best movement too to sneak around. If my size becomes common knowledge to Ylisse, then I'll take up your offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense darling,\" responded Maribelle, \"You aren't a burden at all, but if that is your wish...\" Maribelle slowly got up, her maids supporting her up, and turned towards her bedroom. \"I will retire for tonight, I still need time to get over all this. May you both have a good night.\" With that, Maribelle's maids practically carried her to her room, the young woman looked absolutely exhausted and definitely needed a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you to your room.\" said Robin, waving the manor staff to retire for the night. \"We'll talk in the morning about getting you to Chrom and Sumia, I think Maribelle needs a good cuddle tonight.\" Robin opened the large doors to the ballroom and the three entered, Lucina crawling inside. Robin helped the two prepare for bed for a while before retiring to his bedroom shared with Maribelle, stopping to kiss the sleeping babies Brady and Morgan goodnight. As the butlers dimmed the lamps and closed all the doors, everyone had retired to their rooms to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one wacky day for the House Maribelle.</span></div></div>",

After dealing with time travelers, cultists and dragons who thought themselves gods, a giant woman must not seem so strange to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome considered this, but wasn't completely satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what of Maribelle? I thought the sight of a giant would send her shrieking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina shrugged her shoulders, careful not to disturb Gerome with a careless move of her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lissa's praise must have been accurate, she is clearly a stronger woman than we would expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if the heads of the household remain calm the servants follow in their lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be so. It heartens me that my companions still see me for who I am and that they can indeed sway others.

You are a dependle fighter and husband, and skilled wyvern rider, that may well be enough for you.

Robin opened a window to let in the natural air as a catalyst to help wake up. He sniffed the fresh scent of nature and turned to his wife, who was beginning to disrobe herself behind a folding screen to prepare for a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's alright with you, I was thinking we should eat in the ballroom this morning.\" Robin spoke to his wife. Maribelle poked her head out from behind the curtain, having removed her lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she inquired, \"What's in the ballroom? Why not the dining hall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought it'd be a better idea to eat in the ballroom while Lucina and Gerome are here,\" responded Robin, \"To help Lucina feel welcome with her size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes.\" responded Maribelle. \"How could I forget about that? We'll eat in the ballroom then.\" Maribelle was remembering all that transpired the night before, with Lucina showing up and scaring her half to death with her massive size, and having to allow her and Gerome use of the manor to hide out in. \"Oh gods, it wasn't a dream...\" she muttered, not amused with the idea of trying to hide a giant woman on top of her busy schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'll give Brady and Morgan a bath and bring them downstairs. We'll see you in the ballroom.\" Robin whistled as he left the room, heading to the Twins' Room down the hall, closing the door behind him to give Maribelle her privacy. Maribelle had finally disrobed herself and moved out from behind the curtain, moving into the bathroom linked to the bedroom. She grabbed a towel from the rack and stepped into the shower, she turned the handle to let the hot water flow onto her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a morning this will be...\" she thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maribelle had finally come downstairs, she entered the kitchen and prepared her breakfast - a bran muffin, a grape bunch, and a cup of tea - and joined her family and guests in the ballroom, her maid carrying a tray of her breakfast behind her. When she opened the door, she was greeted by the laughter of her children and the massive frame of Lucina taking up the ballroom. Lucina was playing peek-a-boo with Brady, who was clearly amused by the giant princess, Morgan had stolen Gerome's mask and giggled uproariously as Gerome tried to remove it from her tiny hands, Robin only watched and laughed as he saw the scene unfold. The shut of the door had alerted the group Maribelle had joined them, Robin picked up the babies from their playtime and moved to a table with Gerome set up in the room to eat breakfast, Lucina kneeled down next to a cart filled with well-done steak and eggs and a large barrel full of tea, facing the table to join the discussion that would take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"There goes that souffl\u00e9 I was going to make...\"</i> thought Maribelle as she sat down at the table to join her family and Gerome. She took a sip of her tea and popped a grape into her mouth before addressing her guests. \"Forgive me if I don't seem amused today,\" she spoke to the duo, \"I'm still trying to get adjusted to this situation. It may sound priggish of me, but I've grown comfortable with my usual daily rituals, it is the magic that is me, and even the slightest changes in my morning drive me crazy.\" Lucina felt as if all the food the servants prepared for her might have set Maribelle off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about all this Maribelle,\" spoke Lucina, taking a swig from her barrel, \"I appreciate your kindness, but if you want us gone at any moment, then please don't hesitate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense dear,\" responded Maribelle, \"You aren't a bother to me or Robin, I'm just used to my usual routine is all.\" She faced Brady and Morgan, playing with their baby food, before continuing, \"Besides, Brady and Morgan have taken a liking to you two, and if my children enjoy your presence, then so do I.\" Lucina grabbed a handful of steak and eggs and stuffed them into her mouth, coughing a little bit after swallowing, as if she was afraid to ask something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That having been said...\" she started, \"You wouldn't happen to have a bathing area for me, would you? I haven't actually bathed ever since I've gotten this big.\" As she said this, Maribelle could notice the stench of the sea, sulfur, and rotting corpse on Lucina, and pinched her nose, moving from the table to open a small window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a lake and a waterfall near here.\" said Robin, responding for his wife, \"I'm going to be busy with the vineyard today, so I'll have a maid come with you and show you the way. It's a popular fishing spot around here, so she'll keep watch for you while you bathe.\" Robin smiled at Lucina and she smiled back, clearly pleased with his kind demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Robin, I appreciate it.\" Lucina took another swig from her barrel, gladdened by her hosts' hospitality and their estate's many features to support her. Gerome on the other hand winced at the word \"vineyard\", Maribelle did say he had to work while he and Lucina stayed here, and the thought upset him a bit, he was much better fit for hunting and woodcutting than harvesting fruits. Robin took notice of this and spoke to Gerome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Gerome,\" he said, grapping one of his grapes as if to illustrate his point, \"Harvesting is fun and builds stamina, and the most fun part is when we stomp on the grapes to make wine! I'll let you and Lucina sample some when we make it, it'll be like learning a new skill!\" Robin beamed with a childlike smile, but Gerome only looked annoyed, bothered by the idea of stomping on grapes, thinking it was unbecoming of a warrior. Maribelle returned from opening the window, and the group all continued eating breakfast together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce breakfast finished, Maribelle took to her usual duties with the babies and writing up shipment logs, while Lucina, Gerome, and Robin had gathered in the vineyard, Lucina carring a maid upon her shoulder as she kneeled down to address the two men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going off to take my bath now, I'll try to get back as soon as I can, and then we can take some time discussing how to see Father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" responded Robin, \"Have fun. We'll be working here if you need us, and feel free to take a few grapes when you get back!\" Robin grabbed a large basket and Gerome grabbed one in turn, the tactician faced the vineyard and walked towards the grape vines, but Gerome looked his wife in the eyes with an annoyed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to make something up with him while we're working, don't worry, we'll get into Ylisstol.\" Robin beckoned Gerome to come on, the wyvern rider sighed and began walking to the grapes. \"At least the butlers are washing Minervykins...\" he mumbled in a defeated tone. With that, Lucina got up and a maid began directing her to the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls talked for a while about various things as they walked through the woods behind the Maribelle Estate, Lucina spoke praise for her father and mother and told embarrassing stories about Gerome showing his emotions, the maid spoke highly of her masters and expressed the idea of how great it would be to be giant like Lucina, stating it would make her job far easier and please her masters better. When they reached the lake, it was devoid of people; the clear waters reflected the vast blue sky and the waterfall powered down from the cliffs above, sending a powerful sound of water crashing through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep watch from down here,\" spoke the maid, \"If any fisherman show up, I'll shoo them away with a staff. Please take your time, Miss Lucina.\" Lucina thanked the young maid and removed her from her shoulder. She looked around for a bit before disrobing herself and stepping into the lake, the maid grabbing Lucina's undergarments and dragging them atop one another, folding them as she overlayed them. Lucina dived under to get her whole body wet and shook the water from her hair, feeling absolutely refreshed to get the stench of sea air and Risen off of her. She moved under the waterfall and closed her eyes as she ran her fingers through her hair, cleansing all the salt from it and removing the knots from her hair. She hummed an upbeat tune Sumia used to sing her to sleep with and gyrated her body under the waterfall, rubbing her hands across her body to fully clean it, she truly felt in touch with nature as the birds sang in her ears and the water ran over her body, a small rainbow even entered her field of vision; the maid watched from the shore and couldn't help but feel mesmerized by the young princess' catchy tune and dance.</span></div></div>",

Even with the maid watching her back, there was no guarantee someone would not be able to escape the maid's notice, especially at the distance from which Lucina could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder if anyone else has ever been in my situation. Lucina thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Gerome's \"pep talk\", she was less conscious of her body now than she was yesterday, but she still did not want others gawking at her, regardless of whether  they thought she was a sea monster or a beautiful woman, though naturally she would prefer people think the second rather than the first. But then if even Maribelle's kids were able to see her as a human being, their was hope yet. Those sailors were possible a particular loutish lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough perhaps Gerome looking that way would not feel so bad either....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look at the late, Lucina was relieved to see how clear it was. She had indeed lucked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she cleaned herself, she wondered how Tiki and Say'ri were doing. Presumably they had a smoother than she did? Though surely a full dragon crossing the skies must have been cause for alarm. But in her advanced age, Tiki must have come up with a way to manage unwanted attention. Lucina would have to ask her how. She wondered if the two of them had got involved in any adventures. Lucina suddenly bolted up. How was Tiki and Say'ri going to find her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki flew high in the sky, almost reaching the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tiki why are we so high up?\"  Say'ri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To avoid unwanted attention.\" Tiki said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, that makes a lot of sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind the journey, it may be quite boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay'ri smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate being able to talk with you. Not everyday needs to be an excitement filled adventure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay'ri's grip suddenly tightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just realized... if we get separated from Lucina, how are we going to find her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki remained calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would expect it to be easy to track a giant girl, but failing that I'm sure their will be rumors abound the second anyone sees here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina wanted to relax and enjoy her \"bath\", but having to keep an eye open meant she fully couldn't her wash. She decided not to tarry anylonger and finish cleaning herself as quickly as possible.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dot the i's. Cross the t's. Write neatly and clearly. These were the rules Maribelle followed when writing up her shipment logs for her family's wine brand. Her shared brand with Robin, \"Winery Emblem\", had won the hearts of nobility all across the world, its rich flavor being sampled in high-class taverns, noble weddings, and royal feasts, and the popularity had turned Robin and Maribelle into celebrities almost overnight. When asked about the secret to its exquisite flavor, Robin only responded \"Hard work and a lot of love\"; now if only he could have a better explanation for the name than \"I thought it'd be funny if we named it after the Fire Emblem\". Maribelle sacrificed her legislature study to work hard on the paperwork for orders, logbooks, and sales charts, and Robin worked hard in harvesting the grapes and making the wine, giving up almost all his free time; even so, the couple managed to always make time for their beloved children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle was carefully writing into a final box on her spreadsheet, adjusting her reading spectacles, when Minerva's loud roar rang through the outside air, causing Maribelle to scribble wildly and ruin the sheet she tirelessly worked on for the past 20 minutes. She threw her quill pen up into the air, removed her spectacles, and banged on the desk, she felt like she could deal with Lucina's size and Gerome's antisocial behavior with enough work, but if she had to hear Minerva's roars one more time, she was going to flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't that Gerome train that dragon to act properly around company?!\" Maribelle cried, grinding her teeth together. A butler knocked on the door, beckoning for his master, and Maribelle couldn't help but flip out at that too. \"What now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me Madame,\" spoke the butler politely, \"But there is a woman at the door claiming to be Lady Tiki, the Voice of Naga from Valm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Tiki?\"</i> thought Maribelle, <i>\"Could she be here to see Lucina?\"</i> Maribelle thought it strange for Tiki to be visiting all the way from Valm, but she figured it'd help Lucina faster, and get Minerva out of her hair faster by extension, so she jumped at the chance to speed up Lucina's care. \"All right, thank you. I will see to their company immediately.\" Maribelle opened the door to her study and walked out, moving down the halls into the parlor, facing the large regal door, hearing a weak knocking sound and what sounded like panting from behind the door. Maribelle opened the door with a small steel handle and came face-to-face with Tiki, panting like a dog, gasping for air, and sweating profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...Day, Maribelle...\" Tiki spoke, wheezing at her pauses. \"Is...Lucina here...?\" Maribelle was concerned for Tiki's health, it's not every day the strong, stoic Voice of Naga was reduced to looking like she ran a marathon, even in the heat of battle she always looked calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tiki, are you alright?\" inquired Maribelle, worried for her former Shepherd comrade. \"Can I get you a glass of water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Can we just please come in?!\" spoke another voice from outside the mansion. Maribelle came outside to look for the voice's source and found Say'ri, completely nude, covering her body with her hands, ducked behind a large bush. The woman's face was tomato red and she definitely looked larger, about 15 feet tall by Maribelle's estimate. \"A-And no men!\" spoke Say'ri in a girlish tone, \"N-Nobody can see me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods!\" Maribelle cried, pinching the bridge of her nose, making an annoyed expression; she looked ready to have an aneurysm at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are...You complaining about?\" Tiki coughed out, panting and gasping for air at her pauses, \"You...Didn't have to...Carry her all...The way here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle shooed away all the butlers and the two further guests entered the mansion; Say'ri stood tall at her full 15 foot height and covered her privates, looking around erratically for any peeping men, Tiki collapsed into a plush chair and began fanning herself heavily with a regal hand fan at the chair's side table. Maribelle took a deep breath, purifying any urge to scream and start hitting things with her parasol from her system, and spoke as calm as possible to her new guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, enlighten me. How did this happen?\" she spoke in a passive-aggressive tone. \"No, no, don't tell me; it was a meteor, from space, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...\" responded Say'ri, stuttering as she kept looking around and wriggled her body. \"W-We inspected the m-m-meteors in W-Wyvern Valley, a-and it m-made me like th-this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's unfair,\" interjected a now-relaxed Tiki, \"I broke the chunk off, I should've gotten big instead!\" Tiki felt her dreams of eating all the meat, sweets, and ale with no stomachache or hangovers leave her mind and it left her heartbroken. \"And the rock doesn't even reactivate as we fly it over the ocean either; absolutely perfect.\" Say'ri looked erratically for cover and focused on a large red and gold curtain covering a window, she started towards it, intending to tear it down and turn it into a makeshift dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU TOUCH THAT AND YOU'RE LOSING YOUR ARMS!\" yelled Maribelle, causing the Chon'sin warrior to freeze in place out of fear. She took more deep breaths and faced Tiki, continuing her thoughts on the matter. \"And why, pray tell, have you bought this rock here? To make more giants? To send me to an asylum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you,\" spoke Tiki, fanning herself less, \"It ran out of power. I used my Dragonstone to take a small chunk off the larger rock and Say'ri caught it, then she grew big and burst right out of her clothes after it glowed a bright green.\" Say'ri collapsed to her knees, embarrassed at Tiki's words, and hugged herself tighter as if to cover herself better. \"After that, it became an obsidian rock and it wouldn't activate again, even for the whole day we carried it across the ocean. From this we can summarize that the meteor triggers growth based on the size of the stone and that it only triggers growth once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you keep that thing far away from me, I don't care what you do with it.\" chimed Maribelle. \"But I must ask, why take a stone that doesn't function with you across the ocean? What is the point of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually why we wanted to see Lucina.\" answered Tiki. \"I don't want to get her hopes up, but if Naga's power can modify this rock, we could forge it into a new stone to allow users to shift sizes, like Dragonstones and Beaststones.\" By this point, Tiki put the fan down. \"I felt bad about fibbing to her, so I wanted to check in on her as well, but I don't know whether or not to tell her about our back-up plan yet. Minerva's roars had guided us to this mansion actually, thankfully too, I would've collapsed to hold Say'ri's new size if we flew all the way to Mount Prism without rest.\" Maribelle was surprised at Minerva's ability to sense Tiki and use sonar, perhaps she was smarter than she gave her credit for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this rock? Where is it exactly?\" inquired Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outside, in a hollow tree.\" answered Tiki. \"I hid it so nobody would steal it, if one had the urge. I won't lose track of it.\" Tiki got up and directly faced Maribelle. \"You wouldn't mind if we spend the night here, would you?\" Maribelle's eye twitched at the prospect of two more guests to look after and feed, but she shook off the oncoming tantrum she was about ready to throw and cleared her throat, addressing Tiki with grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be my honor, Lady Tiki...\" Maribelle said, bowing to the Voice of Naga. She then turned to Say'ri, still covering herself on the floor, and spoke with a less graceful tone. \"You on the other hand!\" Maribelle walked to the stairwell and rang a bell, calling out for some maids to assist her. On cue, three maids came down the stairs, slowing their movement to gawk at Say'ri for a minute before facing their master. Maribelle faced the maids and pointed at Say'ri, and on command, the three women grabbed her arms and helped lift her off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is this?!\" Say'ri said, confused and flustered by the three pint-sized women holding onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen here,\" spoke Maribelle, almost like a drill sergeant, \"I won't tolerate anyone, be it man or woman, walking around my manor completely nude! You are to be seen to the fitting room immediately and my tailors will prepare a new outfit for you to wear on your journey to Mount Prism! I do not wish to waste fine cloth, so state your favorite colors, designs, and style of dress when you enter the room immediately, and absolutely no changing your answers! You will be bought to a guest room for your meals with the blinds shut, and so help me gods, if I find you wrapping any of my sheets around yourself to freely walk around the mansion with, not even a staff will be able to cure the hell I will unload onto you!\" Maribelle clapped her hands together and the three maids began to drag Say'ri down the hall past Tiki and Maribelle towards the fitting room; the young princess' face turned bright red and she struggled to keep up as the maids drug her down the hall, her feet almost breaking into a run and her footsteps being audible throughout the manor's interior. Tiki turned towards Maribelle after watching the scene unfold and coughed, as if to draw attention to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, wouldn't happen to have any fried apples, would you?\" asked the manakete. Maribelle wished she had a pillow to yell into, but she tried to keep her frustration in as much as possible, not looking to deny the request of another she called friend during the marches against Valm and Grima; she beckoned Tiki to follow her as they entered the kitchen, Tiki ready to raid the pantry.</span></div></div>",

Maribelle somehow managed to wait until she was out of site of Tiki before she shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That woman....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon reached her husband and Gerome, both taking a short break from work. Robin was certainly surprised to hear of Tiki and Say'ri, but had no trouble remaining calm.  Maribelle couldn't help but admire that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose this is nothing compared to our war or struggle against Grima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome however was crabby as always.

We have to get rid of those stones Wyvern valley will be overrun with gigantic dragons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually the stones did not affect Tiki when she was in her dragonic form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and Gerome relaxed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is relief.\" Robin said. \"I suppose Tiki can dispose of them once she returns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome frowned, though it was hard to separate from his usual expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or she'll just make herself gigantic so she can eat endlessly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribele almost chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told Lady Tiki that if she did that, it would only make her meals seem that much smaller by proportion. I hope she got the message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't count on it.\" Gerome said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked up from his thoughts, now looking focused and determined. A part of Maribelle shivered happily when she saw him that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our first priorty should be ensuring the giants stay safe. At their size they could easily attract unwanted attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that already!\" Gerome snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin ignored that outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, we need to try and understand these stones and find a way to counteract their magic. If they truly are from space, their may be no record of them and its possible no earthly magic will be able to counteract them. However it's more than likely that in this planet's long history, their is some myth of legend alluding to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle hung Robin's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound's like a good plan, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I should get to work.

Maribelle had kept the information about the possible shrinking stone from Robin and Gerome since Tiki herself wavered on telling Lucina, however, Lucina might think something's up if Tiki came to visit, the girl wasn't as blissfully ignorant as her sister, Maribelle even felt Gerome might've pieced some information together already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin,\" whispered Maribelle as the footsteps drew closer, \"What should I do about Lady Tiki?\" Maribelle thought hard about how to handle this, there was a high chance that Tiki's appearance would end in hurting the young woman's feelings, she didn't want to give Lucina any false hopes or sorrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Discuss it with her first, and if she chooses to see Lucina, then we'll play it off like a gourmet tour.\" Robin was fully aware all the Shepherds knew of Tiki's love of dining from the countless dinners they shared together as well as the way her mouth watered when she talked of the sweets she sampled at the Hero King Marth's side, it wouldn't be rare for her to go off looking for new cuisine. Robin turned towards Gerome to ask a request; \"I know you love Lucina, but can you not tell her about Tiki if she doesn't come out? I don't want the thought of further meteors to get her upset.\" Gerome knew Robin's heart was in the right place, he treated all his comrades like family, and he would hate to see a close friend upset for any reason; as much as he wanted to tell Lucina to help her, Gerome had to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he said begrudgingly before turning to Maribelle, \"But I expect Tiki to do the right thing.\" Maribelle nodded and went back inside to discuss the matter with Tiki, as soon as she closed the back door, Lucina had arrived in the vineyard and faced the two men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello boys,\" said the woman with a smile on her face, feeling refreshed and looking radiant from her wash, \"Reached a break in your work?\" Lucina grabbed the maid from her shoulder and let her to the ground, the woman bowed in return and entered the mansion to continue her duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Gerome, \"We were in the middle of discussing a plan to sneak you into Ylisstol.\" This was a fib, but not fully a lie, Robin and Gerome had indeed begun discussing about sneaking Lucina into Ylisstol before Maribelle had come out to talk about Tiki, albeit for a short while. Lucina beamed with glee from Gerome's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" she cried while clasping her hands together, \"Mother's library is an extensive collection of legends &amp; fables and Father's words could encourage me through any situation, they're sure to help us! Thank you Robin, and thank Maribelle too for letting us stay here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks Lucina,\" Robin said scratching the back of his head, \"I'd do anything to help a good friend in need!\" He gave Lucina a few bunches of grapes as a snack and beckoned her and Gerome to a small table on a backyard patio; on it lay a game board and a couple chess pieces, a map of Ylisstol overlayed the board's face. Robin and Gerome sat while Lucina laid down on her stomach to get a clear view of the table, she began to pop the grapes into her mouth as Robin started. \"We'll use this to help plan our route. These pieces represent us.\" He took a White Bishop, Knight, and Queen and placed them at the edge of Ylisstol, before sliding another Bishop to the side. \"This one represents Maribelle, in case she's not busy enough to help us out. We'll start at this postion here and swing into the back of the city, before moving into the theater district.\" Robin became more in-depth in his explanation and begun moving various pieces around, Black Pawns and Rooks to simulate Ylisstol gaurds, as he went over the plan; even though the job of a tactician was to put 100% focus into the plan ahead, Robin couldn't help but let his mind wander to Tiki and Say'ri's presence within the mansion, hoping nothing was going wrong and Maribelle wouldn't flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay'ri had been blown away by the sheer size of the fitting room, even at her Amazonian stature, her head barely touched the high ceiling and various closets and cabinets were distantly placed from one another. She was put behind a privacy screen, but it could only cover her lower half, and some of the tailors were male, so she turned her chest towards a wall to remain decent, even though the male tailors could care less at the sight of a naked woman. Several maids had gathered around Say'ri, some standing atop ladders, and begun taking various measurements of her body; the young woman blushed and squealed as she felt the maids wrapping tape around her body and the cold strips touch her smooth, sensitive skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Favorite colors?\" spoke a male tailor, a slight accent in his voice. Say'ri was alarmed by his sharp tone and loud voice, the man was clearly a professionalist, and his direct inquiry with no prior small talk had caught her off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um, p-purple and lavender...\" answered Say'ri, completely flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Favorite designs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Flowers are nice, an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Style of choice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Wha?! B-But I-\" Say'ri had no time to answer as he clapped his hands, beckoning the maids to come over. He took a chart of measurements from them and glanced over it quickly before clapping his hands once more and beckoning his fellow tailors to work; his expression clearly showed he knew what he was doing and was a born leader. Say'ri looked on in awe as she saw the synchronization of all the tailors, almost like bees, gathering the various cloths, cutting the material they needed, and sewing material with such precision; either she was around true professionals or completely crazy people. She ducked behind the curtain, overwhelmed by the site, and curled up into a fetal position. <i>\"Someone get me out of this crazy mansion!\"</i> was the one thought that ran through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's the plan.\" Robin had finished up with his explanation and successfully moved the four pieces into the center of the castle next to a King and Queen, representing Chrom and Sumia. Lucina and Gerome were in awe with Robin's strategy, it just seemed too perfect to go wrong, there were no flaws or do-overs in his moves; the man had a natural talent for battle plans and Validar would've wasted it on resurrecting Grima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...Perfect.\" complimented Gerome, mouth still agape at Robin's plans and suggestions. He was especially amazed at the thought of using fireworks and theater props to dress up Lucina like a float to simulate a parade and break right into the front gates of Castle Ylisstol right in front of the unsuspecting population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like they never knew a giant maiden was there!\" Lucina absolutely fell in love with the plan, but still had one hang-up on it; the Black Knight, simulating Cynthia, surrounded by Pawns of Pegasus Knights. \"But Cynthia and I share a strong sisterly bond, she'll know that I'll be there. She will feel it in the Mark of Naga upon her back.\" Any other tactician would pass that off as hogwash, but Robin could feel Validar's influence run through his blood in the past and there were times where Robin felt like Chrom was his right arm; the ties of family blood and true friendship ran deeper than one would think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point there,\" replied Robin, \"We'll have to have a distraction to keep her busy.\" Robin fumbled at the thought, there was one distraction he had in mind, Tiki in her dragon form taking to the skies to alert the Pegasus Knights and lead them away, but that would require her presence to be made known to Lucina beforehand, and the plan could most certainly fail if the threat of more meteorites caused Lucina's heart to waver and her emotions to overwhelm her. Perhaps he could use a troop of butlers disguised as brigands? No, no, that would cause them to get hurt, he needed another disguise to minimize the threat to all his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, it's a good plan, despite the wall Cynthia presents.\" complimented Lucina, \"When will this take place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight.\" answered Robin, \"I wish you two could stay the night longer, but you wish for a quick cure Lucina, and I intend to deliver you one. Besides, I think Maribelle's going a little crazy with all that's been going on.\" Robin giggled a bit, it was cruel of him, but the thought of his wife running ragged over the slightest issues to trigger her OCD tendencies always made him laugh, it was the most attractive feature of her he had always thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" answered Gerome, \"Minerva wishes to stretch her wings anyways instead of being cooped up in a stable all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" added in Lucina, who began to stand from her position, \"I wish to see Father and Mother as soon as possible anyways, I do miss their company a little.\" Lucina resolved to leave the two alone after the war on Grima in order not to mess with the timeline further, but the other children of the future were totally fine with not returning to their period and quickly adapted to the past, Brady, and Owain especially, the former becoming a pro violinist in Ylisse, the latter becoming an experienced stage actor and expecting a child with Severa; Lucina couldn't help but feel a little jealous of her baby self getting to spend time with Chrom, Sumia, and even Cynthia more than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled then.\" Robin said, taking a sip from a teacup next to the board. He set it down and got up before looking at the couple in front of him. \"Operation: 'Firework Emblem' begins tonight!\" Robin expected a good reaction from his thought up name, but both Lucina and Gerome just looked at him funny; it may have been the lamest thing the two had ever heard the star tactician say.</span></div></div>",

It took you long than I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tiki began to explain, Gerome stood behind Lucina, miming something to  he formed a circle shape with his end to fingers and made an x with his hands, hoping Tiki would get the hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came through Wyvern Valley and Say'ri picked up on of those rocks and ended up a giant as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Gerome's palm hitting his head filled the air. Lucina cast her husband an odd look. Robin sighed glancing at Tiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing Maribelle didn't catch up to you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door flung open and Maribelle came running after Tiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tiki there you are! You mustn't tell Lucina that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina coughed and glowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle looked aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Lucina, we didn't want to add to your worries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a big girl, you don't need to keep anything from me. You shouldn't be keeping anything from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome flinched, but said nothing. Tiki frowned at the drama she had unwittingly caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry I did not know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin placed a hand on Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina don't take this persoanlly, we didn't want you worrying about the stones in the valley when we were still trying to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina was not satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I should worry! When we get back our home is going to be overun with giant dragons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki folded her arms, still disapointed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually those stones dont work on dragons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina was still tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is well,  but what if some villager wonders into the valley and suffers what I have? Or worse, one of those stones falls into the wrong hands?\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin however, was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we devise a cure for you it should be easy enough to cure anyone else affected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF you manage to do so. We're not even sure this can be reversed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't start thinking like that Lucina, it's too early to start losing hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not, I am merely trying to be realistic about the troubles we will face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wyvern Valley is a remote mountain range,  it is highly likely anyone will just wonder into it.

It's true that giant humans paled in comparison to Grima on the threat scale to this world, but the thought of an innocent villager having their life changed by the rocks or a large brigand bringing terror to local villagers still ate up at her. \"But we are to immediately work on disposal of these rocks as soon as this adventure for the shrinking elixir ends. Even if I return to normal, I want nobody else to have to deal with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Lucina,\" chimed in Robin, \"We didn't mean to get you upset, sorry for trying to hide this from you.\" Robin took his signature Plegian coat from a rack on the patio and adjusted it over his upper body, a sign that the work day was over. \"Shall we move inside to prepare for tonight? We should stock up on supplies for the operation and say goodbye to Brady and Morgan.\" Robin began walking around the side yard to the front door of the mansion, Lucina and Gerome trailing behind him. \"You know,\" Robin started, trying to lighten the mood, \"Brady's going to miss you when you get back to normal Lucina, he'll be asking 'What happened to the giant lady?' when he learns to talk!\" Robin's little joke worked as Lucina giggled at his comment, Gerome even cracking a smile; from behind the joyful trio, Maribelle and Tiki had stayed behind for a private conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you aren't great at breaking news to people,\" commented Maribelle, \"But at least you didn't tell Lucina about your little 'Giantstone' project. The poor girl would've been in tears after all she had to go through to get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, evidently my people skills aren't good, but I won't tell Lucina about this until I find her a real cure, and I won't rest until there is one. I'm skeptical about this 'shrinking elixir' myself, but if anyone can truly cure Lucina's condition, it's Naga.\" Maribelle smiled at Tiki's resolve and the two moved to rejoin the other three Shepherds; Maribelle couldn't help but think how dense Tiki was for such a strong, brilliant, and deep Voice of the Divine Dragon, but it was without question that she was one of the kindest people this world has ever seen. \"And Maribelle? Can I take some snacks for the road? Like a turkey or two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She certainly has a one-track mind...\"</i> Maribelle had thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five comrades gathered together in the manor, Robin and Gerome had gone around gathering materials for the trip, Tiki raided the kitchen, and Maribelle helped Lucina adjust her clothes to provide minimum attention-grabbing and maximum movement; Robin's plan involved dressing Lucina like a parade float, so she figured the jungle accessories over the swimsuit-like attire could easily pass her off as a giant dancer effigy. Everyone had fully gathered in the parlor, a few butlers and maids gathering alongside the quintet, intending to help their masters and guests in their journey to Ylisstol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tiki,\" started Robin, \"It's rude of me to ask, but will you accompany us on our journey to Ylisstol? I think you'd be a big help to our plan if you could manage it.\" Tiki moved her hand to her chin for a few seconds, internally weighing her options, before answering Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, anything to help my good friends out.\" Everyone was thrilled with Tiki's answer and equally flattered by her declaration of friendship. Tiki had figured she could easily depart from Ylisstol, double back to Themis, grab the stone, and go see Naga with nobody prying into her secret plan, the only problem lying in carrying Say'ri around without raising alarms or passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Say'ri?\" asked Gerome, \"She came with you, did she not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's currently in fitting,\" replied Tiki, \"I don't know how long that'll go over, I don't think she can join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, that's quite alright...\" spoke Say'ri's voice from down the hall, alarming everyone to turn to her direction. The young woman had come out from her fitting accompanied by a team of tailors and maids, towering over them three times their body size and her face completely red. She wore a large, stunning Victorian ball gown in the colors of purple, lavender, white, and gold, her arms were covered by radiant silk white gloves, white roses decorated the lining of her dress, and a large purple headband adorned her jet black hair. The party couldn't help but stare at Say'ri's elegant dress and admire how well she wore it, but Say'ri only looked completely embarrassed and urged everyone to stop looking at her, she still wasn't adjusted to her size or attire. Maribelle gave a smug look and addressed the Chon'sin Amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look positively dashing, darling!\" Maribelle gave a audible chuckle before continuing her talk with Say'ri. \"You're surprised at the speed you came out of there, yes? I hired only the finest tailors in Themis, many of whom had served my family in the past, their work in dress-making is unchallenged, both in quality and speed! Yes dear Say'ri, you truly look like the princess you are! How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Say'ri replied, still blushing, \"It's a beautiful dress, it's just...I preferred the kimonos and warrior attire of my homeland...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now!\" shouted Maribelle, \"You did tell them your preferences, did you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\" replied Say'ri, once again shaken by Maribelle's words. \"I tried to tell them, but they got to work immediately as they got my measurements! I had no opportunity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. They must do things differently in Valm.\" Maribelle walked up to Say'ri and dismissed the maids and tailors, she looked straight up into the blushing woman's eyes. \"Once we get Lucina a remedy for her size, then I'll give you only the finest Themis etiquette lessons I can muster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look very beautiful Say'ri,\" spoke Lucina, \"I wish I could've worn a dress like that in the future.\" Say'ri smiled at the Ylissean princess' warm words as Maribelle smugly laughed, taking Lucina's compliment to Say'ri as if it were meant for her and her staff. \"Will you join us on our journey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be my honor Lucina,\" Say'ri responded with a bow, albeit stiff with presence of a corset, \"We're both in this together now, quite literally in fact.\" With the formalities settled, Robin and Maribelle retreated upstairs to kiss their children goodbye while Lucina, Gerome, Tiki, and Say'ri went outside with the caravan of maids and butlers to wait for the couple, Gerome petting Minerva and mounting her when control was returned to him from the stable butlers. When Robin and Maribelle joined the party, they all set out in a march towards Ylisstol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night had fallen when the group arrived, just as Robin had planned for, and they all stood from a Cliffside, looking down at the brightly-lit city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father and Mother are inside, I can just feel it.\" Lucina truly did feel a sensation in her left eye to indicate Chrom's presence, like a radar, and knew Sumia was close behind like the faithful and loving wife she was. She squinted her eyes and saw a few black silhouettes in the distance soaring around the exalt's castle; the Pegasus Knights, lead by Cynthia, who had received the position from Cordelia when she had taken leave to Regna Ferox to live with Lon'qu. Lucina's eye twitched at sight of Cynthia's patrol as she felt her presence, and deeper down, she could even feel the presence of her baby self and Owain in the city, since the latter had a birthmark as well upon his arm; Lucina had felt one more presence of her bloodline in Owain's viscinity, could it be the child Severa was pregnant with? Now aware of Owain's presence, Lucina had now thought Lissa could be in the city as well, her not being as strong to detect since she had no mark; usually Lissa was farming out of town with her husband, Donnel, and her mother-in-law, but the three were free to make trips to the castle when they came to the farmer's market in town, and Lissa took that completely for granted to mess with her brother and sample the luxury food she used to enjoy. Lucina kneeled down and faced Robin to relay the information to him; \"I can sense Father and Cynthia's presence, but I can feel Owain in the city as well, near the theater district. There is one more in the area too, I think it may be Owain and Severa's child, though she's still pregnant. Aunt Lissa could be here as well, be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Lucina, I'll keep that in mind.\" responded Robin. He looked at the city for a bit, thinking of how to handle the new intel, before turning to the group. \"Okay everyone, we're going to have two teams take charge of this operation. Lucina will be the captain of Team A, who will work on bringing her into the theater district to dress her up. Tiki will be the captain of Team B, tasked with distracting the Pegasus Knights and leading them out of the city. Team A will be a couple ground units to simulate a parade, Team B will be a few Pegasus Riders and another flying mount rider as a co-captain. By this logic, I and Say'ri will be a part of Team A, but we're going to need a co-captain for Team B.\" Robin looked at Gerome &amp; Minerva and turned to Maribelle and her black Pegasus; both riders flew with their mount as one and cared for them with equal amounts of love and care, both were more than suited to help Tiki ride through the skies, but both could easily compliment the show they'll put on in main street. \"Gerome, Maribelle, I'm going to need one of you to help Tiki distract the Pegasus Knights. Could one of you help her divert Cynthia's attention from Lucina?\"</span></div></div>",

We're on patro-o-ol~!\" Cynthia flew through the skies with her squadron of Pegasus Knights in her stead, happy to feel the wind through her blue pigtails and even happier to guard her family and her home alongside Ylisstol's best. She had practiced her skill every day in the future, with the Shepherds, and after Grima's defeat, she wanted nothing more than to be a hero that'd make her mother proud, and while Sumia insisted that Cynthia had already made her proud, Cynthia always wanted to go one step beyond, to protect all important to her; Chrom, Sumia, Lissa, Brady, and most importantly, her beloved sister Lucina. The other Knights had thought her a klutz and a crazy person with all her fighting poses and theme tunes she sang, but they couldn't doubt Cynthia's raw skill and bravery, and they all looked up to their captain with complete admiration. The girl happily looked upon her beloved city to watch for any intruders, when a Knight came up at her starboard to give a report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain!\" he spoke with utmost respect and a powerful voice. \"A black wyvern approaches, a masked hoodlum rides it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Masked?\"</i> thought Cynthia, <i>\"I only know one masked wyvern rider, and that's...\"</i> She looked dead ahead and saw a man with burnt orange hair riding upon a black wyvern at a high speed towards them, his mask came into view as he slowed his charge. \"Gerome!\" Cynthia happily flew towards her brother-in-law with her Knights in tow, concerned for their captain's safety. \"It's alright guys, Gerome's family, you can stand down!\" Cynthia lurched forward for a moment to pull Gerome in for a hug. \"Oh Gerome, it's been forever! It must've been a <i>whole 2 weeks</i> since I went to Valm! How is Lucina doing anyways? Any new stories to share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that,\" Gerome responded, \"I've been meaning to ask you; are there any other secrets you wish to tell Lucina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you heard about the doll thing, huh?\" Cynthia just giggled at Gerome's annoyed expression. \"I couldn't help it, it was just such a cute little love story to tell your kids!\" Gerome coughed and blushed, he hadn't even thought about kids with Lucina yet, he had to nail this distraction quickly before Cynthia gets more embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Cynthia, I've come to help you run...\" Gerome sighed as he tried to choke the words out, \"...'Hero Training' at Chrom's request. There's a group of Pegasus Knights accompanying me and our task is to hunt down a dragon in the area and haul it in for capture.\" Gerome hoped Cynthia would buy it, she had never seen Maribelle's staff before, so his ruse could easily get past her, and by the time she realizes the dragon was Tiki and everything was a trick, Lucina will already be in the castle. Gerome sweat as Cynthia rubbed her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father really said that? But I've been showing him all my newest tricks, spears, and fighting poses...\" Cynthia wasn't buying it. \"I dunno Gerome, I think I'm just gonna check with Father real quick about this...\" She prepared her reins to make a descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll do a set of poses with you!\" Cynthia stopped her movement and stared at Gerome. \"I-If you run this exercise, I'll...Help you with your hero poses...\" Gerome felt sick at the thought of saying it. <i>\"Anything for Lucina,\"</i> he thought, <i>\"I just have to buy her some time...\"</i> Cynthia's eyes lit up and she let out a squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The return of the Dragon Hero Gerome?!\" she cried. \"Ah, the Justice Cabal is complete again! Yes, yes! Let's go get a dragon!\" Cynthia turned to her men and gave the order: \"Everyone, our Exalt has ordered us to capture a dragon with Gerome's help! This will build bonds and skills between you and your Pegasi! Now men, let's go bag us a dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Captain!\" shouted the platoon of riders. Gerome pointed towards the woods far from Ylisstol and Cynthia excitedly led the troop towards the designated area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The things I do for love...\"</i> thought Gerome, as he rubbed his hand against his forehead. He beckoned Minerva to follow the Knights and they soared through the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe theater district was relatively empty, devoid of an audience with no plays to be run. In a large run-down theater, the couple of Owain and Severa were hard at work trying to get the place up and running again; the two had received permission and a loan from Chrom to re-open an old, famous theater to begin a family troupe in, hoping the shows could drive up the morale of the people and tourism. Owain hammered at nails and painted old sets with vibrant pastels, shouting lines and making poses on the spot as he worked, Severa sat down in a seat usually reserved for audience members, a medium-sized bulge in her stomach signifying her 4 months of pregnancy. Severa watched her husband's one-man show and scoffed at his antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" started the raven-haired beauty, \"If you worked as much as you played, we'd be done with this dump by now.\" Severa moved a hand to her stomach and rubbed it tenderly. \"Think: What will Ophelia think when she sees her father is more of a kid than she will be?\" Owain merely chuckled and struck another eccentric pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Severa,\" spoke the brown-haired youth, \"I'm merely practicing for when we open this theater! It is our duty, as heroes of the future, to bring smiles and instill bravery in the hearts of men and women everywhere, and I wish for Ophelia to see our noble deeds and grow from it!\" He took a knee and pumped his fist down, as if to look deep. \"She is, 'The Chosen One'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay crazy.\" retorted Severa, not impressed with Owain's display. \"And explain to me this 'Chosen One' role? Is it going to make her a successful child? Give her friends? Make her, you know, <i>normal</i>?\" Owain took a normal stance and actually spoke his thoughts normally for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking we should train her to be a professional Dark Mage so she could use magic in our shows, it'd really wow the other kids and make her a lot of friends! We could get Henry to train her so she could learn about animals too, and she could use his nature talk to grow up and be a doctor too! You know, just in case she wants more than the Family Troupe.\" Severa huffed at Owain's remarks, she didn't want to admit it, but he did make sense, even if he suggested Henry as a teacher; it was a cold day in hell when <i>Henry</i> sounded like a desirable teacher. Owain looked a little sad at his wife's face and tried to get her in a good mood. \"I didn't mean to get you upset...Here, let's do this: Give me a scenario and I'll act it out, it'll help the writing and feel of our shows we put on!\" Severa sighed at the childish suggestion, she couldn't get what she found so cute and attractive about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Bears.\" she said curtly. Owain took a deep breath and took a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel, foul beast! Your terror to the local hunters and villagers ends here! May your pelt lay at the cold end of my steel! BUUURNING BLADE!!!\" Owain looked absolutely ecstatic. \"Quick, give me another!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Risen.\" responded Severa, now paying more attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corpses of the Damned! May you return to your eternal slumber as the dark power escapes from your veins! The light of my blade paints an arc across the ether! RADIANT DAAAAWN!!!\" Owain was completely jazzed up now. \"Another, something unexpected!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Giant Lucina?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, nice suggestion, and nice feeling! Woe is me, my beloved cousin now a colossal puppet of my sworn evil enemy! Fear not, brave Lucina! I will free you from your curse! ILLUSORY REVELA-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawds, you blockhead! Look behind you!\" Severa yelled as she pointed past Owain. He looked past the set props he was painting and saw Lucina trying to crawl behind a background, 60 feet tall and barely covered by the pastel sky and trees; Owain leapt back with a yell and fell off the stage, almost taking the expression \"break a leg\" seriously. Robin, Maribelle, and Say'ri poked their heads out from behind a wooden bush and saw the two future children staring at Lucina, mouths agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops,\" said Robin, \"I, uh, thought this theater was empty. Sorry Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, forgive me Robin,\" retorted Lucina, \"I got a little charged up and didn't notice Owain's presence. My fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey!\" Severa said while snapping her fingers, Owain shuddering next to her legs, \"Can someone explain to us what the hell is going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to explain the situation, even with Lucina's cliffnotes, but Severa and Owain got it quite well, and the two had managed to calm down well enough at the sight of their giant, half-nude comrade and the Amazonian Say'ri. A light had glimmered in Owain's eyes at the mention of size-enhancing meteors, as he thought aloud it'd be neat to get his hands on some; Lucina had verbally reprimanded him for even thinking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me get this straight: there's these space rocks making people huge and you're looking for a legendary cure?\" Owain was taking notes on a pad, looking to make it a scenario for a play. \"And you want to borrow our props to make a float out of your huge body? To sneak into the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" responded Lucina, \"I don't wish to impose on you both, but is there any way you can help us?\" Owain had gotten fired up at Lucina's question and broke his pencil in half with his fingers, striking a pose to express his supercharged state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear cousin, you may have our sacred family props, passed down through generations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" responded Lucina, clasping her hands together, \"Thank you Owa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But on one condition! In exchange for our sacred sequins, our consecrated cloths, our shimmering streamers, our-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spit it out dear! We're busy!\" shouted Maribelle, tiring of her best friend's son's antics. Her outburst had thrown off everyone, even Severa, who wasn't easily fazed by words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right, Auntie Maribelle...\" responded Owain dejectedly. He twiddled his thumbs together and spoke softly. \"If it's alright with you Lucina...\"</span></div></div>",

You guys have a float bed already prepared, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" responded Lucina, \"It's out in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'll meet you guys out there!\" With that, Owain dashed off, charging with an energy as if he were leading the charge in a war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina's group waited outside with Maribelle's servants and the float bed, making themselves comfy and chatting all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Severa,\" began Lucina, \"Forgive me for prying, but how long have you been carrying Owain's child?\" The mercenary blushed and put one hand to her stomach, stroking her raven pigtail with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four months.\" responded Severa. \"It was right after we defeated Grima, we had that huge party afterwards, Owain gave me a ring to actually seal us being together, and things just sort of...happened in the tents.\" She gave a warm smile, a rarity for the usually sour girl. \"They're saying it'll be a girl, Owain decided on 'Ophelia' for a name; I honestly thought he'd call her 'Darksworn Bloodmane' or something stupid like that.\" Lucina gave a chuckle, it definitely sounded like a name that screamed \"Owain's Child\". \"I think we'll be good parents. Well, at least I will. I'm looking forward to wrapping her in my arms, singing lullabies to her, and rubbing her cute face in Mom and Dad's faces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you two luck,\" responded Lucina with a smile, \"I have no doubt she'll be a beautiful child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you Luce?\" asked Severa. \"You and Gerome thinking about children yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's-!\" Lucina's face turned red and she pushed her fingers together, clearly embarrassed by the topic. She fumbled for an answer. \"I-It's just, we, uh, we've been taking things slowly for a while, we've just been so content with tending to the wyverns, the thought really hasn't crossed us yet!\" She calmed down a bit more and adopted more of a solemn expression. \"I think Gerome would be a great father, but what if I'm stuck like this? It'd make it much harder to...you know...\" Severa eyed up the princess before giving a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can see the problem in that. I mean I guess you could have a child if you put him in your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" shouted Maribelle, \"My ears scream at such unrefined speech! For the love of gods, please stop!\" Robin and Lucina blushed trying to remove Severa's mental image from their heads, and Say'ri looked almost ready to hurl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back!\" Owain ran out to the float to rejoin the party, carrying a cart of multi-colored cloths, long ribbons, and shiny decorations with him. His upbeat attitude clashed with the mood of the party before him. \"Uh, did something happen while I was gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, nothing Owain...\" Robin got up from the float bed and walked over to Owain, dusting off his coat and coughing the blush from his face. \"Let's see what you got here.\" Robin rummaged through the cart and grabbed all of Owain's decorations, admiring the texture of the cloth at hand and the luster of the metallic decorations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have only the best costumes and props at our disposal!\" remarked Owain, feeling pride in his tools. \"I've named them all individually to compliment our family's acting! What you hold is the Flannel of the Wolves; it's brilliant purple luster can only be complimented by the Shiny Sequins of Shiny Shine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods...\" remarked Maribelle, shaking her head with her hand to her face at Owain's childish dialogue. Robin ran his fingers across the cloth and inspected each decoration, smiling at the quality Owain's collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is perfect Owain!\" said Robin, very impressed by Owain's collection. \"These can easily dress Lucina up and compliment the show we'll put on; you're a natural stage talent!\" Owain blushed and rubbed the back of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks Robin, that's good to hear when we haven't even had our first show yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the type of show?\" inquired Severa. \"I'm assuming you'll want something to detract attention from Lucina's mass on the float?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were thinking magic to captivate the audience's attention.\" responded Robin. \"Both Maribelle and I are accomplished magicians, and some of our staff know some card and rope tricks that could impress an audience.\" Maribelle adopted a smug look, flattered by Robin's words, she couldn't see it with her eyes shut, but Severa was making a funny face to imitate Maribelle. Owain raised his hand to get Robin's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's fine,\" he asked, \"Could Severa and I put our own show on the schedule?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what is it?\" Owain took a huge breath and struck a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A drama of two young warriors, madly in love, as they travel the land to protect the innocents before them! It is dubbed: 'Owain Dark and Severa Light: Avengers of Righteous Justice'!\" The setup sounded very familiar to Robin, being a topic of he and Owain's talks in the Shepherd barracks. \"It's only a sneak preview for now, since we still need to get the theater up and running, and as the years go on, we're going to put Ophelia in the show once we reach the 'Children of the Future' arc.\" He jumped up on the float as he continued explaining the act. \"It will be a hero show put on with fake swords and a lot of heroic poses; I'll be playing myself, and playing Severa...\" Owain looked at the rest of the party for a moment, eyeing up some of the maids before stopping at Maribelle. \"Um, Auntie Maribelle? Would you be okay with playing Severa?\" Maribelle was taken back by Owain's words and expressed shock at the inquiry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Me?! Why not Severa?! She's in the play's name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" responded Severa, pointing at the bulge in her stomach, \"Baby on board? Hello? I won't be good to act in these things for another 5 or 6 months.\" Maribelle fumbled, trying to find an excuse not to perform in the play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But I've never held a sword in my life! Isn't Severa a mercenary?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" cheerfully responded Owain, \"I'll give you some quick practice! It's only just play anyways, not real fighting, so you won't have to take a battle stance or anything.\" Maribelle ran out of excuses, she lowered her head dejectedly, defeated by Owain. Robin came over and laid his hand upon her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry honey,\" spoke Robin softly and gently, \"I'm sure you'll be a great actor! Trust in Owain on this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to cry...\" complained Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could get these butlers and maids to play villagers, and Say'ri could be the demon terrorizing them!\" Now Say'ri looked shocked by Owain's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Me?!\" she cried, \"B-But why?! I've never acted before in my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be honest,\" responded Owain, \"It's because you're so big, but you still look like three people on top of one another, so you could easily play the villain role and hide in plain sight to boot.\" Say'ri looked flustered, this time it was Lucina to provide encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Say'ri, I bet you would make a great actor. I only wish I could see it instead of hearing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-If you insist...\" responded the Chon'sin warrior. \"B-But I don't think I can do the villain role to well, I've never done anything evil at all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be easy!\" encouraged Owain, \"Just do a lot of 'BWA HA HA!'s  and strike some poses too, but they need to be evil poses, ones that provoke fear into the hearts of men and women everywhere!\" Say'ri wasn't following Owain, she thought he may have become crazier than usual after the war on Grima. \"And we need some special effects, do you have anything for that Robin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some fireworks,\" he responded, \"And if you want, I can use some of my tomes to help give some more magical weight to your act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" he responded, \"Then let's get to decorating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, places everyone!\" shouted Severa, imitating a director. \"We need this thing to be perfect if you want to sneak your little giantess into the castle! Let's get to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear? There's a parade that's going to go on in main street in a few minutes, there's flyers all over the place about it!\" The people of Ylisstol had gathered in the plaza, ready for whatever show was going on. The guards lined the streets to prevent anyone from interfering with the performance and aid anyone who may get hurt, they were ready to escort the Themis performers and Dark-Light Troupe into the castle. Severa had spoken with the head guards beforehand and received permission from the head guard to end their performance in the castle yard and entertain the Shepherds for a while, she and Owain were two of Chrom's close companions from the war, the guard wasn't about to go against the Exalt's wishes to allow them free access to the castle. The citizens squeezed tight together and conversed loudly about what the show could be about and what type of acts they'll see, children chattered with glee, hoping to see a mystical performance that'd blow them away. Suddenly, a loud horn rang out, gathering the attention of everyone present to a large float and platoon of performers, really Maribelle's servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies &amp; Gentlemen!\" spoke Robin, clad in a mask and magician's outfit, \"The Themis Family and Ylisstol's own Dark-Light Troupe are pleased to present a magic show and heroic play that will leave you all dazzled beyond your wildest imaginations! May you enjoy our show for tonight and share the bright feelings of joy with those you love and care for!\" He pointed to the sky and on cue, a set of fireworks had shot into the sky, exploding into a shower of bright rainbows. \"It's showtime!\" The float moved and the magic began; at the center of the float laid Lucina, obscured by a mass of cloth and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I hope the act goes well...\"</i> she thought. All she could do is hope her friends came through for her so she could see Father, Mother, and Cynthia soon.</span></div></div>",

It was easy enough to keep their eyes off Lucina's hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle and Robin launched one last display, then as the audience clapped and hollered Maribelle used the opportunity to run behind the curtain and changed into Severa's mercenary outfit and donned a wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for the next part of our show, Owain and Severa's troupe will now be performing uh-.\" Robin pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket, unable to remember the improbably long and flowery name Owain had come up with for his play. \"'Owain Dark and Severa Light: Avengers of Righteous Justice!\" Robin cringed a little as he said that, feeling like he had tasted more ham than Stahl ate in a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain did not seem to notice, immediately leaping out, fully in costume, his arms raised high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you! GOOD EVENING YISSTOL!\" He yelled like a rockstar. \"Are you ready to be entertained? Because I have a story all about THE GREATEST HEROES IN  YLISSE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain continued to showboat and work the crowd, partly for his amusment and partly to allow Maribelle time to get ready. She looked down at herself and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I think about it, I really should be Lissa rather than Severa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Robin had come to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already had a good actor for Lissa, but none for Severa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle furrowed her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really remind you of her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, I just trust you with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle seemed a little happier, but was still uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I suppose to portray her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Act grumpy and emotionally evasive? I must confess, I'm a tactician not a playwright. Don't worry if you're not perfect, your performance only needs to be good enough to hold everyone's attention until we're inside the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle gave it some thought then brightened up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. I think I can manage that, but I'm still not sure how to project Severa's persona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could always ask her for advice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. You should get out there soon, I don't know how long Owain can keep that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey listened, hearing the shouts of his yelling even from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say he could go a good while longer. He does enjoy the sound of his own voice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That maybe, but we don't know how long the audience would enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle cautiously pushed through the stage curtain. As it turned out, Owain was doing a fine job keeping the crowd's attention, with a combination of his hammy sayings and his flashy sword work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEYYYAHHHHH!H\" He yelled, jumping and slicing through the air, and landing with surprising grace. As he did, he suddenly noticed Maribelle and gestured to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah my lovely wife, Severa is here. Say hello the audience my lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... no...\" Maribelle imitated Severa's poutey face and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain seemed surprised, but had no trouble rolling with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha she's just shy.\" Owain said. \"And now we're ready to begin! Lights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorches lit and Owain began reciting. The play turned out to be an embellished adaption of the war against Valm and the Grim leaf, while also detailing Owain, Severa and Lucina's journey through time and exaggerating Owain's prowess and heroism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile somewhat over the top, the audience enjoyed it, and heartily clapped and cheered. They soon reached the castle, and at the sight of Robin, the guards cleared the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good we're in.\" Robin said. \"Now to find Chrom.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good, you made it, how was the show?\" Severa approached the party who had entered the castle, guards around her, the castle's front doors wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was GREAT!\" shouted Owain with childlike glee. \"I got to show off my latest hero poses, and Auntie Maribelle did a great job at the swordplay, and Say'ri was really scary as the monster, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ham Knight, didn't ask for a full review.\" Owain was used to Severa's derogatory remarks at this point and took it as a compliment, he knew full well she didn't mean the name-calling just for the sake of being mean. Severa turned around to the royal guard to address them. \"Now, for you boys, we have a full line-up of stage magicians tonight to help raise Shepherd morale. Just head to the barracks and they'll take the stage in a few. We'll get the door for you on our way in.\" Severa was referring to Maribelle's servants with their birthday party-tier magic shows, the final distraction in Robin's careful plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you kindly, milady! May Lord Chrom enjoy your act!\" The guards gave a salute to Severa, who in turn saluted back, before clearing the courtyard and going to the barracks. Severa looked around for a bit and walked to the cloth mass of the float, pulling some of it up and coming face-to-face with Lucina's massive branded eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The coast is clear,\" she whispered, \"Haul it before someone comes looking around!\" With that, Severa leapt off the float and begun to pull a rope attached to the front, the rest of the party joined her taking more ropes until the front of the float was pulled off. Lucina crawled out from beneath her large blanket and peeked around quickly, before lunging into the door and waving her friends to hurry. When everyone had come inside, she pulled the massive doors shut and got to work looking for Chrom and Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see it! It went that way!\" yelled a Pegasus Knight. The group of Knights flew through the air chasing after their dragon with skillful evasive maneuvers in response to the dragon's hailstorm of ice breath. Its shining golden and emerald body and red eyes seemed to illuminate the night, making it an easy target to spot, but its speed in the air made it a hard target to catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fall back!\" yelled Cynthia, worried about the well-being of her men. Gerome had taken her and the other Knights' weapons for this mission, the only way they could fight the dragon was to tire it out and capture it with a net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you it'd be a hero's challenge!\" yelled Gerome. He made no attempt to help the Knights, which Cynthia did not think odd for a training mission, but what seemed odd was that the dragon seemed to be purposefully missing the Knights with careful precision. \"You won't be able to catch it with that predictable movement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Predictable?\"</i> thought Cynthia, <i>\"My movements are too predictable?\"</i> She watched the dragon dance gracefully in the air, barrel rolling, doing full loops, lunging down at the enemy while firing its ice breath, when suddenly, it started to dart towards her. Suddenly, she had a thought; Cynthia released the reins of her Pegasus and grabbed the net, standing up on the saddle of her Pegasus while taking a good look at the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Cynthia?\" inquired Gerome, concerned she had completely lost it. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something completely <i>unpredictable</i>!\" She jumped from her saddle towards the dragon, intending to capture it with the net by the head and drag it to the ground. Gerome yelled for her sister-in-law, afraid she'd become a splat on the ground from their height in the air. The rest of the Pegasus Knights looked at their captain with concern. The dragon's eyes grew wide. Before gravity could take effect, the dragon had sped up and dived under Cynthia to catch her upon her back; the girl had bagged the net around the dragon's neck in return. \"Caught ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU CRAZY?! You could've died from this height!\" Cynthia released the net when she heard the voice come from the dragon's maw, the other Knights looked on in confusion, Gerome had slapped his hand to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait a minute...\" Cynthia pondered. \"Lady Tiki, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Oh crap...\" responded Tiki, realizing her mistake. She had soared to the ground and landed, transforming back to her manakete form as Cynthia dismounted her. The rest of the Knights and Gerome &amp; Minerva had landed around the duo. \"Uh...\" Tiki coughed. \"Hey, Cynthia, long time no see...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But-! This was supposed to be a dragon! Not our friend! I knew you were going easy on us!\" Cynthia turned to Gerome and puffed her cheeks out, mad at her brother-in-law. \"Gerome! You took us off patrol to play?! Why would you do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh boy...\"</i> thought Gerome, he knew this wouldn't be easy. He took a deep breath, ready for his in-law's frantic reaction; he only could hope Team A had finished their job. \"Okay, it's about Lucina...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom sat upon his bed, reading a book in peace by himself. His wife Sumia had left to see the magic show in town, Lissa had drug Donnel to the kitchen to raid the cabinets for spices to bring back home, he was alone for once in the day, and he was never a fan of it. Chrom had always been at his happiest around friends and family, nothing had beat the joy of saving a village or stopping Risen outbreaks alongside his comrades, he loved the feeling of being paired up alongside his best friend Robin in battle, and missed the days of combat in the Shepherds dearly. In truth, Chrom would gladly give up fighting forever as long as it meant peace for all mankind, which his rule as an Exalt had bought to many, but it was really more the sensation of being lonely that ate at him. He had a lovely family to surround him, as well as good friends he could visit any time, but the one person he missed truly seeing was Lucina; though she lived as a baby in the room next to his in this timeline, his daughter of the future made him equally as proud, and he loved her just as much, though he was happy she chose to marry her childhood love and live in Wyvern Valley with him, the thought of her being away did eat up at him - he had even cried the first night he spent without training with her in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom sighed, remembering days of old, and flipped a page, hoping to find joy in his story. A knock at the door had taken his attention away from his book; he had expected it to be a guard, but the voice on the other side had gotten him giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom?\" asked Robin, \"Are you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin!\" Chrom answered back, \"How did you get in here? Would you like to come in and talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"I was hoping you could come out here and talk. It's about Lucina...\" Chrom jumped from his bed at the mention of his daughter and walked towards the door, he gripped the knob. \"You might want to come slowly...\" Wondering what he could've meant, Chrom slowly opened the door, Robin's visage coming to view, and walked outside; the tactician was ready to grab him on the small chance he faints. Chrom's eyes grew wide as he looked upon Lucina at her massive size, her head almost reaching the high castle ceiling as she kneeled upon the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina...\" Chrom said, trailing off as he kept gazing upon her figure. Lucina blushed and coughed for a moment before addressing her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello, Father...\" Lucina chuckled quickly and nervously. \"I realize it's been long since we've last seen each other...Things have changed quite a bit, as you may see...\" Chrom said nothing in response as he looked up at his daughter, though he didn't look scared in any way, Lucina looked distressed. \"Nothing to say?\" Chrom began walking towards her as she spoke. \"I...I suppose it is weird to speak to your daughter when she's become ten times her size...Father, I hope you think me not as a monst-\" She was cut off as Chrom grasped the wall of flesh that was her leg, trying to pull her in for a hug; she could see tears well in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina, welcome home. I missed you.\" Lucina was overwhelmed by the sight of her Father not even reacting to her size; tears began to well in her eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Father!\" Lucina grabbed Chrom from the ground and pulled him in close to her face; Chrom had begun to stroke her cheek as she sobbed and hiccupped. Robin looked on with a warm smile, moved by the family bond; the rest of the party had come out from behind a pillar they hid behind and watched the scene unfold, themselves moved by the act as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite touching...\" commented Maribelle, small tears welling in her own eyes as she wrapped her arms around Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's truly a strong family bond...\" commented Say'ri, remembering the old times she shared with Yen'fay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophelia better do that when she grows up.\" commented Severa. Owain gave her a light sush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're killing the moment!\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two finished sharing their hug and cry, Lucina had explained her story to Chrom, the rest of the party filling in where they came in as well; Chrom remained solemn the whole time, taking in all the information he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that brings us here.\" finished Lucina. \"We were wondering if Mother's library had any information on this shrinking elixir, can you help us Father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for my daughter,\" responded Chrom, \"I'll accompany you on your journey myself if I have to.\" Lucina was touched by his words, even though she knew she truly wasn't his daughter in the timeline, even if she shared the same genetic makeup as her baby self of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Father.\" responded Lucina warmly. \"I never meant to hurt you when I left, I hope you'll forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could never stay mad at you Lucina. Though my sorrow of you being away from me never leaves me, I find joy in your happiness with Gerome. I hope he's taking good care of you.\" Lucina nodded and wiped away more tears forming in her eyes; she was home once more, and she would see to it to visit more often when her incident had ended.</span></div></div>",

And he would still recognize Lucina as a human, even at giant size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain couldn't help but be disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where's the excitement?\"  He gestured Where's the drama?\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera scolded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everything needs to be dramatic!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Maribelle began. \"There is something to be said for one who can remain calm when faced with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\" A piercing shriek rang out from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned, seeing Sumia having tripped over again. She got to her feet and starred dumbly at Lucina<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain looked a little more satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? That's what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina wasn't sure how to react so she waved dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr.. hello mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom stood up and held her hand out to Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia wait, this is Lucina, she's still our daughter, even though she's a lot larger.\" He ran to her. \"See? Robin and Maribelle are here to.\" They waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia gaped up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how could this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Chrom could answer, the sound of clanking metal filled the air. Several guardsman were running towards the entranceway Chrom had stepped through, though Chrom barred the way, holding his hands up and standing in a way would block the view of his daughter..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire is everything ok? We heard the Queen scream-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom answered quickly..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing uh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia took a deep breath and forced a large smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I was merely... astonished. And I tripped. Again. I'm sorry to have worried you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, all is well, please return to your posts. Thank you for looking out for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom and Sumia took a deep breath, Sumaia still holding her hand over her heart. She took another look at Lucina, her eyes still wide. Lucina looked back pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, it's still me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia took a long, deep breath and sighed. She walked towards Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can see that, I'm sorry for panicking I just didn't expect such a big surprise.\" She held her hand out to Lucina, and placed it on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. This came as a surprise to all of us, when I saw what was happening my reaction was not different to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia looked thoughtfully at Lucina. Chrom smiled playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you wondering how your going to bake our daughter a pie big enough for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no not at all. There's more to me than pies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom wrapped his arm around hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I merely saught to lighten the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you but I'll be fine as long as there aren't too many more surprises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the heard Cynthia yell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're back!\" She shouted at the top of her loud voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia gasped and tripped over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom looked at his other daughter sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia, how many times have I told you not to  surprise your mother like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I really wanted to see sis. Though I guess that's big sis now or maybe really big sis-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome flew to Lucina and landed, while Minerva jumped on Lucina and licked her like a puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Lucina, I tried to stall her as long as I could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina was happy to see him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, you did well. We were able to enter the castle, and I'm glad to have my family around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera was puzzled, looking to the others for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come Cynthia didn't panic at the sight of Lucina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia stood tall and stuck out her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! A true hero isn't afraid of anything, even a giant big sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foreknowledge.

It took a lot of convincing from Chrom and Sumia to free the halls and room of guards and scholars, respectively, but they managed to sneak their huge daughter within the library with no troubles. Gerome and Cynthia sat upon Lucina's shoulder as she sat down, Tiki had rejoined the party and stood near the door with Say'ri, and the rest had sat upon a series of plush couches; all tried to relax from the hectic day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is my personal library,\" explained Sumia to her huge daughter, \"It's normally open for public study, but we were able to shoo everyone out for 'roof maintenance'. I'm sure your book must be in here somewhere sweetie, and if you can't find it, you may always sleep here; I just got the latest in the 'Wyvern Wars' series too, in case you want a fun read!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mother, I appreciate your kindness.\" Sumia got up from her seat to try and hug her daughter's big toe, but slipped on a pile of papers and fell face-first into a stack of books. Lucina picked her mother up and rested her in her palm. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Ha, I'm fine sweetie...Ouch...\" Sumia rubbed her face to detract from the sting of hitting hard leather. Lucina giggled a bit and sat Sumia upon her shoulder, next to Gerome and Cynthia, she never could get used to her mother's pratfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll talk to all the guards tonight to inform them of your situation.\" spoke Chrom. \"I didn't want to raise any alarms while getting here, but I don't wish to raise any tomorrow morning if they happen upon you as well; gods help us if Lissa finds you before I get to her. I promise that they'll treat you like they would any guest.\" Lucina smiled at her father and gave a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" chimed in Tiki, \"I think we'll take our leave.\" Tiki and Say'ri turned around to depart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Lady Tiki,\" responded Lucina, \"You won't stay with us to look for the elixir?\" Tiki turned around once more to address the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I've said before,\" she started, \"I have no information on the exact location of this potion, nor on its true nature. I truly wish I could help, but I'm afraid I would provide nothing to your quest. Please forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, you have a point.\" Lucina felt a tad upset Tiki wouldn't join her once more, but she understood Tiki's logic on the matter. \"Thank you for helping us back in Valm, and thank you for helping sneak us into Ylisstol.\" Tiki and Say'ri both bowed at the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was our pleasure Lucina. With that, we depart.\" As Tiki turned once more to leave the library, she shot Maribelle a quick wink; Maribelle knew from that gesture that Tiki was still going to continue her secret mission to cure Lucina. The two Valm residents closed the library doors behind them. Chrom had gotten up from his seat after their departure and prepared to exit himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go hold a meeting with the rest of our guards, if you don't mind. If you need anything Lucina, anything at all, do not hesitate to call me, I'll come running.\" Sumia waved a hand at Lucina's side to try and get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go with Chrom too,\" she said, \"I think the Queen being there would help convince the guards Chrom's not going crazy.\" Cynthia waved for attention next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay here with you Lucy, but if you could let me down for a group hug, that'd be swell!\" Lucina understood and plucked both Pegasus Riders from her shoulder and set them to the ground. From there, Chrom, Sumia, and Cynthia had wrapped their arms around Lucina's big toe and gave her the best hug they could possibly muster. Sumia took Chrom's hand and prepared to leave the room, Chrom addressed the rest of the party before they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If any of you wish for the guest rooms, don't hesitate to ask us. You're all guests of our family tonight.\" Everyone nodded as the royal duo left the room, leaving everyone else to discuss other matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now Lucy?\" asked Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to see if one of Mother's books of fables carries information on this shrinking elixir.\" Lucina replied. \"All fables have some amount of truth to them, if we can just find a rendition of the story with any close or exact locations, we can get closer to finding the elixir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" chimed Maribelle, gracefully unseating herself, \"Then allow Robin and I to take to the second floor for you.\" Maribelle extended a hand towards her husband and helped lift him from his seat, the two then walked down the library hall to look for a ladder. Severa was the next to get up, careful not to put any strain on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not exactly in 'working condition', so I'll check what I can from the ground floor. Owain, I'll point you to whatever looks right, then grab it for me, K?\" Owain got up excitedly and begun shouting, all fired up by the quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! A new chapter in the chronicle of Owain and Severa! I'll call it: 'Owain: Legendary Bookkeeper'!\" Severa grabbed her husband's hand and began dragging him along, like a dog on a leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, save it for the stage, Sugarblood.\" Fired up by Owain's display, Cynthia was the next one to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, this is where Hero #2 comes in for an epic crossover event! I'll take the third floor and grab every single book I can! Lucy, can you give me a lift?\" Lucina laid her palm to the floor and let Cynthia jump upon it, Lucina stood up with Gerome carefully gripping her neck as not to fall, and raised her palm to the third floor, allowing Cynthia to jump off. \"Thanks Lucy! Now off I go, Hi-Yah!\" The other two left watched as Cynthia grabbed the nearest rolling ladder and charged down the aisle with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just leaves us.\" spoke Gerome. Lucina sniffed a little, prompting Gerome to look at her; he saw faint tears beginning to form. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" she replied, \"It's just...Everyone's been so nice and so helpful, I feel overwhelmed by the sight of it all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all? You're our rock, Lucina, we'll always be here for you, no matter what happens. Never forget that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" said Lucina, wiping her eyes. She turned to Gerome and gave him a little peck with her lips, leaving him flustered. \"Now then, the fourth floor is all ours. I'll help you with lookout, and if you want to get to the other side quickly, just ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" responded Gerome. Lucina plucked him from her shoulder and set him upon the aisle. Gerome began walking and Lucina began a slow stride behind him, both ready to look for a book detailing the princess' cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki and Say'ri had entered the courtyard, completely empty, save Minerva who slept in the field, out like a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom and Sumia really did clean house on the guards, I'm impressed.\" said Tiki. She appreciated the peace as it allowed her to freely speak her plans with Say'ri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady,\" started Say'ri, \"Shall we go back to Themis for the stone and continue onward to Naga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, at once.\" replied Tiki. She turned to look at Say'ri and grimaced a little. \"It's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still pretty big, and that ball gown looks heavier than you actually weigh...\" Say'ri almost toppled over at Tiki's comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My lady!\" Say'ri responded, flustered by her friend's rude comments, \"I-I can't help it that I'm this tall or heavy! Please watch your words more carefully!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, no need to get upset!\" Tiki shifted to her dragon form and took flight, allowing enough room for Say'ri to stand under her. Say'ri grabbed Tiki's legs and the dragon tried to take flight, straining as she tried to lift her. \"Oh gods!\" she cried, \"It's definitely the dress! What did they use to make it so heavy?!\" Tiki finally took flight and strained as she talked. \"We're definitely stopping in Maribelle's kitchen before we leave for Mount Prism!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me for my size, my lady...\" With that, the duo took off on their own quest, hoping for fruitful results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that concludes our meeting.\" finished Chrom, as the chatter of the guards filled the air. \"And I swear to gods, if I hear any lewd speak about my daughter's outfit or size, I swear I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" interrupted Sumia, \"Meeting's over! Everyone back to their posts! Thank you!\" The guards left at Sumia's command and left the two royals to their own thoughts; Sumia sighed before addressing Chrom. \"I know you love our daughter and want to protect her, but you can get real scary in your 'Tiger Dad' mode, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know. Sorry about that.\" Chrom felt like his wife was scolding him, despite her warm demeanor and soft speech. Sumia smiled and gave Chrom a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize, it just shows you're a good dad is all!\" Sumia broke away from her hug and gave Chrom some breathing room. \"Speaking of Lucina, do you want to check on baby Lucina with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\" responded Chrom with a smile. The two began walking to the baby's chambers to check on their sleeping little princess; though Sumia wasn't pregnant yet, the two still had another crib reserved for Cynthia when her baby self would be born. Chrom turned to address Sumia. \"I just hope that they're all having luck looking for that elixir book in there.\" Sumia tripped and fell in shock as Chrom said this, gasping as she lifted herself from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" she cried, \"I forgot to teach them the library classification system! Stupid me!\" Chrom laughed as he helped his Queen up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they've got it dear,\" he replied, \"They're all smart and determined, they'll figure it out.\" Sumia dusted her dress off and continued with her husband to see their baby, now a little less worked up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lissa skipped through the halls of Castle Ylisstol, humming a lively tune; despite how late at night it was, the young princess of Ylisse could never seem to exhaust her excess energy. \"Come on, Donny!\" she beckoned, \"Hurry up! I got a neat prank we can play on Chrom, we need to find his bedroom, quick!\" Where his wife was full of energy, Donnel was exhausted, lugging 3 large sacks of flour in his arms and struggling to keep up with Lissa's movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm comin', I'm comin'!\" yelled back the young farmer, huffing and trying to catch his breath. \"I just don't get why we gotta bug yer brother this late at night, doesn't he got a kingdom to rule? I think he needs a good wink of shut-eye without interruption, ya know?\" This wasn't the first time Donnel helped Lissa with one of her harebrained practical jokes; in the past they managed to fill Robin's tent with toads, top all of Sumia's spears with potatoes, and unleash a herd of boars into the barracks while Chrom and Lucina trained together, and while the couple found joy in the pranks, Donnel just couldn't get why Lissa constantly played practical jokes on everyone. Lissa spun around gleefully and addressed her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Donny!\" she replied, \"This is just what little sisters do! It's a family thing! And besides, it does get a bit boring tilling the fields, you know? We gotta spice up our lives a bit!\" She spun around again and continued down the halls to look for Chrom's room, leaving Donnel to continue running behind her, still trying to comprehend the necessity for Lissa's prankster attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that makes a tad bit a' sense...\" Donnel replied. \"Though I still don't think it's a good idea to stuff Chrom's pillows fulla explodin' flour sacks, think 'bout the poor maids who gotta clean it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Lissa thought aloud, \"Maybe we should test this out first to see how far the flour goes, those maids always were nice to me after all...\" Down the hall, Lissa heard the faint voices of people coming from the library. She couldn't catch the full conversation, but one voice seemed louder than the others, and was easy to identify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-couldn't find it. Maybe we should rest and ask Mother tomorrow if she could help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Lucina!\"</i> thought Lissa with devilish glee, <i>\"Perfect!\"</i> Lissa spun around to Donnel and put her finger to her lips, as if to try and silence him. She grabbed one of Donnel's bags of flour, ready to throw it at Lucina's feet and cover her in flour, and lifted her leg, trying to put power in her foot and kick open the door loudly, startling all inside. After a few seconds, Lissa kicked the door open, ready to throw the bag and run. \"The brigands are invading! Hit the deAAAAHHHHH!!!\" Lissa immediately caught sight of the giant Lucina kneeling before the motley crew of Gerome, Robin, Maribelle, Cynthia, Severa, and Owain, and completely frightened and overwhelmed by the sight, she threw her bag up in the air and continued screaming. Donnel rushed over to help Lissa, setting down the bags so they didn't explode, and felt his jaw drop at the sight of Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What in tarnation?!\" Lissa continued screaming as gravity took effect on the bag, hitting her square in the face; Lissa was covered in white powder and stopped screaming, having fainted on the spot, and fell back into the flour sacks, dousing the rest of her body and Donnel's front in flour. At the sight of this, Maribelle ran over and begun to fan her best friend with a pocket fan, trying to revive her. Donnel wiped his face down and continued looking in awe at Lucina, before his eyes took attention to the rest of the party, most notably his son from the future. \"O-Owain?! Wh-What the heck's goin' on here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\" replied Owain, scratching the back of his head, \"You might want to sit down for this one Father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lissa awoke, she felt the feeling of her body sinking into fluffy plush and couldn't feel any contact on her skin. \"Wha...What happened...?\" She remembered little bits of what happened before she fainted as she moved a hand to her head; when she saw her hand covered in white, she freaked out. \"Oh gods! My skin! Wh-What's happened to me?!\" Lissa's eyes grew wide as she hit a revelation. \"Oh gods, I'm dead! I'm a ghost! I must've had a heart attack! Emm! Emm! Where are you?! I'm not used to being dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not dead, love!\" shouted Maribelle, bringing Lissa back to reality; she was pouring a small cup of tea for her friend with the library's stockpile of reading snacks. \"You were absolutely caked in that filthy mess, it was so thick that it stuck to your clothes and skin, we couldn't even wipe the stuff off of you. We just sat you down on the couch and hoped you'd wake up.\" Lissa sighed with relief at Maribelle's comments and drank from the cup her friend gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's a relief...But darn, it was such a good prank gone to waste!\" Now more calmed, she took another swig of her tea and giggled. \"It must've been some night-time delirium or something, my eyes must've been playing tricks on me...\" Lissa said, referring to the giant Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Not exactly, Aunt Lissa...\" Lissa turned slowly and spit her tea all over the floor at the sight of Lucina's size once again; she backed herself against the wall in fear and started screaming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-GIANT LUCINA! G-GIANT LUCINA! AH! AHH!\" Donnel and Owain ran over to calm their family's little princess and restrained her as she tried to back towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now calm down Lissa!\" said Donnel as he tried to calm his wife, \"Lucina here doesn't mean it! It's just li'l allergic reaction is all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allergic reaction?\" inquired a confused Owain. \"Father, that's not what I- No, forget it, Mother you got to listen, it's fine! It's still Lucina, there's no need to be scared!\" Lissa tried to wrestle from her family's control and everyone began to freak out; Robin, Gerome, and Severa were afraid Lissa was going to alert the guards, while Maribelle was afraid Owain was gripping Lissa too tight, and began to bang her fists upon his back. Tiring of all the commotion, Lucina reached her hand out and grabbed Lissa from Donnel and Owain's control, gripping her aunt like a rag doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, Shh, Shh...\" she softly chimed, rubbing Lissa's white-coated hair with her finger. She began to hum a tune to try and calm Lissa, one that was sung to her as a child in the future; Lissa recognized it as a lullaby Emmeryn used to sing to her, and it immediately pacified the freaked-out princess. Lucina loosened her grip on Lissa before turning her clutch into an open palm, allowing Lissa to sit down, now not screaming anymore. \"I'm sorry for scaring you Aunt Lissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods,\" replied Lissa, \"Don't be Lucina! It's my fault, I'm so stupid! It's just, I, I...\" Lissa began to cry as she hugged Lucina's thumb, prompting the blue-haired princess to stroke Lissa once more with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it?! Space rocks?!\" Lissa felt like she was being told a children's tale as everyone recounted Lucina and Gerome's quest to her, she almost wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it all, but didn't want to hurt Lucina's feelings more than she already might have. \"I dunno guys, it just sounds too weird to be true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can choose to believe it or not,\" replied Robin, \"But Lucina stands before you as a giant, and we've been around another friend who grew too, though not as huge.\" Everyone really glossed over everything that didn't involve Lucina growing or swimming to Ylisse, since Tiki and Say'ri had left and the magic show had ended a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right.\" Lissa took a sip of her teacup and set it back down on the table; Maribelle quickly refilled it as if she were Lissa's servant. \"But I mean, there's a space rock that makes people big, right? So isn't there, like, a space rock that makes people small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not.\" responded Gerome. \"If it were that easy, we'd have never left home in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted, you never told me you looked.\" chimed in Cynthia. \"I dunno Gerome, I think Aunt Lissa's got you beat on this one.\" Gerome shot Cynthia a glance, feeling challenged by the Pegasus Knight's comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're actually here to look for a cure.\" answered Lucina to Lissa. \"Lady Tiki and Say'ri had spoke of a shrinking elixir in Ylisse when we saw them, though we couldn't find information on it when we looked in the library.\" Lissa had nearly jumped at the words \"shrinking elixir\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You're talking about that old tale about the treasure hunter, right? Let's see...I think it was called 'The Unlucky Hunter' or something like that, Emm always used to read it to me as a kid.\" Everyone reacted strongly to Lissa's new information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know about it?!\" responded Lucina. \"That's wonderful Aunt Lissa! You wouldn't happen to know where the story book on it is, would you?\"</span></div></div>",

Aunt Lissa can do you one better, I know the full story by heart!\" Lissa stood up from the couch and cleared her throat, ready to articulate the old legend. \"There once was a young treasure hunter, rowdy and greedy, looking for the secret of eter-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know this already.\" interrupted Gerome. \"Where's the elixir supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you're grumpy!\" spat back Lissa. \"Okay, fine; Blah, blah, blah, skip Chapters 1-12, the hunter was told to go way up north in Aurelis and found his elixir in an old temple, except that he shrank to the size of a bug, and the end. How was that summary, <i>Mr. Story-Time</i>?\" Lissa stuck her tongue out at Gerome for his rude behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aurelis? Isn't that in the territory of Regna Ferox?\" inquired Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it,\" responded Severa, \"Mom sends me letters all the time from up there, complaining about how cold it is. I never knew there were any old temples in that frozen wasteland though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's just a story though, ain't it?\" inquired Donnel, curious about the nature of this elixir. \"I don't wanna dash yer hopes Miss Lucina, but ya don't even know if there's anything up there.\" Lucina smiled back at the farm boy, pleased at the information and eyes burning with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the concern Uncle Donnel, but I have to do this. Even if it's just legend, even if it's not real, this story is the only lead I have to getting back to my old size. Sure, being big has its perks...\" Lucina grabbed Gerome and placed him atop her shoulder, as if to illustrate her point, leaving the Wyvern Rider flustered at his wife's actions. She continued her thoughts further; \"But I miss my old size, I miss the feeling of crawling into bed with Gerome to cuddle, to ride upon Minerva's back and feel the breeze, and truthfully, I miss actual clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's settled then?\" Robin asked, \"You two will set off to Regna Ferox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what Lucina wishes.\" responded Gerome with a smile. He looked at his wife for her answer, she looked back before adopting a determined look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Our journey will continue onward! To Regna Ferox!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" chimed in Maribelle with a frown on her face. She got up and began pointing at Lucina. \"You mean to tell me you're going to go to that frozen land of brutes wearing <i>those rags</i>? You're going to freeze to death, dear!\" Lucina began looking at her body; Maribelle had a point, she was clad in nothing but makeshift underwear, she even had no shoes to wear, she'd lose a limb or two to frostbite in the first 5 minutes they step into the continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point. I suppose I will take you up on your offer for a proper outfit, but does that mean we'll have to sneak back into Themis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heavens no!\" responded Maribelle, now smiling with a more cheerful demeanor, \"I'll gather my best and we'll prepare you something here; I'm normally busy, but for you dear, I can manage to take some time away from my schedule. I'm sure Lord Chrom would be more than happy to help make something for you; perhaps an overcoat made entirely out of bear fur, or a winter dress of elk fur and wolf pelts. Ooh! Or maybe we could...\" Maribelle begun to trail off, imagining the many possible designs she could commission. Robin stepped forward and took over for his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, what I think Maribelle is trying to say is; Just give us some time to prepare you something Lucina, you'll work at your best with the right outfit for the job. I don't think we can join you though with orders for the Themis Ball coming up, but a coat is the least we could do.\" Lucina smiled at the duo's kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your kindness, Robin, Maribelle. Even if you can't join us, we appreciate your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Robin,\" responded Gerome, \"You and your wife aren't so bad after all.\" Robin felt a hint of insult in that thanks, but was happy to have thanks nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could always come!\" chimed in Owain. \"Think about it; 'The Five Heroes of the Future travel together, looking for an ancient cure of legend! Their leader towers over them, commanding respect from all in her wake, but bringing kindness to all those she passes; a modern-day goddess!' Truly, it'd be a tale worthy of sacred-blooded heroes!\" Owain extended arms out to Severa and Cynthia. \"What say you two lovely ladies? Will you take up your weapons for the cause of our sacred goddess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it gets you to stop talking like a dork.\" responded Severa, slightly annoyed by Owain's droning speech. \"Just don't forget that I'm carrying our child, so unless she makes like us and pops out of the Outrealm Gate, grown up and tomes blazing, then you're down one sword.\" Cynthia got more charged up than Severa and responded to Owain in a way that showed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Brady's on tour and Ylisstol is in peace! I was waiting on a cool adventure like this! And with Gerome here, the Justice Cabal is complete!\" Cynthia dashed towards Owain and the two struck a group pose, ready for action. \"Come on Gerome! Bust out that old hero stance you took as a kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" was the only response Cynthia got out of Gerome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp! I'm glad we got that settled! I need a bath to get all this crud off me!\" Lissa turned to prepare to leave the room, but stopped to ask the present party a question. \"Um, if you guys are going to be here for a while, then you will use the guest rooms, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom already mentioned it,\" responded Robin, \"Though Maribelle and I will leave tonight to fetch our tailors back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great! He can be a blockhead sometimes, glad to see he remembered common guest courtesy! Donnel and I will be gone by tomorrow morning, we just had to sell some crops and pick up some spices, so you guys can have our room if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means we're having a sleepover!\" cried Cynthia, addressing everyone who wasn't leaving. \"I'll lay out the cots in my room and we can talk about our heroic tales together, and we can play Brady's sheet music on the piano, ooooh, this is going to be so fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm staying with Lucina.\" responded Gerome, disgusted by the thought of a sleepover with Cynthia. \"We always sleep together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about Owain, but I'm gone after the first night and I'm going right to Lissa's room.\" curtly responded Severa. \"And don't even think about keeping me up with that stupid piano concert you're going to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you guys have fun then, I'm going to take a bath and then I'm going right to bed!\" Lissa opened the library doors and exited, Donnel following behind her. \"Goodnight guys, and good luck Lucina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun in Regna Ferox! And make sure ya catch lots o' elk!\" added Donnel as the two farmers went down the halls. Robin and Maribelle were the next to depart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be back as soon as we can, and we'll try to get you your new outfit as soon as possible. See you tomorrow guys, have a good night!\" Robin was about to exit, but Maribelle stopped him, and directly addressed Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can grab what we have from home: Favorite color?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Designs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterflies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Style?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soldier's Formal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You truly do have your father's refined noble manners! Now we may go, Robin.\" The two exited the library, and Cynthia, Owain, and Severa were the next to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sis, have a good night's rest! Last one to my room is a rotten egg!\" Cynthia ran down the halls, dashing to her room at an animal-like speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're not winning that easily!\" responded Owain, dashing after Cynthia as if he were a cheetah trying to catch its prey. Severa just looked at the two with astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawds, they're such children!\" She turned to face Lucina and Gerome before leaving. \"Yeah, you two have a good night and all that. Oh, and uh, feel free to take my suggestion from before, Lucina.\" Severa had a naughty smile on her face as she left the room and closed the door, leaving the princess' face bright red and Gerome confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she mean by 'suggestion'?\" he asked. Lucina just nervously laughed, trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, Ha Ha! N-Nothing! J-Just girl talk is all! Ha...\" Lucina plucked Gerome from her shoulder and set him to the floor. \"You must want to take the couch, you've been sleeping on sand and floor for the past few days after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good.\" responded Gerome, \"In fact, if it's fine with you, would you mind if I spent the night...Closer to you?\" Lucina's face grew a blush again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay! I...I guess we could do that...\" Lucina grabbed Gerome and laid down, slowly moving her hand with the Wyvern Rider to her bottoms, other hand inserted and ready to lift up the front, her heart was beating quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What are you doing?!\" responded Gerome with a deep blush on his face. Lucina was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait, you mean you didn't want to try...you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was just thinking your bra, like back in Valm, it was kind of comfy...\" Lucina breathed a sigh of relief and inserted Gerome into her bra, snug between her breasts, as Gerome removed his mask and looked even more flustered than before. \"What...What did Severa tell you anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Let's just forget that ever happened.\" responded the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's.\" Gerome flipped over and hugged his wife's chest. \"Good Night Lucina, I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I too Gerome, good night.\" With that, the two dozed off in the library, ready to prepare for their journey up north.</span></div></div>",

It was nice to be around her extended family again, though they were surpsied to see her as she was, even Lissa and Sumia started treating her the same way as before, though Lucina had the sneaking suspicion Lissa was contemplating how to use Lucina's size in pranks, either to target her or use her as tool in her pranks, though she wasn't sure Lissa was brazen enough to prank her as she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surprise someone as level headed as Donnel had ended up with Lissa. She would have suspected someone excitable like Vaike would be a better fit, though she also recalled the time she saw him staring at Libra. But surely that would never have worked out... would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina felt relaxed at how normal everyone was treating her. Sumia was still a little nervous, but had ordered the staff to bring her a bountiful breakfast, and while the staff were certainly curious or fearful  at the sight of her none ran away screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose even if we fail to find a cure, I'll still have my family. She glanced at Gerome. Though I'll miss out on certain things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was more than willing to accompany Lucina on her journey, even as Lucina ensured they weren't needed.

Chrom and Sumia wanted to come, but had a kingdom to watch over and both Robin and Lucina assured him their would be more than enough people to watch over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin organized the supplies, which the others helped to gather while Maribelle and several of her servants worked on Lucina's dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good while later, Maribelle triumphantly approached Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished! Come this way!\" Maribelle led Lucina, her shoulders proudly raised..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfit was everything Lucina expected and more and looked perfectly sized to her physique.. It reminded her of the outfit she wore when pretending to be Marth, but with a considerable bump to stylishness and quality and with tastefully done shoulder pads added to it. Looking over it she could also see a butterfly emblem on it, resmebling the mask she was long ago. Feeling it, the fabric was much thicker than expected. Maribelle must have made sure the outfit would be suited to  the Ferox winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina beamed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. It looks great, without any compromise to it's practicality. It still feels like me, but also like an improvement over my old outfit. Thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle returned the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very welcome. Now go get changed, I can't wait to see how you look.\" She raised an arm at Gerome. \"But you! No peeking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome bristled at the accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm not the kind of guy to peek-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina smiled in an unusually flirtatious way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I certainly wouldn't take offence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle stood between them, wagging a finger at Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh! No shenanigans! Gerome you wait here, and young lady you get changed this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina laughed internally. Despite Maribelle's prudishness she felt a certain respect for her. In addition to everything she had done, how many other woman would have the stones to speak that way to to someone ten times there size? She simply nodded and complied, closing the door to her room. When she came out, there were many ohhs and ahhs The outfit looked even better on her than expected!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle was pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my work here is done.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucina ran her fingers across the onesie and tunic she wore with her gloved fingers, they were all made of wool, perfect for protecting her body from the cold, and the tunic was stuffed with down feathers for further insulation, still layered thinly enough to look stylish. Where she normally wore a cape on the smaller version of the outfit there was a fine wool scarf around Lucina's neck, branded with the Brand of Naga that was emblazoned on her left eye, Chrom's shoulder, and Cynthia's back; while normally preferring to keep her relation to Chrom secret in order to prevent conspiracy speech, Lucina figured there was nothing to hide her eye at this size, so she appreciated the logo. While getting changed, Lucina untied her cape from her bra and stuffed it in the tunic for good luck. The only thing Lucina missed from her regular attire was her gold ornate headband, something that'd be hard to remake at this size. Lucina looked down at Maribelle with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels very comfy,\" she said, \"Thank you again Maribelle.\" Maribelle laughed in a posh manner in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing darling!\" Maribelle replied. \"The way I see it, your sister married my future son, so in a way, we are like family! Think of it as a loving aunt's seasonal gift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good, the design suits you.\" remarked Gerome with a smile, causing the princess to blush at his comment. The trio had departed and walked down the halls of Castle Ylisstol, Lucina now free to walk the halls without fear of causing commotion of a giant woman; Lucina got less looks from some of the guards now that she was fully clothed in decent wear. On their walk, they had run into Chrom and Sumia, busy with inspecting the castle and servant morale; the royal duo gave their daughter a intrigued look at her outfit, which Lucina had picked up on, spinning around to showcase her outfit to her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetie, is that your new outfit?\" inquired Sumia. \"It looks so good on you! I love the design!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks almost like what you wore while in the Shepherds.\" remarked Chrom. \"You always look good in that tunic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Father, Mother, Maribelle's kindness will surely get me through the Feroxi winter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it then?\" responded Sumia with a sad tone of voice. \"But you just got here though, we have a lot of catching up to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me Mother,\" responded Lucina, kneeling down to get a better look at Sumia, \"But I need to find a cure to my size as soon as possible.\" She moved her finger to rub Sumia's hair. \"Don't worry though, after seeing Father again, I've decided to come visit more often. I promise Gerome and I will spend a week here with you when I become small again.\" Their moment was interrupted by the swift clanking of steel boots down the halls, alerting everyone that Cynthia was coming, carrying Robin, Owain, and Severa in tow with her, all but Owain out of breath trying to keep up with the Pegasus Knight. Cynthia took a good look at her sister with a twinkle in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Lucy!\" stated the pigtailed girl, \"Your outfit looks amazing! It looks like your usual tunic, but like, <i>better</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Cynthia. What brings you here? Are we ready to depart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that,\" replied Robin, \"There seems to be a shortage on spare rations because of a Shepherds training march. The animals won't be abundant this time of year up there and you should all be properly rationed food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get the chefs to work on it then,\" chimed in Chrom, \"I want you all to be in your best condition for the trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so we're going to rest here for one more day before we depart.\" said Severa. Owain was looking rustled by her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sword hand burns for adventure! I fear I can't control my bloodlust forever! Uncle Chrom! Please urge your chefs to hurry, for the safety of your beloved citizens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I'll get on that.\" responded Chrom, a little embarrassed by how dorky his nephew was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Also tell them to add fish to the rations.\" Sumia suddenly clapped her hands together suddenly, turning the attention of everyone present to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she began, \"If you're going to be here for one more day, let's have a family picnic tonight! Just all of us, eating and sharing stories together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\" responded Lucina. \"Gerome and I would be happy to attend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" added Gerome, \"I'd be happy to join, Lady Sumia.\" Sumia giggled at the Wyvern Rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Gerome, we're family! You can just call me 'Mom' you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't prefer titles like that...\" responded Gerome, slightly flustered by his mother-in-law's comments; he hardly ever called Cherche \"Mother\" when he came back from the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Ooh! Mother! Can Owain and Severa join too?!\" asked Cynthia, jumping up and down excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear, Owain's your cousin, and Severa is family too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaay!\" cried Cynthia as she pulled her cousin and friend in for a hug. \"This is going to be so fun together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bother...\" remarked Severa, feeling nauseous from Cynthia and Owain's cheerful excitement. Chrom turned towards his best friend and asked for his company as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, would you like to join us? Technically, we are related in a sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to Chrom,\" responded the tactician, \"But Maribelle and I have a lot of work we have to get done for the season. I promise next time we're up that we'll set some time aside to share lunch together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a shame,\" replied Chrom, \"But I understand your workload. I wish Lissa could make it too, but she and Donnel have left back home already, she said one of the cows was expecting a calf.\" Maribelle sauntered over to her husband and wrapped her arms around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thank you for being so understanding, my lord.\" she spoke to Chrom. \"May you and Lady Sumia have a good family gathering tonight.\" Maribelle turned to Lucina and gave her a wink. \"And I expect to see you back at our mansion once you become normal again, Brady has become smitten with your playful demeanor. May you find good luck in your quest dear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Maribelle,\" responded the huge princess, \"And thank you Robin; I promise I'll become small for the both of you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you will Lucina, I hope you find it soon.\" replied Robin. He waved towards the crowd of people with Maribelle to signal his departure. \"Goodbye everyone, come and visit anytime!\" Everyone waved back and wished the two goodbye as they began to depart back home to their mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" spoke Sumia, \"I better go start making some sandwiches and rhubarb pie for tonight! This is going to be so exciting!\" Sumia turned around to dash off to the kitchen, but stepped on the hem of her dress and faceplanted into the floor. Chrom ran over and helped his wife from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should come with you, in case you need a hand in the kitchen...\" Chrom turned to address the party. \"Well, we'll see you all tonight, hope your stomachs are empty!\" The royal duo walked off towards the kitchen together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Owain!\" said Cynthia energetically, \"Let's get the blankets to help Mother out!\" Cynthia and Owain ran off together to gather materials for the picnic, leaving Severa to hang with Gerome and Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief,\" she chimed, \"What a bunch of dorks...\" Severa turned towards Gerome and Lucina and glanced at the two, a naughty smile formed on her face. \"So then, did you two do anything <i>special</i> last night?\" Gerome and Lucina's faces made a hot flush, causing the raven-haired beauty to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! For your information!\" shouted Gerome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I could step on you right now! No one would need to know!\" shouted Lucina. Severa only giggled harder, knowing Lucina was far too nice to crush one of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the night fell, everyone in the royal family who could make it had gathered together in the courtyard, the castle walls blocking the eyes of Ylisstol citizens from looking in at the scene. Blankets were strewn across the grassy yard, plates of sandwiches, vegetables, and rhubarb pies lined the fabric, all in abundant supply so Lucina could properly eat. Everyone sat upon the blankets together, save Minerva, who laid next to Lucina like a small pet, waiting for pets, and the baby Lucina, who sat in Sumia's lap, cuddled by her mother; the baby Lucina looked at the older version of herself and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's stange...\" Lucina giggled back, \"I never thought I would be sharing a meal with my younger self, it feels weird. I wonder if she'll remember this when she grows older.\" Chrom laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully not, but should it ever come to that, I'll tell her about you and Cynthia. I don't know how to explain your size to her though.\" he responded. \"Honestly, I kind of want to spend time with baby Gerome, Gregor and Cherche write us all the time about him, it'd be kind of funny if they get married like you two.\" Lucina and Gerome gave light chuckles at the comment, a rarity for the normally solemn Gerome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm definitely arranging some playdates with Lucina when Ophelia is born!\" chimed in Owain. \"I can feel it in my bones, she'll be the cutest little stage star Ylisse has ever seen!\" Baby Lucina giggled at Owain's eccentric display and clapped her hands together, the swordsman playfully bowed in turn. Sumia raised her child to her face to kiss her and addressed everyone present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone, let's eat!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group shared stories and ate food under the brilliant starlight, the crisp spring air not too warm, but not too cold, just the perfect climate for a picnic. Owain had just finished a 100 minute-long story that could easily be formatted into a play script, its large, expressive words and run-on sentences physically exhausted all that listened to it, all except baby Lucina who giggled and jiggled at Owain's expressive motions and loud onomatopoeias; Owain thought that at least his material would be good children's show material. Lucina had swallowed a whole rhubarb pie, a small candy-like snack at her size, and gazed up at the stars in the sky, admiring the beauty of the sky while deep in thought. She let out a small sigh and stroked Minerva's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Gerome, picking up on the motions of his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.\" responded Lucina, turning to Gerome. \"I just couldn't help but think of those meteors that made me like this. What if they weren't just restricted to Wyvern Valley? What if there are more out there?\" The mood dampened a little at this, save the spark of adventure lit in Owain and Cynthia's eyes. It took a bit for a response, everyone thinking of what to say at Lucina's thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your concern,\" responded Gerome, \"I'm not going to say there's no need to worry, but there's nothing we can do about the situation. All we can do is just look for a cure for you right now, we'll worry about the rest later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just...I don't want any of you coming into contact with those meteors and catching what I got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Lucina,\" responded Sumia with a smile, \"Just worry about yourself for now. Chrom and I can handle keeping everyone in Ylisse away from those meteors, and if we find any around Ylisstol, I'll lead the charge to dispose of them before any citizens come into contact with one.\" Chrom choked on his mug of ale he drank from and laughed, causing Sumia to turn towards him. \"Now what's so funny, Chrom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry...\" he replied, trying to calm down from his laughing fit. \"It's just that I can see you tripping into the crater and becoming a giant yourself, I don't think you should be leading the charge on this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" yelled back Sumia. \"That's rude! I am <i>so</i> qualified to handle this, sitting on a throne hasn't made me any less good at riding a Pegasus!\" Sumia sat down baby Lucina and lunged at her husband, beating on his left shoulder with her fists. Chrom laughed at Sumia's childish display and tried to defend himself with his arm, everyone else laughed at the two, save Gerome and Severa, who only smiled and gave light chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'll leave it to you then.\" responded Chrom, ending Sumia's onslaught. \"But just remember that we're two halves of a whole here, don't ever be afraid to ask me to help you out if you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Chrom!\" answered Sumia as she kissed his cheek and went back to cuddling baby Lucina, feeding her some bits of rhubarb pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mother!\" shouted Cynthia, \"Lucy and I could always help too! We could get some rope down and wrap it around the rocks to lift them, or we could just get Lucy to hurl it into the ocean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying to get her smaller, not make her bigger, numbskull!\" chimed in Severa. \"Didn't Gerome tell you those things were touch-activated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I guess I forgot. Whoops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could always try to break it into bits with my expert sword moves!\" shouted Owain. \"Sonic speed, gone in a flash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're already a big enough headache, I don't want you bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're a real grouch sometimes Severa!\" said Cynthia. \"Maybe I should push you into a meteor and make you big, maybe that'll make you more humble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch me while I'm pregnant and I'll drop you to the floor, nerd!\" Severa responded, face reddening. \"I want our child to grow up normal, not the size of a house; how will she get a boyfriend like that?!\" Severa realized what she said and turned to Lucina, realizing she may have offended the princess. \"Oh uh, sorry Luce, I didn't mean it in that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Severa,\" responded Lucina with a warm smile, \"I understand where you're coming from, even if I'm not a mother myself.\" Severa wiped her brow and breathed a sigh of relief, she was lucky her friend was so forgiving; she hated to admit it, but Cynthia was right, she was too mean sometimes, and it caused her to say the wrong things more often than naught. Lucina moved her hand past Mineva's back and wrapped a finger around Gerome's shoulders. \"But I have been thinking about it a bit, and I was thinking Gerome and I should try to have a child once I become normal again. Would you be alright with that, Gerome?\" The Wyvern Rider looked flustered at his wife's comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, I guess we, uh...\" Gerome took a moment to take a breath and turned to Lucina, looking more calm. \"Yes, I'd be happy to start a family with you, Lucina.\" Sumia and Cynthia squealed at Gerome's comments, excited to become a grandparent and aunt, respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll have to get streamers for the baby shower and buy tons of baby clothes!\" shouted Sumia. \"Oh, this is going to be so fun! My little baby's growing up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mother, we're just thinking about it, I'm not pregnant yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" shouted Cynthia, \"I'm all fired up to make Lucina mother-sized again! I'm ready to head to Ferox right now!\" Cynthia got up and ran over to Minerva, rummaging through the rucksack attached to her back as the wyvern purred. \"Alrighty Gerome, let's see what's in your bag of tricks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Get out of Minerva's satchel right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, vulnaries, throwing axes, oooooh!\" Cynthia pulled Falchion from the rucksack, admiring the bright luster of the sword. \"Hey Lucy, you're too big for it now, so can I practice with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can,\" responded the sister, \"But the blade will be dull, don't expect to cut anything with it.\" Lucina still remembered the time they went training in the woods and Cynthia totally missed the log she tried to slice at, they never tried again after Lucina rushed out to cooking duty that night, having no need to anymore with the age of peace at Grima's defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, don't worry sis! I'm just going to pose with it for a bit and practice my sword thrusts!\" With that, Cynthia started spinning around in the open fields, swinging the blade around the air gracefully enough, but adding unneeded \"Hyah!\"s and \"Kyah!\"s to her swings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Cuckoo's behavior aside, she is right.\" spoke Severa to Lucina. \"We'll stick by you until we find a cure for your crappy little condition, I want to see Ophelia and your future kid become best friends, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyah!\" Falchion swiped through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa's right!\" shouted Owain. \"As dear cousin to the crown princess, I have a sworn devotion to you your well-being!\" He drew his blade and pointed it skyward. \"You have Missiletainn's radiant luster on your side! Please utilize it well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyah!\" Another swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're certainly fired up.\" remarked Gerome. \"You already know how I feel, Lucina. I'd say that we're all ready for tomorrow's journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiii-yah!\" Cynthia faced the trunk of a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, everyone,\" said Lucina with warm glee in her voice, \"You're all not just my family, you're true friends! I can't wait to journey with you all tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our little girl's all-grown up now.\" spoke Chrom with a smile to Sumia, as he wrapped his arm around her and the baby Lucina, both smiling as well; Chrom realized the irony of what he said when the baby Lucina wasn't even a foot away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" said Cynthia, slashing the air one final time before striking a pose with Falchion and facing the rest of the group. \"Let's finish the food and make Lucina normal again!\" Cynthia's statement was complimented by a loud \"THUD\" from behind her, as if to end the statement with a bang. Everyone just looked at Cynthia wide-eyed and speechless, save the baby Lucina clapping and cooing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Cynthia, the tree had split from its trunk in one clean slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Cynthia turned around to look at the tree upon the ground, then the trunk, then looked at the Falchion in her hands. \"Oh...Ohhh...Uhhh...\" Everyone was awestruck, trying to think of something to say, Cynthia included. \"Uh, Lucy? Can I...Can I hang on to this? At least until you're normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure Cynthia. Use it all you want.\" Lucina didn't know how to express it, but she was proud of her sister as much as she was surprised. She always wanted to see her sister wield Falchion some day, she just didn't expect it to happen in a manner like this. Cynthia sat back down on the blanket, holding Falchion at her side, the revelation of being chosen by the sacred blade even too much for her excitable personality to process. Everyone was quiet for a while, Sumia breaking the silent tension after a couple minutes with a cough and a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, bear-meat Reuben anyone? Ha ha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an unforgettable family picnic, that was certain.</span></div></div>",

WHOHOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia started dancing around, still waving the Falchion around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful with that!\" Lucina scodled, getting flashbacks to her earlier training sessions with Cynthia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"  Cynthia sheated the falchion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can finally rest well, if anything were to ever happen to me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome placed a hand on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk that way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina looked at him.

But I'm the one who uses swords, Cynthia is more of a lance girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owain, the Falchion is not a toy!\" Lucina chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that! No one respects swords more than I do. And I have the mark!\" He raised his hand and took off his glove. \"I have the mark to! Please let me have my chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, but I have to ask, why did you wait till now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I always wanted to wield such an awesome sword but...\" He shuffled his feet. \"I didn't want to risk being rejected.\" Everyone feel silent, puzzled by that response. \"I've never been rejected by a sword before... I didn't think I could bear it, but after seeing my cousin step up and succeed I had to try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owain, it's alright, if the Falchion does not accept you, you are no less my cousin or a Swordmaster. Just as I didn't think any less of Cynthia before I knew she could wield the Falchion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia thrusted it through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though you gotta admit, this is really cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Lucina and Owain's looks it was obvious to her that it was not the best thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh- I mean it's totally alright if you can't wield the Falchion,  I mean you still have other cool swords.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but for my WARRIOR'S PRIDE I have to do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his hand expectantly and with a moment's hesitation, Cynthia passed him the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain flourished the blade, and setting his eyes on the trunk of the tree Cynthia had felled, he leapt through the air. Screaming a battle cry, he dropped down and  cleaved the stump in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH YEAH!\" Owain said, holding the sword high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom clapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, I can't wait to tell Lissa about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain beamed back, but Cynthia  crossed her arms. She wasn't one to sulk or be jealous but couldn't help be annoyed that Owain had stolen her moment of glory. Lucina saw her reaction and smiled at them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am gladdened that you have both been chosen by the Falchion, I can rest that much easier knowing their are two who can take that place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain was suddenly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey we could never replace you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome glared up at Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I told you not to talk like that, I'm not going to let anything happened to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but if the worse happens and I stuck at this size, I feel safer knowing the Falchion has two more who can wield it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome placed a hand on his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do whatever it takes to get you to normal, I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not doubt it for a moment, but if nothing can be done...\" She didn't finish that sentence, instead cheering herself up. \"And aside from that, I am thinking of future generations, I feel that much better if all of our children had a chance of wielding the falchion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia raised her hands in a pushing gesture<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo! Whoo! I'm not ready to start a family yet! I've got a career to pursue! I want to be a great hero before i settle down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not mean to pressure you. Take all the time you need.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dawn broke upon Ylisstol and the warm air had just spread across the plain. Standing outside the castle walls, away from the merchant's road, stood the group of 5 consisting of Lucina, Gerome, Cynthia, Owain, and Severa, joined by Chrom and Sumia to see them off. Lucina stood tall with Gerome and Cynthia in flight upon Minerva and her Pegasus, respectively, close to her shoulders at eye level. Owain and Severa rode in a large horse-drawn carriage with cartoon illustrations of the couple's faces painted on the sides and purple &amp; gold cloth adorning the carriage; Owain was ready to drive the carriage, holding a wooden wheel attached to the two horses' reins, while Severa sat upon a couch in the back, next to the large stock of food rations, camping supplies, and spare weapons. Lucina gently kneeled down and peered into the carriage to talk to Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want to ride on my body? I could store you, Owain, and the supplies in my tunic's pockets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" replied Severa, repositioning herself to lounge around, \"Heights make me sick, and I'd rather lay down for the baby's health. Sorry if we're holding you up Luce, we'll try to keep our pace up on the way there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" responded Lucina, \"I'd rather your child's needs come first. I can live with being big for a little while longer.\" Sumia and Chrom moved forward a bit to draw Lucina's attention, the Exalt speaking first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get the Shepherds and Pegasus Knights to look for any meteors and quarantine the areas. Cynthia, I've appointed your first mate to head the Knights while you're gone, you have nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Father!\" replied Cynthia. \"We'll try to make it back quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina, sweetie,\" spoke Sumia, \"Please come back to Ylisstol once your quest ends, Chrom and I would really love it if you could spend a little time with us before you go back home to Valm.\" Lucina knelt down next to her parents, a smile upon her face, and spoke to them softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise to stop in with Gerome, Mother, I admit I need to spend more time with you two.\" She extended her palm out to her parents and they stepped on, Lucina lifted them to her face. \"I promise the next time you see me, I'll be at a more manageable size to hug and practice swordfighting with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care, Lucina, and good luck!\" responded Chrom. The two royals moved in to kiss Lucina's cheek, the princess responding by covering her parents' bodies with her massive lips. She let her parents back upon the ground and waved to them, prompting a wave back from the duo. Lucina spoke loudly to address her crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone, we're off! To Ferox!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Yah!\" Owain shouted as he pulled back the wooden wheel, tugging the horses' reins and prompting them to start moving. Lucina broke into a march, covering a larger distance than the usual soldier at her size, as her husband and sister flew right next to her. The 5 had moved onto a trail for the carriage to move more level on and traveled off into the distance as Chrom and Sumia watched, embracing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had passed since they left Ylisstol, and the group showed no signs of stopping. Severa, not occupied by walking or managing an animal, read a map of the Ylissean continent in her carriage; she stuck her head out the front of the wagon and spoke loudly to reach the ears of her heightened companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we just keep bearing north, we'll reach the border of Ferox in a couple days. This old map is saying Aurelis is where East-Ferox is, Khadein being on West-Ferox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man!\" cried Owain in disappointment as he continued driving the carriage. \"You mean we aren't going to West-Ferox? I was hoping we could stop in and see your parents again, Lon'qu said he'd show me some of his special moves if I stopped speaking to him during the war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Owain, but Luce needs a cure quickly; this is a quest, not a vacation.\" In truth, Severa never was a fan of going to see her parents, it was too cold up in Ferox and Severa always felt bugged by Cordelia's perfect array of skills and Lon'qu always getting freaked out when she got close to him; she'd rather take Owain's craziness and an actual job over trying to outshine her parents and being stuck ice fishing any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flavia should let us in just fine,\" said Lucina, \"But I wouldn't be surprised if we scare the guards with my stature and get into a battle at the gates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they do anything to insult you, then they're facing the wrath of Minerva and I.\" responded Gerome. Minerva roared in agreement, ready to defend her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" chimed in Cynthia, beaming with excitement. \"And if they do battle with us, we got this!\" Cynthia removed Falchion from its sheath and pointed it towards the sky in a triumphant pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful with that!\" shouted Lucina, afraid that the blade would fall from Cynthia's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, whoops, sorry Lucy!\" Cynthia placed Falchion back into its sheath and went back to focus on riding her Pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Falchion is not a toy, Cynthia.\" spoke Lucina to her little sister. \"I know you mean well, but please take care of the blade, don't keep posing with it. This was the same blade the Hero King used all those years ago after all.\" Cynthia felt like she was being lectured and chewed out by her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, I'm sorry. It's just force of habit, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Cynthia,\" responded Lucina with a smile, \"Just take the time to think before you use it. I'm sorry I can't properly show you my techniques though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine!\" responded Cynthia. \"I'll pick up some techniques from Flavia when we get down there, and I could always let Owain use Falchy if I'm in a lance mood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you,\" responded Owain, \"I'd rather stick with Missiletainn's shining edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you could wield the blade as well?\" chimed in Gerome, somewhat annoyed by Owain's response. \"What was the point of trying Falchion if you aren't going to use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that.\" responded Owain, scratching his head. \"It was a \"heat of the moment\" sort of thing, I was just kinda curious if the sword would let me wield it, kinda like a \"family bloodline test\".\" Owain's response clearly didn't put Gerome in a better mood. \"Besides, I feel like our weapons are our sworn comrades. I know you and Cynthia don't name your weapons, but they are still your friend and sworn ally, and should be used whenever you need them; as for the rest of us, Falchion is Lucina's sworn companion, I have Missiletainn, and Severa has Owa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop talking!\" shouted Severa, cheeks red. \"Don't finish that sentence, or I'll choke you with the reins!\" Cynthia and Severa couldn't help but laugh, it was painfully obvious what she named her weapon, even Gerome let out a small chuckle. \"And you guys! Quit the laughing! Just keep going north and forget about this whole conversation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright!\" responded Lucina, trying to stop laughing. \"We're just having some fun Severa, we have a few days to go until we get to the Feroxi border after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" cried Cynthia, \"I have an idea! How about we play some of Brady's tunes! I threw some of his sheet music in the back for the ride, so we could have some fun on the trip! Severa, there should be a violin back there too, can you play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" replied the raven-haired mercenary, \"I had to learn some instruments for our shows, but Brady is like, <i>stupid</i> good with the violin, I don't want to butcher the music he worked so hard composing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's fine, Brady'd probably like to hear you play more then hear his renditions anyways! Besides, doesn't your mother have a natural talent for instruments too? I think that would've rubbed off on you or something.\" Severa's eye twitched at Cynthia's remarks, she hated other people sizing her up to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, as soon as you land, I'm gonna...\" she trailed off as she dug through the suitcases in the carriage's back before pulling out some music booklets and a wooden violin. \"Alright, here goes...\" As Severa rubbed the hair of the bow across the violin's strings, beautiful music reverberated through the air, a calm, serene tune that went with the landscape around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hold on, we worked on this one together!\" Cynthia reached into the satchel at her side and pulled out an ocarina. She wrapped a belt on her Pegasus' saddle around her waist to prevent herself from falling, and stroked the flying horse's mane, signaling it to go on autopilot. She looked down from her mount upon Severa and matched eyes with the mercenary. \"Alright, on the count of 3; 1...2...3.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the count went up, the beautiful tune of the string and wind instruments sang through the air, putting a smile on the faces of Owain, Lucina, and even Gerome, and it had a calming effect upon Minerva and the horses as they travelled along. Though it wasn't the first time they got along with each other, the duet Severa and Cynthia played definitely carried the tune of friendship with it, causing both girls to smile at one another as they continued to play; Severa only wondered if Ophelia could hear the music as she grew inside the mercenary's stomach. As the march continued on, spirits and morale were high between the group of 5 - they would no doubt reach Ferox with smiles on their faces and good moods.</span></div></div>",

Cynthia ahead, leaving Gerome and Lucina slightly separate from the rest of the group<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Gerome was enjoying himself, often nodding his head in time with the music, though he tried to hide this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?

What the hell is this?!\" spoke Raimi, chief Knight of the Eastern Border. \"Take aim men!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, stand down!\" commanded Lucina, \"We mean no harm, we seek entry into Regna Ferox!\" The archers lining the walls took no heed and prepared their bows, Lucina's group prepared to clash weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard the lady, stand down!\" came a commanding voice from behind the fort walls. The archers immediately dropped their attack stance and kneeled to their speaker, Raimi doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady, forgive us.\" spoke the Knight. Coming to full view on the face of the wall was a warrior decked out in red and silver armor, brandishing a large sword over her shoulder, her blond hair contrasting her darkened skin. She took a good look at the blue-haired giant and broke into a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while Lucina, what have you been eating to get that big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flavia!\" shouted Lucina with joy, surprised they had met the East-Khan so soon. Everyone in the party let down their guard and found themselves overjoyed at how well events had gone. \"It's so nice to see you, but how did you know we'd be here, with me like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little tactician friend sent a carrier pigeon explaining the whole situation, damned impressive how well those things can fly in the cold. You want in to look for something, right?\" Flavia turned to her guards and broke into a commanding yell. \"Oi! Boneheads! Open the door for our guests, and make it quick before these runts freeze to death!\" With that, the soldiers moved to open the iron gates into Ferox. Slowly, the large metal doors opened, allowing for Lucina to crawl in and Severa and Owain's carriage to easily enter. \"Alright,\" spoke the East-Khan, \"Shall we hurry to my quarters?\" The group quickly took Falvia's offer up with glee and entered the frozen country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavia's palace looked far from as regal as the castles of Ylisstol, Plegia, Valm, and even Maribelle's mansion, but still was a departure in style from the brick and wood homes that comprised Feroxi streets; the palace was comprised of stone and was lit by candle, having very few windows, and along each and every wall there was adorned various trophies, medals, shields, and blades, all symbols of victory from the various wars the country took part in and battles held in the Arena Ferox. In a large central dining chamber sat the party and Flavia, all feasting over a titanic plate of cooked meat and barrels of ale, all clearly made to match Lucina's size, discussing everything that related to the young princess' quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Space rocks, huh?\" spoke Flavia, drinking ale from a mug. \"Haven't heard anything about those around these parts, and we would easily know, around here, we have a lot of space used up by warrior barracks, citizen homes, and the best taverns to grace Ylisse. You shouldn't worry about our safety on that front.\" Flavia dipped her mug in an open barrel and took another huge swig of her drink. \"More importantly, you say you want to get to the northern parts of Ferox? Where all the old ruins are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct.\" answered Lucina, only taking a small sip of her barrel, not used to the taste of alcohol. \"We intended to go from settlement to settlement around there and ask for their advice. It is fortunate we ran into you first, so as we do not frighten whatever soldiers you may have up there. Khan Flavia, will you allow our journey further north?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Fraid not, little lady.\" replied the Khan, drinking more of her ale and taking a large crunch out of the steak before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?!\" chimed Severa, rudely, \"Don't you run this frosty wasteland or something?!\" Severa sneezed, everyone could tell the cold put her in a bad mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiesty one, aren't you?\" responded Flavia with a laugh. \"I'd love to help, don't get me wrong, but the tournament's coming up soon, and the Oaf's boasting about a new champion he's got; I'm not at all scared, but they're saying this champion's good, and I find myself short an outsider to use as champion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just ask Basilio if we could travel north in that case?\" inquired Gerome. \"I'm sure he won't deny Lucina's request after she saved his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, the Oaf's head would've been lodged on Walhart's axe by now if not for Lucina, so you're free to ask him, it's just that he has no information on your wife's...condition, so you'd probably scare him half to death and get the army all riled up.\" Everyone felt disheartened at this news, Flavia had a point. \"Now, if one of you could lend your skills to me for the ring and help me keep my title of Khan, then it'd make your journey far easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying is that we'll have to fight then?\" asked Gerome. Flavia nodded in affirmation while chugging down another spot of ale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this champion like?\" asked Cynthia, eyes twinkling with excitement. \"Are they a powerful samurai from a faraway land? The descendant of a great hero wielding a legendary blade? Ooh! Or maybe a swordsman who can see the future?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she always like this?\" asked Flavia to Lucina, concerned about the girl's overenthusiastic imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been like this since we were young,\" responded Lucina, \"But Cynthia's skills outweigh her imagination, I guarantee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\" Flavia cleared her throat. \"She showed up out of the blue one day, nobody knows where she came from. I met her at a feast with the Oaf's side of the kingdom once; she was young, yet boasted about being a master magician. She was pretty quirky, talking about stars and magic stones every other sentence, and she showed a lot of skin, even in this cold.\" Flavia moved her hand to her chin, pondering a thought. \"She said that she was \u2018A Warrior of Crimson from Another World\u2019; does that sound familiar to you time-travelers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'd remember a weirdo like that.\" responded Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, I need one of you to take this sorceress on in one-on-one combat, sword to tome. Lucina, you could probably take her on with one finger in just seconds flat, but I'd rather you don't compete and put all of Ferox on high alert. No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken, Khan Flavia.\" responded the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay with Lucina,\" chimed in Gerome, \"I'm powerless without Minerva alongside me, and I wish to keep Lucina safe while we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant, so I'm out.\" chimed in Severa. Owain shot up from his seat at the table and started shouting excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" he cried, \"That just leaves me! I'll cut down this traitor with the dazzling light of my blade and fury of my sword hand! I won't let you down Khan Flavia, seal my blade forever if fate wills me to lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" chimed Cynthia, \"Owain, not fair! You said I could take on a tournament of heroes as your apprentice when we were younger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you did! Gerome, he said that, right?\" Gerome said nothing, shaking his head in disapproval. \"Besides, I have this!\" Cynthia removed Falchion from its sheath and pointed it high. \"This is the same blade that Father won the last tournament with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's also the same blade that lost the last tournament, it's a 1-1 win to loss!\" responded Owain. \"My Missiletainn has no losses to its name, I should be the one to take this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you on right now you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, enough, save it for the Arena!\" shouted Flavia, breaking up the quarrel. \"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but we only need one champion for this, can't you two come to a decision?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea.\" said Lucina. She got up from her seated position and turned around, leaning back to let her long hair touch the floor. \"Pull on my hair, whoever draws the longest strand gets to compete in the tournament; it'll be like drawing straws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Lucy, are you sure? I don't want to hurt your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine Cynthia,\" responded the princess, \"I've trained for worse injuries than having my hair pulled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if you insist...\" responded Owain, as he grabbed one of Lucina's hairs, the size of a small rope, and Cynthia grabbed another. Both cousins started pulling hard, huffing and wheezing at the pull, amazed at how strong Lucina's hair became with its size. Flavia chugged her drink and let out a laugh, excited by the sport before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great!\" she said, turning to Lucina. \"Are you sure you don't want to be bigger a little longer? This could really whip my men into shape!\" Lucina laughed at the Khan's comments and leaned back further, hoping that would reduce the strain on her family as they pulled. As Owain and Cynthia continued to pull, Lucina's hair stands started to break from her mane, forming small tears like a rope would. Eventually, the strands gave way and Owain &amp; Cynthia flew back to the ground, the hair strands covering their bodies like long ropes. Everyone had gathered around the two to see who pulled the longest piece.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The electrifying aura of Arena Ferox had pierced the air; people cheered and fought amongst another as they waited for the main event to start in the stadium. In a gladiator's hall under the Arena's stands gathered Lucina and her party; a high barred window allowed for Lucina to view through at the fight and still stay hidden, her friends able to watch too if they sat upon her shoulders. On the floor underground stewed Owain, disappointed at his loss in Lucina's test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man!\" he cried, walking back and forth, \"I knew I should've put my 110% into that pull! If only I had pulled harder and closer to the base...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A loss is a loss, Owain.\" responded Lucina, smiling down at her cousin. \"I'm sure Cynthia will do just fine, and you can always compete in the next tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm going to be a father though, I can't just drop my little baby girl for a battle!\" Owain looked ready to cry, causing the others to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to introduce our little champion here,\" said Flavia, patting Cynthia on the back, \"Try not to stew too much, sword-boy, I'll let you take on my entire army if it'll make you feel better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that'd be okay...\" Cynthia drew Falchion and pointed it to Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'll come out winning Lucy, I swear on it! I don't care who this lady thinks she is!\" Lucina rubbed her finger across the dull edge of Falchion, stopping once she reached Cynthia's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, sister, I have no doubt you'll succeed.\" Cynthia sheathed Falchion once again and departed with Flavia to the Arena's East-Champion entry. Lucina turned to look at the rest of her family. \"Shall we watch the fight together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me out of it, heights don't agree with me.\" responded Severa. \"Owain, tell me how Cynthia's doing from up there, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" responded the dejected Myrmidon. He stepped on Lucina's palm and was raised to her shoulder, he sat upon it with his chin resting in his arms. Gerome soon followed Owain, sitting next to him with his arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wish Minerva could take flight in this hall, it feels strange not doing recon alongside her.\" Lucina smiled at Gerome's words, he really did love the wyvern like a close family member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be able to ride upon her soon, Gerome.\" responded the princess. \"For now, I'm happy you're here with me now.\" Gerome turned to Lucina and shot her a quick smile, before they both turned to watch the battle begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while had passed, the chatter of the crowds had finally ceased as the two Khans of Ferox gathered together within the middle of the Arena. Flavia locked her eyes with Basilio's one, the two smiled at each other and glared, like two wolves ready to fight over alpha status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, if it isn't the One-Eyed Oaf of the West!\" spoke Flavia. \"Did you not learn your losses from last time, or do you wish to make a fool of yourself in front of Ferox once more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've certainly become wiser, you crusty siren!\" Basilio responded. \"I could easily take whoever you got in mere seconds, but rules are rules, so I have a strong mage ready to do my job for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I'd like to see!\" The two Khans locked knuckles with each other, as if to recognize each other's strength in their rivalry, before breaking away to introduce their champions. \"Alright, you're up!\" shouted Flavia to the doors behind her. On cue, out burst Cynthia, breaking into a sprint before sliding into the center ring on her knees, throwing flower petals in her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready Basilio, for I have arrived; Cynthia, Defender of Truth, Justice, and Love! Throw all you got at me, this one's for East-Ferox!\" shouted Cynthia as she pointed to the stands. Despite the crowd's cheers, the cheesy entrance nearly made Flavia topple over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Har Har Har! Your champion certainly is enthusiastic!\" Basilio wiped a tear from his eye before calming his composure. \"I kid, it's great to see you again Cynthia! How's that sister of yours doing? I hope she came to visit old Uncle Basilio and cross blades too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" responded Cynthia, chuckling, \"That's going to be a bit of a problem...\" The West-Khan wondered what that could've meant, but shrugged it off to introduce his champion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must've heard the rumors yourself, so here she is! My prized Sorceress!\" Out the door from behind him slowly walked out a young girl draped in a dark cloak. Her solemn look broke into a smile as she threw the cloak from her body, white doves flying from her cloak, as if it were a magic show. The young Sorceress had raven-black hair and she wore a black and yellow bra decorated with black diamonds, yellow underwear, a see-through bodysuit only covering her stomach, black and yellow open-toed high-heeled boots, a yellow cape, and a yellow headdress. She waved her hands up into the air and addressed the cheering crowd, mostly men cheering at her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I'm an entertainer!\" she spoke with childlike glee. \"I'll be your champion for tonight West-Ferox, and I promise to bring back the rule to your one and only Khan! Let's enjoy tonight's show!\" She clapped her hands together and formed an array of flowers from them, before throwing them in the air. \"Showtime!\" The young girl snapped her fingers and the flowers exploded into fireworks, causing the crowd to cheer even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly picked a good jester candidate, Oaf, let's just hope she doesn't cower at the sight of a piece of steel!\" Flavia once again locked fists with Basilio before the two departed from the ring. The Sorceress had readied her tome from her cape and took a fighting pose with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May the Goddess of Luck shine upon you today, Blue Warrior, for the stars declare that this win shall belong to me!\" Cynthia looked at her opponent puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's kinda weird, she looks just like Aunt Lissa...\"</i> Cynthia shook off the thought and drew Falchion, taking a stance imitating Lucina's movements. \"I've heard of you, 'Crimson Warrior', and I don't intend to lose, I have someone to protect! Now, do you have a name for my blade to take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Name?!\" The Sorceress froze up, and stammered in a panic for a moment, sweating profusely from the head. \"Um, uh, m-my name is, uh, H-Henry...etta. Yeah, that's it! Henrietta!\" The girl took her stance again, Cynthia only looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hiding something, aren't you?\" The girl looked shocked at Cynthia's comments. \"...Nah, must be my imagination at work again!\" The young Sorceress sighed in relief and locked eyes with her opponent again. After a few seconds, the two charged at each other, sword and spells ready to clash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you make of this?\" asked Lucina, watching from behind her window. Gerome put his hand to his chin and pondered for a moment, taking in the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to say, I can't hear what they're saying from over here, but she seems very...energetic.\" Gerome wanted to say \"crazy\", but his mouth would not let him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean she looks cute enough though.\" chimed in Owain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not be thinking of leaving me for that woman!\" yelled Severa from the ground floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't dare dream of it, Severa!\" responded Owain, trying to calm down his wife. \"Though it is kind of strange,\" said Owain, looking back at the two girls fighting, \"Her face looks a little familiar, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Owain,\" replied Lucina, \"But I can't see it very well with all the action going on. Do you know her from somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Nah, I'm probably just overthinking it.\" All three went back to watching the battle unfold before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roaring Tempest!\" Cynthia dodged to her left to avoid the huge stream of wind coming at her. She jumped in the air, ready to drive Falchion down into her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naga's Revenge!\" The woman teleported out of the way, appearing behind Cynthia. A shadow of a large arm brandishing a cutlass came from the girl's tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abyss Puppet!\" Cynthia turned and locked blades with the paper-thin shadow; she stared into her rival's eyes deeply. \"Well,\" started the Sorceress, \"It seems you are not uncommon to the practice of signature moves! The seeing stones spoke of a rival like you, I respect your might in the art!\" The Sorceress stomped the ground and a pillar of fire shot up from the ground under Cynthia, breaking her clash with Sorceress. \"However, you are still 18 years short from defeating me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that, you spooky magician!\" Cynthia charged towards the Sorceress again and clashed blades with her shadowy puppet again. \"Though, after I win this, you should try joining our Justice Cabal back in Ylisstol! I have a cousin who acts a lot like you do, you'd just love him! He's married though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you up on that offer, O Azure Knight! But on the name of my Father's honor, I shall not lose this battle! I've travelled across worlds in order to prove myself here!\" The two broke away from their clash and the Sorceress started launching fireballs and lightning bolts at Cynthia. The Pegasus Knight snaked around the attacks and moved in to close the distance once more, the Sorceress prepared more shadow puppets from her tome once more to prepare for the oncoming clash.</span></div></div>",

The sorceress continued moving back as quickly as she could, continuing to launch blasts of dark magic, however skilled as she was, she could not match Cynthia's speed. Even with her shadow puppets and acrobatic movements, Cynthia had no trouble keeping close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHADOW DRAG- AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to call out another spell but was interrupted by the sting of Cynthia's lance. The sorceress tried again, but was hit by a follow up attack, this one sending her to the ground. Cynthia held her lance over the sorceress, sure  as victory as she was, she still wanted to be ready for any possible trickery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surrender, sorceress!\" Cynthia yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" she looked around any possible escape, but with Cynthia's lance hanging over her their was none. \"I yield!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavia stood to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the winner is Cynthia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd on her side cheered, as did Lucina and the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress pouted, folding her arms across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia offered her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put up a good fight, those spells stung! And you had such cool names for them! But no one's better at beating mages than use Falcon Knights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the sorceress took her hand and Cynthia helped her too her feet. However the sorceress was still unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wanted to win for mom and dad! And I didn't even get to show off everything I could do with Missiletainn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir was some angry yelling from the crowd. Flavia clenched her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basillo wouldn't have... there's no way she's from our clans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera and Owain's eyes grew wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she say-\" Owain stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missletainn!\" Severa yelled. \"Like that sword you carry around? How many people would name their weapon that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia took no notice, remaining her cheerful self as she tugged the sorceress around..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're mom and dad would still be proud if their watching. I mean you lost but you put on a great show! Just because I beat you it doesn't mean you aren't strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that offer to join that Justice Cabal is still on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress brightened up at that, clapping her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I always wanted to fight for justice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer slow walk suddenly gained a spring. Cynthia smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd be glad to have you! By the way what did you say your name was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophellia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain and Severa gasped. Severa glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does dressing up and travelling through time run in your family or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain ignored her, running out and vaulting over the barricade to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophellia!

Ophelia swung her raven hair around, adopting a solemn expression, and slowly turned to this new foe. \"Hark! An enemy beckons my name! Prepare to taste purgatory, fie- DADDY?!\" Ophelia turned to face Owain with wide eyes, watching the Myrmidon pant and huff, trying to regain composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hark!\" he cried, \"My daughter comes from across time to meet me! Mere words cannot express my joy at her appearance!\u201d Owain coughed and wheezed as he tried to recover from his sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Daddy!\" cried Ophelia, burying her face into Owain's chest. She snorted and sniffled as she spoke to him, her words came out obscured by snot bubbles. \"I-I've missed you! I-I came back through time! A-And, I'm so glad to see you again!\" As she cried like a baby, Flavia came up and grabbed both Owain and Cynthia and drug them off to the coliseum halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, save the waterworks for outside the ring! You got some things to discuss!\" The four left through the door, leaving some of the crowd chattering and confused, but the Easterners mainly glad their Khan keeps rule again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy smokes!\" shouted Ophelia, looking at Lucina's large frame, \"Is that the crown princess?! How did you get so big?! And when did you come back through the Gate?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain my situation later,\" explained Lucina, \"But more importantly, I'm not the crown princess you know, I am another Lucina, from a different time, one separate from yours.\" Ophelia looked one part confused by her words, another part amazed by her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you even doing crossing through timelines?!\" barked Severa. \"Don't you know that's dangerous?! We nearly bit it when we came back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mommy!\" cried Ophelia, hugging Severa tightly, \"I never meant to worry you, but I- Wait, what? 'Came back?' Are you from the future too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We probably should mention that to our Ophelia...\" mumbled Owain, scratching his head. He cleared his throat, and puffed out his chest. \"But yes, dear daughter! We are all warriors from a doomed future! Travelling through time to save the world as you know it, for innocent children like you to live and love in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really get it...\" replied the Dark Mage, \"But I guess if you say it, it makes sense. After all, you two aren't...\" Ophelia mumbled out that last bit, enticing confusion from all present. Cynthia swung her arm around Ophelia's neck and joyfully responded to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this means you're my niece, yeah? That's great, I have such a cute and heroic niece!\" Ophelia blushed and grinned wide at her aunt's comments, humbled by her kind words. \"Alright, let me introduce you to the Justice Cabal; I'm Cynthia, your aunt, a super-cool Pegasus Knight for Ylisstol! And that over there is my <i>really big</i> sister Lucina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you!\" spoke the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen the crown princess up so close before, she usually only stepped out for the Exalt's speeches and the Shepherd's exercise routines! You're so pretty!\" Lucina bowed her head at the Sorceress' words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're on a quest to shrink her back to normal right now, and it bought us to you, so you must be important! That grump over there is her husband, Gerome; he looks tough, but he's a true hero and Justice Cabal founder!\" Gerome blushed and looked away, waving his arm to greet the time traveler. \"And those two over there are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know them!\" Ophelia interrupted, voice filled with whimsy. \"Those are the greatest and most heroic performers Ylisse, nay, the world has seen; my Daddy and Mommy, Owain and Severa! Their shows brought smiles to all who viewed them! They truly are the greatest Troupe to ever live!\" Owain puffed out his chest, ego stimulated by his daughter's words, Severa just crossed her arms and looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed,\" she responded, \"That's one way to introduce your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, I'm just so excited!\" Ophelia cried. \"I spent my whole life trying to be a great entertainer, like Daddy wanted, so I trained with Uncle Henry and Aunt Sully to become an expert magician and performer! I can cast magic while riding a trapeze!\" Severa couldn't help but cringe when she heard the words \"Uncle Henry\", she still thought that guy was a total lunatic, he must've rubbed off on her somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still haven't answered us though,\" chimed in Flavia, \"Why come to the past in the first place? And why fight for the Oaf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" stammered Ophelia, \"I can't really get into it, because Uncle Henry said 'Messing with time and telling people about the future could mess everything up real nice!', but you know, I guess I just really wanted to see my parents again. I fought for Khan Basilio to train for new material is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sweet.\" commented Lucina. \"But Ophelia, don't be afraid to open up to us on anything, I had the same fears you once had with my Father, but all turned out for the better in the end once I told him of our future. If you ever want to talk, just talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters,\" chimed Severa, \"What's with that outfit? What's with all that skin you're showing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it? This is my \"Performer from the Stars\" outfit!\" Ophelia spun around to show off her outfit. \"I made it myself: Uncle Henry said good Sorcerers wear little clothes to move easier and Big Sis Kjelle said good warriors show off their muscled bodies, so I used both their advice to make this! What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to clobber those two...\" commented Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it looks terrific!\" commented Owain. \"The shining yellow really complements your magic, and the black diamonds really scream 'Behold, my demonic servants!' when they reflect the shadows from your book! And your body is so well toned too; I've never been more proud, you're definitely a true hero!\" Ophelia squealed and hugged her father, jumping up and down while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! I knew Uncle Henry was right when he sent me to live with that family of wolves for 2 years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! That's it!\" shouted Severa. \"We're keeping our child the hell away from that nutjob when she's born!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ophelia, how about it?\" asked Cynthia, \"Wanna come with us to help fix up your Aunt Lucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" shouted the Sorceress, jumping in the air with her fist pumped high. \"I could check Missiletainn's spells and see if we could shrink her down! Now <i>that</i> would be a real magical trick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you really do that?\" asked Lucina. \"Is your magic that good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I dunno. But I could give it a try! A good entertainer always gives a new act a try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect no success, usual magic has had no effect on me so far, but I would appreciate your help.\" Ophelia whipped out her tome and flipped through the pages, looking for a hex that could shrink something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, nope, nope, nu-uh...There's this one right here for hair growth, I could try it in reverse.\" Lucina felt her heart sink a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, thank you for trying Ophelia, we'll just continue our journey for the shrinking elixir since we've come this far.\" Ophelia's eyes lit up with stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on a journey for a <i>shrinking elixir</i>?!\" she cried in awe. \"That sounds so COOL! You just <i>have</i> to let me come along! I could make a nice show out of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, you're always welcome to join.\" responded the princess with a smile. The Sorceress started bouncing up and down with glee, happy that she gets to travel with her family from the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great and all,\" commented Flavia, \"But could we discuss this back at my quarters? I don't want people seeing Lucina like this and causing a sce-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Flavia!\" came the shouts of Basilio from down the hall. \"What's the damned big idea, stealing my champion away after the fight's over?!\" He stomped down the hall, the noise reverberating with sounds of fury from off the walls. \"I swear woman, I could knock you out right now if you so wis- HOLY HELL!\" Basilio's only good eye nearly popped out of his socket as he laid it upon Lucina's giant figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello, Khan Basilio,\" she spoke, \"How do you fare these days?\" Basilio took some time to compose himself before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what you meant then Cynthia! Geez, don't scare me like that! My heart's not as young and sharp as my mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" laughed Flavia. \"Your mind is sharp as a brick if you react to a woman like that!\" She began to head towards the exit to retreat back to her palace. \"I'll throw you a bone, Oaf, join us for a feast tonight in honor of my victory, and we'll fill you in on Lucina's condition and your champion's true identity.\" With those words, everyone departed from the Arena Ferox and stealthily retreated to the palace before the Arena halls and city streets filled with Feroxi citizens.</span></div></div>",

Maybe someone will show up in a box with a device from the future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if we end up a hotspot for time travellers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shouldn't be likely. We came back to stop the Grimleaf, and Ophelia came back to stop.. something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you come back to stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you, Uncle Henry told me not to tell too many people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Why? Don't tell me I kick the bucket again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's nothing like that. And I can't tell people because Henry said the knowledge would change how people would act and those changed actions could affect other things I can't see like some kind of butterfly of doom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I came from the future I kept a low profile at first, but when I joined the Shepards I had to let people know who I was and where I was from and as far as I'm aware, my precsne did not cause any harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Uncle Henry insisted and I don't want to take any chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let us know if anyone's going to kick the bucket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia hesitated, but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome had been riding Lucina's shoulder and shuffled closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea why she could have come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's obviously come back to prevent something that happened her time. Maybe someone targeted her mom or dad, or an ancient evil wakes up or a war breaks out. As of now I can only guess.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"To victory!\" Flavia raised her mug of mead high in the air, exciting cheers from Feroxi warriors gathered in the palace. The Khan drank from her mug and laughed, clearing her throat to address her crowd. \"And now, a special treat; A public speech from the Oaf-Khan himself, Basilio!\" The dark-skinned warrior begrudgingly walked up on the stage, lips clammed shut with a annoyed expression on his face. \"Go ahead, I'm waiting.\" Basilio sighed and got ready to humiliate himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men, comrades, brave warriors. I stand before you not as the West-Khan, but as a Fool, a Dummy, and most importantly...an Oaf. As you drink and feast tonight, may you please yourself with the thought that you all have a sharper mind than this old moron, and may you all appreciate the thought that I was bested by a small, lightweight girl.\" The Feroxi warriors laughed uproariously, as did Flavia, at Basilio's speech; a vein looked ready to pop on the West-Khan's forehead. \"Alright woman, I did your speech, now where's my mead?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did good Oaf! Here; best mead in the land, straight from the Northern Brewery!\" Flavia extended a mug to Basilio and he accepted it in turn, chugging it quickly, hoping the alcohol would help him forget the embarrassment of loss and making a fool of himself. The feast kicked off with roaring celebration, Lucina's friends &amp; family quickly integrated themselves in the celebration with no troubles; Feroxi warriors gathered around Cynthia to celebrate their champion as she posed with Falchion and various lances, Owain and Severa ate from the vast plates of meat and swapped stories of war between the rugged men around them, and Ophelia had gathered a large crowd around her as she put on a wonderful magic show for everyone, some men wowed by the show, others just eyeing up her skimpy outfit. Lucina and Gerome sat by a wall, happily drinking and eating together, Gerome rested upon the princess' shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels nice to have a moment to ourselves.\" said Lucina with a smile, sipping a barrel of mead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Gerome, \"Evidently the warriors of Ferox are far more interested in strong warriors than a giant woman. A proud bunch.\" Gerome took a leg of chicken from his platter and extended it to Lucina, intending to feed his wife; the princess opened her mouth and Gerome threw the whole drumstick in, Lucina didn't even chew as she quickly swallowed the small snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cute at parties, do you know that?\" Lucina's comment caused Gerome to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only look out for your well-being. I'm more than happy to give you my food if you so wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say Gerome.\" Lucina rubbed her finger on Gerome's head, stroking his hair as if he were a small rodent. \"We should set out in the morning and search the settlements nearby for a guide into the ruins. I'm glad Aunt Lissa pointed us in the right direction, but we'll still be lost unless we have a town elder to further direct us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your family truly is amazing, Lucina. I'm...glad to be a part of it.\" Gerome cracked a small smile as he said this, causing Lucina to giggle in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, you <i>do</i> enjoy being part of the family! It's going to be fun spending the holiday season with you, Father, and Mother!\" Lucina looked down at herself again. \"Well...provided I become normal again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophelia expressed surprise at your size, did she not?\" replied Gerome. \"If this timeline is a base, then wouldn't that imply you don't remain this size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate your efforts to cheer me up Gerome, but that was the other me who she referred to, the baby back in Ylisstol. I might just be stuck a giantess with you and Minerva in Wyvern Valley.\" Lucina placed her hand to her chin for a moment before resuming her thoughts. \"Which reminds me, we'll have to restock our tablecloths and bedsheets on the way back home. Perhaps Maribelle could make me some more outfits to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wish to keep you positive, Lucina. I promise to find you a cure for this, no matter how much rest it deprives me.\" Gerome looked at his platter, noticing it was empty. \"Shall we refill our plate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.\" Lucina responded, smiling at her husband. She crawled towards the large carts of meat with Gerome hanging onto her scarf, ready to refill her stomach with meat and share merry stories with the others along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long and arduous journey, Tiki and Say'ri reached Mount Prism with their meteor chunk in tow, ready to consult Naga for her sage wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lady,\" Say'ri asked, carrying the chunk in her large hand like a small baseball, \"Are you positive this will work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, no.\" responded the Manakete. \"But we owe it to Lucina to try for her sake, especially after all she's done for us. Her growth has not seemed to affect her well-being negatively, but regardless, life as a giant could become lonely, she could be shunned by a society who sees her as different; I know first-hand how it feels to be different from others.\" Say'ri knew Tiki's near-immortality had always made it hard for her to make friends, so helping those who could be seen as different, like the half-Manakete, half-human Nah, had always been a passion of hers. Tiki stepped forward and took a knee in front of the temple's dragon statue and light-emitting mirror, effigies to the Divine Dragon Naga. \"O Naga,\" she spoke, \"Please hear my call! A new phenomenon has entered our world, I seek your divine wisdom to diffuse this matter!\" Upon command, appearing in a sacred blue fire, came the apparition of a green-haired Manakete some referred to as a Goddess; the Divine Dragon, Naga, whom was also Tiki's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiki, my child,\" spoke the Manakete to her daughter, \"You have grown so much from the infant you once were. I can see your spirit; you seem to have met many interesting and good-hearted comrades, I am gladdened by your experiences. Speak, why have you come seeking my advice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O Naga, we come bearing a tool from beyond this world.\" As if on command, Say'ri placed the meteor between Tiki and the apparition of Naga to illustrate her friend's speech. \"Its power is to mutate the body of humans and turn them into giants. It has affected a hero of this realm, as well as my close friend Say'ri, and I fear it may affect more humans.\" The meteor was raised into the air by telekinetic power, and was pulled to the Naga's view. She looked upon Say'ri, the princess kneeled before Naga in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend appears to be three times your size. Is this the norm of this stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my lady,\" responded Tiki, \"The hero I spoke of has become enormous, ten times the size of a regular human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ask of you now, O Naga; can your divine powers reverse the effects of this mutation? We wish to create a stone to seal the power of growth, as you have done with the Dragonstones of our brethren?\" Tiki and Say'ri waited a moment through silence for Naga to answer them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Millennia ago, the Dragonstones were created by the powers of the Dragon Tribe Elders, it was not I alone who was responsible.\" Tiki felt disheartened at this news. \"However, I can see what you wish to accomplish, and it is possible. Tiki, my child, if you truly wish to cure the giants of their curse, than you must do this quest.\" Tiki raised her head, alert at her mother's words. \"I wish for a full mass of stone and a giant to appear before me; from this, I can analyze the situation and use my powers and yours to create a cure for your hero in due time. Do you understand, Tiki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, O Naga! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall leave it to you then, go now.\" Tiki and Say'ri turned to leave the temple. \"Tiki, my child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, O Naga?\" asked Tiki, turning to face her mother once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, good luck!\" Naga gave her child a peace sign with her fingers and smiled warmly at her, before disappearing into the blue flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nah was right,\"</i> thought Tiki, <i>\"Naga is kind of lame.\"</i> As the two exited the temple, Tiki spoke to Say'ri about the new plan. \"So we're going to need a full-sized giant and a larger meteor. I'm out since we need my powers, and I don't know where Lucina is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady,\" responded Say'ri, \"Do you require for me to grow again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the question,\" responded Tiki, \"I'm not putting you through that again, nor Lucina if we need a new meteor. I hate to say it, but we're going to need to grow someone else. Preferably a female for the effects of the Giantstone to work 100% with Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, my lady. Do you have anyone in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Tiki responded, trying to think who'd be best. \"We know where Maribelle is, but she'd probably deck me for suggesting her to grow, and while Queen Sumia would do anything for her child, abducting and mutating Ylisstol's Queen could put us in hot water. Regardless, we'll figure something out. Shall we depart to look for a meteor in Ylisse, Say'ri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lady.\" On that, Tiki shifted into her dragon form again, now prepared to carry the weight of her friend, and allowed Say'ri to grab her legs. The two took flight, and even though Tiki could carry her friend easier with the experience of it fresh on her body, the Manakete couldn't stop from huffing and wheezing as she struggled to soar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We're taking some stops for food on the way...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sumia stood in a stable out in the courtyard of Castle Ylisstol, brushing the Pegasi of the Pegasus Knight squadron. Before becoming the Queen of Ylisse, Sumia was once an accomplished Pegasus Knight herself, with an amazing natural ability to calm the animals around her and a great skill in flying the horses that transferred to her daughter; even after Chrom responded to her crush on him with a marriage proposal, Sumia still flew the path of a Knight in the war against Valm and Grima, her skills as good as ever. Even as peace set in Ylisse and her royal duties increased, Sumia's natural talent around the Pegasi did not dull, as did not her skills as a Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now Marcia, would you like an apple?\" spoke Sumia to one of the Pegasi while brushing its mane. She fed the winged horse and turned to another, ready to brush it too. \"And how about you Fiora? Have you been keeping up on your baths?\" Sumia sat upon a pail and begun brushing the horse's mane, not caring of the thick white hairs falling upon her royal blue dress. As she stroked the Pegasi's neck, another behind her started neighing at something outside, causing an uproar in the stables. \"Ferry? What's wrong girl? Is there something outside?\" Sumia ran out to see what all the commotion was and was met with the sight of a dragon and an Amazon touching down in the courtyard; Tiki and Say'ri. Tiki shifted back to her human form as Sumia ran out to meet the two. \"Oh, Tiki &amp; Say'ri! Welcome back! I thought a couple brigands snuck into the castle for a moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you again, Queen Sumia.\" said Say'ri as she and Tiki began to bow before her. Sumia just giggled in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no need to be so formal with me! We're friends, forget about the 'Queen' stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sumia.\" responded Tiki. The Manakete cleared her throat as she prepared a question for Sumia. \"We were just in the neighborhood, and we were wondering; Is your daughter, Cynthia, around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry you two,\" responded the royal, \"She just left with Lucina to Regna Ferox, you missed her by a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast, we'll have to fly back north again.\" Tiki removed her Dragonstone from her satchel and prepared to shift forms again. \"Thanks for your help Sumia, we didn't mean to bother you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" shouted Sumia, arm extended as she ran towards the two. She tripped over a root and hit the ground, prompting Tiki and Say'ri to stop their departure help hoist her back up. \"Thanks for that, my dumb little feet...\" Sumia wiped the dirt and grass from her face before continuing. \"What do you two need Cynthia for anyways? Is it about Lucina? Is she going to be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, my lady,\" responded Say'ri, \"But we cannot divulge, there's no reason to involve more people in this.\" Sumia clasped her hands together and pleaded the two to answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please tell me!\" she cried, giving her best puppy dog eyes. \"I need to know if my baby's going to be alright! Please tell me she will!\" Tiki sighed, there was no way of getting out of this one, she had to divulge everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine.\" she replied begrudgingly. The Manakete faced Sumia and gave her a solemn expression. \"Lucina will be fine, we've consulted Naga and found a way to cure for her, but to do this, we need a fresh meteor and a candidate willing to become a giant. Cynthia is the closest link we could think of to Lucina, so as much as it pains us, we've chosen her as our candidate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful!\" cried Sumia with joy, \"Lucina's going to be happy to become small again!\" Sumia quickly lost the joy of her previous expression though as the rest of the explanation set in. \"But, does this mean Cynthia will have to live huge now? What about her Pegasus? Her job as Captain? Brady? Wouldn't this ruin her life while helping Lucina's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me Sumia, we don't wish for this to happen.\" responded Tiki, looking distressed. \"Naga told us we need someone as a test subject for this experiment. From what I understand, the meteor only mutates the body to cause rapid growth, so while we need just a female to replicate Lucina's situation, we figured a blood relative would be more willin-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\" interrupted Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" responded Tiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia, you can't be serious! You have a kingdom to rule over with Chrom, we couldn't just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dead serious.\" responded the Queen. \"I wish for my children the happiness they were deprived of in the future, how could Cynthia have that when she's as big as a building? I'd be more than happy to give my happiness away for theirs.\" Sumia adopted a more happy look to break the moment's tension. \"Besides, Castle Ylisstol is huge! I'm sure Chrom wouldn't mind if I slept outside his room instead of in bed with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess you have a point there.\" responded Tiki. \"I'm sorry Sumia, forgive me for such selfish words. I should've factored in Cynthia's future rather than prioritize Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine! Really!\" responded Sumia as she gave Tiki a small hug. \"I'm just happy that you we're worried for me!\" Sumia moved past the two and began to walk towards the castle interior. \"Let's just let Chrom in on the situation before we do this, okay?\" The two nodded and began following the royal as she went to consult her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to turn Sumia into a giantess to help cure Lucina?\" Chrom sat upon an armchair in the library as the three girls explained the whole situation to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, my lord.\" responded Tiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All we need is to expand Lady Sumia and bring the raw material of the meteor with us to Mount Prism.\" added on Say'ri. \"From there, Naga will craft an instrument similar to a Dragonstone or Beaststone to allow the user to become normal-sized again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" said Chrom. He looked upon his wife to ask for her input. \"Sumia, are you really okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, Lucina's well-being is far more important than mine. Besides, it'll just be a quick big-and-small trip, right? It's not like feeding or clothing me will suddenly become a huge issue or anything.\" Chrom got up from his seat and rested Sumia's hands in his, he looked deep into his wife's eyes with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a very caring person, do you know that? You're far too good for me.\" Sumia blushed at his words and giggled at him. \"Just make sure you don't roll over to your stone in the middle of the night and grow on top of me, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Chrom!\" Sumia replied. She removed her hands from Chrom's and gave him a big hug. Tiki broke up the moment by clearing her throat, bringing the attention of the two onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to break up the moment, but we need to get rolling on this whole plan if we want Lucina small soon. We need to find a meteor somewhere around here, otherwise we're going to have to go to Valm and grab one. I'm sure the shower wasn't just restricted to Valm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sent the Shepherds on the task after Lucina left.\" responded Chrom. \"I promised her I'd make sure nobody is affected negatively by this. We've already received reports of green glowing stones around the continent and set up quarantine zones to keep villagers from touching them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Tiki?\" asked Sumia, \"Lucina said her rock burst and scattered when it was activated, wouldn't we need a barrier to stop the shards from scattering too far if I were to touch it?\" Tiki froze, she definitely forgot to add that to the equation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sumia, I completely forgot about that part! We wouldn't want two giants to worry about!\" Tiki laughed and rubbed her head, everyone else was a little baffled on how the Voice of the Divine Dragon could have such an empty head. \"I doubt a physical barrier would keep, and it'd be uncomfortable for you to grow out of a wooden box, so we're going to need a magic user to help us on this.\" Tiki sighed as she ran over the candidates in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have someone in mind?\" asked Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...Well, yes...\" responded Tiki. She sighed once more and shook her head, she knew this wouldn't be easy. \"I told Maribelle about the whole Giantstone project we were working on, so she'd be more willing to help us, but she might just bust a vein if I come to her with more talk of giants. To be honest, I probably would've risked asking her to grow if you didn't know where Cynthia was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then shall we leave to Themis?\" asked Chrom. He didn't want to show it, but he was a little excited to hang out with Robin some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, at once.\" The four left the library to prepare the journey, Tiki stopped as they walked a few steps down the hall. \"Lord Chrom, you wouldn't happen to have a carriage, would you? Carrying Say'ri around has become a little...tiring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" shouted Say'ri, feeling inadequate about her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry,\" responded Chrom, \"I'll have to let Frederick know I'm leaving anyways so he can keep charge while we're gone. We'll prepare a carriage to ride to Themis with at the stables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness...\" responded Tiki. With that, the four continued on to request Maribelle's services.</span></div></div>",

She asked if Basillo knew anything that could help her, striking up the conversation quickly enough that he would sober enough to reply coherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrinking Elxir? Sounds like a children's story. Then again I'd have said the same thing about a giant woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know this Arkhe- whatever place your on about, but after everything you've done the least I can do is lend you a guide. Well the least I can do is nothing, but I'll go one better! Ha ha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So come on, why not make the most of the occasion? Your companions certainly have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome gestured to the main floor, where she could see Owain, Ophellia and Cynthia, red in the face, laughing and chatting loudly. Gerome and Severa were more subdued, Gerome watching Lucina cautiously and acting aloof towards anyone else, while Severa wore her usual scowl, cautiously sampling the food on offer, while refusing any drink stronger than water, placing her hand on the bump in her stomach if anyone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fear it would require a lot of alchoal before I felt anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasillo slapped her on the back. Gerome's  eyes narrowed, but he said nothing, while Basillo didn't even notice his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You don't know  how strong our mead is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina took a cautious sip, still draining almost half the mug. Her eyes widened when she felt it's kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stronger the anything I've tasted at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is! No one is tougher than us Ferox!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the festivities really kicked off with Lucina joining the fray, all the Feroxi warriors began to get heavily drunk and started singing songs of war with each other; Cynthia and Owain were quick to join them, both proving to be lightweights to alcohol after a mug or two of ale. The Feroxi warriors caught sight of Lucina and began to demand arm wrestles, the term \"wrestle\" being taken quite literally, as it came down to each challenger trying unsuccessfully to pin down Lucina's pointer finger to the floor, ejecting much laughs after watching each challenger fail to subdue the giant. Around the 11th drunk man, Gerome got upset at the warriors treating his wife like a circus attraction and offered to take on everyone in the room in arm wrestling - Lucina thought Gerome's display of affection was cute, but she didn't find it too impressive considering it was one sober man against hundreds of drunkards. Lucina sat down and leaned against a wall to drink a barrel of Feroxi mead as she watched her husband's challenge, but before she could take a sip, she felt the tug of Severa's arm against the hem of her tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too drunk,\" she spoke to the princess, \"I'm gonna need you sober for a little chat with my daughter later. Look.\" Severa pointed at the young magician's face, staring more intently at Owain then watching the action on the floor. \"I've been watching, she's not a drinker. She's hiding something about the future she came from, I intend to find out what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Severa, why need me?\" asked Lucina. \"Ophelia's your daughter, I'm sure she'll confide in you easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, like when you told Chrom how a dragon was going to kill everyone he knew and loved?\" Lucina cringed at Severa's remark; it was rude but she had a point. \"Look, I'm not dumb, I can see the girl went gaga over the sight of you, she clearly idolizes you as a person, even if it's not the exact you she saw. I figure she'll easily give up info for the caring Princess of Ylisse rather than her yelling, cranky mother, plus you could easily grab her if she runs off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Severa, just call me over when you need me.\" Lucina responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Luce,\" replied Severa with a smile, \"Now go cheer on your hubby, he's 43-0 right now!\" Lucina moved back to the floor to cheer on Gerome's arm conquest, but kept a close eye on Ophelia for the rest of the night, eyes still glued to Owain and vision moving over to Severa at random intervals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the night came, a grand majority of Feroxi warriors had found themselves passed out on the main hall of the Eastern Palace, making it impossible for anyone else to move around there. Flavia had allowed Lucina's party guest bedrooms to stay in, save Lucina who was too big for the room, so she had opted for the hall outside the rooms with a tarp to blanket and keep warm with. While Gerome normally slept with Lucina, she had urged him to actually sleep in a bed by himself tonight, arguing that her chest wasn't a good substitute for a soft bed. Ophelia had helped Cynthia and Owain to beds themselves and went off to go fetch her mother, intending to sleep with both of them; wandering the halls, the two raven-haired girls had met up with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!\" cried Ophelia, who's overwhelming joy dropped as she tried to correct herself. \"Er, uh, should I say Severa, or Mother? I know it's kinda strange for a 19-year old to still be saying 'Mommy'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're way too joyful kid.\" responded Severa. \"I wanted to talk with you about that actually, me and my friend here. You know Princess Lucina.\" Lucina moved out from behind a corner to reveal herself and smiled at Ophelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Ophelia.\" The Srceress bowed elegantly in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my honor, Lady Lucina. I'm still not used to seeing you this up close, not to mention so big!\" Ophelia had adopted a normal stance once more. \"So, uh, Mother, what did you want to talk about? Got some advice for my magic? Some new outfit ideas? I got this mermaid one for a water show I was thinking about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing like that,\" responded Severa, \"But I am surprised how seriously you take your job, but glad how good you are at it. I take it we taught you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" replied Ophelia with glee. \"I learned all my magic from Uncle Henry, but you and Daddy, er, Father passed on the spirit of an entertainer to me, so I took what you practiced and made my own routines from it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive. So I take it you've performed with us, right?\" Ophelia froze up when Severa asked her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh, not exactly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Mother, I'm not really comfortable with this questioning, so I'm just going to go to bed with Father...\" Ophelia turned to go back to Owain's room. Severa snapped her fingers in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luce, restrain her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ophelia!\" Lucina reached her hand out and grabbed Ophelia, bringing the magician back before Severa and raised above the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Lucina! Please let me go! This is uncomfortable!\" Ophelia struggled to break out of Lucina's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now give me her tome.\" commanded Severa. Lucina begrudgingly removed Missiletainn from the Sorceress' person and handed it over to Severa. \"Now that I have a trump card in this debate, will you tell me what you really came back for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't!\" cried Ophelia, \"Uncle Henry said that talking about the future could ruin the past as we know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, then you wouldn't mind if I burned this instead, right?\" Severa walked over to a torch on the wall slowly, bringing shock to Ophelia and Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa!\" cried Lucina, feeling her friend was going to far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not Missiletainn! Please Mother, that was Uncle Henry's gift to me!\" Severa slowly moved her arm to move the book over the flames. \"Alright! I'll tell you! Please, just stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I wanted to hear.\" Severa snapped her fingers again, commanding Lucina to release Ophelia to the ground, and gave her back her tome. Ophelia took a deep breath before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she started, \"In the future, you and Father...died during a tour.\" Ophelia started shaking as she kept talking. \"I was only 5 years old and you two left me with Uncle Henry when you went to go perform in Valm, but there was a bad storm, your boat capsized, and...\" Tears started to well in her eyes as she continued. \"Grandma Lissa was going to take me in, but I just wanted to be a good performer like you two, so I stayed with Uncle Henry and practiced magic. He even taught me forbidden dark arts used for Risen summoning, but I couldn't find anything that could bring you two back like I knew you. When I became 19, Uncle Henry and Aunt Sully told me about the Outrealm Gate, so I thought if I could just see you two again, I could...We could...\" Severa interrupted Ophelia's tale with a big hug and wiped the tears from her daughter's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's</i> what got you so worked up? Us dying? So we'll just avoid boats, no biggie!\" Severa stared deeply into her daughter's eyes. \"Believe me, I know how hard it is to break to your parents that they ended up dead, I won't hold this against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mommy!\" Ophelia squeezed herself against Severa and started softly sobbing, prompting the mercenary to pat her back and beckon her it'll be okay; the scene hit too close to home with Lucina and it touched her heart deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more secrets now, okay? It's going to be okay, Ophelia.\" Severa broke her hug once Ophelia calmed down a little more. \"Now you know that once you came back through time, there was no going back, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" responded Ophelia, \"I made up my mind with everyone back in the future. I'm going to miss Uncle Henry, Aunt Sully, and Big Sis Kjelle, and I feel really bad for Grandma Lissa, but all I wanted was to see you and Daddy again. I hope I didn't upset you with all the secret keeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, your outfit gets me more upset than your secrets. I really don't think my girl should be running around in her underwear, but it's special to you, so I'll allow it. Just make sure you bundle up when we set out up north tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mommy, thank you!\" Ophelia turned around to Lucina. \"I won't let you down, Lady Lucina, I'll get you small again so you can enjoy my shows without taking up all the seats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Ophelia, I'm glad to have you aboard.\" answered the princess with a smile. \"Just keep in mind that if you have anything to say, just tell us. I've been in the same situation you and Severa were in too you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Your Highness.\" Ophelia turned to Severa. \"Mommy? Do I need to tell Daddy about this too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you feel like it, sweetie, I won't make you. And feel free to keep saying 'Mommy' and 'Daddy' however much you like, seeing as how you never really got the chance to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" With that, the three girls walked on back to their rooms, softly gossiping along the way, and prepared to get to bed. When they reached the rooms, Ophelia and Severa had climbed into bed with Owain and snuggled under the bedsheets together, the young magician kissing her mother and father goodnight, and Lucina pulled the tarp over her body, staring up at the soft moonlight and listening to Minerva's growls and snores in the stables outside before falling to sleep, ready to set out the following morning.</span></div></div>",

If I don't, someone else will have and I would do anything ot help our daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki looked solemn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your selflessness is admirable, but I must caution you. This is an experiment and I cannot guarantee results. There is a chance you will be stuck as a giantess forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia shivvered, chattering her teeth, then stood straight, trying  her best to appear brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I accept. If the worst comes to worse.... Ysitrol will just have to accept having a giant queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrome placed a hand on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will accept you at any size, no matter what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia smiled and hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh  Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But are you certain  you want to go through with this? We can keep searching for another way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia nodded resolutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. As I said, if its not me, it will be someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well I respect your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom arranged for a carriage that could accommodate them though Say'ri had to ride on the roof and spread her weight between two of them. She wasn't entirely happy with the arrangement, nor with not being able to sit next to Lady Tiki, but she endured it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally having a giant atop the carriage drew more than a few eyes, but Chrom was able to allay anyone's  fear, Ysitrol trusting in its rulers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making  the necessary preparations, they set off for Themis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her brave front, and Chrom comforting her, Sumia was tense, twitching the whole. However she noticed Chrom was much more relaxed. While he was clearly concerned about her, he also seemed... excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem unusually excited about this trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom looked out the window, as though admiring the scenery<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you looking forward to seeing Robin again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom turned to Sumia and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you know me well.

I mean socially not when someone turns into a giant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, though we do keep in touch by letter. Albiet less often than I should.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure they'll be glad to see us in the flesh.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maribelle sat at the tea table of her terrace staring at the night sky, now completely calm with the knowledge there would be no giants to spook her this night. It was a hectic set of days she worked for Lucina's sake, her resources of cloth and food had dwindled hard with the girl's stay, but Maribelle thought it was all worth it if it could make Lucina happy again; after all she did for the Shepherds, Ylisse, and the rest of the world, Lucina definitely deserved anything Maribelle could provide for her. Robin once again joined his wife at the table, dripping with sweat, coat removed, and with a small towel around his shoulders; he wiped his face down and helped Maribelle partake in her favorite blend of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" spoke the tactician, \"It took a bit of work, but I managed to get all the wine packed up and shipped out to the town, Ylisstol, and the Feroxi docks, so we're all set for the month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work Robin.\" answered Maribelle with a smile upon her face, happy business hadn't fumbled during their time with Lucina. \"The Themis Ball is next week, I assume that you have your tunic cleaned and pressed properly for the event?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" replied Robin, \"I went ahead and handled your dress too if that's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most excellent indeed! Robin, you truly do go one step beyond! It's no wonder I fell for your charms!\" Robin laughed in response, not expecting such an excited reaction from Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just do what I can to help out! I must admit though, my dancing is kind of rusty, I think the last time I danced was at our wedding. If you have some free time in the week, would you mind helping me re-learn my steps for the Ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Robin, we could practice right now! I feel so spirited now that I have the burden of giants off my shoulders!\" It wasn't even 5 seconds after the statement that a butler had opened the terrace door to address his masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame Maribelle, Master Robin,\" he spoke, \"Please excuse my interruption, but Lady Tiki wishes an audience with you. She carries the Exalt and Queen of Ylisstol with her, as well as Lady Say'ri.\" Maribelle had nearly broken her teacup in two at hearing this, while Robin got excited at the knowledge Chrom was visiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for gods sakes! What is it this time?!\" spoke Maribelle, already feeling like her week was going to be ruined. She stomped down the main stairs with Robin in tow and opened the door to her manor; there stood Tiki, the first thing Maribelle's view had rest upon. \"What do you want this time Tiki? I'm busy.\" Maribelle opened the door further and took notice of Chrom and Sumia, standing in front of Say'ri and their royal carriage. \"Ah, forgive me, my Lord, my Lady! I do not mean to be so rude tonight!\" Maribelle had bowed hurriedly to the royals, exciting a giggle from Sumia, while Robin caught sight of Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Chrom!\" spoke the tactician. He ran towards the Exalt and pulled him in for a friendly hug, Chrom gripping tightly in return. \"What are you guys doing here? I'm assuming it's related to Lucina, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Tiki, \"It's a bit of a long story, however, we have found a possible cure to Lucina's size and we need a mage with skill in barrier-erecting. Our first thought was you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so your little pet project finally bore fruit?\" inquired Maribelle. Tiki took no time in making herself comfy once more in the main parlor's armchair, and took some time to squeeze into the plush before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm, that's right, we can create a stone to let Lucina shift sizes with Naga's power, but for that, we'll need a test subject and whole mass of meteor.\" Maribelle looked ready to explode at the phrase \"test subject\", Tiki immediately picked up on her reddening face. \"Calm down! I didn't mean you! Lady Sumia offered to become our test subject, all we need is you and Robin to help us set up a barrier so we can easily pick up the pieces of rock.\" Maribelle had calmed herself at these words, Robin just looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, honey, you knew about this?\" he asked. \"What does this mean, Sumia's going to grow too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Sumia, facing Robin, \"It's going to be a strange experience, but I'm willing to do it if it'll make Lucina happy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already talked about it,\" added Chrom, \"I'm completely fine with it and I'll make sure Ylisstol's fine with it too; they already accept Sumia as a wise and loving Queen, I'm sure their opinion of her won't change when she's 60 feet tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Naga assures us the process will create a stone capable of shrinking the subject as well.\" added Say'ri, helping put Robin's worries to rest. \"Lady Sumia will only be giant for a short while, then she will be completely capable of shrinking back to normal and growing back to a giant whenever she wishes. I would be capable of the same with the process, however, my size dwindles to Lucina's, so my stone would not be able to shrink her to normal size.\" Robin took in the facts calmly and thought for a short while before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, it sounds like a good plan, but Sumia, you do realize Lucina's clothes were destroyed in her growth, right? Do you have anything prepared to wear once you become huge?\" Sumia froze and gasped, realizing the gravity of Robin's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she cried, \"That's right! Thanks Robin, that would've been a real problem!\" In truth, Sumia didn't mind if people saw her naked, it was just part of her personality of being one with nature, but she didn't want the children of Ylisstol to be looking upon her body and getting their minds corrupted by lewd thoughts. \"You wouldn't happen to have anything I could wear, would you? You made such a nice outfit for Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sumia,\" answered Robin, \"But we ran through the last of our cloth with Lucina's outfit. Yarn and linen are on a shortage this year because of poor weather conditions and a sheep flu going around, so it's going to be a while before we can craft any more clothes.\" The rest of the group walked into the mansion and Sumia started looking around for an alternative. Her eyes fixated on the curtains covering the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about those?\" Sumia pointed at the red cloths; Say'ri cringed, remembering her experience with trying to pull the curtains down, and Maribelle ran over to her curtains, holding her arms wide to indicate they were off-limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, absolutely not!\" she practically shouted. \"These curtains cost me an arm and a leg, I'm not giving them up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Maribelle,\" answered Chrom, \"I'm sure you'd say yes if Lissa asked you.\" He giggled at his joke while Maribelle froze up, a little embarrassed by the comment. \"I promise to buy you some new curtains, the best in all of Ylisse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really mean it, my Lord?\" responded the noble, \"I don't wish to squander your funds for my needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, it's no problem.\" Maribelle let down her defensive stance at Chrom's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright then. But I'd rather it not be these curtains; Lady Sumia, is there not any other cloth you could use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" asked Sumia, \"Do you have anything in purple or pink? I like colors like those the best.\" Maribelle sighed, the dining hall curtains were a plain lavender, the only ones in Sumia's favorite colors, but they were her favorites and some of the first she brought to break into her new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some in the dining hall, please, follow me so we may take them down.\" Sumia trailed behind Maribelle as they walked down the halls to the dining hall, leaving the other four to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tiki,\" asked Robin, \"Do you have a fresh meteor to work with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" answered the Manakete. \"On the ride over here, Chrom told us of a few meteors that had touched down at The Crossroads, not far from here or Ylisstol. The area has already been cleared and quarantined, so we have nothing to fear with any villagers in the area being affected. All we need is you and Maribelle to keep the shards in once place, and we'll be good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be great to travel with you again Robin, as short as it will be.\" spoke Chrom. He stuck his arm forward and Robin grabbed his palm, pulling him in for a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to run with you again Chrom.\" Robin turned to the bell upon the stairwell and rang it, summoning a group of maids to his call. \"Could you prepare a delivery cart for us to use? We need to load up some curtains and head down the road for a bit.\" The maids bowed and left to prepare the cart, Robin turned back to entertain his guests. \"Say, while we're waiting for the cart, Maribelle, and Sumia, would you like to see Brady and Morgan? They've just started crawling, but they aren't speaking words yet; even so, they're the cutest babies in Themis!\" Chrom giggled at Robin's overly motherly attitude, it's almost like Maribelle was the father in this relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be honored Robin.\" answered Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As would we.\" added Tiki, speaking of her and Say'ri. With that, the four left up the stairs to kill time with the babies while everyone was getting prepared.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the group had reached The Crossroads, they had found a set of 4 meteors, still glowing with a bright green radiance, spread a fair amount apart from one another; everyone was relieved knowing the placement wouldn't accidently cause Sumia to grow too big. Robin and Maribelle got to work erecting barriers around the meteorites so the shards would stay in; the two read incantations from tomes to create bright blue spheres around the craters and then set the tomes to the ground like charms, allowing the barriers to stay up without anyone needing to keep the spell held. The duo came back to the others to confirm the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Robin started, \"The way the barriers work is that they're permeable by all that enter it, but won't allow anything to leave unless impact is felt. Once the stones hit the barrier, it should dissipate, allowing Sumia room to grow without injuring herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a strategy for everything, don't you Robin?\" asked Tiki, admiring the tactician's careful planning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" chimed Maribelle, \"Forgive me if I'm being rude, but can we get this over with? I have a very important schedule ahead of myself for the week, and I don't wish to waste it out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" replied Tiki, not fazed by Maribelle's impatience. \"Lady Sumia, are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Sumia walked out from behind a carriage draped in a blanket covering her body, having disrobed herself for the experiment. She walked forward and stood facing Chrom, pulling the Exalt in for a quick hug and kiss before she did her part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going anywhere you know.\" spoke Chrom with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" responded Sumia, \"Just one for the road, in case it's a while before we do this again.\" Sumia had thought how she would become pregnant with the Cynthia of her time as a giant, but she figured not to worry about it for now, Naga and Tiki knew what they were doing. Robin turned around so he wouldn't look at Sumia's body, being respectful of his friend's wife, as Sumia marched towards the meteor by herself and entered the barrier. As she faced the meteor, Sumia dropped the blanket from her body, exposing it to the world, and took a deep breath; she touched the smooth surface of the meteor and felt the rock rumble in return. In an instant, she was engulfed in a bright green light and watched the meteor shatter before her; the pieces flew in every direction and hit the barrier walls, keeping the shards constrained to the crater for easy collection. Soon, the barrier dissipated, leaving Sumia kneeling before a pile of rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Sumia?\" asked Chrom, concerned for his wife's well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm fine, it's just...Ugh...\" Feeling a slight discomfort in her body, Sumia hugged herself and watched the world shrink before her, the trees dwindle smaller as she expanded. After a short while, Sumia stopped feeling the Earth shift under her feet, signaling a halt to her growth, and stood to her full height of 60 feet tall. \"Amazing...\" she said, feeling the breeze run through her hair, awestruck by her size. \"This is nothing like seeing the world from the back of a Pegasus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing...\" parroted Say'ri, admiring the sight. \"It's not pleasant to feel, yet amazing to see. Those meteors truly are a strange enigma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" started Robin, \"Can you please dress yourself Sumia? I really don't want to see you naked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" gasped Sumia, \"Sorry Robin! Just taking this all in! Let's just get out of this hole...\" Sumia moved one foot out of the crater and prepared to move the other, ready to drape herself in Maribelle's curtains. As she took her step towards the carriages, she slipped on the blanket she dropped to the ground, causing her to trip forward and fall. \"W-Whoa!!\" Time seemed to slow for a moment as everyone watched the giant fall towards them, shock and panic on their faces, save Robin who wasn't watching. Tiki, Say'ri, and Chrom moved to the right, Chrom carrying Robin by his arm, and Maribelle jumped back to the left to avoid Sumia's body; they watched as Sumia's body crashed into the carriage carrying the curtains, her body left a dent in the ground on impact. The ground shook and everyone was knocked off their feet; Maribelle, who had jumped, had tumbled back the most, rolling down a crater and hitting her head against a hard surface. Sumia removed her head from the wreckage of the carriage and shook off the impact, everyone looked on to survey the damage to the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Sumia!\" yelled Maribelle, frustration reaching a zenith. \"Be more careful! I nearly broke my neck falling down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Maribelle...\" interrupted Robin, now watching the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now Robin! I've had it up to here with all these giants! I should be preparing for a Ball! Not-\" Maribelle's ramblings were interrupted by a rumbling from behind her. She turned around and adopted a horrified expression as she saw what she hit; a meteor, ready to burst. \"Uh oh...\" The flash of green light up the crater and more shards scattered under the second barrier, allowing it to disperse as Maribelle began to expand. The group was treated to the sounds of ripping fabric for a short while as they saw the once-small noble expand as well; when the growth stopped, Maribelle grew to a massive 60 feet alongside Sumia, the pink horse-riding suit she wore during her time in the Shepherds now scattered across the ground, leaving Maribelle nude. \"<b>AIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</b>\" screamed Maribelle, covering her privates with her hands, horrified at her new stature. \"Look at me! I'm a freak! My favorite riding suit is in ruins! Ahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not how I expected it to go, but I guess we got our meteors.\" commented Tiki, taking everything in. Maribelle turned around and reached her hand out, grabbing Tiki and holding the Manakete between her fingers by her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" she cried, \"You did this to me! I just wanted to stay at home, study law, and eat chocolate; now look at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you tripped on the impact, it's kind of Sumia's fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll crush you!\" yelled Maribelle at the Manakete. She fully grasped her hands around Tiki and prepared to crush her, Tiki only looked completely unfazed; in truth though, she was completely terrified on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey!\" shouted Robin, \"Don't crush Tiki! We need her to get you two back to normal! Just put her down, please!\" Maribelle gritted her teeth and huffed, she moved her hands to the ground and released Tiki before moving her hands back to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Robin.\" spoke Tiki to Robin in a solemn voice. She took Say'ri by her hand and drug her behind a tree; when she was out of sight, Tiki started shuddering and grasped Say'ri tightly by the waist of her dress, her teeth started chattering and she begun to feel physically ill. Robin ran over to his wife and began to stroke her thigh; he looked up at Maribelle's face, it went from a healthy peach to bright red, the woman bit down on her bottom lip and tears started to well in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know things look bad,\" he started softly, his voice naturally relaxing his wife, \"But we just need to take the meteor you hit with you too, and Naga can fix you right up. I promise that we'll get you at a manageable size before the Ball hits, and then you'll never need to touch your stone ever again if you don't want to; though I really hope you do use it sometimes, it just means more of you for me to love!\" Maribelle sniffled a little and wiped the tears from her eyes, trying to get control of her mood better. \"It's a little scary now, but just smile, we can get you back to normal too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks Robin...\" responded Maribelle. \"I'd kiss you, but right now, I'm a little...indecent. Lady Tiki, please forgive me for my outburst.\" Tiki's shaking hand came from behind the tree, giving an \"OK\" sign to signify her forgiveness. \"Lord Chrom, I hope I didn't startle you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not at all...\" replied Chrom with a faint blush upon her face. \"It's just...You wouldn't happen to have bought extra curtains, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" replied Maribelle, embarrassed the Exalt laid eyes upon her naked body. \"Lady Sumia, is there any you could spare for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in luck!\" responded Sumia, grabbing the stacks of curtains from the tattered remains of the carriage. \"It looks like if we just tie around our chests and loins, we can cover up enough for both of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness...\" Sumia extended a pile of curtains towards Maribelle and the two quickly got to work at tying the cloth to cover themselves, at least while they were at this size. When finished, the two looked like they wore strapless lavender swimsuits, their figures complemented what they wore well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, on to Mount Prism next, right Tiki?\" Tiki shook her head at Sumia's question, still trying to get over Maribelle's angry outburst. \"Sorry I wrecked the carriage boys, you're going to have to ride with us.\" Sumia took Chrom by his cape and dropped him between her breasts, jiggling them playfully when he landed. \"Don't worry Chrom, I promise not to trip!\" Maribelle took Robin and Say'ri and sat them upon her shoulders together, she rubbed her hand across her arm and felt a little embarrassed at showing so much skin once the gravity of her situation set in. Tiki fully recovered from her fear and shifted to dragon form, ready to lead the charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, gather your shards or you're not getting small again.\" she commanded, the girls had followed orders and gathered their rocks, holding them like small piles of soil before beginning a march. \"Alright, off to Mount Prism!\"</span></div></div>",

I have a naturual aptitude for it, but when I lost my memory it one of the things that kept me sane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChron nodded, though they didn't notice him till her spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does have a point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would not wish any in our army to be stuck this way, but if Tiki's plan works our defenses will be bolsted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you aren't just saying that because of.... other benefits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom leaned back and relaxed further, placing his hands behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth be told no, I was only thinking of our nation. But we might as well make the most of the situation we're in.\" He looked up at Sumia's magnified face. She smiled, but also blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Maribelle still unhappy, Robin placed an arm on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should be there soon. It should be a simple matter to climb the mountain at your sizes. This time we are unlikely to have to deal with Risen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-But if we do we can crush them like the pests they are.\" Maribelle smiled. \"Hmm.. I am starting to see the positives to this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm still eager to return to normal. Though if all goes well maybe I'll see what I can do with a giant stone. Just once, at least.\"</span></div></div>",

Like before, Lucina strode forward with Gerome &amp; Minerva in flight at her side, and Owain &amp; Severa's theater carriage in tow, however, Ophelia now joined the travels and drove the carriage while her father tried to dispel his hangover with coffee and medicine, while Cynthia allowed her Pegasus to freely fly at its leisure while the girl wrapped herself in Lucina's massive scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp...\" croaked Cynthia, holding a hand to her head. \"To think that a mere ale would trump the mighty Cynthia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia, it's your fault, you shouldn't be drinking things you're not used to.\" retorted her sister. \"Even Father rarely drinks, and he knows how to handle his alcohol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry sis...\" Cynthia burped lightly like she was about to vomit and relaxed herself in a laying position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just lucky Gerome and Ophelia were there to peel your sorry butts off the floor of the mess hall.\" curtly chimed in Severa. She gazed at Owain, rotating between sips of a hot mug and vulnerary vial, before continuing her lecture. \"You especially should be ashamed, you're going to be a father soon! Just think what poor Ophelia was thinking while she was watching her Daddy chug one mug after another to prove his 'Hero's Worth'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sorry about all that Severa...\" Owain looked at his future daughter, whistling while handling the horses, and begged for her forgiveness. \"Sorry to you too Ophelia, I'm sure you didn't travel back through time just to be a designated driver...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries Daddy!\" beamed the young Sorceress. \"I used to spend time with horses all the time back in the future, it makes me feel at home! And besides, I'm not going anywhere anyways, we'll have plenty of time together ahead of us!\" Ophelia decided against telling Owain of his fate, but resolved to speak after her other self's birth, with Severa keeping the secret safe too; it was a definite boost to the girl's morale to get her burden off her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you're a good daughter!\" Ophelia nearly squealed at the compliment, getting flashbacks of happy 4-year old memories. \"And hey, speaking of, how about that Gerome last night with the arm wrestling? He even slammed one guy through the table! Tough stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic.\" replied Gerome. \"I just wanted them off of Lucina. And that table slam was because he passed out and leaned forward mid-match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, it was very thoughtful of you Gerome, thank you.\" Gerome blushed a bit and cracked a smile at his wife's compliment. Lucina stood on her tiptoes to get a better view of the area and caught glimpse of a watch tower beyond a sea of trees; she could easily see smoke and assorted hay &amp; wooden roofs in the clear weather of the day. \"A town is just up ahead, we can ask around about the ruins there, someone has to know of the elixir story.\" Everyone felt a little charged up at Lucina's comments, feeling that they were nearing the end of their wild goose chase soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a bed,\" chimed in Cynthia, sneezing and burping a little, \"I need a warm bed to nap off this headache...\" When the group reached the edge of the town a short while later, they hid amongst the forest trees to determine their plan at Lucina's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to inconvenience you all, but could you all continue without me for now? I don't wish to scare the townsfolk with my size.\" Lucina took Cynthia from her rest on her shoulders and slid her into the carriage. \"We might need to stop here for the night if Cynthia and Owain are too hung over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let off too kind a presence to frighten someone, but I do see your point.\" replied Gerome. \"Very well, but you won't be sleeping out in this cold forest tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine Gerome, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll see to it the town elder allows you some sort of shelter.\" Gerome got off Minerva's back and spoke command to the wyvern. \"Stay with Lucina, keep her warm and keep her company until we get back.\" On command, the wyvern cuddled up alongside her mistress and blew puffs of smoke from her nostrils to keep her warm in the snow; noticing this, Cynthia's Pegasus moved over from its grazing and started nudging Lucina's thigh, as if to get in on the love. Gerome got onto the carriage and sat alongside Ophelia in the passenger's seat. \"We'll be back, be safe.\" With that, they departed into town while Lucina kept hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being such a small town, the townsfolk seemed too much like city-dwellers, too busy to talk and hurrying along. The cart was stopped at the side of the main plaza as Gerome, Ophelia and Severa yelled for attention, much to Owain and Cynthia's headaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're looking for the town elder, where-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me! Sir! Do you know where-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Numbskulls! We're trying to find-\" No response to all 3 travelers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is beginning to wear thin,\" commented Gerome, \"How are we supposed to find the village chief if nobody stops for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you tried something quieter?\" asked Cynthia, distressed by the noise. Suddenly, a light went off in Ophelia's head at her aunt's words. She jumped out of the carriage and turned to the other riders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" she cried. \"If words don't work, then <i>actions</i>!\" She turned around to the busy public and opened her tome, shooting fireworks into the air from its pages; this caught the attention of some young children and houseparents. \"Ladies and gentlemen!\" cried the magician, \"We have a wonderful magic show for you today! We ask for no money, just a warm bed to sleep in and your hearts &amp; dreams! Just for a moment, I want you to think one thing; Whatever you believe is real, <i>is</i> real!\" From there, the young magician began her acts, turning snow to bubbles, floating through metal rings, forming doves from snow angel indents, and drew in a large crowd of cheering onlookers; Gerome and Severa were amazed at the draw the entertainment magic provided, and were equally gladdened that their hunt had just gotten easier. At the end of her set, Ophelia pulled a beautiful bouquet of flowers from a young child's ear and gifted them to the girl, causing cheers to erupt from the crowd. \"Thank you so much! You've all been a great audience!\" An old man with a cane walked out from the crowd to greet the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bravo, young missy! You really lit up the town, and it's still day!\" Ophelia bowed in turn, accepting the praise graciously. The old man turned to the rest of the group aboard the carriage. \"Forgive me for the busy townsfolk, we have a small festival coming up in a few days. You say you needed a bed to sleep in? My name is Young Hubba, and I'm the elder of this village, pleased to meet you!\" The group, minus Ophelia, had sworn they heard the name before, or one similar, but wrote it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hospitality is appreciated, elder. My name is Gerome, this is Severa, and Ophelia. Our two friends in the carriage, Owain and Cynthia, have fatigued themselves to continue our journey as is, and therefore we require shelter. There is one more we wish to introduce you to, if you could come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sonny, I'm too Young to be called Elder just yet!\" Hubba chuckled at his own corny joke, but got back on topic when he realized only he laughed. \"Yes, well, I can definitely allow you all to spend the night here, but what kind of journey are you youngsters on? Care to give a young elder a story to hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it is related to our other companion; We wish to know if you know any information regarding the ruins up north. Specifically, one mentioned in a story about a shrin-\" Gerome's words were cut off by a large yell from the edge of town, drawing the crowd's attention as they began to shuffle towards the source. Gerome looked panicked, realizing he might have been wrong when speaking to Lucina before. <i>\"Oh crap!\"</i> He jumped from the cart and dashed off to the edge of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Gerome, wait!\" Severa realized the urgency of his run, but her pleas for him to wait fell on deaf ears. When he got to the edge of town, Gerome watched as the crowd gathered around a portly man dressed in furs, looking out of breath and scared as a lanky farmer-type comforted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter Tell, what's wrong? You look like you done saw a ghost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wyvern! In-In Woods! A-And g-giant woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, that's crazy talk! Everyone knows there's no such thing as a g-g-giaaa...\" The farmer was cut off as he saw Lucina's figure at the edge of the woods, looking equally as panicked as Gerome that she had been spotted. Minerva had crawled out from the woods and kept a low snarl, trying to control the crowd to keep panic from erupting and her master's wife from being hurt. After what seemed like forever, Lucina gulped and finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello everyone...M-May I come in?\" The tension in the air was thick, Lucina, Gerome, and Minerva knew not what would happen and prepared for the worst.</span></div></div>",

So that's what it is then, huh missy?\" Parting the crowd with his words, Young Hubba came forward, not particularly shocked or frightened by Lucina's size, with Lucina's extended family in tow, cart and all. \"Yup, I can see why you'd want that shrinking elixir from the story. As far as I'm aware, it's just a story, but if ya need some directions, I could always point you folks to the exact ruins from the tale.\" Lucina looked ecstatic at the elder's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could?!\" she cried, lunging forward slightly and frightening some of the crowd. \"Oh please, do tell us if you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, I can certainly see you're excited!\" chuckled the old man. He pulled out a folded map from his person, decorated with drawn pictures of temples, marked areas, and little facts, almost like a brochure, and held it up for Lucina's viewing. \"Yup, around here, we got a lot of ruins from stories, it's kinda like a tourist attraction, so I drew up these little maps here with the rest of the town hall for the best viewing pleasure.\" He moved forward to hand Lucina the map, the girl squinted trying to read it, before handing it off to Gerome, deciding he could read it better. \"What you folks are going to want are the 'Limestone Ruins', marked up a couple miles north from here. It's the big white-grey temple with the 8 pillars for an entrance, you can't miss it;  it's a bit deep and has a couple booby traps in it, so be sure to be careful, I'm sure you can fit in it, Miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina.\" answered back Lucina, finishing the sentence for the elder. She got up and bowed to him in return for his kindness. \"Thank you for your help, elder. I'm sorry to ask further request of you, but our family members have fallen incapacitated and cannot journey with us as is, is there any way we may spend the night in your village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask no more!\" answered Hubba with glee, \"The weather's cold outside, no way am I about to let you nice youngsters freeze out in the cold! I'll let you fellas stay at the hotel tonight for free, least I could do for your friend's magic show!\" Ophelia held her rosy cheeks at the complement, feeling an ego boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was nothing!\" she replied, head in the clouds. \"Really, just some nifty little tricks!\" Severa inched closer to slapping the humble into her daughter's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you Miss Lucina,\" continued Hubba, \"We could always let you use the town barnhouse to sleep in tonight, it's nice and warm so you don't have to lay in the cold, your wyvern could even stay with you too!\" Minerva rubbed herself against Lucina's leg in response, happy to spend time with her mistress. \"Just if you could, could you help us hang up a couple streamers in there before you tuck in for the night? We got the Festival Dance coming up soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Elder Hubba!\" objected the lanky farmer-type, \"We can't just be accepting in everyone so close to the Hunting Festival!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pipe down you!\" shouted back Hubba, waving his cane around. \"First rule of our town: Never turn away a weary traveler, no matter who or what they are! And we could always use Miss Lucina's height to help us more than you could lying around that field of yours all day!\" The farmer was defeated by the elder's response and folded his arms in a huff. Calmed a bit, Hubba returned back to talking with the giant princess. \"Sorry about that, everyone's a bit tense so close to our local festival coming up. Let me see you folks to your staying quarters for the night, and then just ask us if you need anything else while you're staying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you elder.\" replied Lucina, bowing once more. Carefully, she stepped around the crowd as she began to follow behind Young Hubba, with Gerome, Minerva, and the rest of the party in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And done!\" shouted Lucina as she hung the final streamer from the rafters of the barn. The whole place was set up to look like a fancy ballroom, but still had the farming village charm to it, the villagers clearly put work into their festivals. Night had just fallen, and Lucina finally got to seat herself on the floor of the barn; she sat down next to Gerome and Minerva, happy not to be seated in snow this time. \"Elder Hubba was so kind to let us use the barnhouse to sleep for tonight, as well as give us a map to the ruins. I think we're reaching the end of our journey Gerome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" grumbled Gerome in response. Lucina looked a little distressed at his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's those townspeople.\" he replied, fuming as he said it. \"The elder was a nice enough man, but for those people to be treating you like a monster just got me angry is all.\" Lucina sighed, worried that Gerome would bust a vein just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Gerome. I don't mind their comments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mind.\" he replied. His tone was harsh, but he decided to soften up as he continued. \"I'm sorry, it's just that I think of you like I think of a treasure; precious and special. I can't help becoming furious if anyone were to hurt you, physical or not.\" Lucina sighed once more and grabbed Gerome swiftly, exciting some shock from the wyvern rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that?\" she asked her husband. \"I'm a big girl now Gerome, I can fight my own battles.\" She gently let Gerome down before continuing. \"It's not even just now, it was even during the war; I can't count how many times you put yourself in harm's way for me, I...no, we all could have lost you out there on the battlefield, I would never want to live with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mere flesh wounds couldn't end me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point Gerome.\" Lucina laid on her stomach, trying to get more down to earth with the rider. \"My point is this: You've already done so much for everyone. Not just me, our family, our friends, everyone in the Shepherds, and you never took a break doing it.\" Lucina pulled off Gerome's mask and stared into his deep brown eyes. \"The time of war is over Gerome, our nightmare from the future has ended. It's the dawn of a new era for us, an era of peace, there's no reason for you to be so tense anymore.\" Minerva came over to cuddle her master, licking his face as Lucina spoke to him. The princess smiled at the scene, thinking nothing else could be a more perfect illustration for her point. \"We all love you Gerome, so just relax. We'll fix me eventually, I can just feel it now, and it's all thanks to you, as well as the rest of our family and friends.\" Gerome took all these words in, before sensibly chuckling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny, it was usually me telling you that you'll be normal again soon...\" He placed his hand upon Lucina's cheek and rubbed it softly before locking lips with Lucina's massive pink lips in front of him. \"I understand Lucina, I'll take it easy from here on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Gerome.\" Lucina tilted her head up a bit and looked through the shutters of the window; though night had fallen, it was still early, and the two were alone, save their trusted wyvern considered part of the family. \"Say, Gerome?\" began Lucina with a soft blush upon her face. \"It's still a little early, and we're completely alone, so...\" Gerome immediately picked up on the signals his wife was giving, and his face became red hot in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean in here? Now?!\" Gerome looked around, afraid at the idea of someone walking in on them. \"Lucina, what if someone were to see us in here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know! I'm embarrassed too!\" The full red blush on Lucina's face confirmed it, both she and Gerome looked like tomatoes; clearly the two were made for one another. \"There's only one door leading into the barn, Elder Hubba told us, so if we just keep it locked, I'm sure we could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't say it!\" Gerome took a moment to calm down before addressing his wife back. \"Alright, I suppose if you want...\" Gerome gave Minerva a hand signal and the wyvern blocked the only door to the barn, for extra measure, Lucina pushed a large wooden bar into a lock, completely sealing off the compound; the two were finally alone. \"It's not that I don't want to...\" started Gerome, \"I just can't fathom the idea; How could we make this work at your size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" started Lucina in response, \"Do you remember back in Ylisstol? What Severa told me?\" Lucina bent down closer to Gerome and began whispering in his ear, the wyvern rider's face lit up like a firework at the words spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How does she even think something like that up?!\" Gerome was clearly flustered at the suggestion, but was resolved to keep Lucina happy. \"I suppose we could try, are you sure of this Lucina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really...\" she answered bluntly, face still reddening. \"I just want to prepare in case this journey ends in failure.\" Gerome gave a light chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you know exactly what I'm going to tell you.\" Lucina giggled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I know; 'Stay strong, I promise to get you back to normal again'.'\" With that exchange, the two lovers began to disrobe themselves, moving in closer with each article of clothing they dropped. Lucina grasped Gerome after completely disrobing herself and moved her lips in for a deep kiss, meeting with Gerome's lips returning the action as she did, before moving Gerome lower down her body as she began to lay down. Minerva watched some of this, but fell out of interest quickly and nodded off to sleep, effortlessly blocking the door with her scaled frame and trying to block out the noise her masters were making, instead filling it with dreams of the old days of combat with Cherche and Gregor.</span></div></div>",

She tried not to eat too much, but was grateful to the town, and Ophelia was happy to perform more magic tricks for much of the morning, before they had to depart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group left in good spirits, having had a great time. Lucina walked with a sping in her step, though still watched where she placed her feet. The end of her journey was near, she could feel it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Owain placed an arm around Ophelia's shoulders. \"Who would have though my daughter would be such a great performer? I mean I knew you'd inherit some of my flair, but you were incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia almost blushed, though she was much too brash to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry probably taught her everything she knows about magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm sure I helped to!

Gerome frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to kill your good mood, especially when I see you smiling like but....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This \"Shrinking Elixir\" is just a legend from long ago. Not only do we not know if it exists or if it is in these ruins, we don't know that someone hasn't already taken it or it hasn't expired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina's smile dampened a little, but she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. The thought had occurred to me. There is the possibility this expedition will be fruitless. If that is the case, we will seek a cure elsewhere and if that fails... well, if their is one thing I have learnt on this journey, it's that their are plenty of good people who will treat me as human being no matter what happens, and that I have friends and family I can count on no matter the circumstances. If I am truly to live my life as a giant, I can bear that, as long as I am surronded by people who care about me.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a relatively quick journey, Tiki's party had reached the summit of Mount Prism. There they stood in the marble halls of the Temple of Naga; the sight was all too familiar for Chrom, only mere months ago he stood here, taking part in the Awakening Ritual to bless Falchion with Naga's power, and now he stood to bear witness to the creation of a new magic stone. Tiki kneeled before the effigies to her mother once again, and even without vocal request, the fiery hologram of Naga had shown itself once more; everyone watched in awe and revere at the Goddess' magnificent visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiki, my child, welcome back.\" Naga scanned the room and took note of the giant Sumia and Maribelle, each holding a pile of rock, and Chrom &amp; Robin in tow with them. \"I see you have completed your quest, twicefold in fact. I also see you bring the Exalt and Blood of Grima with you; greetings to you both, I hope you all have been well since our last meeting.\" Robin frowned a bit as Maribelle let him and Say'ri off her shoulder, right as Naga was, he tried his hardest to forget the fact he was destined to become a harbinger of death before Lucina changed everything. \"Now then, I believe we should start the ritual. It's been ages since a procedure like this was held, I may not be able to guarantee success, forgive me. From the two of you, which shall go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Sumia was first after all,\" commented Maribelle, gracefully playing up her friend, \"Please, allow her to go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Maribelle,\" asked back the Queen, \"Didn't you say you wanted to get small as soon as possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong dear,\" she replied, \"It's not that I enjoy this, it's simply that I'd rather observe for now in case anything were to go wrong.\" Sumia looked in shock and started shuddering, fearing for the worst at Maribelle's somewhat rude comments. \"Ah! Forgive me for speaking out of term, my lady, think more of young Cynthia! You still need to be small to have her, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, you're right about that...\" Sumia took a deep breath and removed Chrom from her bosom, placing him to the floor; she adopted a look of determination. \"Alright, let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Queen of Ylisse, if you would step forward towards me, ahead of Tiki.\" Sumia obeyed Naga's command and stepped forward, finding herself in the middle of a circular panel featuring the Mark of Naga. With the wave of her hand, Naga had erected several yellow rings around Sumia, and like magnets, the shards of meteor had freed themselves from Sumia's person and intertwined with the rings, almost like asteroid belts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Naga, what's going on?\" asked Sumia, concerned for her safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not,\" replied the Divine Dragon, \"This is simply part of the process. Tiki, may you join me in prayer? I shall transmit my thoughts and words to you, please follow along with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, O Naga.\" responded the Manakete. With a smile on her face and flick of the wrist, Naga had shot a light blue mark from a mirror upon Tiki's head; the Manakete's eyes glowed a bright blue in response. Tiki could see it - every thought in Naga's mind became hers as well, it would be a simple task to follow along the chant in this state; focusing upon Sumia, Tiki started off the ritual. \"O spirits of our fallen brethren! Please take heed of this woman's curse! May you lend us your power, flowing across eons, so we may relieve her of her ailment! Hear the prayer of our people now! Transfer your powers to the accursed stone before you!\" On that, both Tiki and Naga clasped their hands together and begun chanting in sacred ancient verse, completely in sync with one another; the ancient language confused everyone else present, but they assume it was working. Rapidly, the shards of meteor began to swirl around Sumia, while the rings passed light over her like a scanner; together, the two objects worked in tandem, forming almost a barrier of light and debris around Sumia's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she going to be okay?\" asked Chrom, stepping forward to support his wife. In response, Say'ri extended her arm to block Chrom from advancing further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not, Lord Chrom,\" she spoke, \"Have faith in Lady Tiki and Lady Naga. They know what they're doing.\" For a short while, the arcs of light and stone danced around Sumia before breaking from her person and crashing into one another marvelously, forming a large, yellow orb that floated in the air before her. Tiki dropped to her knees, eyes now normal, exhausted by the act, while Sumia stared at the orb in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it,\" beckoned Naga, \"It's yours. It is linked to your body, you and you alone will be able to use it.\" Slowly, Sumia extended her arm and grasped the orb tightly. In an instant, she was consumed by a bright yellow light, blinding all present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia!\" shouted Chrom, concerned for her safety. When he opened his eyes again, he was treated to the visage of his wife, now her normal size again, still draped in the makeshift curtain smallclothes and holding the stone in her hands; all had shrank to a manageable size. Chrom ran forward in glee, Sumia took notice and broke into a run too; both grasped one another in a big hug and Chrom spun Sumia around in the air, a sight touching for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" cried Sumia, \"It actually worked! Oh, I'm so happy! Lucina can become normal again!\" Tiki fully recovered and rested her hand on Sumia's shoulder with a big smile on her face, and Sumia, in response, brought her in on the group hug as well. \"Oh Tiki! Thank you for all of this! I don't know how to thank you properly enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she responded, \"A large feast would be a good start!\" Everyone present giggled, the mood was definitely brighter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we can start with your other friends, three by my count.\" spoke Naga to Tiki. \"I trust you have two masses of meteors for your hero and the other giant?\" The mood came to a screeching halt at this, everyone's hearts dropped in shock at Naga's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two masses?\" repeated Tiki. \"Forgive me, O Naga, but did you just say we need another meteor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see I should've been more specific before.\" Naga shook her head and cursed herself for causing confusion. \"Yes, the ritual creates individual stone for each person affected by this, but for this, I require a mass of meteorite and an individual affected by the meteor. The meteor doesn't need to be the same one grew with, it's the genetic mapping that's truly important.\" Tiki looked flabbergasted the most out of this, she thought this plan was a sure-fire solution to Lucina's problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But Naga,\" she responded, \"Our hero, Lucina, the meteor she grew with is scattered far across Wyvern Valley's forest floors. How can we shrink her and Maribelle at the same time?\" Angered, Maribelle glared down at the apparition of Naga and loudly made her opinion known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?! We have to choose between me and Lucina now?! One of us will be stuck like this?! How on earth is that fair to either of us?!\" Naga looked a little distressed, but could not properly sympathize due to her long time of seclusion from humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, young lady. I did not mean to cause you any distress, I hope you can forgive me.\" Maribelle was further angered by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ask for action, and you give me mere <i>words</i>?!\" she cried in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, they are but all I have...\" Maribelle felt her anger fading by Naga's calming demeanor, but soon found that anger replaced by despair. She thought Lucina deserved to be small more than she did, but at the same time, couldn't stand the idea of her normal life now completely destroyed by a mere accident; it wasn't fair at all, and the implication of it all overwhelmed her emotionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't believe this...\" She touched her hands to her face, holding her cheeks in disbelief at the situation. \"I just wanted a happy, normal life with Robin, a normal life in Themis. I...I...\" Maribelle couldn't take it anymore, she felt tears break free from her eyes and placed her hands to her face to sob into. In an instant, Maribelle turned from the rest of the party and sprinted out of the temple, intent on finding a secluded spot to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maribelle, wait!\" Robin called out as he reached out to his fleeing, giant wife. Robin turned to the rest of the party and tried to quell the heavy mood put onto them. \"I'm sorry guys, but Maribelle needs me right now. I'll calm her down and we'll be back, I promise.\" With that, Robin ran of the temple, trying to catch up to Maribelle's huge strides; despite his intent to calm everyone, Robin's words fell on deaf ears as the mood remained tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry...\" spoke Sumia, looking ready to cry. \"It's my fault she became so huge, and now I'm small instead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame yourself, please.\" responded Chrom, hugging Sumia tightly. \"I promise I won't rest until everyone is normal again, I swear of it. Let's just be happy that this solution works, and we'll worry of the rest later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's anyone's fault, it's mine.\" commented Tiki. \"I forced you all into this in a mad attempt to fix Lucina behind everyone's backs; I should take all the blame here.\" Shaking off her despair, Tiki turned to Say'ri. \"Say'ri, I assume you would like to get back to normal size too, would you like to go next.\" Say'ri stayed silent for a little bit, guilty that she too would be normal while either Lucina or Maribelle would suffer, but answered anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lady Tiki. Thank you and Lady Naga.\" Say'ri stepped between Tiki and Naga, and as Naga formed the rings around her and produced the small chunk of meteor she was previously offered, the ritual to shrink Say'ri begun, the mood now tense with depression over anticipation.</span></div></div>",

If we come across any risen will slice them apart, like we've done a hundred times already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but please be careful, if you lower you're guard at the wrong moment.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, bad stuff could happen We're not greenhorns!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome huffed..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's saying don't get overconfident you fool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina looked down to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerome there's no need for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain smiled, as though Gerome had caused no slight at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No hard feelings. And I get what you mean, we'll watch our backs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finally reached the temple and hit there first problem. Lucina was easily able to force the doors open, but even bending down their wasn't enough room for her to enter, she tried crawling or sliding through, but she was just too big, and her every attempt brought down more dust and debris. Gerome placed a hand on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should let us handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of you came this far for my sake, it feels wrong to wait out here while everyone else is exposed to danger on my behalf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you telling me how much you could depend on your family just a moment ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, they have always been there for me but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerome's right! We totally have this! You can totally count on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we wouldn't you to bring the tem-\" Owain cut her off with a nudge to her arm. \"Oh- I mean we can handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina considered this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are sure, just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful, we know already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I don't need to say it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group walked into the temple, there weapons drawn, while Lucina looked on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Maribelle? Where are you?\" Robin trekked nearly a mile and a half around the mountain woods looking for Maribelle, evidently it wasn't hard for her to make distance from the rest of the group at her size. He feared for the worst, afraid Maribelle may have hurt herself all alone or ran down to the local village to frighten everyone in her outburst; Robin knew she was a smart, level-headed, and resourceful woman, but she was prone to making horrendously rash decisions when not in the right state of mind, and now was a perfect example of that state of mind. Robin cursed under his breath, blaming himself for not planning ahead for a scenario like this. <i>\"It might take days to find her, even weeks, if she keeps on the move...!</i> As he was about to beat himself up even further, Robin heard a soft sobbing sound coming through the trees; expecting breakthrough, he followed the noise into a grove, and found Maribelle, sitting alone and bawling into her hands by a small lake. She stared at her reflection in the pool of water for a short while before breaking back into crying, not content with her situation. Carefully, Robin walked up, not wanting Maribelle to run on him again. \"Maribelle?\" he calmly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" she shouted in response, waving her hands in Robin's general direction. \"I'm a monster! Leave me alone!\" Robin wasn't going to give up; he strode over to Maribelle while she was turned and laid his hand upon her thigh, prompting the young noble to look down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now look,\" he started, \"I won't pretend I know how you feel, but you need to keep calm, we can handle this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Handle it?!\" cried Maribelle in response. \"You heard Tiki, we need another one of those wretched rocks, and Lucina's is long gone! There's nothing left for me! I'm stuck like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't say that,\" Robin replied, trying to calm Maribelle down, \"Lucina's still looking for that shrinking elixir, maybe then she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get it?!\" shouted Maribelle. \"There is no elixir! It's a child's fairy tale! The chances of her finding it are slim to none!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's not true! It's a legend, but all legends have base-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin,\" Maribelle choked out, \"Just leave me be! I'm not normal anymore! A freak like me, I don't deserve to be your wife, just please take my fortune and marry another-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now that's enough!\" Robin screamed at the top of his lungs, startling Maribelle; she'd never seen him take charge in quite this fashion before. He climbed up to her legs and stared directly into her face. \"I'll let you shoot down all of my attempts to cheer you up as you must, but I'll be damned if I'll stand here and let you tell me to give up on our marriage! You're the woman I fell in love with, there's no way I'm leaving you! Ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, I...\" Maribelle didn't know what to say, she was dumbstruck by Robin's words and crude tone towards her, yet captivated by the words he spoke from the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I don't care what size you are; 5 feet, 60 feet, 300 feet, whatever - I will do absolutely everything in my power to make this work! If you want to be normal again, I'll go to Valm and pick up every piece of gravel I can find looking for meteor shards! And if you'd rather stay large, I'll cook every meal for you and do every single one of your chores, even if my arms give out on me!\" Robin closed the distance between him and Maribelle and grabbed a wall of skin, hugging her stomach as tight as he could. \"Brady and Morgan need a loving Mom to grow up around, and gods be damned, you are that Mom; so please stop this foolish talk of us leaving you, we're your family!\" Maribelle's eyes watered up quickly; she grabbed Robin with both of her hands and brought him directly to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin!\" she cried, as she began nuzzling him against her cheek and sobbing intensely, touched by the words he spoke. Happy that he finally got through to her, Robin hugged her face and felt a warm, fuzzy sensation inside his being; Robin knew on instinct it was the same love he felt when he first proposed to Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours of crying and hugging, though truly only 40 minutes or so, Maribelle had finally calmed herself down to a manageable mood. Robin sat upon her shoulder, and the two stared upon the lake together, watching the water glimmer in the closed-off dome of tree leaves and branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin,\" Maribelle started, \"Forgive me for being so brash before. It was unbecoming of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries,\" replied the tactician, \"I probably would've done the same thing if I were you.\" Maribelle scoffed at the idea, beginning to laugh heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?!\" she spat out between fits of laughter, \"You would've acted all 'Now let's just think this through,' and shuffled around everyone as if you were playing human chess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't sound like that...\" Robin recoiled at Maribelle's shots she took, but was happy his wife was back to her old, joyful, and pompous self. \"Now, I don't want to get you upset again, but are you okay to come back to the Temple now? Would you like to try and become normal again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Maribelle replied, \"Forget about me, give my stone to Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fine with that?\" Maribelle stared out into the lake, watching the pool of water sparkle as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I ran away,\" she began, \"I was thinking purely of what would happen to me. I operated on the logic that Lucina would be small, I never did think that she didn't deserve it over me, especially after all the poor girl's been through. I've had my children already, but what if Lucina wanted some herself? Now how is that fair to take the gift of a family away from her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point,\" Robin replied, \"But what about the Ball? Weren't you excited for that?\" Maribelle looked a little sorrowful, but quickly shook off the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, if there was anything I learned from the war, the value of life comes far over anything else, we could always entertain ourselves at home instead, I'm sure Brady and Morgan would get a kick out of having a giantess for a mother!\" She stared at Robin before continuing. \"Besides, imagine what I could accomplish at this size! Shipping would become a joke, the harvest would be easy, and have you seen my body in these sheets? I could become the world's largest fashion model with my physique and collection of fine cloths! If I weren't a celebrity in Themis by now, I'll soon become the largest woman they've ever heard of; quite literally in fact!\" Robin smiled at his wife's conclusions, happy how quickly she turned a terrible situation into a good one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's the woman I fell in love with! I'll help you at every step of the way!\" Robin hugged Maribelle's neck, and in response, the woman stroked her husband's white hair with her pointer finger. \"Would you like to go back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'd rather stay here with you, just the two of us. I know it is selfish of me, but I rather enjoy not having that green-haired menace near me.\" Robin agreed to Maribelle's words and continued to watch the lake with her, intent on making small-talk with her. \"Though,\" began Maribelle, \"I know I said all that, but I wouldn't mind being small again once in a while. You did mean what you said when you said you'd pick up all the gravel in Valm for me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" replied Robin with no hesitation, \"Anything you want, I almost killed myself for you, remember? Even so, I'm sure Lissa would be fine with growing in order to give you a shrinking stone.\" Maribelle's expression turned from joy to shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?!\" she cried, before plucking Robin from her shoulder. \"Just because I'm fine with this doesn't mean Lissa would! There's no way I'd want her to become like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Maribelle,\" protested Robin, \"You know how Lissa is, she'd probably like being big. Are you sure you wouldn't consider it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" she replied, \"My treasure is not to come near those accursed rocks! If you're going to get someone, why not Cordelia? The woman's already freakishly huge to begin with, what's another couple feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a little mean to say you know.\" answered Robin. \"And besides, you know she's insecure about her, uh, 'assets', I don't think there's a breastplate big enough to cover her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, she could just tear a house out of the ground and wear that as a bra if that's what she's so worried about!\" Maribelle thought for a moment, before coming to another conclusion. \"Well what about dear Ricken? He was always complaining about being so short all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd just cause more problems, because then Nowi would try to get big to match her husband, and we'd have a giant dragon on our hands. Now how scary would that be?\" Maribelle laughed at Robin's thought, imagining a large Nowi flying over Ylisse, trumping even Grima in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I see your point! Then, how about...\" From that point on, the couple sat together and discussed scenarios of if different Shepherds became giants, laughing as the scenarios ran through their heads, but being fearful of the ideas of Tharja or Anna towering over buildings. In any case, Robin had been successful in cheering his wife up, and managed even to make her enjoy the idea of life as a giant; if one thing was clear, it was that the two truly loved each other deeply.</span></div></div>",

He could not completely stop the part of himself that likes to come up with plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we find another stone piece?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we manage that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was undeterred by her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is likely more fell, and at your size, it would be easier to search a wider area, or see if any remain at Wyvern Valley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what good would that do? Either you would only take my place, which I could not endure, or I would grow to an even more gigantic size, and to a scale where neither Naga or Tiki would be able to assist me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could ask. I would never act recklessly and risk the ones I care about, least of all you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you but no thank you, I can endure living like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have nothing to lose just asking Tiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle carefully picked Robin up and placed on her shoulder. She got up slowly, ever watchful of her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose... but would she even know? She still hasn't figured this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is still worth asking her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" Maribelle smiled. She started walking back to mount Prisim as quickly as she could, while still being mindful of her surrondings, as well as her husband.  \"You always know exactly what to do, no matter the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not always, but given time, reasonble thought and the assitance of good friends, one can make a better future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle rolled her eyes but smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheesy.... but quite accurate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle soon reached mount Prisim again. Everyone was still there, Naga, Tiki, Chrom, Sumia and Say'rii, now restored to her former size. Despite this, the mood was decidely somber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Maribelle....\"  Tiki said, unable to think of anything better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia tried to run to Maribelee, but tripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maribelle, I'm sorry I took away your one chance to be normal size-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle waved her hand, as thought it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that, I don't hold it agaisnt you. None of us were to no. And thanks my wonderful husband.\" She stroked him with a finger. \"I realized my life is not over, even if I am to remain like this. I will still have my family and friends and I can still be a wife, mother and model!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle swelled with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter what happens, we always make the best of it, and no one is better at than the two of us! My size is not merely a curse, it brings advantages with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki looked up at her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is wonderful. I feared I had failed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Besides Robin has pointed out there might be hope of restoring my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sat up and all eyes were drawn to him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is possible there maybe more stones at Wyvern vallery, or that the meteorites may have fallen elsewhere. If Maribelle were to retrieve another set of shards, would you be able to make her a stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if Maribelle tried to retrieve more fragments, she could grow even larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know, but the stone would still make her human size, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to Naga expectantly, Maribelle especially leaning in. Naga paused in thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure. In all my time I have never seen anything like this. If a second meteor did affect, I do not know if one stone would be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're back to square one... I suppose I can live at this size if I must..\" Everyone looked at her, clearly surprised and note entirely believing her current reaction. Maribelle continued.  \"I know I reacted badly at first, but that was only when I believed my life was over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin clenched his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only there was a way of knowing what effect a second exposure to a meteor fragment would have. For all we know it may only affect someone once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can't risk that. I would not, nor would I allow other to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom walked towards Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is still hope. If Lucina finds the exlir there may be enough left over-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki spun round to Naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Naga, how likely  do you think it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrinking... Elixir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki sagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have not heard of it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom filled her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what Lissa told me its a fable where a greedy hunter finds an Elxir that shrinks him out of existence. Do you think such a thing would exist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaga took another moment to consider this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything is possible, but I cannot say. Humans have so many legends. A surprising manner contain truth, even those that seem impossiable and yet... even if this Elixir existed there is no guarantee it would still be there or that it would still function.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waiting on her family's results, Lucina sat outside the temple, leaning against a sturdy white pillar and rubbing her hands next to a large bonfire made of dead trees. She thought it had been a while since they entered, dusk finally taking over the sky, and couldn't help but worry of their status since she was physically unable to enter with them. Minerva cuddled up against her mistress, snuggling her scales against the soft wool of Lucina's huge scarf, the girl looked down and giggled in turn. Lucina gave a sneeze, prompting the wyvern to puff flames from her mouth to relieve her mistress of the chilly air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Minerva.\" responded Lucina with a smile, moving closer to the bonfire as she spoke. The girl reached down and wrapped both her hands around Minerva's body, hoisting her up like a small puppy and resting her upon her lap; the wyvern lowered its head and gave a purr-like bellow when pet. \"I bet you're worried about Gerome, aren't you girl?\" The dragon nuzzled her head into Lucina's lap in response, a sign of agreement. \"I'm worried too, Gerome's resourceful, as are everyone else, but for this temple to contain such a concoction as a shrinking elixir, it must be full of traps or creatures. Severa's in no condition to fight or run either, and it distresses me to think Ophelia could watch her mother get hurt again for my sake.\" Lucina looked down &amp; distressed, having no comforting words to ease her wandering mind, and Minerva couldn't help but feel powerless, being unable to speak her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wyvern leapt from Lucina's lap and grabbed a large burning branch from the bonfire with her jaws; shaking off the flames, she bought it close to Lucina, expecting her to pick up on the signals. \"What's this?\" asked the princess, holding the burnt wood close to her face, \"Do you want to play fetch?\" Minerva flared her nostrils in response, confirming Lucina's thoughts as correct; the princess smiled and turned around from the fire, eyeing the open snowy area of the ruins. \"Alright girl, are you ready? Go fetch!\" Lucina threw the branch with such strength that it disappeared from the horizon, into the darkness; Minerva immediately took off like a jet after it, intending to bring it back to her mistress. Eventually she did, receiving a pet from Lucina before the princess repeated the process again; this went on for a long series of reps, and each time Lucina threw, her mind seemed to ease itself from the stress of worrying about her family. <i>\"This was your intent, wasn't it Minerva?\"</i> thought Lucina, admiring how smart and caring the wyvern was, <i>\"Thank you so much for being with me, I don't know what I'd do without you or Gerome in my life!\"</i> The wyvern picked up on Lucina's thoughts as she viewed her face; Lucina could've sworn that as she played with the dragon, she could see the strong, rock-like mandibles of Minerva's jaw contort into a smile, an unknown phenomenon for a dragon to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team of warriors journeyed through the dark ruins, hands upon their sheathed weapons, carefully eyeing anything that may seem out of sort. Already, the team have encountered several traps and secret passages, and while most had been unearthed and activated, some spike traps and trapdoors had found themselves either reset or constantly active; while it was but a mere tiny obstacle for the stamina-strong Gerome &amp; Owain and naturally acrobatic Cynthia and Ophelia, Severa found herself in a pickle in her state of pregnancy, and required Ophelia to levitate her through the obstacles present, of which her daughter happily obliged. Walking through a passage lit by a floating fire spirit, summoned from Ophelia's black magic, the heroes felt they neared the end of the temple, and looked for indication of treasure around, hoping the elixir would be among the treasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sword-hand trembles,\" begun Owain, \"The sprits of fallen warriors possess me! They speak to my soul - The sacred elixir is bound to be within this very chamber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Severa flatly. \"You're going to make a gig out of this? This deep down? Can't you just take things seriously for one second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy's right.\" chimed Ophelia, exciting some surprise from Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, even our daughter thinks you're loone-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the spirits of demons lurk these halls! The darkness beckons to take us in our search, but I have embraced it! I promise to guide you through its malicious desire Daddy, so we may find the treasure it protects!\" Owain looked charged up by Ophelia's display, matching her wavelength of excitement, while Severa palmed her face at the two, embarrassed by their actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are right.\" started Gerome, scanning the mostly empty rectangular room they were in. \"There's something here.\" Cynthia moved her hands to her weapons, one on Falchion, another on her lance, and took the stance of a tiger, ready to pounce on prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, bring out all the ghosts and the demons!\" she cried, \"I'll slice 'em all to ribbons, then cut 'em up some more and make confetti for my grand entrance to the boss monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean that.\" responded Gerome, slightly annoyed by the display. \"This room is hiding something. Look, it's empty, yet decorated ornately, with a small breeze of air coming through. If I had to guess, this was a place of worship for whoever designed it, it must have a secret room made to store treasure for this purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Mr. Archaeologist,\" shot back Severa, \"Then where is this room? And how do we get inside? These walls are solid last time I checked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" responded Gerome, \"I'm just making conjecture based upon what I see.\" Gerome beckoned Ophelia closer to him, bringing the flames closer to him as he inspected a pillar, rubbing his hands across the limestone. \"There must be some sort of mechanism in place to open up a chamber, if I had to guess. We'll have to search stone after stone, to look for a switch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's gonna take hours!\" cried Cynthia, bored by the lack of action. \"I want Lucy back to normal as much as the rest of us, but can't we just break stuff instead and look for small crevices like that? It's gotta be much faster!\" Pouting, Cynthia leaned against a statue of an ancient idol, and in response, it sunk into the wall, throwing Cynthia off her feet and making her crash to the floor. Upon this activation, the whole party watched as a section of wall opened up, revealing a golden chamber that flooded the room with radiant light; gold, jewels, and ornate jars filled the room, and the centerpiece that sat upon a pedestal in the middle of the room was a worn goblet, with signs of being moved before. The party was awestruck by the discovery, not expecting a result of this caliber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the elixir?\" asked Gerome. He tried not to show it, but was overjoyed at the prospect of Lucina's cure near arm's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so...golden.\" remarked Owain, awestruck by the goblet's luster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo-hoo! We found it! I'm gonna go test it out!\" Cynthia got up and began running to the goblet. As Cynthia got close to Severa, the raven-haired mercenary shoved the royal blood to the floor before stamping her foot upon her back, pinning Cynthia to the ground. \"Oww! Let me go Severa! What the heck was that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You moron!\" shouted Severa, \"Think back to the story; The guy shrank to the size of an insect after he chugged the elixir, do you want to make a problem out of a solution after we fix up Lucina?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" protested the Pegasus Knight, \"I just wanted to make sure this stuff works is all! I don't want anything else happening to Lucy after we came this far in, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release her Severa.\" At Gerome's command, Severa huffed and backed up, giving Cynthia some room to get up. Gerome got closer and put his hands on Cynthia's shoulders, speaking to his sister-in-law calmly to get his words through. \"I want Lucina back to normal like the rest of us, she's my wife, but it defeats the purpose of the journey if we make you too small to handle in exchange for Lucina's shrinking. Do you understand, Cynthia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" pouted Cynthia, \"But couldn't we just find a meteor and get me big again like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You raise a good point, but we still don't know exactly what those things are or where they came from. I don't want any negative side-effects on you either, if there are any, you're my family too after all.\" Cynthia's eyes got big and the girl let out a small squeal, thinking Gerome's words were adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, when you put it that way, we'll surprise her with whatever this stuff does!\" Gerome broke conversation with Cynthia, and the 5 heroes began to walk towards the goblet together in order to bring it back to Lucina. The gold and jewelry they walked through was enticing, mainly to Severa, but they stayed focused on their mission, closing the distance between themselves and the fabled elixir. They all leaned in together, making sure no traps would possibly activate, and gazed into the mouth of the goblet.</span></div></div>",

It tasted old and dusty, but not much different to ordinary water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tastes like flavored water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome shouted at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't waste that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey it's fine!

She fed Lucina the elixir and waited, Lucina returning her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerome touched his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" Lucina waited eagerly for any kind of change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it takes time for the elixir to work?\" Cynthia said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain forced a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lissa's story implied the elixir would work immediately, but that could have just been narrative convenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina tensed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I hope so.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group travelled back to the small village they came from, intending to take rest before retracing their path back to Ylisstol and regrouping with Chrom and Sumia. The mood was somber and quiet; Lucina and Gerome felt as if they spent a good chunk of their lives on a wild goose chase, though in reality it was merely a few weeks, and the other 4 had no clue what to say to the two without causing distress. Lucina looked towards the ground, looking slightly sorrowful, yet trying to keep her composure to keep the mood happy; for the in-flight Gerome and Cynthia close to Lucina's face, they weren't fooled by her demeanor, and tried to console her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" asked Gerome, flying in close. Lucina looked at him and tried her best to put on a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you aren't.\" responded the Wyvern Rider. \"I'm sorry about the elixir, I did not intend for our search to end like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Lucina said, shaking her head, \"It's not your fault the elixir didn't work, we had no idea if it even truly existed.\" Lucina looked towards the sky. \"You are right though, I am a little disappointed over how it didn't work, it almost felt like a waste of time. I suppose I could get used to life as a giant; I have my friends, my family, and especially you and Minerva.\" Gerome couldn't help but get depressed at Lucina's mood, he felt low knowing he had no hope to lean on, no more words to offer past parroting the same things he's been saying for the past few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could always try that hex out Lady Lucina, would you like me to try?\" asked Ophelia, sitting upon the back of the wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, make her big and bald, great idea...\" muttered Severa under her breath, doubting Ophelia's magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, but thank you Ophelia, I think I'm done with trying to fix my condition anymore, I'm just going to get used to my size from now on. You are truly a caring niece.\" Ophelia wanted to relish the compliment, but couldn't crack a smile at the mood; she basically just got to this timeline, and still it felt as depressing as her future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd cut my sword hand from my body and seal my special moves forever if it could get you back to normal Lucina...\" spoke Owain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luce, you can ask us for anything you need as long as you're in Ylisstol, OK? We're part of you're family too, got it?\" chimed in Severa. Cynthia raised her fist up in response, addressing Lucina with bravado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And if Ylisstol's got a problem with my really big sister, well then, I'll just have to arrest the whole city! We're gonna make this okay!\" Lucina cracked a small smile at her family's comments, grateful to have such a colorful and kind group to rely on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, the group had reached the village they departed from, now far more welcoming being aware of Lucina's size. They walked through town a bit, receiving a few stares from townspeople over the still-giant Lucina, before reaching Elder Hubba's residence. The old man walked outside with his cane, coming face-to-face with the not-so-happy faces of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there, youngsters! Back so soon?\" he asked. Hubba looked upon Lucina before looking at everyone else's faces; he got the mood of the group really quickly. \"I see you're still big young lady, didn't find the elixir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that, Elder,\" responded Lucina, \"We did find the elixir, but it appears not to have worked. I doubt someone would make up a story with so much evidence that backs it, so the elixir must've been lost its potency over the centuries. We thank you for your help Elder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem missy, sorry it didn't work out though.\" responded the old man, trying to keep cheerful. \"Well, seeing as you're here, would you fellas like to participate in our Hunting Festival? We got some delicious meals and desserts to help celebrate this year's bountiful hunt, I'm sure you folks would like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Elder, but we really must be going back home, south of Ferox.\" Hearing this, Cynthia fell into a childish tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Lucyyyyy!\" she pouted, flailing her arms around, \"Festivals come once every year! Can't we just relax a little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Cynthia, but no.\" responded the giant princess. \"You can stay if you like, but I'd really just like to see Father and Mother again. Besides, I wouldn't want you getting drunk again.\" Cynthia begrudgingly stopped her tantrum, not wanting to further upset Lucina after her sister's disappointing journey, but still folded her arms like a child. Lucina turned again to address the Elder. \"We're sorry Elder, but thank you for the offer. We'll be going now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's too bad.\" replied the Elder. \"That green-haired woman really was looking forward to the Pie-Eating Contest against you as well. She has been eating us out of all our food though...\" Everyone was surprised at the Elder's words, save Ophelia who didn't know why her family reacted as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiki's here?!\" asked Lucina, excited - the Manakete might have an answer to her problem. \"Elder, where was this woman last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right behind you.\" On those words, the party turned to find Tiki behind them, chowing down on a cooked turkey drumstick, chomping on the bone and all with a smile on her face. \"Hey,\" she spoke cheerfully, \"How have you guys been? Nice clothes, Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tiki!\" responded Lucina, getting down on her knees to address the Manakete in a desperate fashion. \"Oh thank goodness you're here, the shrinking elixir you and Say'ri spoke of existed, but it did not work on me. Is there anything else you can think of to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so it really did exist.\" Tiki remarked. She threw the scrap of bone in her mouth and crunched down hard, grinding it up into a fine calcium powder. \"Ah, who cares about that old thing anyways?\" Lucina was taken aback by this, feeling Tiki's words were harsh, and was hurt by her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Tiki, how could you say that? We journ-\" Tiki raised a palm to calm the girl before she might've made an outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me finish Lucina, let me finish. There's no point in caring about that anymore since Lady Naga's fixed you up a little cure for your problem.\" On this, everyone was in shock, moods brightening now knowing that Naga herself prepared a cure for Lucina. The princess herself replaced the hurt in her heart with hope, and spoke excitedly towards Tiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" she cried, \"The Divine Dragon Naga?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm!\" replied Tiki, expecting this reaction from Lucina and feeling gladdened by her hope. \"You know Dragonstones, right? We prepared something very similar and dubbed it a 'Giantstone', so now you can shift between your sizes as you please. Want to lie in bed with your hubby? Then go back to normal! Need a boost to view the woods? Then get big! Even those clothes will grow and shrink with you! And all it took was one meteor and you need to participate in a ritual!\" Lucina was gladdened by this news, as was everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, cut the crap.\" remarked Gerome. \"You said you needed a meteor, how did you get one without growing yourself? We saw what happened to Say'ri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite perceptive Gerome.\" responded Tiki. \"Alright, it's true, someone had to get big just to get you small, so Lady Sumia took the charge herself.\" Lucina and Cynthia's eyes widened at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother did that for me?\" asked Lucina, shocked and touched by Sumia's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Mother alright? Will she be a giant from now on? She hasn't even had me yet!\" commented Cynthia, worried about Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down you two, Lady Sumia's fine, she shrank herself down as a test subject for this, but she'll have the ability to get big when she wants from now on.\" responded Tiki. \"When we grew Lady Sumia initially however, we accidentally caused Maribelle to grow to your size as well. At first, she freaked out, but she seems willing to give you her meteor to shrink again.\" At this, Lucina began to tear up and broke into a big smile, not being able to hold her feelings of happiness in anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maribelle did that for me...I...I'm so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to get to Mount Prism for the ritual. You probably want to get small sooner than later, but can't we have that Contest first?\" Gerome glared at Tiki from behind his mask, feeling angered that Tiki would suspend his wife's cure for leisure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's fine with you, Lady Tiki,\" responded Lucina, \"I would prefer we leave now, I miss my old size. I promise to hold our own between us when we return to Valm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself.\" Lucina turned to Hubba at Tiki's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your help, Elder Hubba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, little miss! Have fun on your journey!\" he spoke, waving his cane in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, full speed ahead to Mount Prism!\" cried Owain, whipping the horse reins to make his wagon move; in an instant, the group had all bolted to Mount Prism, now with Tiki in tow. When they were out of sight, Elder Hubba had retreated back into his house, walking into a kitchen and producing a goblet from a cupboard, similar to the one in the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel bad about lying to those nice kids...\" he spoke to himself, \"But they looked so needy for that shrinking elixir, just like in the story.\" Hubba filled the goblet with some water from a in-kitchen pond and squeezed some blueberries into the water, turning it a pale blue, just exactly like the elixir. He sighed for a bit before looking out a window. \"Guess I'm gonna have to travel back into that temple, didn't think they'd actually make it that far, I hope I disarmed all those traps when they went in. The things I do for tourism...\" Hubba exited his kitchen and went to join the rest of the villagers for the festival, goblet upon his table.</span></div></div>",

I wish only for the safety of our realm and people, and I\u2019d gladly be the first to take responsibility for anything that may happen out of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow noble.\u201d answered Gerome, clearly still not amused by the idea of this. \u201cSo was it your grand idea, or was it the tactician's?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither, actually.\u201d Sumia answered, \u201cMaribelle actually pushed the idea, and volunteered for the front lines herself.\u201d Gerome lost his footing at this, not expecting pompous and noble Maribelle to give the A-Okay for a war, everyone else found themselves just as shocked as Gerome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d added in Owain, scratching the back of his head, \u201cAuntie Maribelle does seem like the type of person to make rash decisions like that. Just don\u2019t tell her I said that\u2026\u201d Chrom grimaced a little, remembering clearly how the suggestion came about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say she might have gone on a bit of a power trip when suggesting to use her power to \u2018protect Lissa\u2019s farm'. It was a little horrifying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you Father,\u201d chimed Lucina, moving forward as she spoke, \u201cI\u2019d be happy with protecting the future ahead at this size, but for now, I would just like to go home with Gerome and sleep in the same bed as him once more. It\u2019s been quite a roundabout journey after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ask nothing more of you Lucina.\u201d responded Chrom with a smile. \u201cTake all the time you need. You don\u2019t even have to pick up your stone again, I\u2019d do anything to protect your peace.\u201d Lucina smiled as she looked down at her Father, before turning to Gerome; the Wyvern Rider sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as an apology for the suggestion then.\u201d Gerome looked up and cracked a small smile. \u201cThank you for all you\u2019ve done\u2026Father.\u201d Lucina giggled at Gerome\u2019s attempts to address his extended family, causing the masked man to blush and fidget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna be big too! I wanna be big too!\u201d Cynthia ran forward and began jumping in front of her parents like a child hopped up on candy. \u201cC\u2019mon c\u2019mon c\u2019mon c\u2019mon Father, pleeeeeease?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, normally I would say no,\u201d answered Sumia in Chrom\u2019s place, \u201cBut seeing as how I\u2019m now capable of shifting sizes, why not? We can be a giant mother-and-daughter team!\u201d Cynthia let out a shriek and hugged her mother tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you thank you thank you! This is gonna be so fun!\u201d Severa shook her head at the sight of Cynthia acting like a dope again, but Ophelia thought it was sweet, and giggled in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, now everyone clear out!\u201d Tiki spoke, \u201cI got to concentrate here, let small Lucina be a big surprise for you!\u201d With a wave of her arms, everyone save Lucina bunched up and left the temple, leaving the two girls alone together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that, you know, they could easily have watched.\u201d Lucina protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Tiki apologetically responded, \u201cI just didn\u2019t want them to hear me get mushy with you.\u201d Tiki knelt down towards Lucina and lowered her head. \u201cI really haven\u2019t been a help to you this whole journey, and I feel as if I hurt more people than I have helped, Maribelle especially. I am dubbed the Voice of Naga, yet I feel as if this experience has been a wake-up call; I still have very much to learn about humans and the natural world, and I cannot simply feign the part of an all-knowing sage with big words and a steady demeanor to command respect or favors of people. I hope you may forgive me if I hurt your feelings in any way, Lucina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Lucina responded, \u201cYou had no way of knowing the shrinking elixir was even real, yet you gave me hope to cure myself and allowed me to journey with my loving friends and family. And even as I traveled on a wild goose chase, you went out of your way to make things right for me, and here you stand, begging forgiveness now when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Tiki, you truly are a great friend, and I\u2019m proud to have met you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Lucina,\u201d responded Tiki, \u201cI\u2019m sure Mar-Mar would\u2019ve been proud to meet you too if he were still alive.\u201d The two ladies smiled at each other, reaching a mutual understanding, before Tiki got back up again. \u201cNow then, shall we?\u201d Lucina entered a circle of meteor shard as beckoned by Tiki as the Manakete summoned Naga before the two of them. In a few short moments, the ritual began, and Lucina found herself bathed in light as rocks swirled around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party waited outside the temple for Lucina to be done, joined by Say\u2019ri who sat at a pondside, relishing her original stature. Say\u2019ri\u2019s mind wandered to other matters, relieving her of the stress her Amazon size once gave her, but her ears overheard slight words of the group\u2019s conversation, yet she remained far calmer than the shocked Chrom and Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say you came from the <i>future</i>?!\u201d spoke a shocked Chrom to Ophelia. \u201cJust how many kids are going to come back from the future?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust me, my Lord, I came only for my parents sakes.\u201d Ophelia pondered it for a moment before shuddering &amp; continuing. \u201cThough now that you mentioned it, a blond-haired mercenary had lusted after me in the future I came from, and I wouldn\u2019t put it past her to travel back just for me, she was kinda scary. I can\u2019t remember her name, Sol-something or other, but she said her mother and father were Shepherds too, and invited me out for tea with the both of them.\u201d Chrom put his hand to his face and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh gods, it\u2019s Morgan and Inigo\u2019s child\u2026\u201d</i> Chrom didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or be disturbed by the irony that one of Robin\u2019s bloodline had fallen in love with a daughter of his family\u2019s, more the fact she was a girl herself. Sumia shook off the shock from Ophelia\u2019s revelation, and got to speaking more calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I must say, you are a cute child, Ophelia, it makes me proud to know you\u2019re part of my family as well!\u201d Ophelia blushed at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Your Highness! I aim to please all!\u201d Severa felt a smug sense of pride in knowing her daughter was complimented by the Queen of Ylisse herself. Just then, the massive stone doors of the temple opened, slowly creaking as they shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Tiki and Lucina exit!\u201d spoke Say\u2019ri, intent on knowing the fruits of their labor. As everyone watched carefully for the two stepping into the light, their faces of hope turned to disappointment as they saw Lucina still a giant, both her and Tiki\u2019s faces looking sullen. Say\u2019ri was confused; she had saw it work on Sumia and felt it herself, why not work with Lucina? \u201cLady Tiki?\u201d she asked, \u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d After a moment of silence, Lucina winked and returned to a happy demeanor, as did Tiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha! We\u2019re only kidding!\u201d With that, Lucina produced a bright yellow orb from her person and held it high, bathing her in a bright yellow light. When the blinding aura cleared, Lucina stood at her original 5\u20198\u201d stature once again, smiling widely from ear-to-ear, still clothed in her custom-made tunic which shrank with her. \u201cIt works like a charm! Thank you all for your help!\u201d Everyone was relieved that Lucina was back to her old self again, and ran over to crowd and congratulate her. Gerome moved forward the most and pulled Lucina in for a deep hug, erecting \u201cOoh!\u201ds and \u201cAww!\u201ds from the onlooking party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGods, how I\u2019ve missed this\u2026\u201d spoke Gerome warmly, feeling the embrace of his wife returned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back, Gerome. Thank you for sticking with me.\u201d The two broke away for a moment before closing in their faces for a deep kiss. The onlookers looked on happily, Severa grabbed Owain\u2019s arm and stroked it tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf something freaky like that ever happens to me,\u201d she spoke, \u201cYou better sure as hell treat me like that when I get fixed.\u201d Owain nodded, and as he did, Ophelia joined in, thinking the act to be a group hug; the moment might\u2019ve been ruined, but the two did not protest, and leaned in closer to their daughter. Sumia leaned into Chrom\u2019s chest and hugged him tightly as well, Cynthia joining in upon Chrom\u2019s back \u2013 love clearly was in the air because of the two Valm residents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then,\u201d Sumia spoke up, \u201cI believe you said you were going to visit with us after you got back to normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Mother.\u201d responded Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then,\u201d replied the Queen, \u201cI say we have a family picnic to celebrate! Everyone here\u2019s invited!\u201d Tiki\u2019s mouth watered as she jumped at the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please tell me you have a fine turkey for me to eat!\u201d spoke the Manakete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but first we should stop and thank Auntie Maribelle on our way back for Lucina! She\u2019s gonna flip when she sees Ophelia!\u201d Owain spoke. As the group all walked off together, Sumia becoming a larger size and Tiki turning to a dragon to make the journey easier, Gerome and Lucina lagged behind, the two saddling up together on Minerva\u2019s back; the wyvern was overjoyed to see Lucina ride upon her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to do the honors?\u201d asked Gerome, pointing at Minerva\u2019s reins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d responded Lucina with a smile. In one sweeping motion, Lucina commanded the wyvern to take flight, and the three journeyed off to join with the rest of their family and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey was finally over.</span></div></div>",

Come to smite you with the might of the mighty Missiletainn and support of my loving wife, Severa Light!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d shouted Ophelia, donned in armor and hair up in pigtails, \u201cWe make up a duo of justice together, and as long as our spirits linger in this world, your kind has no room to live!\u201d The two bunched up together, back-to-back, before lunging forward with swords in hand, dashing like a charging rhino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHAAAADOOOOW DRAAAAGOOOON!!!\u201d cried the two, as they thrust their blades into the darkness before them, stabbing at the invisible enemy they fought against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaand scene!\u201d shouted Severa, sitting in a chair with full view of the stage her family worked on. Owain and Ophelia broke away from each other and begun to stretch, grinning at each other as they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did great, honey!\u201d complimented Owain towards his daughter, \u201cYou play your mother really well! In terms of face, you\u2019ve inherited your grandmother\u2019s looks, but your hair\u2019s just as brilliant as Severa\u2019s is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Daddy!\u201d Ophelia responded, giggling as she did so. \u201cI really want to make sure I make Mommy out to be the hero of justice she truly is, so that everyone may know how great she really is!\u201d Ophelia turned towards Severa to ask for her input. \u201cHow did I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I think you need to be grumpier, and you won\u2019t ever catch me dead with those ridiculous special moves, but all-in-all, not bad, you make a fine actress, Ophelia.\u201d The sorceress was gladdened by her mother\u2019s words and placed her hands to her rosy-red cheeks in response. Suddenly, the door to the theater flew open, and a loud voice shouted into the auditorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, where is she?\u201d cried an excited Lissa, \u201cWhere is my little granddaughter from the future?\u201d Lissa ran down the aisle and jumped up onto the stage, coming face-to-face with her granddaughter before pulling her in for a hug. \u201cThere she is! It\u2019s like looking into a mirror! Oh, if I were still a city princess and not a farm princess, I\u2019d spoil you so silly right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, all I need is your face, Grandma Lissa!\u201d Lissa squealed at how polite her granddaughter was and dragged Owain into the hug with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Owain! You make a mother so proud! I\u2019ve already lived to be a grandmother and I\u2019m not even in my 20s yet, and she\u2019s so polite too!\u201d Lissa spun around to Severa and addressed her. \u201cHey, Severa, when is the little version of her due?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust in two months or so, doctors say.\u201d responded Severa with a grin. \u201cI need to be relaxing and out of work until then, so Ophelia\u2019s going to take my part in our shows we\u2019ll put on, her magic is sure to blow the audience away too! You and Other Dad are coming to the first show next week, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kidding me? I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world! I\u2019m bringing Donny\u2019s Mom too, she\u2019s never seen a fancy play before!\u201d Owain looked around at mention of his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is Father anyways? Didn\u2019t he come with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know Donny! Always lagging behind with some sort of thing he\u2019s doing!\u201d Lissa turned to the door and shouted as loud as she could. \u201cHeeey! Donny! Come in here and meet your granddaughter right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019! I\u2019m comin\u2019!\u201d Donnel ran into the auditorium and fixed his hair, trying to look as nice as he possibly could. \u201cWell howdy Ophelia! Nice to meet ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandpa Donny!\u201d Ophelia jumped from the stage and pulled in her grandfather for a big hug, happy to see him again. \u201cIt\u2019s been ages since Uncle Henry took me to see you on the farm, you definitely look shorter than in the future!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Donnel cried, \u201cThat definitely hurt ma\u2019 pride a little! Why, you almost wanna make me sign on ta Chrom\u2019s Giants Brigade like that!\u201d Everyone laughed at Donnel\u2019s displeasure, taking joy in making fun of the farm boy\u2019s short stature. \u201cSpeakin\u2019 of, any of you fellas thinking about signin\u2019 on fer that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTempting, but no,\u201d replied Owain, \u201cMy passion is in two things: My sword-hand, and the stage. You can\u2019t just abandon a weapon and a job for another weapon and another job, that\u2019s like losing two best friends for two new friends, and they might not even be cooler!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d rather just perform with Daddy.\u201d Ophelia added on. \u201cThe stage is my life, and I want to dedicate my time to putting smiles on the people\u2019s faces 24/7. Besides, if any brigands come raiding, I\u2019ll just hit \u2018em with the worst hexes I can drag up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get me anywhere near those dumb meteors, and I\u2019d stomp you out of existence. I like being normal, thank you very much.\u201d Severa pointed at Lissa before continuing. \u201cWhat about your wife? She seems trigger-happy for a Giantstone of her own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah,\u201d Lissa replied, \u201cIt\u2019d be cool to have, but Chrom says it\u2019s strictly for military use only, and I\u2019d rather not get drafted into the army again, I got a farm I gotta tend to. Same goes to Donny too, the quiet life\u2019s for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelp, then I guess that\u2019s that then!\u201d Donny ended the topic with. \u201cJust thought I\u2019d bring it up cuz I ran into one of the Giant Brigade members on my way here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Owain asked, intrigued, \u201cWhat were they like? A big, strong man? Worthy of a rivalry with my blade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, nothin\u2019 like that,\u201d Donny replied, \u201cIt was a girl first of all, and she looked pretty darn pretty too!\u201d Lissa felt a little jealous, but Ophelia was intrigued by what a female Giant Brigade member would be like, besides those in her royal family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was she like Grandpa Donny? Does she do magic like me? Or is she a seasoned warrior who fights with her muscles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe latter.\u201d he replied. \u201cShe was tellin\u2019 me she used to work as a mercenary too, cuttin\u2019 down thugs for loot and takin\u2019 the kidnapped women on nights out as payment.\u201d Suddenly, Ophelia\u2019s eyes grew large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Did she say she was in love with women?\u201d Ophelia asked, slightly frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she said somethin\u2019 along the lines of that,\u201d Donnel replied, \u201cBut she said she already had a sweetheart she joined the Brigade for, said she fell in love at first sight with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-And her hair? What color was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlonde, why\u2019d ya ask?\u201d Just then, the family of 5 heard the sound of stomping across the ground, like something large was coming towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Ophelia~! Where are you~?\u201d came a booming and seductive voice from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s gotta be her! I told her \u2018bout the show next week while we were in the market, and she done perked right up at the poster I showed.\u201d Suddenly, Donnel got real confused as he saw Ophelia shudder. \u201cWait a sec, do you two know each other?\u201d Owain and Severa immediately picked up on the signals, remembering Ophelia\u2019s story she told on Mount Prism a few weeks prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh gods no.\u201d Severa muttered. On that, the gigantic face of a beautiful young blonde blocked the outside of the theater doors, her brown eyes looking into the theater as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOphelia, my sweet!\u201d she spoke, \u201cYour darling Soleil has traveled across eons just for you! Check out this new power I have, isn\u2019t it just darling? Let\u2019s go out on a tea date, just you and me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap!\u201d Ophelia screamed, turning around and running to the props room, dragging Owain with her. \u201cHide me! Hide me! This woman\u2019s totally crazy!\u201d Soleil stuck her hand into the theater and tried outstretching it to the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh~!\u201d she cried, \u201cYou can run all you want, but fate destines us to be together! A giant warrior and her tiny princess \u2013 it almost sounds like a romantic fairy tale!\u201d Lissa and Donnel ran towards the back to avoid being hit by the giant mercenary\u2019s hand. Severa watched the scene play out before her and just shook her head, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGawds!\u201d she cried, \u201cWhy is it that fate has given me a family of weirdos?!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chrom stood out in the courtyard, training his blade skills among the various training dummies he set up. Though he was the Exalt of Ylisse, he felt it was no excuse to put aside his training as a warrior, for if Grima was any indication, a threat could come out of nowhere at any moment, and Chrom was willing to put his life on the line to protect his people like his older sister once did. He figured his wife and daughter already protected Ylisstol on their own patrols with far more area covered than he could, so Chrom had a lot of training to his body and mind to catch up to his family. As he dashed, leapt, and stabbed around his large circle he set up with such speed and power in his lunges, Chrom felt the vibration of two monoliths coming towards him, causing him to slow his training to a halt. As he turned around, the giant bodies of Sumia and Cynthia came into view, decked out in their full Shepherd armor, just finished from their Brigade patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrom!\u201d called Sumia, \u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201d The Exalt smiled as the two girls stepped over the castle walls into the courtyard, kneeling down to face Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back, Sumia, Cynthia, how was the patrol?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was great!\u201d Cynthia cried. \u201cWe ran into some brigands ransacking a nearby town, so we showed up and used our stones to intimidate them, and they immediately gave up on the spot! You should\u2019ve seen the looks on their faces!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s not exactly how it went\u2026\u201d Sumia added, pressing her fingers together in embarrassment. \u201cThey weren\u2019t exactly intimidated until I\u2026tripped and crushed their caravan wagon\u2026\u201d Chrom snickered, expecting as much from Sumia, causing the Queen\u2019s cheeks to flare up a hot pink. \u201cHey! It\u2019s not that funny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Chrom responded, \u201cIt\u2019s just such a \u2018you\u2019 thing, I could see something like that happening!\u201d Chrom\u2019s chuckles didn\u2019t help cure Sumia\u2019s embarrassment, and it didn\u2019t help that Cynthia joined in on the giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelp,\u201d Cynthia added, \u201cWe got our patrol done on there, I\u2019m gonna just take my shift in the Pegasus Knights right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie,\u201d Sumia chimed, \u201cYou\u2019re too much of a workaholic, why don\u2019t you take the night off? I\u2019ll take over your patrol in the Pegasus Knights tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mother!\u201d Cynthia protested, \u201cI need to be a hero of justice to everyone in Ylisstol, and keeping the ground and skies safe is one of my duties!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve done a great job at that,\u201d Chrom added, \u201cBut Sumia\u2019s right, you\u2019re going to overwork yourself at this rate. As Exalt, I\u2019m going to command you to take the night off and spend it with Brady, he just got back from tour after all. In fact, I\u2019ll give you money for dinner tonight, should you spend it at a restaurant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you say so Father.\u201d In an instant, Cynthia shrank back to her original size and ran to enter the castle to her room. \u201cBut just to let you know,\u201d she called back to her parents, \u201cIf I see any crime on the streets tonight, I\u2019m getting big right on the spot and busting their butts!\u201d With that Cynthia retreated back to her room, leaving the two to ponder how their daughter could\u2019ve become so reckless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe can be such a handful sometimes\u2026\u201d Chrom commented before turning to Sumia. \u201cAre you alright with taking over Cynthia\u2019s shift tonight? I\u2019d think that you\u2019d want to relax in the library after all that ground work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh horse poo!\u201d Sumia scoffed, \u201cThis Queen stuff really isn\u2019t for me anyways, all I do is just read or walk around the city, it\u2019s too much lax! No, I\u2019m more happy knowing I\u2019m giving back to the people of Ylisstol like this, and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to keep them safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, ever since you showed this power off those weeks ago, the people have seemed more welcome to the idea of giants, you just have that calming effect on people I suppose.\u201d Chrom thought to himself for a moment, appreciating the fact destiny allowed him to meet Sumia and give her the title of Queen she deserved. \u201cBut Sumia, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that even though Maribelle suggested this Brigade, she hasn\u2019t signed up for it, and you\u2019re working twice as hard as you should be. Are you trying to take over for her?\u201d Sumia sighed, she was caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Chrom, I just kinda feel responsible for Maribelle being the way she is now, so I feel I should at least take over her job suggested and let her enjoy life with Robin. It was a private conversation between us, and it took a lot of convincing, so please don\u2019t tell anyone, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour secret\u2019s safe with me.\u201d Chrom responded, gladdened by his wife\u2019s selfless nature. \u201cOn that note, since you\u2019ll be out for the night, why don\u2019t we check in on Lucina now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea!\u201d Sumia shrank down to her original size and laid her hand in Chrom\u2019s, and the two began to walk off together to see their baby. \u201cYou know,\u201d Sumia added, \u201cWe still need to have baby Cynthia now that I think about it, shall I take off early tonight so we may have some fun?\u201d Chrom didn\u2019t know whether to giggle or blush at Sumia\u2019s lewd suggestion, so he did both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Responded Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBraaaadyyyy! I\u2019m baaaack!\u201d Cynthia called around her decently-sized room, built like a small apartment, poking her head up the stairwell looking for her husband while his music reverberated through the room. \u201cWhere are you? Don\u2019t make me get big in this small space!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019 Cynthia! Cripes, no need to bring the house down on us!\u201d Brady came down the stairs from the second floor, brandishing a violin in his right hand and a bow in the other. \u201cSorry \u2018bout that, you caught me in the middle of some practice. How was patrol today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty good,\u201d Cynthia replied, \u201cMother bought down some justice on the brigands and we saved a small village! Mother\u2019s taking my shift too, so we can go out for dinner tonight! Father\u2019s paying!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear! I found this new place that opened up downtown, say they got the best damned quail this side of Ylisstol!\u201d Brady set down his instruments for a bit and wrapped his arm around Cynthia\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna sound like I\u2019m complaining or anything, but I still feel like this whole \u201cGiant Cynthia\u201d thing\u2019s gonna take some getting used to; hell, I still can\u2019t get over how big Ma is from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I feel you on that one. The whole growth felt really weird and everything, and it\u2019s still a little crazy how big I am compared to everyone else, but it\u2019s super fun towering over the bad guys and bringing them to justice! I feel like a real superhero like that!\u201d Cynthia spoke with stars in her eyes. \u201cSay, why don\u2019t you join the Brigade with me and Mother? You could strike some fear into brigands with your face! Uh, no offense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no, I ain\u2019t doing that!\u201d Brady replied defiantly. \u201cIt\u2019d give me a damned heart attack to have that much power, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of steppin\u2019 on some flowers; nah, music\u2019s more my thing and all, but if you guys need a healer to come around with ya, I\u2019m always up for that. Big you\u2019s fun and all, but I hope I can still cuddle with the Tiny Cynthia once in a while, yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet!\u201d Cynthia responded, \u201cHow else am I gonna watch your home shows at a big size anyways? I\u2019d take up all the rows!\u201d Cynthia giggled and gave her husband a kiss on the cheek. \u201cNow then, wanna go get a reservation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! Just lemme get my good clothes on.\u201d Brady retreated up the stairs again to put on his formal wear, while Cynthia retreated into her closet to find a good dress to wear. The two planned to have a fun night full of joy and laughs ahead of them, definitely the future they envisioned, though not with footnotes they expected.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maribelle could no longer enjoy the view of her terrace anymore, now being 10 times larger without a Giantstone to shrink down with, but she didn\u2019t mind much, she found some benefits to this size that definitely spiced up her life. First of all, the harvest had become pathetically easy with her size, allowing her to command the grape vines and harvest with ease, and juicing was even easier now that she had to just dip one foot into the tub of grapes to crush them; this allowed the servants of her manor to have a boost in morale and for Robin to take over her shipping log duties and motherly duties on a more full-time basis, both acts which he naturally excelled at. Second, ever since Chrom announced the Giants Brigade, Maribelle had been viewed less as a freak and more as a celebrity in Themis, earning the title of \u201cThe Gold Giantess\u201d among the upper nobility for her radiant hair and use of her size to make riches; this admiration came in the form of journalists looking for interviews, artists wishing to paint her radiance, and plenty of invitations for her and Robin as guests of honor to many fine parties and gatherings of the like. As an added bonus, Sumia herself resolved to take Maribelle\u2019s duties up in the Brigade and let her enjoy family life full-time, and she even donated some of her old outfits with use of her stone so she wouldn\u2019t be stuck wearing nothing but curtain underwear full-time; Maribelle chose this day to wear an old pink dress of Sumia\u2019s, which she thought looked darling on her, and chugged down a barrel of her finest blend of tea, enjoying the pleasing flavor and aroma. Still bright in the afternoon, Robin came outside to join her, carrying with him both babies Brady and Morgan; the three sat themselves at the table to join their noble family member and brighten her already glorious day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Robin, how goes your duties today?\u201d Maribelle asked, enjoying the sight of Robin not totally drenched in sweat for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d he answered, \u201cEverything looks to be in order in terms of shipping, and Brady and Morgan are doing just fine today; I thought it\u2019d be fun if I bought them outside to see their mother today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA capital idea!\u201d Maribelle remarked, \u201cThe children do need some sun on their faces more than being cooped up in those old cribs of theirs anyways!\u201d Maribelle leaned into the terrace opening and moved her hand inside, rubbing the cheeks of her children gently with her finger, causing them to coo and giggle in joy. \u201cAnd how are my little bundles of joy this morning? Oh you two just look so cute that I could just eat you up! Though, I do realize how bad that may sound at my stature!\u201d Robin snickered a bit at watching his wife go gaga over the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really sound like you\u2019re enjoying yourself at this size.\u201d he commented, laughing a tad between sips of his teacup. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you\u2019ve forgotten your old life of being small in just these few weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow rude!\u201d Maribelle protested. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I quite do miss the joy of that terrace, as well as sleeping in a bed with you, cuddling your chest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe terrace I can understand,\u201d Robin replied back, still smirking, \u201cBut I did start sleeping with you in the ballroom, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m the one cuddling your chest now, and at your suggestion too!\u201d Maribelle blushed at his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well! I\u2019ll have you know I slide you between my breasts for your pleasure only! I can stop doing it any time I desire!\u201d Robin laughed at Maribelle\u2019s protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say dear.\u201d He answered back, clearly knowing he\u2019s put his wife in checkmate. \u201cThough, I am happy you\u2019ve made this into a good situation, in fact, I notice you\u2019ve made no attempt at trying to return to normal, and you seem to smile more than usual nowadays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I really that transparent?\u201d Maribelle asked. \u201cYou are right, perhaps I have gone on a power trip with my new size, I\u2019ve never felt so full of life before since seeing the world from this perspective. Maybe I was meant to become like this, it\u2019s definitely changed the way I see people.\u201d Maribelle slid her fingers under Robin\u2019s chair and brought him in close to the railing, near her face. \u201cBut most of all, it was you who\u2019s changed my view of my situation, and for that, I am forever in debt. If I am stuck like this forever, then so be it, but know that I love you more than anything.\u201d Maribelle leaned her husband into her lips and covered him in a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd know that I love you back; considering what happened during Grima\u2019s assault, I suppose you can say that we both saved each other once.\u201d Robin got up to retrieve his teacup and sat back down next to Maribelle\u2019s face. \u201cActually, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that Tiki just came by a few moments ago and said she was hard at work finding Lucina\u2019s meteor shards; she\u2019s already collected quite a few inactive pieces, so you might be able to get back to normal soon, though from the sound of it, I think you\u2019d rather stay big!\u201d Maribelle was slightly surprised by the news, but overjoyed all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas she here now?\u201d Maribelle asked. \u201cThat is good news to hear, it gives me an option, as well as a larger wardrobe, and we could save on the food supply we own as well! Perhaps she\u2019s not so bad after all, maybe I\u2019ll have her a gift basket made, full of our best wine and fruits!\u201d Maribelle wiggled her finger around Brady\u2019s face once more. \u201cDid you hear that Brady? Your Mother\u2019s going to be able to cradle you more manageably from now on!\u201d The baby leaned forward and let out a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMama!\u201d Brady called. Maribelle and Robin were in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear that?!\u201d Robin called out, overjoyed. Morgan started rocking in her chair, almost as if demanding attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapa!\u201d she spoke. Small tears welled in Maribelle\u2019s eyes as she gave an ear-to-ear smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur babies spoke their first words! This is what all mothers strive to see!\u201d Maribelle couldn\u2019t think of any way her life could be better at this point; she was large &amp; in-charge, healthy, rich, and with a loving husband and children to boot \u2013 her life truly was paradise. \u201cThis calls for a celebration; let us all go out to the finest restaurant in Themis tonight, I\u2019m more than sure they would let me in with my status!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great!\u201d Robin answered. \u201cLet me just wash up the babies and fetch my evening wear, and then we can head out!\u201d On that, Robin removed the babies from their chairs, each repeating \u201cMama!\u201d and \u201cPapa!\u201d back-to-back with one another, and began to take them inside for a bath. \u201cI love you honey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs do I Robin!\u201d With that exchange, Maribelle was left to her own joyous thoughts once more, and she gradually took sips from her barrel of tea while grinning, reflecting on the bliss that was her life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gerome and Lucina were hard at work on the roof of their home, Gerome hammered away at a set of nails while Lucina laid lumber in her gigantic form. Though she could now live life as normally as before, Lucina didn\u2019t totally want to give up being giant with the choice now available, and decided on the idea of renovating the house to better suit being a giant, alongside allowing Minerva to live as an in-home wyvern, ideas Gerome agreed on; in truth, the couple agreed that the intimate moments they shared while looking for the dud shrinking elixir spiced their relationship up too much to totally give up, and they wished to conduct their couple duties more in private, despite the fact they lived on a mountain secluded well enough from society. With the noise of the mallet ringing through the air once more, Gerome finally managed to finish the renovations on their house, and the once small shack now stood like a wooden mansion along the Cliffside of the mountain. Gerome wiped the sweat from his forehead and lightly gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, our home looks to be done now.\u201d he spoke. Lucina clasped her hands together, happy that their strenuous work was finally over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d she replied, gazing over the finished work. The home now had doors meant for Lucina in both her normal size and giant state and the interior was far larger for Lucina to do her morning workouts in, and though all the furniture was still the same size for the couple, they had incorporated one far larger bed into their home, of which Lucina and Gerome could spend their more private moments together. Lucina dug into her pocket and pulled out Gerome\u2019s mask, kept on Lucina\u2019s person to prevent it from being drenched in sweat and sawdust. \u201cWould you like your mask back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks, nobody can see my face this far out anyways.\u201d Gerome responded. \u201cIf you could get me down, I would appreciate it though.\u201d Lucina nodded and grabbed Gerome, moving him from the stories-high roof of their home to the ground, before shrinking back to normal, taking care to make sure Gerome\u2019s mask wasn\u2019t on her and turned miniscule-sized. Minerva crawled closer to her masters, receiving a pet from Lucina as the princess placed Gerome\u2019s mask in a satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a parrot, but I really did miss doing this.\u201d Lucina commented, referring to rubbing Minerva at a size where she didn\u2019t look like a small pet. \u201cThis Giantstone really was a saving grace, once again we owe everything to Naga.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear, hear.\u201d Gerome agreed. \u201cIt definitely helped increase our supply of raw goods too, it\u2019s amazing how it manages to cause anything on your person to expand as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sharp contrast from those meteors.\u201d Lucina added, remembering how her favorite tunic was completely destroyed by her initial growth. \u201cI must admit, the thought of Falchion becoming giant itself is too frightening to imagine though.\u201d Lucina referred to when she used the enlarged Falchion to chop down an entire forest grove for home lumber, and then proceeded to cleave a chunk of mountain away to expand the property of her and Gerome\u2019s home soon after; it\u2019s a good thing only her family could use Falchion, though Lucina would still think twice about lending the blade to Cynthia in her enlarged state. \u201cStill, I\u2019m glad that meteor episode finally ended, we can finally return to enjoying the peace of our marriage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it, and may it last forever.\u201d Gerome and Lucina moved to enter their newly-supersized home and pack it in for the night, but Minerva followed behind them, wanting to enter the house herself; noticing this, Lucina grew once again and opened the larger door to the home, allowing the wyvern inside. Minerva cuddled up near the fireplace and immediately fell asleep, cozy by the flames, while Lucina and Gerome disrobed themselves to prepare for bed. The two convened together towards their bedroom, Gerome clad in pajama bottoms and Lucina in a lingerie nightgown, and sat at the foot of the bed to talk to one another before they went out for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather\u2019s Brigade seems to be going well,\u201d Lucina started, \u201cCynthia tells me that she and Mother have seen a decrease in crime across Ylisse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d Gerome replied, \u201cThough I don\u2019t think policing the whole continent was a great idea. It doesn\u2019t set right with me for one nation to be looking over others, even for safety purposes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame Father for thinking that,\u201d Lucina spoke in defense, \u201cHe\u2019s a caring person who doesn\u2019t want a future like we came from, he\u2019s justified in being overly defensive.\u201d Lucina shot Gerome a quick smirk and flexed her arm a bit. \u201cThough if Father does go overboard with this, I\u2019ll make sure to knock some sense into him with Mother and Cynthia!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what of you? Will you join the Brigade yourself? You are more than qualified after all.\u201d Gerome asked. Lucina shook her head in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs much as I would enjoy being around my biological family again, being around myself would lead to more complication than naught, and besides, I already have a life with you I plan to enjoy. Though, now that you mention it, if we see any poaching up here, I won\u2019t hesitate to use my powers on whomever they may be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be fine with that.\u201d Gerome answered with a grin, gladdened by his wife\u2019s caring nature. The two began to lay back and looked through the large skylight they installed, up into the starry night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Gerome.\u201d Lucina spoke, commanding his attention. \u201cWhat do you think is out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, beyond this world.\u201d Lucina added, pointing at the stars. \u201cThe meteors that changed me must\u2019ve come from somewhere, it seems odd to think that mutation was purely natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a point,\u201d Gerome answered, \u201cAnd it was amazing that Naga and Tiki could use their divine magic to prepare you a cure. Perhaps the meteors themselves were magic from another world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Lucina pondered for a minute. \u201cOr maybe it was a gift from the gods who made this world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA gift?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lucina answered, \u201cAt first, we may not have reacted as well to it, but with Naga\u2019s help, we have been granted a new power. Maybe these meteors were brought here to help save us from something? Maybe that\u2019s why I was the first to grow, not by chance, but by choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to have philosophy on your mind a lot tonight.\u201d commented Gerome, a little surprised by Lucina\u2019s rationale. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at your logic, Grima is fated to return 1,000 years from now after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid Father do the right thing?\u201d asked Lucina, gears now running in her head. \u201cI don\u2019t wish for Robin to disappear, but will the future truly be ready for Grima\u2019s return?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe key to Grima lies in Robin\u2019s blood; he\u2019ll see to it that his family prevents Grima\u2019s return with Validar dead and the Grimleal on decline.\u201d Gerome responded. \u201cAnd I can feel it as I look into your eye; your bloodline will be a noble one, strong and unwavering, and if any threat would come to this world, they won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Gerome,\u201d responded Lucina, hugging his chest, \u201cYour words always put me at ease.\u201d Lucina thought for a moment before opening her mouth again. \u201cSpeaking of bloodlines, would you like to try for a child tonight?\u201d Gerome\u2019s face lit up, but he managed to keep his composure steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we could.\u201d he answered, pulling up the sheets of the bed. Lucina tugged on his arm before he could lay down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, meant the bigger bed\u2026\u201d Lucina said, pointing at the monolithic wooden frame. Gerome placed his hand to his head and shook it, though he looked at Lucina with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to stop talking to Severa, you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! It was just too good to give up!\u201d Gerome chuckled and allowed Lucina to go to the center of the room. She pulled out her Giantstone and used it, growing to her 60 foot stature before placing the large orb on her just-as-giant nightstand. She grabbed Gerome and brought him to her face. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d he answered. Lucina was gladdened by his growing confidence and how he seemed to open up emotionally far more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Gerome.\u201d responded the princess with a smile, enveloping her husband with a large full-body kiss. Lucina lowered Gerome into her underwear and placed him inside, before collapsing onto the bed and hugging her legs together; the two seemed to have more adventures in marriage ahead of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the starry sky above, shooting stars lit up the night, coming in close to the planet\u2019s surface. Be it other life, a gift from the heavens, or whatever else, it was certain by the meteors alone that the world was boundless, and nothing could be certainly set in stone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I figured it was more you\u2019re kind of thing than mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina opened it up. Inside was a shining, celebrate forged silver bracelet. Lucina was intrigued by the bright shine it gave and picked it up for a closer inspection. It looked even better in good light, each link was intricately woven and on the largest part were several paintings of the moon , each in varying phases and of a quality she would expect from a Royal Artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you mother\u2026 this must have cost you a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually no. All I had to  was agree to bake him a week\u2019s supply of sweets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina opened her mouth in disbelief then laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know he likes sweets but I can\u2019t believe he parted with something so valuable over\u2026 sweets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a very good at making sweets and he has the love with them.\u201d Sumia winked. \u201cNever underestimate the effect good food can have on a man. And I said I\u2019d bake them with extra honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why that would matter\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind,  it\u2019s a long story. Anyway it didn\u2019t look this good when he showed it to me,  I had to polish it several times before it sparkled like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina held the bracelet in front of her, er eyes drawn to the various moons<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did a very good job. Are you sure I should have this?  Wouldn\u2019t you rather wear it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. Besides since I married your father I have more than enough things to wear.\u201d And you could use all the fashion help you could get\u2026. Sumia thought, recalling her times clothes shopping with her daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you mother!\u201d She hugged Sumia and put on the bracelet. It fit perfectly, not the slightest bit too loose or too tight, almost as though it had been tailor made for her. She proudly walked, eager to show off her new treasure.</span></div></div>",

She smiled and thanked them as she continued her stroll. She stopped by various places to stop and chat for a bit: the food stalls, the clothing line, and even the armory. All of this made her happy, unlike her...previous timeline. But now isn't the time to look back, she thought, the menace that tortured her for years is now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thoughts halted as she heard someone yelling quite bombastically. She was on her way until she saw a grouo talking to each other. The purple prose, the intricate structure in his words, and the vitality in his voice. Yeah, Lucina thought, only one person fits <i>that</i> description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so! The samurai, shocked to see him alive in this tainted realm, approaches him with his legendary blade...\" Owain appeared to be in the middle of a story. He was sharing it with someone Lucina knew far too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then? What happened next?\" Cynthia screamed, apparently swinged into the exciting tone her cousin is using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up to another one of your tales, Owain?\" Lucina giggled as she walked up to the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho!\" Owain laughed to hear Lucina's voice once again, \"Care to join in? I'm sharing my ideas with Cynthia on my next greatest show: Odin Dark and the Invisible Kingdom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Cynthia spouted, \"It's about a trio suddenly being transported to another dimension, and must fight to overcome the great evil that will soon consume the one who summoned them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to hear this, but I got other plans for today. In the meantime, check out what my moher gave to me this morning.\" Lucina held up her hand that held the bracelet and showed its glimmering design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that's looks so cool, sis!\" Cynthia gawked, \"I can't wait to see you kick some butt the next time we go on a skirmish together.\" She struck a pose, acting as if she was the one wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible...\" Owain thought out loud as she approached the lord, \"May I see it, Lucina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, sure...?\" Lucina agreed as she handed it over to the myrmidon. Owain wasted no time in scrutinizing its lavish forge. It was going to be one of these moments...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This silvery gleam shines like the surface of the moon! The elegant design strikes fear into the wearer's foes! It gives a sense of authoeity, but at the same time, shows how caring thay person is. Such beauty can be compared to the moon itself! Even its patterns are of that we see in our moon! I can see you taking this in the middle of a night, the moon shining down on you as you look down on your foes, casting a menacing aura before you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWAIN!\" The sisters screamed to get his attention. Naturally, he jumped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack, sheesh, okay! It's a wonderful bracelet, Lucina. But such a bracelet needs a name! I shall dub it: the Lunar Bracelet!\" The three looked at each other momentarily. Lucina was the first to break the brief silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a wondeful name, Owain!\" Lucina said as she placed the bracelet back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Owain,\" Cynthia jumped in, \"It's one of the few times you ever gave a good name for something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I knew the two of you wouldn't be-wait, what do you mean 'one of the few times'!?\" Owain replied as he jerked his head over towards the giggling princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you two, I think that's enough banter for one day,\" Lucina said as she tamed the mood for a bit. Still, she couldn't help but look at her bracelet. Why was it locked up inside a black box? Perhaps it was a treasure long forgotten in history?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, do you want to hang out with us, Lucy?\" Cynthia asked, \"It would be more fun with you around!\" Lucina smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I got some time to kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Owain barked as the three began to walk around together, \"Now that we're together, let me continue from where I left off. The samurai, Prince Ryoma...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Owain continued his tale, which seemed to get more far flung with each word. Lucina wanted to believe him, but with each word the tale got more ridiculous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome dragon brings Owain, Severa and Inigio to a far off land to fight his other self and makes them change their names? And he can heal their future but he can\u2019t do anything about his other self or the warring kingdoms? And one of the kingdoms is ruled by an evil slime monster that people just obey anyway? And it\u2019s the kingdom Owain chooses to fight for? Not to mention so many of the actions undertaken by the characters in the story made no sense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina realised if she told her own tale to someone who didn\u2019t know it that it would also sound far flung and ridiculous but it would at least make more sense, as far-fetched as it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Owain was a skilled storyteller, he would make a fine bard or actor and he managed to make his yarn entertaining, despite the absurdity of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia hung on every word, not questioning any of the incongruity of it. Lucina herself was able to enjoy it, mainly by turning off the questioning part of her mind. It also felt good to spend some time with her family, and after everything they had gone through to be able to spend time relaxing instead of fighting for their lives or the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio was having so much fun together, and so lost in Owain\u2019s tale that they did not notice how low the sun was getting. It was almost sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia marvelled at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow time really passes when we hang out together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain stuck out her chest and posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m such a great Storyteller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Though I think it\u2019s also because we spent the time together. Shall we watch the sun set together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Owain and Cynthia chimed in at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed for the town centre, which in the short time they had would give them the best view of the sunset. The trio watched the sun\u2019s light slowly leave Ylisse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina suddenly felt strange. Something tugged at her arm or more specifically her bracelet. If there was anyone else around she would have suspected a theif was trying to steal it from her. She lifted it up. It was glowing, though on a closer look she could see that only the crescent moon glowed. Owain and Cytnhia noticed the glow to, leaning over to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow how did you get it to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing! This must be some hidden painting technique!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the glow and the strange feeling Lucina was experienced intensified. Cynthia and Owain\u2019s eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Lucina are you getting taller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia measured with her hand where she thought Lucina should have been, and indeed she was several inches taller and growing rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re-\u201d Owain struggled to find the right words. \u201c\u2026 getting bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rare for Owain not to think of a flower way of saying something. This must have been serious. The two backed away as Lucina continued rising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bracelet!\u201d Lucina thought. She tried to take it off, then pull it off it but to no avail. Even when she applied all her strength it remained stuck. Her family and Ylisee seemed to shrink before her, Owain was usually taller than her, then she was a head taller than him and now he didn\u2019t even come up to her stomach and she was still rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was fortunate that her clothes, including the accursed bracelet grew with her, but that didn\u2019t change how awkward she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the city folk had gone home, but the few people around the city centre gasped as the sight of giant Princess, some cowered or yelled in fear while others gawked at the impossible sight before there eyes. Even Cynthia and Owain were stunned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!\u201d Cynthia said. \u201cLucina you\u2019re huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina was bigger than a house now, and had a clear view of the square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, but we need to get out of here immediately!\u201d Lucina said, her voice booming out on account of her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took giant strides away, distressed at the sound of her giant footsteps. Owain and Cynthia followed after her, though struggled to keep up with her.</span></div></div>",

It was a miracle Cynthia and Owain were quick on their feet, otherwise they probably would've been held back and interrogated regarding the event at the center. Regardless, they escaped far, and eventually, the three stopped at a plains to catch their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Lucy,\" Cynthia wheezed, \"You are...really fast.\" She collapsed on the ground to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I'm fast,\" Lucina retorded as she too was heavily breathing, \"It's my size that made me cover more distance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter now?\" Owain hastily said to change the subject, \"Is there anyone behind us?\" The three looked around for any signs of scouts, or worse, soldiers looking for the giant princess. A couple minutes later, they grouped back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't find anyone...\" Cynthia sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Lucina responded, \"I would hate to cause even more trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that the coast is clear,\" Owain said, \"What's with that glowing symbol on your bracelet?\" Lucina kneeled down so that the other two can get a clear view of it. On its silver coating, there was a glowing shape representing the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a prisitine, royal glow,\" Owain briefly monologued, \"I have no doubt whoever made this was an excellent craftsman. Why, it's aura reminds me of...\" As Owain dragged his sentence, Cynthia looked up at the sky. The stars were shining, but not as much since the moon was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The moon...\" Cynthia finished, putting some of the pieces together, \"Ah! The moon!\" Cynthia looked up at her literal big sister, \"Lucy! Maybe the Lunar Bracelet gets its power from the moon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Lucina asked. She looked up at the sky to see a crescent moon. The moon seemed to share the exact same glow and shape as the moon on the bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A waxing moon.\" Owain added, \"They said a full moon appears every eight days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, that means...!\" Cynthia gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">\"No!\"</font> Lucina angrily screamed, scaring the duo, \"I do not want to know what happens at each phase of the moon. We're returning this bracelet-\" Lucina suddenly paused to see something in the corner of her eye. She stood back up to reveal her full stature. At Cynthia and Owain's point of view, it was very intimidating, especially since this is the princess of Ylisse when she is upset. They looked in the direction Lucina was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pegasus knight. A scout to more precise. She was unnerved to see the tall princess glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Princess Lucina!\" She yelled before darting back towards town. Lucina, out of natural instinct, tried to stop the flier from escaping. She pulled out her Falchion and was ready to pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LUCINA, STOP!\" The duo yelled to calm her down, Cynthia speaking up soon after, \"Let her go. Mom and Dad are probably looking for us ever since a few hours ago...\" Lucina looked at her bracelet and could make her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...\" Lucina dejectedly said as she sheathed her blade, \"I'm sorry for acting rash...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With new powers comes a new challenge, Lucina,\" Owain prosed, \"Eventually you will learn to cope with it and accept it as your own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Owain, though I think it will take more than that get acustomed to my new height...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, now that we've been spotted,\" Cynthia questioned, \"What are we going to do for the time being?\" The three thought about it for a moment. What could they do for the night until reinforcements arrive?</span></div></div>",

What if they thought her a monster, or some marauding giant from legend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia and Owain were clearly looking to her for guidance. Just like in the dark future they had come from\u2026 She pushed those thoughts away. But they did remind her of one, she the eldest princess of Ylissee and the leader of the group so she couldn\u2019t afford to wallow in her thoughts.

I should be strong enough to lift you both and it\u2019s the only way you could match my pace without a mount.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey that sounds fun-\u201d She saw Lucina's withering stare.  \u201cI mean like a good idea.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scooped them both up, surprised at how light they felt, it was like lifting toddlers only it somehow felt easier than that, and placed them under an arm. She hoped she had put them in tightly enough that she would keep hold of them but not so much that they would be uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you two alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWow I can see half of Ylissee from here!\u201d \u201cI can see the castle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina strode away from the town, trying to the stick to the widest parts possible while exiting town as fast as possible. She decided it would be best to head for the wilds outside of the town instead of heading back to the castle. She feared what would happen if she approached the castle like this and in the dark of night they mistook her for an enemy, but in the morning light even if she was still stuck as a giant it was likely someone at the castle would recognise her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was dark she managed to make her way through Ylisse without causing any destruction, though she did accidentally kick over a wagon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later Lucina looked behind her and saw she was a good distance from Ylisse. She paused to catch her breath and checked on her passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you both well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia actually seemed excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain looked behind them, noticing how much ground she had covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou broke record time and lifted us like dolls! You\u2019re already starting to master your new powers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think of that way but I suppose you have a point, if I could control my size I could even put it to good use, though at this moment I see it only as a burden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia suddenly became animated, her body shaking with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you were this big when we were at you\u2019d be able to just kick away the risen or stomp them flat!\u201d She did the motions with her leg. \u201cOr any enemy soldier who tried to mess with us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina smiled a little at thought. \u201cTrue...that would be useful\u2026\u201d Then she frowned again \u201cThough being this big would make me a target on the battlefield.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything else, Owain was still his usual hammy self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never know when a threat will rise up from the shadows. Maybe one day Ylissee will need a giant protector like you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina pondered this for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm if this artefact could be controlled it might even be an asset, but right now I just want to be normal sized.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain deflated, but only a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you might as well make the best of what you\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina tried to relax, though she was still a little stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to wait here to till the morning. Hopefully someone at the castle will be able to help me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The moonlight struck her and made her stand out. She wish she could say something, but she was too enamored to say something.<br>\r\nAt least, until Lucina let loose a yawn. To Lucina, all of that running made her tired. To Owain and Cynthia, it was a huge scare for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Lucy!\" Cynthia whined, \"That was loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Cynthia,\" Lucina apologized, \"It's just that after all of this running, I'm just a bit...\" Her head bobbled up and down as she tried to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a hero needs to rest eventually,\" Owain commented, \"Let's settle here until the sun begins to radiate its light upon us once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Lucina nodded. She took off her straps and laid Falchion aside, still keeping it close in case of an ambush. She folded up her cape and made it into a pillow of sorts and laid down on it. She would rather not do this, but with nothing to cushion her head, she has to make use of something. She looked up at the sky and eventually lulled to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst, sis,\" a voice whispered into her ear, \"I want to talk.\" Lucins opened her eyes and slowly turned her head towards Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmh, what's wrong?\" She muttered, still drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owain is talking in his sleep...again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not move somewhere else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the only comfortable spot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina thought for a moment. She looked at her tiny sister, and not long after, she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know another comfortable spot.\" Lucina smiled before plucking Cynthia off the ground. She dragged her and carefully placed her on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Lucy, you sure have developed over the last few years!\" Cynthia complimented as the warmth of Lucina's chest enveloped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Enough... You're making me embarrassed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, oh well. Good night, sis!\" Cynthia closed her eyes and quickly fell asleep. Soon, Lucina followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun began to rise in the horizon. As it did, the moon began to lose its glimmer, and so did the glow on the bracelet Lucina had equipped. With the loss of shine came a loss of power, and soon, Lucina began to shrink back to normal height. Unlucky for Cynthia, she fell off and hit the floor during the process. Abruptly awakened, she turned around to see Lucina shrink back to her normal size. I wouldn't take long for the princess to stir awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Lucy!\" Cynthia happily greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Cynthia.\" Lucina reflected as she sat up. She looked at her bracelet to see that the glow has faded. In fact, she just noticed that she's back to her normal size. She got up quickly to compare herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back to normal...\" she muttered as she conpsred her height to Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CYNTHIA. LUCINA.\" A distant voiced called to them. The two turned their heads towards the source of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia, their mother. She was on her pegasus, and was arriving at high speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother...\" the two uttered as they watched her land and dismount her pegasus.</span></div></div>",

Now that she had, a pang of guilty hit her stomach. She wanted to tell Sumia everything but how was she going to explain it? It seemed too unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia and Owain clearly didn\u2019t know what to say either, shuffling their feet and trying not to look Sumia in the eyes. It was rare to see them both fall silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father and I were worried about you! We sent the whole and a squadron of pegasus riders to look for you! We thought you might have been kidnapped or worse!\u201d Sumia  paused to catch her breath, calming down as she did so. \u201cI know the three of you can take care of yourselves but there are dangers out there even for you. I even heard people speak of a giant wondering into town! I wasn\u2019t even sure such things existed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it, Lucina knew that was her chance to explain herself. She took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother\u2026 you might not believe this but that giant was me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was because of the bracelet.\u201d Lucina raised her. The bracelet was not glowing and showed no signs of being magical, even as Sumia inspected it again. \u201cAfter the sun set the bracelet glowed and I found myself growing until I was larger than a house. I panicked, both at my sudden size and the people mistaking for a monster, so I took Cynthia and Owain in my arms and fled as fast as I could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is actually really fast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI intended to wait till the morning and then return to the castle. But with everything going on I did not think about how worried you or father might be.\u201d Lucina hanged her head. \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia\u2019s eyes were wide with surprise, but she listened to Lucina\u2019s tale without interruption. She looked Cynthia and Owain\u2019s faces to see how they reacted to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Lucina I didn\u2019t know that bracelet was cursed! Can you get it off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina gritted her teeth and tried to pull it off, but it would not budge.  \u201cIt seems stuck to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia gripped Lucina in a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Lucina I\u2019m sorry I got you a cursed bracelet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had no way of knowing. Hopefully someone at the castle will be able to remove it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill I am sorry to put you through that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, you couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s head back. Lucina you can ride with me, Owain and Cynthia I\u2019ll get two riders to bring you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia leaned forward, clearly surprised at how calm her mother was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow mom I\u2019m surprised how well you\u2019re taking this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would have though such a story was far fetched, but I know you are not one to make up tall tales. After everything We\u2019ve gone through I can believe Lucina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina suddenly felt bad about doubting her cousin\u2019s fanciful tales. Is it possible he really did travel to another and take part in a war she never knew about? She decided not to dwell on it, right now she this bracelet to worry about.

Both she and Sumia made their way back to Ylisstol at a quick, but steady pace. Lucina looked at the ground to see how small everthing was. The trees, the road, the plains, and the greens and fields plowed, everything looked so small, the only difference being that her two feet weren't touching the ground. She estimated that they were flying around 300ft high, but it was a rough guess she had to go off of. Still, she had something in her chest, something she wanted to know ever since the fiasco last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother...\" Lucina asked her. Sumia peered around her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think...if I were to control the power this bracelet has-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People wouldn't call you a monster?\" Sumia finished, \"Lucina, you are special. I'm sure whoever saw you were in a state of panic as well and couldn't process that it was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but...\" Lucina shivered a bit, \"Cynthia, Owain, and I theorized about the bracelet. About how when the moon waxes closer towards a full moon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina, please...\" Sumia paused her, \"I am just as confused as you are, but really, keep that attitude of your up any further, and you might faint on the spot!\" They both giggled a bit, even if the setting is not appropriate. \"Still, save the questions when we get back home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, they arrive at the training grounds in the castle. Sunia ordered a couple of pegasus knights to ferry Lucina's friends back towards the castle, and from there, the two made their walk around the castle. How it felt good to be home, even though the slew of events lasted only a couple of hours. Eventually, the two came across someone Sumia knew not too long ago. He was sitting on the floor, tasting the various sweets and pastries he had properly laid out on a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Gaius.\" Sumia meekly called out. Lucina's eyes flared up upon hearing his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Sumia.\" Gaius responded, his tone more mellow than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, about the bracelet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue filled me in. He had a suspicious feeling I was involved since you told him about Lucina's gift yesterday. Combine that with a scout's report last night, and well, you can piece it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to help me remove this, right?\" Lucina demanded as she walked closer to the sweet tooth thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Butterfly, I only opened the box,\" Gaius defended himself, \"The box didn't have a label that read 'DANGER: UNCONTROLLABLE ARTIFACT'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Gaius, you shouldn't worry about it,\" Sumia curiously responded with a faint smirk on her face, \"But at the moment, I'll have to focus on Lucina with her dilemma, so I'm afraid your sweet will-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Stumbles, fine, I'll help,\" Gaius dejected, \"Just tell me what I need to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Gaius,\" she smiled, \"I promise I will make it up to you once this is all over. Now then, can you tell me where Chrom is right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's in the library with Specs. Said something about wanting to learn more about the bracelet, but you know how well he is with books.\" Lucina and Sumia looked at each other and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyway, I'll see you later, and thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care, Sumia.\" Gaius waved as both she and Lucina walked away. To his surprise, Lucina stopped shortly after and turned towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tell you something, Gaius,\" Lucina said in a nearly menacing tone, \"If you want to know what it feels like having someone taller than a building chase after you, come see me once the sun has set. You will know how powerful this 'gift' you gave to my mother is.\" With that said, she turned back around and catched up with Sumia. Gais, meanwhile, turned back towards his stache and thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What did I get myself into?</i>\"</span></div></div>",

During the strangest parts of her tale, Miriel fidgeted with her glasses, less taken aback  than others had been but still clearly puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would not expect such an artefact to exist outside of children\u2019s tales, but you are not known to speak falsehoods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my mom said the same thing.\u201d Only less verbose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does that mean even you haven\u2019t read anything like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrecisely.

Perhaps it was the stress of her situation? Maybe it was because this had hit her so suddenly that  she hadn\u2019t had the chance to approach this in a cool headed fashion..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that\u2026 thank you.\u201d She drew the Falchion, glad she kept it at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait Lucina what if you miss?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spread her legs out, instinctively assuming her battle posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease trust me mother, I am a practised swords-woman. And I will strike with care. \u201d She held the bracelet out  and raised the Falchion with her other hand but she did not immediately strike. She studied it for half a minute before brining the sword down. With a balance of speed, force and precision, Lucina brought the blade down, only for it to bounce off with a load clang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible! The Falchion didn\u2019t even dent it!\u201d Lucina checked the blade and the bracelet, relieved to see at least her sword was unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be woven with powerful magic indeed. Could I see the bracelet again?.\u201d  Lucina sheathed her sword and walked over to  Miriel \u201cI will check under myths and legends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to help let me know.\u201d Lucina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia hung her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel so powerless\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to hope there\u2019s something in here that can help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius sighed. He didn\u2019t look forward to helping out with what might be hours or days of research.  but dared not argue.  Lucina\u2019s earlier words lingered in his mind, Lucina was one of the Shepard\u2019s strongest fighters and even at her normal size was fearsome when angered he didn\u2019t even want to think about what a giant angry Lucina would be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina still bemoaned her plight. BUt she wondered... if she couldn't get this bracelet off her could she find a way to control it? She concentrated but nothing happened. Perhaps it's power only activated at night or perhaps she didn't know how to tape into it yet? She hoped they would find something of use before nightfall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ever since Sumia left, Cynthia and Owain sparred for a while. Unfortunately for them, it came at the cost of having little to distract themselves with. Thank goodness there was a river nearby, so they wouldn't faint upon hunger or thirst. The two were used to such occasions in the past, but this is really taking a toll on her body ever since she agreed to help her cousin with his next play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm,\" Owain spitted out, \"Around four...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking them...so long...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they found a breakthrough in Lucina's Sacred Lunar Bracelet?\" Owain was doing his best to keep the mood up, but between the exhausting heat and vigorous training, his facade was beginning to slip. He looked up at the trees, imagining Lucina towering above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Owain...\" Cynthia said as she took a swig from her canteen, \"About Lucina as she was huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah?\" Owain responded. He doesn't know why, but he's got a pit in his stomach as if he knew what she was going to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you, umm...feel overwhelmed?\" She looked down at the ground, only to gaze her eyes at the trees Owain was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overwhelmed?

I'm sure the magnificent scholars back at home will have an answer soon enough.\" Owain patted his hand on Cynthia's back to ease her fears. After all, Lucina has endured many hardships ever since she took up her father's sword. She has leaded everyone to combat the menace that plagued their future, went back in time to avert the doom and change the stars of destiny. Without her, Owain couldn't imagine what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. Sis is strong! No way will she let an evil artifact hurt the people she loves! SHE WILL LEARN TO CONTROL-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, Cynthia, keep your voice down.\" A voice told her. She turned around to see the source, only to see a pegasus knight she knew very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi, Cordelia!\" She waved at her as the duo approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cordelia,\" Owain greeted, \"So how is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, if that's what you're asking...\" A bitter voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Severa...\" Cynthia frowned as the red-haired churl got off the pegasus she was riding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You're still upset over that one time I curb-stomped your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Cynthia yelled, \"You knew I'm not the best at using an axe, anti-hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANYWAY,\" Cordelia raised her voice in a commanding tone, \"I'm sorry for being late. Chrom filled me in on what happened-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which I had to remind her constantly by the way.\" Severa interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he told me to get some supplies for Lucina! Tonight is a half-moon, so I made sure to stock up on extra!\" Cordelia quickly re-railed. Owain and Cynthia rolled their eyes at what Severa was implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as we make it there before sundown, I think we can control the situation and help Lucina control her awesome power!\" Owain affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can make it there by dusk, sure!\" Cordelia reaffirmed, \"I just need to pass by a village to pick up a research report about the bracelet Lucina is wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great, let's go now!\" Cynthia said. The others nodded and hopped on, with Owain riding with Severa, and Cynthia with Cordelia. Not long after, they departed towards the village Cordelia mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Owain,\" Severa yelled as she turned her head, \"Once this is all over, you're giving me that bracelet. I'm not letting Lucina have all the fun being gigantic!\" Owain flinched at the idea. Severa is always in a bad mood, but what if that attitude carried over as a giantess? Taming her at normal size was difficult enough, but for a 30ft tall Severa? He dreaded for that day to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it!\" Owain responded. Severa flipped her hair and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll remember that~!\"</span></div></div>",

The sun had set and the moon started to rise. As its light hit Lucina she felt a familiar sensation. She knew what was coming. But this time the sensation felt stronger than before. Everyone stared as she rose higher and higher and Lucina realised she was fast exceeding her previous size. Everything seemed much smaller than last time and those around her back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah Lucina you\u2019re extra big this time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be because of the phase of the moon...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the relative size of everything, Lucina estimated she was roughly twice the the size she was last night. Would this get worse with each night? If she was this big now then just how big would she be.  Would she dwarf all of Ylisse? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did this happen to her? That bracelet, all of this started with that accursed bracelet.. that Gaius gave Sumia! This was all his fault!

Snap out of it!\u201d Owain called her her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina paid him no heed. Gaius wasn\u2019t thinking of where he was only going, only in running away from her as fast he could, yet he soon found himself cornered. He gripped his blade. Even if Lucina were her normal size he wouldn\u2019t fancy his chances against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-Lucina I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mean to do this please don\u2019t kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina raised her foot again.

The Lucina I know, the Lucina who is my daughter would never do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina flinched, suddenly feeling a stabbing pain in her head. She clutched it.  \u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026. What am I doing? I-I\u2019m sorry Gaius\u2026 I\u2019m a danger to others, I have to get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina stepped away from Gaius and before anyone could stop she ran, bounding over the castle walls, which were only waist high to her</span></div></div>",

It took all the self control not to tamper with the lock of snow white hair.

Oh how she hated him, all he did was steal her precious Robin's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for nightfall before practically pouncing on an iridescent tome. Years of magic and mental preparation were required to even perform the most basic spells in the tome, but she knew it would be well worth it.

Is that really you?\" Morgan asked, \"You're soooo teeny.\"<br>\r\nRobin couldn't help but chuckle at his daughter's innocent diction. \"Yeah it's me.\"<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\" Robin answered vaguely, \"just make sure to take me to your mother in the morning.\"<br>\r\n\"Okie-Dokie,\" Morgan chirped. \"But you're sleeping close to me. Need to make sure you're safe and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan? Who exactly are you talking to at this hour?\" The voice was tired and groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shouted in surprise, nearly dropping her shrunken father. Morgan kept calm, recognizing the voice as her sister...</span></div></div>",

It's kind of late, and I don't really want to keep you up too late.\" Robin's excuse was weak, but he hoped his general authority as a parent would be enough. Then again, he wasn't too far from literally being wrapped around his oldest daughter's finger.<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no problem, daddy,\" Severa shot down, \"Morgan usually keeps me up late when she studies tactics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, um... well, sure. I guess we could go into town tomorrow. Only if your mother is okay with it.\" Robin figured that his wife would bail him out.<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Can I come?\" Morgan beamed.<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not.\" Robin answered, keeping his cool while rejoicing on inside. \"We'll just have to wait until the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls groaned in discontent, before Morgan immediately  flopped back onto her bed, startling her father in her hand. Gently, she dropped him right by her face. She smiled, finding her shrunken father strangely adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If only I could find a way to shrink mom and Severa.</i> Morgan thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from the look on Severa's face, Morgan figured that her sister was thinking the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't really take the three too long to sleep once Severa blew the candle out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was the first to wake up, feeling a soft pressure on his back, and once his eyes opened, he realized he was pinned under his red head daughter's cheek.  He forced himself out, rubbing out a small amount of drool out of his hair. There was a warm wave of humid heat at his back. He scrunched his face at his daughter's morning breath, but he figured it was better than whatever place he would have woken up in with Tharja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed against Morgan's cheek, shouting her name, but the girl was still sleeping. He pressed harder, eventually causing her to stir. A light shadow then loomed over the tiny Robin, and he slowly shifted to face the giant who held her arms close together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might as well quit,\" Severa chided playfully, \"you'll never wake her up.\" The giant lifted her father into her own hands before using her free hand to shake her younger sister awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmh? Oh, Severa I just had the weirdest dream.\" Morgan groaned as she sat up.<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a dream, dummy.\" Severa scolded before brandishing her shrunken father. Robin at first wanted to speak up about Severa blatantly insulting her sister, and it took a few ineffective talks until Robin finally was able to make peace with the idea that his oldest daughter's insults were just commonplace and really held little malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Father, good morning! Shall we go see mother then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin wasn't sure how he should've reacted to how easily Morgan accepted his predicament. And within minutes, the tactician found himself outside with a familiar silhouette in the distance. He felt shaky, not really knowing how his wife would react to his new stature. He breathed deeply also hoping that Cordelia would catch on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother!\" Morgan chirped, taking the lead and rushing towards the pegasus knight. Rushing into a hug, Morgan signaled her older sister over with a light shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom,\" Severa greeted, hiding her father behind her back.\"We have something for you. Close your eyes and hold out your hands.\"<br>\r\n\"Well okay, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecklessly, Robin was dropped on his wife's gloved hand. He kept still, completely in awe at his love's massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now open them!\" Severa ordered, playing close attention to her mother's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, since when did you and Morgan have time to make a figure of your father?\" She lifted the \"doll\" by his left leg, dangling him upside down as she inspected him closer. \"My... you even got his wittle coat down perfectly.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! It's hexed!\" the pegasus knight yelped before dropping her husband much to the dismay of her daughters. She quickly lifted her boot into the air before being stopped by Severa, who quickly jumped in front of her mother. Morgan dove to her father's side, cupping him in her hands as she stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not hexed!\" Severa shouted. 'Well, he is, but he's not a doll! Just doll sized...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia simply stared at her shrunken husband, holding her hand to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Robin, honey, is that really you?

Do you two really promise to watch him?\"<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Both girls cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin grimaced, feeling completely emasculated as his wife and daughters talked about him as if they were negotiating getting a new pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia bit her lip before saying...</span></div></div>",

However, doing so put him out the shadow he had been standing in and into the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got to his feet, he felt himself being lifted up by the back of his shirt.

The siblings were silent, somewhat thankful that there mother had stepped in instead of someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Severa,\" Morgan whispered, checking to see if her mother was distracted. Luckily her parents were talking to each other, not paying much attention to her. \"I think I know how to get Mom to forgive us.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, don't keep it to yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go talk to Tharja ourselves.

Just don't say anything stupid and let me do the talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin found himself sitting on a stack of tomes, looking up at his wife who desperately scanned each book for a cure. He couldn't help but admire her, watching intently as Cordelia tossed another spell tome over her shoulder in frustration. The shrunken tactician counted his blessings, finding himself extremely lucky that his wife still cared for him at his most vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis daughters on the other hand, seemed to take his affliction in stride. Sure, he loved them, but the full weight of the situation had't really dawned on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we were hard on them?\" Robin asked, kicking against the spine of a tome.<br>\r\n\"Well they did almost have you sold to some stranger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but... it truly was an accident.\"<br>\r\n\"You have to be stern with them, Robin.\" Cordelia pressed. \"You're letting them walk all over you, and that was before you shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't really help it.\"<br>\r\n\"I know. I can you get all weak when they play the Daddy's little girl card.\" Cordelia teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus knight couldn't help but find her tiny husband adorable. Before he shrunk, he had a certain charm to him that she couldn't place, and his new size seemed to amplify it.After a few minutes, she found herself ignoring the passages before her as her focus shifted to the shrunken tactician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plucked her husband between her fingertips. She giggled lightly as the tiny tactician struggled against her grip. He seemed to calm down after she flashed him a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I just realized?\" Cordelia asked, her voice low and husky.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Robin asked, still naive to her tone.<br>\r\n\"From you running the Shepherds and my night patrols, it's been a while since we've had time alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Robin piped, finally getting her drift. He was brought to her lips and into a quick, smothering kiss as Cordelia made her way to their shared cot.<br>\r\n\"I'm a little tense from staying up all night. You mind giving me a little massage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin felt his knees nearly buckle from her voice, eager to treat his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just before Cordelia lowered herself onto the bed, there was a startled call in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOOOM!\" The voice cried, getting closer by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take too long for the two to realize that it was the cry of one of their daughters. Cordelia shot up, facing towards the door to tend to her child.</span></div></div>",

I'm going to check on something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you want me to stay here alone with her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those ropes are securely tightened. She can't do magic without her hands. I'm just going to check somewhere,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera still looked nervous. \"I'll buy you a dress.\" That cheered her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. But if she gets loose, I will hurt her bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded and walked over to her husband and younger daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back soon you two, ok? Hang in there.\" They nodded still focused on the gargantuan witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia exited the tent and made her way over to Tharja's tent to search through her personal library.</span></div></div>",

She kicked at a stack of tomes in frustration, grunting just to release her building stress. Her search produced no results, making her nervous as the minutes went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother?\" A meek voice called, followed by a cautious head poking into the tent. \"I think I've finally recovered from the last hex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia froze in place, staring back at the enemy's daughter who was also solidly stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What hex?\"  Cordelia interrogated, stepping closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing, Miss Cordelia! Forget I said anything. My mother doesn't test curses on me--what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, sweetie.\" Cordelia comforted, \"I know the sort of person your mother can be. What was the hex? Did it have anything to do with shrinking?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire, a little worried from the pegasus knight's tone, swallowed the spit in her mouth nervously. She shook her head, \"no, but she said she was going to test that one on me when I recovered from her sickness hex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\"  Cordelia sighed with a grisly tone, \"she won't have to test it on you. It works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head stuck her hand out, revealing her shrunken husband sitting on her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-robin? Is that you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tactician nodded grimly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can do?\" Was all the archer asked. \"Maybe I can convince my mother to try to change you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me we've tried.\" Cordelia shot back.  Tharja won't be swayed. She has no incentive to change Robin back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin paused, thinking his options through. He racked his brain, finding only one reasonable option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, if we perform the shrinking hex on her. Then she'll have a real motivation to find a cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to shrink my mom?\" Noire guessed, feeling her chest tense up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Noire. You can watch over her yourself, but please help.\" Cordelia begged, \"she already got my husband and my baby Morgan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\" Noire answered stiffly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I don't know how I could ever repay you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group left the tent, heading back towards where Tharja was captured. Fortunately, the sorceress was still bound in place, albeit still struggling. Severa stood off to the side, keeping a steel lance pointed at the dark mage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother! You're back... With Noire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,  Severa. Noire's here to help.\" Cordelia answered calmly, noticing the tension in her daughter's tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Dastards!\" Tharja screamed, \"turning my own daughter against me. That's a new low.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking.\" Severa spat, restraining the urge to kick the bound woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire kneeled by her mother's side, reaching for the spell book off to the side and finding the page with the shrinking hex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noire! My sweet daughter. Release me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mother. I'm standing up for myself. It was fine when you tested your hexes on me, but you can't do it to my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was an archer on the battlefield, Noire was familiar with dark magic thanks to her mother. She retired the words on the page, feeling a familiar energy run through her. The sorceress struggled harder, feeling the hex take place as her body began to reduce in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was all over, Noire towered over her inch tall mother. She held Tharja in her hands, feeling a sense of catharsis and responsibility as her mother felt completely fragile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry for what my mother did,\" Noire apologized, turning towards the family. \"I promise that we'll find a cure. Even if it takes weeks, months, even years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archer walked off, closing her palms around her mother, effectively silencing her obscenities. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cordelia looked down at the two figures in her palm. While she was concerned for her husband and daughter's  well being, she couldn't help but feel that there was an odd charm to her tiny family. Maybe it was the way that Morgan excitedly bobbed in her hand. Still, the mother was glad that her eldest daughter was spared, stowing away the idea of a tiny, grumpy Severa with a light giggle. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe family found themselves inside Cordelia and Robin's tent, processing the events of the day. Somehow and thankfully, they were all in one piece, which was more than Cordelia expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalling her hands into a tight fist, Severa paced around the room, muttering expletives under her breath. Her mother pretended not to hear, letting her daughter stew in her anger. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"This sucks!\" Severa griped, crossing her arms in discontent. \"What are we supposed to do, just sit here and wait for a cure!?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"There's not much we could do.\" Robin answered blandly. \"These kinds of things require patience to get through.\"  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I know but... UGH! I'm going to punch a tree or something.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ooh! Can I come?\" Morgan chirped, jumping from her mother's palm. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't think it's saf--,\" the mercenary excused, \"sure, whatever.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nScooping her shrunken little sister in her hands, Severa made her way out the tent and the camp. In reality, she had no intention to really hurt the surrounding vegetation. She felt like she needed to clear her head and felt it was best to do it alone... up until her sister had asked to come along.  Ever since Morgan was struck with Tharja's hex, Severa harbored the idea that it should have been her instead. Although her self-shaming thoughts were often set aside by her younger sibling's lively attitude despite being an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, where are we going, Severa?\" Morgan asked once she noticed that Severa had no intention of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it a minute, will you?\" Severa snapped, closing her fist around her sister. Feeling a slight pang of regret, she loosened her grip but still kept her aloof expression while she brightened her strides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercenary, after minutes of walking, stopped on the shoreline of a small lake. She sat just short of the water, opening her hand to grant her sister a view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! This would be a really cool place to set up camp.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is exactly why I didn't tell Daddy about it when he sent us scouting for a place to settle. I needed a place to think, and the still water calms me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in silence, Severa placed her sister on the ground next to her. She stretched her legs out, making sure not to knock over Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera stood to her full height, towering over her tiny sister as she began to pull off her armor, nonchalantly dropping her clothes dangerously close to her sister. Smirking, she watched her shrunken sister dodge the incoming breastplate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, sis!?\" Morgan cried right before jumping out of the way of a falling boot. \"I'm still down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she answered cheekily, holding her hands against her hips. \"I'm going for a dip, care to join?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan kicked at the dirt beneath her,\" um, I don't think this is a good--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up. You wanted to come along, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Morgan could even finish, she was scooped up in her sister's hand and lifted in front of Severa's face. she felt a slight tugging on her back just as her coat was ripped from her body and dropped onto Severa's clothes pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby, Morgan. A little water never hurt anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the icy water, Severa ignored her sister's protests, moving deeper until she was wading in the water on her back, her shrunken sister resting on her stomach.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Come on, sis! This isn't funny! You know I can't swim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush, dummy. I taught you myself, rememb--\" Severa paused in thought, looking into the unamused look in Morgan's eyes. \"Well I suppose I could teach you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger sister brought her hand closer to Morgan, curling her index finger behind her thumb.  And in a split second, Morgan was sent flying throughout the air, landing with an audible splash. The red haired sister struggled for help, spitting out water and kicking to gain leverage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa! Stop! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was sigh off in the distance before a massive hand plucked the drowning girl from the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cry, Morgan. Your big sissy is here.\" Severa patronized. \"Gawds, this lake is barely chest high, and you're already crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaling reluctantly, Severa walked out of the lake before chuckling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first time I taught you how to swim. It sorta happened a lot like that, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Come on tell me more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh. It's not that interesting. You were six and I was eight, I think. Mom and Dad were out visiting the exalt, so I took you out to the lake by the town and just threw you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were always so gentle,\" Morgan quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera laughed again before saying, \"I had to buy you some candy just so you wouldn't tell Mom.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well it wouldn't hurt to take me out for some cake or something, Or else I'm telling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stuck her tongue out at her sister, eliciting a giggle from Severa.</span></div></div>",

Severa, while having a sweet tooth herself, let her sister dig in first. Her younger sister always held a soft spot in her heart, her aloof, surly demeanor breaking whenever Morgan was around. So it wasn't a surprise that Severa could hardly contain her smile once her inch tall sibling dove into a mound of spongy chocolate. The older sister casually scooped up a dollop of icing and dropped it in her sister's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up, sis.\" Severa chimed, holding back an enthused giggle. Her sister stepped away from the cake, holding a chunk of sweets the size of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you gonna fatten me up, just so you can eat me?\" Morgan joked before shoveling more cake into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I might.\" Severa teased, playing along with her sister. \"You do look adorable enough to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, the two shared the moment, indirectly glad that the hex made them closer. For the brief time, Severa let go of her own insecurities, focused completely on spending time with her tiny sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the older sibling reached for a nearby fork and begun cutting into the cake, tearing off a slice for herself. He rmovements were gentle, keeping the points away from Morgan with ease. A thought floated into her head, one that she just had to try out just for laughs, even if what she was about to do was at the expense of her helpless sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera brought the fork closer to Morgan, cutting a larger chunk from the mound. She pretended not to pay attention, ignoring the slight, startled yelp as an avalanche of cake buried her sister. Carfully, she lifted the fork, carrying the cake and her sister along with it, bringing it closer to her mouth. And down below, her sibling struggled under its weight, using all her strength to push off the sponge-like wall. Upon closer inspection, Morgan realized her coat was caught along one of the fork's prongs. She pulled against it before quitting the notion, opting to call for help from her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa! Help, I'm stuck!\" Morgan pleaded, \"come on, I know you can hear me. This isn't funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring into her sister's open mouth, Morgan screamed for help, feeling Severa's warm breath wash over her. Her heart raced, completely startled by Severa's display of power. She closed her eyes, shuddering as she drew near her older sister's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan kicked herself for not realizing the joke as Severa lightly kissed her younger sister on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've seen the look on your face.\" Severa teased, fighting to hold back her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really think I was gonna eat you? You're my baby sister, you dummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan huffed, looking up at her beaming sister. There was something comforting about being referred to that way by her giant sibling. Even if she just played that joke on her, Severa still cared for her sister's well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you got me pretty good.\" Morgan conceded with a light chuckle.</span></div></div>",

After all she couldn't enjoy her sweet Robin the way she wanted if they were on even footing. Plus she still had a Pegasus knight and mercenary to repay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It didn't work a-again.\" Noire commented from her seat at her mother's desk. She watched the diminished drk mage try and fail yet again to grow the plant. Since she'd shrunken her down to size, finding a cure was proving to be more difficult. Tharja would have to yell up to her to get something or read book passages aloud as she couldn't at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly Noire couldn't help but feel a slight sense of satisfaction at finally having the roles reversed for a change. She was now the stronger of the pair as her mother was now fragile. But she could still never shake off the ominous aura the woman projected. Even tiny, Tharja made her uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. Nothing is working.\" Tharja whispered. As much as she hated to admit it she needed help. She needed another practitioner of the dark arts. Someone who just as much about hex as she did. It killed her inside knowing she would have to ask that man for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should try something else?\" Noire suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe?\" Tharja agreed as she eyed her spellbook. If only she could lift it, she'd make her daughter pay. But if she tried anything now without protection, she'd risk invoking the girl's much more agressive side. Despite the front she put up, Tharja had no desire to be squished. Noire's pinky alone could flatten her. A fact that annoyed her to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll dump this cauldron and we can start again.\" Noire then proceeded ofver to the boiling black pot of purple goop. Nothing they mixed in it worked so it only made sense to dump it and start from scratch. While Noire was distracted by this task, Tharja pulled a small coin purse from under her outfit and dropped it on the ground. Reciting her hex from memory she chanted it at the coin purse and looked on with anticipation. Sure enough it shrank away until it was 1inch tall (To her at least).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" Tharja smiled. She then felt slightly dizzy after as she used her hex without her book. With the knowlege she can still shrink things the first idea that comes to mind is to shrink her spellbook and then punish Noire for her humiliation. But then again using the spell without her book had tired her out and there were no guarantees that at her size her spell would be enough to shrink Noire down, even with the book. At worst she'd be digging her own grave deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it would be safer to just bide her time like she'd been doing? Maybe even call in a favor when she was all alone? While she pondered her options she could hear the telltale sound of her cauldron's contents being poured out on the ground outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja bit her lip. What did she choose?</span></div></div>",

There was also the matter of her tattoos, Robin could feel they were imbued with very powerful dark magic, but he felt oddly content by them, if her wasn't fearing for his life he thought he'd be just fine with laying his head on one of the lines on her tit and sleeping the rest of the journey<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours of silence (at which point Robin had given up and did lie down across her breast with his head on one of her markings) there were finally voices; speaking in a language Robin instinctively  the language of the Grimleal, unfortunately his memory loss coupled with not hearing it spoken since he'd awoken meant he was very rusty, only recognising a phrase said by a young voice which he knew to mean ''Good fortune to Grima's bride'' the greeting used when meeting the High priestess. A few minutes later the armour shuddered and reformed again and her was picked up and dropped onto a table. His captor was still as silent as she had been since she bought him, sitting in a chair beside the desk and staring with what he believed (hopefully incorrectly) was a look of hunger.<br>\r\n''Well here we are, alone at last'' Robin's eyes widened as he finally realised who his 'new owner' was (still having problems recognising people after such a severe change of scale) it was Aversa, previously Gangrel's lieutenant, presently (as far as he knew) Validar's lieutenant and as it turns out the current High priestess of the Grimleal.<br>\r\n'Why did you buy me?

The tactician rushed across the battlefield, using her tomes to open up her path towards the injured boy lying on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan!\" Robin called as she kneeled by her son's side. She scanned the time travelling teen's body looking for any fatal cuts. \"Lissa! Maribelle! Anyone!  I need a medic!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mother, \" Morgan groaned, \"I'm fine.\" His voice was hazy, raspy and did nothing to help his worried mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They hurt my baby,\" she said in monotone, a slight twitch in her eye. <br>\r\n\"Robin, \" a high pitched voice called, Lissa's,  \"don't get too hasty.

She dropped her tome, causing the pair of cavaliers, Sully and Stahl, to rush out of the book's landing spot as it crashed and left a dent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her boot into the air, raising it high above a pack of risen. And with little effort she stomped the enemies into the ground until there was nothing left but a cloud of smoke where they stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Sheperds watched in horror as the giant Robin layed waste to the rest of the hoard. As much as they hated to admit it, whatever happened to their tactician was for the better as they would have been easily forced to retreat or worse by the sheer number of risen. In a matter of minutes they were all plumes of smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin kept stomping,  her brown boots now a smoky black. Even though there were no more risen left,  she kept mashing her foot into the ground, shaking the earth with each collision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S.  FOR.  MY.

The pillowy feeling was welcome as his face was rather forcefully buried into his wife's upper lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss overstayed its welcome by a few seconds, which Chrom took as an act of innocent teasing from his wife.  He was dropped back onto her palm, a little disoriented and a little annoyed,  but the Ylissean Exalt took solace in the fact that his wife was in better spirits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat there quietly, watching the sunset and enjoying the rare quiet moment. </span></div></div>",

Her spouse was on a night shift, hence why she was sleeping alone. The Tactician was having trouble getting some rest. She was struggling with the usual dream of Grima taking over her body, but her mind being free. Being forced to watch as she slaughters all her friends, while trying to stop Grima from the inside, but to no avail. No matter how many times she has this dream, it gets more horrific every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Robin shot up. After a moment of just sitting there, she stared down at the mark of grima on her hand. Everytime she had this dream, she would feel more and more defeated when she woke up. Like her sense of control over grima was... shrunken. And this time was no exception. Robin felt horrible, but she needed to get some sleep, and it was unlikely she would have the same nightmare two times in the same night. So even though it was difficult, she went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain. Again, she had that same horrible dream about losing control. It had never happened before. Never before had the tactician had the same nightmare twice in one night. She shot up. But this time, something was... different. It took about 1 second to realise that her bed was much, much bigger. either that or she was quite small. Robin started to panic. Was this real? Was she just dreaming? After about 10 minutes of calming herself down, Robin decided to analyze the situation. Luckily, her clothes and long coat had shrunken down to her size, which she rounded around to 2-3 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what should she do now?</span></div></div>",

Morgan was than soon grabbed from Lissa who turned around to see it was Aversa holding Morgan now. \"Well hello there my little nephew the cake has been taken out of the oven and now needs frosted which thankfully has already been made.\" \"But what are we going to use to frost the cake?\" Morgan asked not really bothered with what was happening. \"That's what I was thinking until I realized that we would have to use Falchion which grew along with Lucina. \"Falchion is a sacred weapon, I have already had to deal with Morgan using it to cut apples.\" Lucina argued, Robin pouted, \"Lucina, everyone has to make sacrifices for the greater good.\" \"Your just saying that because you want to stuff your face with cake!\" Lucina shouted at her mother who only sighed in response. \"I didn't want to do this but, if you don't allow Falchion to frost the cake you won't be allowed to play with Morgan.\" \"Fine, but I will frost the cake.\" Lucina submitted walking towards the sight of the towering cake which was placed upon a wooden platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stinking mom and her gluttony,\" Lucina murmured as she finished up applying the white frosting onto the cake which while extremely large and capable of feeding all the shepherds was not larger than any of the giants. \"Oh yes the cake is finished everyone!\" Robin called out all the shepherds soon arriving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was having a very good time and all thinking that the cake was very good even Lucina thinking that it was worth using Falchion to frost and cut the cake. \"Oh yes that feels great Morgan!\" Robin had ended up eating way too much cake and had a stomach ache so she required the assistance of her little masseur to soothe her bloated belly. \"Don't worry Chrom at bedtime it will be your turn to have some fun with me.\" Robin reassured while licking her lips causing Chrom to blush. \"Mom could you not flirt with father like that in public.\" Lucina pleaded also blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now</span></div></div>",

Although, there was something entrancing about the way Lucina paced around the tent, mesmerizing, hypnotic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late by the time he realized his beloved big sister's blue leather was descending upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the only injury he had sustained was a piercing headache as he was safely and conveniently tucked in the small lift between the boot's sole and heel with more than enough room to move around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how small am I?\" Morgan asked himself. If he remembered correctly, the heels of her boots weren't even high, just a slight half inch lift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then his sister's monolithic boot was lifted high into the air and dropped far off into the distance with a heavy, but nowhere near painful thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud creaking in the distance as he turned to see his sister sitting on her cot across from his own. Being siblings, the two shared a tent, unlike the other unwed Shepherds who were paired by gender. He didn't mind it as much since it provided him an opportunity to make up for lost time due to his amnesia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ultimately decided against climbing his sister, completely afraid of the risks involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing in and scaling Lucina was something his reckless father Chrom would have done. No, he needed a bit more finesse, a more tactical approach. Something safe, yet effective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at his tactician coat for some inspiration until his eyes slowly landed on a bright yellow tome sticking out of one of its pockets. A smile crept along his face as an idea came into mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed over to his coat, taking about a minute or two to finally reach his goal. He stopped at the base of the cloth before he slowly began traversing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan?\" Lucina called.  The shrunken boy's ears perked up at the sound of his name. \"I swear he's just as sloppy as father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's stomach dropped once he realized she was referring to the discarded tactician coat by her cot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pig!\" Lucina yelled at no one in particular, hoping to get a rise out of her little brother, but no response came, at least not one she could hear. Down below her brother ignored the obviously joking callout  and opted to scream for his sister's attention, but  he grew a little frustrated as she never caught his shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being discouraged,  Morgan kept climbing his coat, taking much longer to scale it than walk to it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLuckily for him, Lucina seemed to be in no rush as she halfhazardly kicked off her boots, but unfortunately they were tossed in his general direction. The shrunken tactician let out a horrified scream as one of the ankle high boots soared over his head and the other landing directly in front of him, pressing into the coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat hit him first, and then the smell followed as Lucina's left boot forced his eyes to water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan made a mental note not to ever mention this to his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the added terror used productively, Morgan finally reached the exposed tome. He dropped to his knees, letting the familiar electrical charge energize his body. It was a simple lightning tome thankfully, and if done correctly it should just register as a quick static shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry, Luci,\" Morgan said under his breath, knowing that there was absolutely no chance of his sister hearing his apology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe aimed for Lucina's bare feet, a little touch of payback for the earlier incident. And in a flash,  a bolt was sent and Lucina jumped, letting out a surprised shout of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, searching for the source, but she only found a half buried tome inside her younger brother's  cloak. It struck her as odd, as she realized that tomes never discharge like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out she was right as there was an impossiblly small form on the tome itself. She kneeled over, granting the near speck a rather surreal view of her face. And on closer inspection, she quickly identified the source as her brother Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer little brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mor-Morgan? Is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheepishly, the tiny boy simply answered, \"yeah.\"</span></div></div>",

She searched the underside until she came back with a staff in her hands. \"It's going to tingle a little, okay sweetie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've healed me before,\" Morgan reminded, his comment purposefully ignored by Lissa.  The tiny tactician felt the comforting warmth of the staff wrap around his diminutive body. He closed his eyes and let the staff do its work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they opened, he was still staring at the giant faces of his sister and aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Lucina asked. <br>\r\n\"Maybe it's a spell or a hex.\" Morgan suggested, refusing to give up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could stay here with me!\" Lissa beamed cheerily, \"Er, until Robin and my brother come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your choice, Morgan.\"</span></div></div>",

Finally, she swallowed and broke the silence between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not mad about that little game, are you?\" Lucina asked her brother, with the smallest amount of guilt in her voice. \"Nah, not at all,\" Morgan said through a mouthful of meat, \"Just don't make me do it again.\" Lucina laughed lightly. \"Oh, it couldn't possibly have been THAT bad, could it?\" Morgan frowned and pointed up at his sister's face. \"You try running from two colossal giants!

Morgan in hand, she stood up from her seat and lowered the boy to the ground, setting him down between her feet. Morgan craned his neck upward as Lucina stood back up to full height, hands and her hips and meeting his gaze. \"Are you scared, little guy?\" Lucina spoke down to him teasingly. From so far away, her voice seemed to entirely surround Morgan, as if it was a goddess addressing him, and not his sister. Every instinct Morgan had was screaming at him to run in the direct opposite direction, but Lucina's massive presence was so oppressive, Morgan could bring himself to do nothing but stare in awe at her monumental figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina's cold gaze on Morgan wavered, her smile turning from taunting to genuine. A light chuckle escaped her lips, which soon evolved into a full-stop laughing fit. Lucina held her stomach as her knees buckled, forcing her to take a seat.

You're just so cute all tiny and helpless like this.\" She wiped a tear from her eye, \"I just had to tease you a little for it.\" Having calmed down, Lucina looked down once again at her brother, smiling sweetly. Morgan, however, was not laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Lucina. You think this is funny?\" Morgan accused, angered at his sister's disregard for him. \"Yes, actually.\" Lucina answered, still giggling softly at her tiny sibling's outburst.

Lucina tried to get him to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, seeing you like this just reminds me of being a kid again.\" She brought him closer. \"I always liked being your protector... it made me feel needed and powerful\"<br>\r\n\"Well I appreciate your protection but could you scare me a little less?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T WORRY, BIG SIS IS HERE!\" Her voice boomed around, though in a less menacing way than before.<br>\r\nMorgan covered his ears and looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina giggled for a second then looked sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that really scare you?

There was nothing to do but sit and wait. Morgan lay back against the camp and began to day dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost track of his surroundings and suddenly found an enormous shadow over him.

The inside had a raw, musty scent to it as Morgan was tossed between a tome of Thoron and an elixir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he wasn't found by Cynthia... or Severa,and there was also Noire's extreme mood swings and her equally extreme fear of insects. It made the aspiring tactician wonder why every Shepherd was seemingly a nutcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you have to be a little crazy to be willing to challenge an ancient demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were cut out by two soft, slender fingers plucking him from the darkness of the bag.

And on closer inspection, he absolutely sure she was Laurent's mother, which was comforting due to his friend's rather logical nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was placed on stiff tabletop, directly in front of a set of notebooks and quills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems your body mass hasn't reduced along with your stature.\" Miriel stated curtly, \"It raises questions about what else was scaled down. Durability, which will require some stress tests, seems like a simple yet effective place to begin the experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it hurt?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be determined by the tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Morgan wanted to run, he found it impossible, taking seconds to realize it was out not of fear but from strands of string dexterously tied around his arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid him on his back before turning to her notebook and writing inside its blank pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to feel pressure, and it's going to increase gradually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her thumb above the boy, giving him a few moments to prepare himself before she dropped her finger over his entire body, burying him beneath the pad.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe pressure started off bearable, but the pain began to buil as she pressed harder against his body. Luckily, it never really got bad as he came out unharmed the moment Miriel removed her clammy hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. The subject appears unharmed.

Also in all of Morgan's studies, he had never heard of magic that could shrink someone before. It was entirely possible, even likely that Lissa would be unable to help him. Maybe Miriel's scholarly mind was his only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt bad for a second, here he was thinking poorly of Miriel when she was actively working to help him.

You made a mistake or two, but I'm still alive... and, uh, I've never really felt safer?\" Luckily for him, Cynthia didn't pick up on his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Morgan continued, \"all you really need to do is control your strength around me, and I'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia smiled, Morgan's kind words striking a chord with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed in relief.

What are you trying to pull here?\" Severa now confronted Lucina with her disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No tricks, Severa. That's Morgan, I swear.\" Lucina held up one hand, as if taking an oath. \"He can attest to that himself. Go on, Morgan, tell her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed. As much as he wanted to detach himself from the colossal girls, the spotlight as on him now, and if Severa doubted he was the real, living Morgan, his situation would become much more dangerous. Reluctantly, Morgan spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Severa. This is no joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curiosity returned to Severa's eyes. Morgan's testimony had convinced her. \"So, this is... I... Wow...\". Severa was speechless as she continued examining Morgan like a bug under a microscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come by again tomorrow morning,\" Lucina resumed. \"until then, he's all yours.\" Lucina turned to leave. \"Have fun, you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera didn't seem to notice Lucina leave as she toyed with Morgan. A smile slowly crept across her face as she poked and turned the boy in her palm. \"This is incredible, how did you get like this?\" Severa asked the question, but gave Morgan to time to answer as she played with his tiny body. Morgan quickly tired of the giant woman's games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, would you kindly stop this?\" Morgan requested, as her giant finger prodded his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" she answered plainly. Her voice was cold and apathetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera's feet moved as she started walking towards her own tent, Morgan still in hand. The girl's giant footfalls shook Morgan's body, knocking to his feet. The soft flesh of Severa's palm broke his fall, and Morgan looked up to see the face of his giant captress staring down at him, and grinning ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dread mounting in Morgan's gut grew with each step Severa took. Across the whole walk, never once did Severa's toying with Morgan pause. Soon, she arrived at her designated tent, and went inside. By then, Morgan had had enough, once more he tried reason with Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Severa, put me down.\" Morgan pleaded. Severa's play suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, little guy.\" Severa closed her fist around Morgan, constricting his limbs and leaving only his head open to the air. \"You and I are going to have a lot of fun together, I think.\" Severa giggled at the boy's plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan struggled to break free, but found Severa's grasp to be too strong. \"Severa, this isn't funny! Put me down, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you giving me an order?\" Severa's grasp tightened, forcing the air from Morgan's lungs. Morgan looked up to see his tormentor's face, still grinning, coming closer. Severa held Morgan close to her mouth, and spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the one in control here, Morgan.\" Severa's breath washed over him, the softspoken words creating a small hurricane to him. \"You belong to me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan couldn't believe what she was saying, the power had clearly gone to her head. \"Damn it, Severa! You can't do this! We're both people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we?\" Severa's voice was low and sultry, almost seductive. Morgan felt himself falling, as Severa lowered him and herself to the ground, and released the boy onto the hard ground. He breathed deep, thankful to be free of Severa's clutches, The good feeling would not last long, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt both of Morgan's sides, Severa's boots stood as monuments. The prince's eyes traced the path upwards, where Severa's legs rose as twin pillars of heaven. Far above, Severa's face loomed over him, staring down from on high. Their eyes met, and fear took hold of Morgan as the massive difference in scale between him and his captor sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera put her hands on her hips. \"I don't see a person, Morgan.\" She decreed down to the boy. \"All I see from up here is a bug.\" Morgan felt his knees quake, but could not will himself to move otherwise. \"A bug who doesn't know it's place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera raised her foot and held it over Morgan, eclipsing him in it's shadow. Finally, instinct kicked in, and Morgan turned to run in the opposite direction. Laughing at his attempt to escape, Severa began removing one of her boots. In the time it took her to bare one of her feet, Morgan had barely moved at all. With her bare foot, Severa lightly nudged Morgan's back, knocking him flat on his face. The young man, only to see Severa's big toe incoming. The toe impacted Morgan, pressing his face into the soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power-hungry giantess licked her lips. \"I do enjoy squishing bugs...\" Severa started, sending new waves of terror through Morgan's veins. \"...but I guess if you can please me, I can let you go. You can start by kissing that toe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera crossed her arms impatiently. Morgan wasted no time getting to work to stay the titaness' rage. Severa felt Morgan's lips press to her skin, small though they are. The sensation of the boy's kisses brought her to shiver in delight. The power rush was certainly going to her head, and she knew it, but she was enjoying it far too much to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Severa tired of the kisses her toe was receiving. \"Okay Morgan, that's enough of that.\" The giantess removed her foot and retrieved the boy, bringing him in her palm up to face level. \"Now it's time for something different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was just a simple thing, with potatoes, beef, and some vegetables, but it would soon have an additional ingredient\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the stew warmed, Severa took a tasting spoon and scooped some of the broth out, and wasted no time in plopping Morgan onto the broth-laden spoon.<br>\r\n\u201cAck! It\u2019s wet and sticky!\u201d Morgan yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh, its soup.

Now give him back!\u201d Lucina stated, reaching out a hand towards the spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera quickly snatched the spoon away, taking care not to throw Morgan off, and held it away from Lucina.<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, princess. We have to taste the stew first! That\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll know if Morgan really does give my stew emotion!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan cried out in fear while Lucina gasped, looking horrified.<br>\r\n\u201cSevera!

If I remember correctly, you said that the game you played with Morgan earlier terrified him, so now you have to let me frighten him! Besides, I won\u2019t hurt him, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m actually going to swallow him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera knew that the easiest way to beat Lucina in an argument was to attack her honor; she could see that she had beaten the future exalt.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2026 Alright, fine! But after this I\u2019m making you help me find somebody who can help Morgan! After you taste him, we clean him up and then we\u2019re done with this argument!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera grinned, she was going to enjoy this!<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!

He seemed to be frozen; looking like he couldn't believe what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and sighed. Morgan could be an annoyance at times, but he was still her little brother, and she loved him. On one hand, she was the older sibling, and it was every older sibling's duty to look after their younger sibling. On the other hand, Severa had backed her into a corner with her argument, and Lucina couldn't stand the thought of someone thinking her to be dishonorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Severa spoke up, sounding annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! What's taking you so long?! If I'd known you were going to stall for this long, I would have decided myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I'm just a little uncomfortable with the fact that I have to put my little brother in danger just to satisfy you!\" Lucina retorted with a bit of an edge to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera calmly shot back her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey. Calm down, it's not like whoever gets the spoon is going to swallow; I may like messing with the little brat, but I'm not stupid. There are a lot of things I want to do to him, but something like eating him is messed up even by my standards. Anyway, whoever tastes the stew will just swish the stew around and then spit him out or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera then smirked and looked into Lucina's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now quit stalling! What's your decision? Which one of us gets the spoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina winced and hesitated for a second, before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that the stew will be tasted by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Which girl tastes it?<br>\r\nOption 1: Lucina doesn't trust Severa, she puts the spoon in her mouth. Ironically, something happens and she swallows Morgan by accident.<br>\r\nOption 2: Lucina lets Severa taste the spoon for some reason, and just as she feared something happens that makes Severa accidentally swallow Morgan.</span></div></div>",

Here goes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me. I'll taste the stew.\" Lucina uttered in defeat, while Severa's eyes widened in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, finally! I was beginning to think that you were going to stall forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get this over with, Severa.\" Lucina muttered, unable to meet her little brother's terrified eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, no need to look so glum Lucina! Just swish him around for a bit and then spit him out! It's not like you're actually going to eat him!\" Severa said, crossing her arms under her modest bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina sighed and picked up the spoon her brother was curled up in. Wishing that this was over already, she silently lamented being roped into doing this by Severa. But then again, it really wouldn't be so bad... All she had to do to uphold her end of the deal was to swish Morgan around in her mouth for a little bit, and then he'd be free... And then she'd hug the life out of him to make up for scaring him (and plead with him to never tell their mother.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucina brought the spoon up to her waiting lips, she could see Severa watching on intently, a look of fascination on her face. She winced when she heard Morgan squeak in fright as she stuck the spoon in her mouth and deposited him on her tongue along with a mouthful of stew. The taste was surprisingly good (of the stew, she WAS NOT going to think about how her baby brother tasted.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I knew you could do it! There was no need for you to put up such a fuss after all! Now come on, how's he taste?\" Severa asked, in a tone that was much more excited than her usual teenage selfishness. Using her tongue to press Morgan into her cheek, Lucina answered around the mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stew doesn't taste bad. I'm not going to dignify the rest of your question with a response.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever. But hey, good job! You upheld your side of the bargain!\" Severa exclaimed while giving Lucina a firm pat on the back. Unfortunately for all three individuals involved, that pat on the back caused a certain involuntary action in Lucina's body, and everything else in the world seemed to grow silent except for the single loud *GULP* from Lucina's throat. Lucina's and Severa's eyes widened in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina doubled over, sputtering and coughing as Morgan passed down her throat. He was significantly bigger than the other morsels in her mouth, so it was hard for him to pass down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Gods, why did you DO that?! You weren't actually supposed to eat him! We're going to be in so much trouble now!\" Severa cried, throwing her hands up in the air in a combination of panic and exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Severa! This is all your fault! I didn't want to do any of this, and now Morgan is... is... Oh Naga...\" tears began to emerge from the corners of Lucina's eyes as the full weight of the situation came down on her. Severa's eyes softened as she began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Luci... don't cry. He's not gone yet, he's a tough little guy. And you've handled worse! We can go and get help; there are people in this camp who know lots about magic; one of them'll be able to fix this.\" Severa spoke softly, placing a reassuring hand on her friend's shoulder.</span></div></div>",

Robin realized that something was fishy with the two girls, and her demeanor went from worried and upset to suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I think about it, I KNOW I heard him speaking in here. He sounded upset... The two of you didn't have anything to do with that, did you?\" Severa gulped and shook her head, and Lucina's eyes watered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, out with it! What did you do to my baby?! Lucina, I trusted you to look after your baby brother! What happened to him? Spit it out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could! I didn't mean to swallow him, it was an accident!\" Lucina cried, tears pooling in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what? You'd better explain yourself, dear. I don't think I heard you right.\" Robin crossed her arms under her ample bosom, staring down at the shorter woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera paled and groaned in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, I can't believe you told her, Lucina! She's gonna kill both of us!</span></div></div>",

You nearly gave me a heart attack! What is wrong with you!\" Severa snapped, only to shrink back into herself when meeting the dark mage's smoldering glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the future girl's outburst, Tharja continued. \"I was stalking Robin until I noticed the future Exalt looking dangerously suspicious. So I decided to stalk you instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women went as pale as sheets. \"H-how much did you see!?\" Severa asked panicked.

Although I never thought for a second that the noble princess of Ylisse had in in her to swallow her own brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident!\" Lucina defended. She bristled a bit a the accusation but pushed her growing anger and embarrassment down as she knew this was just how Tharja interacted with people. \"I never meant for this to happen.\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. She'd never hurt Morgan on purpose!\" Severa added. Lucina appreciated her friend's defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Tharja said with mild disinterest. \"You're too noble for such action. But that still doesn't change the fact that your brother is currently occupying your stomach.\" she then placed a hand to her chin I thought. \"I wonder how he's fairing in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina felt her blood run cold at the ravenette's words and Severa took this opportunity to step in. \"Enough already. Look, you're a mage, right? That means you know all sorts of magic. Can you help with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja raised an eyebrow. \"You want my assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yes?\" Severa as sure as she was asecond ago. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally when someone requires magical aid in camp they turn to Miriel or even Ricken or Henry. The only person that ever comes to me first is Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we're asking you first. Right Luci?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes. We would be honored if you assisted us.\" Lucina answered. Tharja might've been a family friend, but the woman always made her feel uneasy. Even in the future before Grima the dark mage just had this ominous aura about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Severa evidently didn't think much of Tharja's response either, vocally voicing her displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you mean, you psycho bitch?! We're trying to save a life here and you're first response is to figure out how to profit off of it? Lucina, we were wrong! There's still time to find- Grrk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera's angry voice was cut off as her throat constricted painfully. Clawing at her throat, the twin-tailed redhead spun on her feet to face the sorceress, who now had one arm outstretched, her fist closed and pointed directly at Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. That was awfully rude of you, Severa. You're asking me to clean up your mess for free after all. I'm not Anna, but you can't expect me to devote my valuable time to something that you knowingly caused,\" The dark mage tittered, conversing with the choking woman as if they were discussing a purchase at the marketplace. Lucina started towards Severa, before turning towards Tharja with a pleading look in her eye. She didn't want this to come to blows, not when doing so could expose her horrible crime to the rest of the shepherds, ruin Morgan's chance at being rescued, and potentially harm the unspeakably precious cargo inside of her. Tharja cast an aside glance at her, the deadpan look on her face clashing with Lucina's worried visage. After a tense second, the Plegian unclenched her fist and severa fell to her knees, gasping and greedily sucking in air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Cough* That was- *hack* the stupidest thing you could- *wheeze* do, you dumb bitch! What if somebody heard us, we'd all be screwed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja lifted a delicate brow at the hunched over girl on the floor of her tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... I'm sure you meant to say 'witch' just now, not that other awful word... and no one's ever accused me of being dumb,\" Lucina stepped in between the two quarreling women, arms outstretched. This situation needed to be diffused immediately! Ever second they lost here was another second that Morgan lost inside of her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tharja, please! Severa didn't mean what she said, this awful situation is just bringing out the worst in us! She's sorry, right Severa?\" Lucina's last question was directed between her and Severa alone, but the witch-woman didn't miss the pleading look on the bluenette's face as she stared into her friends eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Che, fine. I'm SORRY for insulting you!\" Tharja held Severa's gaze for an uncomfortably long second before turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was hardly sincere, but its likely the best I'll get. And bringing back my earlier question- What. Do I get. From helping the two of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina gulped nervously. She could barely feel Morgan inside of her. He was so small, so frail right now that he didn't even register as added weight- he was just another bite of food in her stomach. His clock was ticking, and here she was arguing with his best hope at making it out of this alive... Gods, she didn't even know if it was too late for him to emerge unscathed. What if he came back burned, or with his limbs broken, or, or... No! She couldn't afford to think like that right now. Morgan was in danger and she had to rescue him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tharja, please. Even if you don't care much for Morgan, Severa, or me, he's still Robin's son. Her Baby Boy- he means the world to mother. You'd be doing her an enormous favor. Just think about how much she would owe you for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd those were the magic words. All at once Tharja's demeanor seemed to change; the sinister aura around her receding and something that Lucina could barely call a smile creeping onto her face. Eugh, she was glad that smile wasn't meant for her... poor mother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that you mention it I do believe it is in my best interests to help out your dear brother! I will of course still require payment from you and Severa for my services, but in light of more pressing matters I will be happy to collect on those once this problem is resolved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina sagged against the tent and Severa slumped back in relief, feeling at least some of the tension leave their bodies. Thank the Gods, they'd made Tharja see reason. Ugh, if only she'd thought to bring up her mother early, they could've avoided this whole argument in the first place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you to had better follow me back to my prevent tent. I've amassed a wide variety of tomes, cursed artifacts, and trinkets of mysterious origin that there should be several avenues open for us to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera spoke up for the first time in several minutes since her choking at the dark mage's magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaaay, just as long as the first option gets him out. The goal here is to retrieve Morgan from Lucina's gut, not turn the two of them into your magic experiments,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes of course. Not to worry, we will retrieve Morgan from Lucina and I shall be on my way to Robin's good graces in no time at all! Follow me, girls. I must undo the wards on my tent to allow you to enter unscathed,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera and Lucina shared a look- Tharja seemed awfully delighted about this turn of events (or at least, what passed for delight in Tharja's world.) They could only hope that she had the health and safety of the two of them as well as Morgan in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief walk, the three women passed through the nearly empty camp (everyone else must've been out training, hunting, or patrolling) before arriving at Tharja's tent. After she waved her hands and chanted briefly, runes on the large canvas tent's entry flap glowed, before she signalled them inside. Once inside, Tharja rushed over to a table containing all sorts of dark artifacts, before practically skipping back over to Severa and Lucina. In her hands was a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Doreedo's Note** I have a rough outline for option 1, so I'm reserving the next post on that branch for myself. After that its fair game.

Miriel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from the tome she had been studying, Miriel saw Severa enter her tent, nearly dragging Lucina by the hand.

Am I hearing you correctly, Sever?. Morgan, small as he is, is much too large to be consumed by a being of human stature.

Small enough to fit in his sister\u2019s mouth?! Fascinating! I have never read any tomes that described the successful reduction of one\u2019s physical mass. Why, this is a wonderful opportunity. Your brother\u2019s state could tell me so much I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel stopped as she noticed Lucina start to shake. The blue-haired girl had her arms wrapped around herself and seemed to be lost in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies, Lucina. I lost myself for a moment and didn\u2019t adequately consider your feelings. Clearly, as you have notified me of this event and no one else, I understand that you wish for me to lend you all the aid I can. As I said earlier, there is no existing work beyond mere theories on size-reduction, so my help will be limited to what I have gleaned from my studies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter constantly letting Severa speak for her, Lucina sighed and closed her eyes. After a moment, she opened them and began to speak.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Dame Miriel. I greatly appreciate your help and I\u2026 Huh?!\u201d Lucina jerked as Miriel abruptly jerked up her tunic, gazing at Lucina\u2019s pale, toned stomach in thought. Severa squeaked and watched the two with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I am to help the three of you, I must run some simple tests. I believe detect life should suffice here. Ah, there we go.\u201d The mage exclaimed as she ran a now glowing hand over Lucina\u2019s bare belly, making the girl shiver at the contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering the girl's tunic, Miriel turned her attention back to the two young women in her tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this simple scan has told me several things. First of all, Morgan is alive and currently well. The heat and smell don\u2019t seem to be a threat towards him, but there is a matter that we must address immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gonna happen?\u201d Both Lucina and Severa spoke at the exact same time. Pausing, Severa gave Lucina a nod to speak.<br>\r\n\u201cYou said there was a problem? Please do whatever you need to do to fix it! Just keep my brother safe!\u201d Lucina pleaded with the solemn mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage lowered Lucina\u2019s tunic down, covering the girl\u2019s stomach once more before straightening up and answering the worried sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, dear. That goes without saying. I merely meant that there would be a problem in the near future that we must resolve now to ensure that it does not hinder our efforts to safely retrieve little Morgan.\u201d After saying this, she turned around and began to rummage through a chest full of books near her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera spoke up, not wanting the scholarly mage to become distracted once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what is it? Is it something we can help with? Please don\u2019t say that we have to go out and get help\u2026\u201d The twin-tailed girl groused, drawing Miriel\u2019s attention once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not at all. In fact I can take of the dilemma right now. I was simply making sure that I had an adequate tome of wind spells. It would be disastrous if the spell I used was underpowered, or Naga forbid, overpowered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Lucina and Severa realized where Miriel was going with her train of thought. Severa was once more the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGods, you mean Morgan can\u2019t breathe in there? Why can\u2019t you just teleport him out or something?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina looked horrified at the notion that her brother might asphyxiate inside of her, but answered Severa\u2019s Miriel-directed question nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother explained it to me, as siblings there is a certain amount of overlap in our magical signatures, a rescue staff might not work on one of us if we were standing side by side. To work around the problem, it would have to be both of us together or neither at all,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite right, Lucina. You see girls, we must take the long way to solve this problem because I fear that attempting to teleport Morgan out using conventional means may be quite harmful to both of you. So instead, we are forced to simply configure Lucina\u2019s stomach to allow him to survive until we have a better solution. I apologize, but on such short notice it is the only option to take. Severa, you should step back. Lucina, I have a few questions before I begin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera wisely stepped back, making more space for Lucina and Miriel, while the other girl answered the mage\u2019s question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, configure my stomach? Wouldn\u2019t that be harmful to me? I don\u2019t want Morgan to be harmed, but if anything were to happen to me he may become un-retrievable,\u201d the princess was already wary at the thought of foreign magic affecting her body, and not keen on allowing herself to end up as somebody's lab experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to worry princess. I merely intend to cast a spell that will effectively cast a safety net around your brother. This way, you won\u2019t worry about starving, but Morgan won\u2019t be at risk of digesting. My earlier test ensured me that your brother's innate magic resistance will keep your stomach acids from affecting him for the time being. Severa, would you assist me for a moment? I need you to expose Lucina\u2019s stomach for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina and Severa blushed at the odd request, but nonetheless acquiesced to the mage\u2019s demands. Severa moved directly behind Lucina and rolled the princess\u2019s tunic up till it was just below her bra, exposing the entirety of her belly. Moving up to them, Miriel waved her arms over Lucina\u2019s stomach, each hand glowing with power. Lucina started at this, nearly stepping back into Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy stomach\u2026 that was supposed to happen, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel nodded. \u201cNot to worry, that was merely the safety net wrapping around your brother's signature. Food should be able to pass through like normal, but the passage of oxygen will be confined to what passes up and down your throat. The final measure I take is one that I would like your permission for. I have to, for lack of a better term, \u2018puff\u2019 your stomach up. Simply put, filling your stomach by constantly swallowing air would be too cumbersome and attention-grabbing to sustain. To this end I\u2019ll use focused wind magic to create a reservoir of stored air inside your stomach that will constantly be in a state of replenishment and recycling. As I said, I require your permission for this step. The notion of altering another\u2019s body without their explicit consent, even for good intentions, is something that I find quite repulsive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo, you\u2019re going to be filling her stomach with air, remind me not to stand in front of her, she\u2019s going to belching louder than Vaike,\u201d sniped Severa, adjusting her arms and rolling her shoulders to bring feeling back into her arms. Lucina frowned and snapped back at Severa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSevera! That\u2019s not funny! Please, Miriel, you have my full permission for whatever you need. Just keep Morgan safe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel\u2019s eyes softened and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.  Princess, I want you to know that I find your determination and worry over your younger brother to be quite moving. I am touched that you came to me for assistance.\u201d Miriel said as she opened a green tome, flipping through the pages. Eventually, her hands came to a stop\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Doreedo's Warning** Option 1 and 3 Miriel I'm trying to keep as close to their canon self as possible, but if people want to add to option 2, she can be written out of character. </span></div></div>",

They headed towards the kitchen,  both grateful that no one was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was dropped off on a nearby counter as Severa and Lucina dug around the room for ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a stew?\" <br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, that's all we can make until we see the merchant again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine,\" Lucina conceded, forcing open a crate of vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sat on the side, somewhat relieved that their attention was diverted for at least a few minutes of rest. But it didn't last as long as the giant grouch made her way towards him under Lucina's watchful glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself useful and start cutting the carrots,\" Severa ordered, dropping a carrot that easily dwarfed Morgan. She dug around her pockets until she found a small knife suitable enough for the tiny tactician to cut with, albeit while expending way more effort than it was worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's small, and kinda pathetic,\" Severa stated, \"so it should suit you pretty well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed as he gripped the blade with both arms, finding it difficult to even do that as the blade itself, while a measly two inches, was still taller than him. It kept him occupied long enough as he listened to the two talk while the stew cooked. And when it was all done, all Morgan had to show for it was a half a carrot cut into thin slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach dropped as a familiar shadow descended on him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all?\" the voice criticized. \"Whatever, it will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera cupped the carrots into her hand and swiftly dropped it into the pot. Right after, the two girls slowly began to pour the food into bowls, working quickly to set up the first serving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lucina, could you start passing out the bowls? I'll wash out the pot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord nodded and grabbed two nearby bowls, leaving the room and forgetting her shrunken brother. And for a quick moment, it seemed like Severa paid no mind to the now helpless tactician at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Severa creeped over to Morgan, placing her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since your sister's not here. I guess it wouldn't hurt to put in my... secret ingredient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan went pale right before he was forced back upside down, losing any sense of comfort now that Lucina wasn't around. It didn't take a genius to figure out what came next as the shrunken tactician was hanging helplessly above a single bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully whoever it is just doesn't shovel it down their throat.\" Severa taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Morgan noticed was the heat. He counted himself lucky that it wasn't scalding. He splashed against the liquid. And once he reached the surface he was forced back down by a deftly peeled potato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held onto the slice as the Severa carried out the bowl, pushing him down to hide him as she placed the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Morgan resurfaced, he was mortified once he realized it was...</span></div></div>",

Her mind drifted off to the thought of her husband sharing her son's stature.  She stifled a giggle, knowing that having Chrom literally under her thumb was too good to be true. At the very least the training equipment would last longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did this happen?\" Robin asked. <br>\r\n\"Last morning. Though it feels like I've been like this for years.\"<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first thing that day,  Lucina almost stepped on me. \"<br>\r\n\"She did!?\" Robin stood up from her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,  mom no! It wasn't her fault! It was an accident.\"<br>\r\n\"Still, she put your life in danger without even trying. Did anything else happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan feared elaborating further, knowing that his mother would severely injure Miriel, Severa, and even Lissa for what they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing else! \" Morgan piped. <br>\r\n\"Morgan,\" Robin pressed, \"I can tell when you're lying.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay.

What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sweetie, but this is for your safety.\" Robin rationalized as she brought the shrunken boy closer to her tactician coat, opening the inside wide enough to safely deposit her son in an inside pocket meant for vulinaries and elixirs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat satisfied with her protective measures, Robin patted at her chest. The wriggling mass against her torso only meant that her son would be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the pocket, Morgan was disoriented, losing any sense of direction as the only stimuli was the heat.

Still, she inadvertently returned just in time to spare her son another torturous day at the hands of anyone but her. She felt that all Morgan really needed was his mother protecting him. Her eyes grew heavy, and she fought to stay awake as she fazed in and out of focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to her bed, a sad looking cot that suddenly looked like her massive plush bed back at Ylisstol's castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess Morgan wouldn't mind if I took a little nap,</i> Robin rationalized, <i>It beats accidentally skipping over a cure.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stood up, shuffling her way towards the tiny cot, forcing off her boots as she stopped.

He army crawled his way towards what he assumed was the exit, reassured by his mother's distant heartbeat. And after five tiring minutes, Morgan felt the sweet fresh air, a welcomed change compared to the stale leathery odor of the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, able to finally stretch his legs. Off in the distance, Morgan caught a gkimpse of his sleeping mother. He found it hard to believe that she would be willing to entrap her son for that long under the pretense of keeping him safe. He looked to the side, sliding down the side of the tactician coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked up to the massive wall that was his beloved mother.

Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis response was once again left with no response, but a sudden tremor in the ground seemed to reawaken the fear in the shrunken boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the massive wall got larger as Robin turned to her side, ominously hanging above Morgan. The tiny boy stepped back, recoiling until he stopped just short of the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother! Wake up! Please!\"<br>\r\n\"Mmph,\" the giant groaned, \"it's okay sweetie, Mommy's here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan perked up, only to be shot down as Robin was still heavily asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cot began to groan and the giant form began to move over, rolling closer and faster to the point where Morgan had to either jump off or be pressed under Robin's massive weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked over the cot's edge, completely unpleased with the option as the hopeless abyss of Robin's boots were the only thing waiting for him at the bottom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mouth opened in awe as he stared at the immense colossus. So familiar, and yet so alien from this perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god. You are tiny. I can barely make you out down there. Even my boots dwarf you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan continued to stare up at his mother who herself looked down at him from full height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he shouldn't be afraid. This was his mother after all. But seeing her from this perspective. So far above him, looking down like a goddess from on high...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother,\" he gulped, \"wha- what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled kindly down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Morgan,\" she assured him, \"I was just curious how it looked from this perspective. I've held you in my hand of course, but seeing you like this... it really drives home the problem here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded in agreement, unable to tear his eyes away from his towering mother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't afraid of me, are you Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, of course not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"I'm glad to hear it. I know these last few days must have shaken you up a lot. But you know you can always trust me. I'll protect you no matter how long it takes. Oh, and don't worry. I assure you I won't tell Noire about your secret. But like I said, when you get back to normal, you'd better man up and tell her the truth, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Robin as she leaned down, \"I'd say it's dinner time. Shall I get some food and bring it back for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mother. I'd appreciate it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and put her hand down for him to step on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok mother. I can get up to your desk myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her eyebrows at this unusual statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really. It's fine! I'd like to try and maintain some independence. Even at this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back to her desk the back down to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I'll be fine.

She blew him a kiss, and then raised her massive leg up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan watched in awe as her pillars went over his head and landed on the other side with a trembling sound. She continued towards the exit, her footsteps causing the ground to quake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the reassuring talk he'd just had, Morgan found he was in fact unable to get back up to the top of the desk by himself. Despite his strength of will, the tiny boy found he just didn't have the strength to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well so much for my independence,\" he thought. \"I can't wait to see mom's smirk when she finds me still on the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, he began to hear the ground shake again with the footsteps of a giant (aka normal-sized person).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

He took a deep breath, letting his off beat heart calm down to a steadier rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course his heart rate sky rocketed the second he spotted his giant crush walking into the tent. Panicking, Morgan dove behind the bowl of stew, hoping Noire would leave quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Robin,\" Noire called, her voice low in volume, half worried about the possibility of being heard.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Noire.

Also, their figures are a bit more...robust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Robin knew it was too late to bring out Morgan, knowing that Noire would probably die of embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, and I suppose you would be on the... slight side?\"<br>\r\n\"Slight? Ha! I'm skin and bone! I fall over in a stiff breeze.They're all so full of energy; it's like staring into the sun... They make me feel like a troll...

You're not a troll. You're just perfect the way you are.\"<br>\r\n\"INSOLENCE! HOW DARE YOU GIVE ME FALSE INFORMATION! NO MALE HAS EVER GAZED UPON ME AS THEY HAVE WITH OTHER WOMEN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that what it's about?

Though he's a little shy,\" Robin purposefully emphasized the word little, \"I practically had to pry the fact that he had a little crush on you.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Mo-- Erm, Robin,\" Noire corrected, lunging into the tactician for a hug tight enough to cause back pain. \"I don't think I could thank you enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan could have sworn his heart dropped when Noire began bouncing away from the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Robin hummed, \"if all goes well, she won't have to correct herself anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOOOM, please...\" Morgan groaned, both embarrassed and horrified at the turn of events. \"You promised!\"<br>\r\n\"And I kept it, sweetie.

Well, just be careful, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Robin. I'll take care of him,\" Noire responded cheerfully, seemingly unaware of the warning note in Robin's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked out of the tent with her boyfriend, Morgan released the breath he had been holding in.

Beneath that sweet, helpless exterior, Noire always had that... other side to her. If she said or did the wrong  thing at the wrong time she could splat him at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould Noire really do that to him? In the past she has been nothing but kind to him, even if she did sometimes say very strange, very disturbing things. She had never tried to control or manipulate him. Then again he had a higher oppinion of Lissa and Miriel before this happened. So far only his mother and sister had truly treated him as a human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat other side of Noire.. she seemed almost oblvious to it. Did it come out today because she wanted to push him around or was she just nervous? Maybe he really did have nothing to worry. While a part of him still resented his mother's meddling, her judgement had always stirred the Shepards and himself well. And if she thought this was a good idea, odds were good it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was careful, he could avoid upsetting Noire, and then their would be no reason to be afraid. He was stuck in this situation, so he might as well make the best of it. If all went well, this could be a wonderful night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire had been heading for town with Morgan in hand and only just noticed he had been starring into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shook out of his trance, and looked up, noticing Noire's loving eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh- uh.. just our date tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled him closer and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to the side, fidgeting with her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-I'm excited to... but also nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan made himself smile, but actually felt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nothing to fear, we're going to have a great night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Awkwardly shuffling, Noire sat at a small, isolated booth in the corner, gently lowering her date onto a coaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this place fine?\" Noire asked, keeping her voice low enough to be obscured by the chatter of the other patrons. Morgan nodded,thankful of the privacy Noire provided. \"Oh look at me, talking to a coaster. I must look like a mad woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire stifled a giggle at her own expense, playfully dragging her fingertips closer to Morgan as if it were a person walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about what other people think, though,\" Noire declared. \"I only care about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked at him with her index finger, giggling slightly as he stumbled backwards. Morgan laughed along, albeit uncomfortably. Still, she seemed happy, and it meant that her other persona would be at bay. He couldn't help but think about whatever punishment Noire would have in mind if he said or did something wrong. But one look at her smile seemed to make everything worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for someone to come by to take Noire's order, unaware of the tiny person on the table. The overall encounter was quick and painless, and definitely not enough to summon Noire's other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you holding up? You know... being so tiny and all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, its erm,.. weird. I feel s-safe and vulnerable at the same time. It's just that I know you wouldn't try to hurt me, but at the same time... all it takes is one accident, and I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Morgan,\" Noire sighed, \" I didn't know you were so scared of everything like that. But I guess I could see what you mean. I'd be even more frightened if I could be killed as easily as-- sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Morgan swallowed, avoiding the thought.<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure nothing ever tries to hurt you. I'LL SOONER SEE THEM DEA-- sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed, somewhat thankful that her outburst wasn't directed at him. He just hoped it wouldn't turn for the worse.</span></div></div>",

The tiny boy practically wrestled against a rather tough piece of chicken, and his giant date couldn't help but giggle once she realized that the meat was winning the scuffle. She pushed him aside, gently nudging him with her index finger before tearing a small chunk for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Morgan sighed, biting into a lump of meat as large as his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight lull in their date as neither really had much to say. Still, they both appreciated being in each others company, enjoying the relative silence and peacefulness shared between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight up until a large, frothing mug was slammed onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, um, Miss? I didn't ask for an ale.\" Noire clarified, looking up to the waitress.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but that's all we got.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire, a little off put by the glass of alcohol, sighed sharply as she brought the mug closer to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Noire!\" Morgan called, \"I didn't know you, um, drank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archer chuckled before taking another swig, \"well when your father's 'The Vaike', most of your daddy-daughter bonding time involves a cask of ale. I think we drank ourselves silly just because he wanted to truly make sure I was his daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe coughed a bit and shuddered as she took down another mouthful of the drink. \"I don't really like the taste much, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little tactician looked up at the giant glass, failing to avoid the thought that he could easily drown inside the amber liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if it's such a good idea to be imbibing.\" Morgan reasoned, staring down at his own feet. Noire scoffed in response, cheekily brushing off her date's concerned suggestion. There was a flush of warmth at her cheeks as she just happened to notice how adorable Morgan was. Although, it might have been alcohol talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, cutie,\" Noire hushed, \"it's just a little confidence boost. Get the date rolling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan swallowed the growing lump in his throat, noticing that Noire had already begun loosening up. Though it was perfectly okay with him as long as it warded off Blood and Thunder. No matter how much she seemed to drink, she never went past a light buzz, which Morgan was thankful for. They talked, mostly about their experiences from when they landed in the past. Her shy tendencies seemed to shrink away the more the night went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their date went on, Noire found herself growing more comfortable when handling Morgan, holding the shrunken boy in her palm and keeping him close. And before Morgan knew it, he was plucked from her hand and held in front of her plush lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her, it was a small peck, but Morgan was buried against Noire's puckered lips. The shrunken boy blushed furiously, earning another entertained giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boo. The food's gotten cold,\" she whined, faking a disappointed tone. \"I guess we should head back to camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk was uneventful, save for Noire's slight swaying. Luckily for both of them, it wasn't much of a distance, and Noire quickly found herself stumbling in camp, She paused at the line of tents, looking down at Morgan before thinking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what now?\" Morgan squeaked, staring up at the slightly glazed look in his date's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the other hand, hi smother was the only one who he felt truly safe around, and with her gone, he felt a lot more vulnerable. He knew there was Lucina, but he did not have the same confidence in her. Partly due to almost being eaten by her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Noire herself. He had no way to defend himself if her other side manifested itself. He could only hope he was able to calm her down before she left any permanent damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire went into her tent and looked at her bunkmate's bed, noticing they were out for the moment. She sat down on her cot and tilted her hand letting Morgan roll out onto the mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alone at last,\" she leaned on her stomach, her chin in her hands and stared at her lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Alone at last. Before, we do anything, we should set a few ground rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, rules. And what if I don't follow those rules?\" She leaned in close smirking. \"Will you punish me little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confidence from Noire was not something Morgan was used to. He never would have seen it at his normal height. Honestly, he wasn't sure how to deal with it. It made him feel more uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, not rules. More like requests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Noire's smirk faded and she nodded in understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of the camp knows by now about my condition. But I'd like to keep interaction to a minimum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A recluse huh? Just like Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister is not a recluse! She just has a lousy sense of humor. I don't want to shut myself out. But I find when I'm around lots of people, my chance for misfortune increases.\" He thought back to Lissa, Miriel and Severa, shuddering at what they put him through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's fine,\" Noire smiled lifting Morgan up by the back of his coat. \"More time I have you to myself then.\" She held him in front of her face and stared at him for a while. Then suddenly she opened her mouth and threw him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noire, what the hell!?\" She giggled at his panic and to add insult to injury started to swish him around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Morgan, it was far less pleasant however. He couldn't tell which way was up or down and he was getting soaked in her saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, for him she soon tired and spat him out into her hand. She pulled a cloth from her bedside table and wiped him down with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan glared at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok another ru- er request. I know you probably didn't mean anything by that, but could you please not do it again.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire frowned. \"What, you're telling me you didn't enjoy that at all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's glare turned to one of confusion. \"No I did not! How could you think that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire shrugged. \"I just thought it might bring us closer together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that close! Please Noire. Don't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment, then smiled. \"I'm not sure I can promise that. After all, I am the one in charge and if you're ever naughty boy, well.\" She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, I don't truly believe that some part of you didn't enjoy that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan opened his mouth to retort, but stopped. He knew he wasn't going to change her mind on this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but just give me a heads up next time, ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but that's the fun! You never expect it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that he had no further response, Noire leaned forward and kissed him on the head. She then leaned on her back and placed him on her chest. She moved the covers up to cover him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so my roommate doesn't see you immediately and try to steal you from me! Then I'd have to punish her, and really eat you!\" She said it in a joking manner, but there was steel in her eyes that said otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leaned back, Morgan suddenly thought of another even more serious problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I ask one more request?\" He paused. \"Don't show me to your mother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, she went quiet for a time. \"I doubt I can keep you totally hidden. She probably knows I have you. But I can at least keep interaction to a minimum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have preferred no interaction, but he knew there was little Noire could do when it came to her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd say that's enough for one day. Thank you for making me the happiest girl in the world, little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan lay awake for a while, watching his girlfriend, his goddess, sleep, still amazed he'd managed to win her over. Even so, he still was uncertain about their future together between his height, and her increasing dominance, it would be a challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he closed his eyes, lulled to sleep by the rhythm of the giant's rising and falling chest.</span></div></div>",

He had always thought of her as sweet and delicate, at least when the other side of her wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd would she really risk exposing her to Tharja? Morgan shuddered. He couldn't think of ANYTHING scarier than a giant Tharja. Then again, he was sure that even Noire was afraid of Tharja. If Tharja caught sight of him and took an interest in him, the interaction wouldn't be minimal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to clear his head of such thoughts. What started as a dream date had turned into a night. The weeks ahead could be painful, but there was nothing left to do other than to go along with it. Hopefully he wouldn't have to endure too much before being united with his mother, though he would definitely rethink his taste in woman. Why was everyone he knew so dam crazy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was flung out his thoughts, and physically knocked over, simply by Noire waking up.

What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through the entrance. In your tent.

Dissecting bugs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's eyelids raised a tad. He looked up from where he was lying down to see a flat plain of stomach. Tilting his head up slowly, he saw a familiar face with a headful of dark and bluish hair. He then lost his hold and fell into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Morgan? Oh Robin! I had no idea you were into hexes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Tharja. I didn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And on your own child no less! Oh please tell me how you did it!

The sphere then infused its essence inside of the diminutive tactician while Tharja spoke in an ancient language that Robin could not interpret. The sphere then disperses and disappears completely and leaves Morgan flat on the ground. Robin rushes over and kneels next to Tharja to check on her son.<br>\r\nRobin lays her hand on Tharja's shoulder and asked \"What happened?

She was wearing no shoes as she typically does, revealing her furry barefeet, along with sharp nails on her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPanne? Oh thank the Gods! Her Taguel senses should be able to find me no problem! Panne! Look down here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, she does not acknowledge Morgan\u2019s cries for help<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin? Are you here? I was wondering if you wanted me to go out on more scouting missions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks towards Morgan and raises her left foot high into the air, casting a massive shadow over the shrunken tactician.<br>\r\nShe unfortunately is not aware of his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPANNE!! LOOK DOWN HERE!! IT\u2019S ME MORGAN! OH GODS PLEASE DON\u2019T SQUISH ME!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanne\u2019s foot began to descend upon the tactician, soon to make Morgan a mashed corpse under the Taguel\u2019s furry foot (or so he thinks). Without a second thought, Morgan swiftly dives out of the foot\u2019s shadow, narrowly dodging the big toe from the left barefoot of the Taguel. Morgan then tries to run up to her foot and hit it to get her attention, but Panne moves forward away from Morgan. She walks further into the tent <br>\r\nand looks around for any traces of Robin\u2019s whereabouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffs the air, and cringes in disgust \u201cUgh, the horrid stench of hexes clouds this place. That witch Tharja must have gotten to her first. Oh well, I'll find Robin later\u201d<br>\r\nDue to the residue of hexes all over Morgan as well, her senses are unable to detect the miniature tactician\u2019s presence. Morgan begins get deep in thought how to approach the Taguel in order to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she can't find me so easily, then how can I get her to see m-\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly, Morgan\u2019s foolishness of thinking out in the open got him trapped within the shadow of Panne\u2019s foot again. He was deep in the shadow and there was likely no escape this time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOO!! PANNE!! PLEASE DON\u2019T STEP ON-\u201d<br>\r\nPanne had already stepped on the poor tactician before he could finish his useless final cries for assistance. Luckily for Morgan, he was still alive and one piece beneath Panne\u2019s foot, and was shocked to discover his survival. He couldn't move and felt stuck to Panne's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?... Thank the Gods! How the heck am I still alive? That didn't even hurt that much!!\u201d Morgan said muffled and while getting fur in his mouth.<br>\r\nPanne\u2019s soft fluffy sole made the step not that harmful to Morgan, he was honestly quite lucky to be squashed by the last Taguel!  An odd thought, but at least it wasn't someone more forceful like Kjelle. Panne's sole was all covered in a coat of brown fur, feeling like laying on a soft bed on your belly for Morgan\u2019s case being face first to the ball of Panne\u2019s sole. Her sole was a bit dirty though, but her foot complemented itself with a surprisingly pleasant scent, at least compared to Robin and Lucina\u2019s barefeet. <br>\r\nPanne began to walk out of Robin\u2019s tent, still possessing the tiny tactician on her foot. As Panne walked, Morgan felt a combination of being pressed up against the soft fur and skin of Panne\u2019s sole while whiffing in her pleasant foot scent, and the bit more hurtful grass which the hex luckily facilitates the pain of it. Panne unfortunately collected more dirt under her foot and on Morgan from the ground, but Morgan had a clean space where he is stuck on. Morgan was a bit intrigued to be riding on Panne\u2019s foot, but at the same time wanted to be released by the fluffy comfortable foot.<br>\r\nEventually Panne stops walking, and is talking to someone. Morgan can't quite make out who it is, all he hears are muffled female voices conversing. Panne even begins to tap her foot repeatedly, stamping Morgan into the ground. Soon enough, Panne starts walking away, and Morgan gets a quick glimpse from behind and saw Robin walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOTHER OVER HE-\"<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s attempts to shout for his mother are quickly silenced by Panne\u2019s footsteps. With this, Morgan watched his mother walk away towards the direction of her tent. The poor tactician felt like a pathetic worthless bug succumbed to a soft yet annoying fate. As Morgan endures the walk, Morgan is able to\u2026..</span></div></div>",

Morgan attempts to bite the skin of the ball of Panne\u2019s foot, but swallows a bunch of brown fur that nearly suffocates him. Morgan spits and coughs out the residue of the fur and goes at biting her foot again. His teeth manage to just scrape Panne\u2019s skin, with fur close to the end of Morgan\u2019s throat. Morgan lets out another nasty cough from the fur and hopes his last resort plan is accomplished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Panne stops where she is, the squashed tactician\u2019s plan actually worked! Morgan can make out a bit of what her muffled voice was saying, praying to not stay on her foot any longer. Panne wiggles her toes a little bit, as a way to feel what she just felt on the bottom of her foot along with tapping her ball and feeling something coming from it.<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? What was that? My foot kinda itches. Ugh I must have stepped on something. No matter\u201d Panne says to herself while stopping wiggling her toes and tapping her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanne starts to rub and slide her foot across the grass in order to scratch her foot, not exactly what Morgan intended at all! At first, it starts off gentle and slow, as if Morgan was receiving a fantastic massage from the cozy and smooth foot after all that walking around.<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, I might not break out, but this is great! Never thought I'd enjoy being under Panne!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Morgan\u2019s pleasure and comfort would soon go away as Panne gets annoyed and presses harder to ameliorate the itch. The pressure on Morgan\u2019s tiny body increases greatly as he is rubbed across the grass on his back. Morgan endures the pain as much as he can, never thinking he could experience being smothered under a Tanguel\u2019s foot. Eventually, Morgan slides off of Panne\u2019s sole and lands flat on the ground, relieved of not being trampled anymore. He looks up at Panne\u2019s foot and it starts to come down on him again, but luckily Morgan rolls out of Panne's foot\u2019s shadow before he can get stuck under there again. The tactician watches Panne walk away from him towards her tent, staring at her furry soles as she leaves his sight. <br>\r\nMorgan lays flat on the ground and breathes heavily, Panne knocked the wind out of him countless times! He was covered in fur and dirt, and he smelled like Panne\u2019s pleasant foot scent along with it being all he is currently smelling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaaaaa, haaaaa, I\u2026. am never\u2026.. looking at feet\u2026. the same\u2026.. ever again! Though it was kinda fun and cool with Panne\u2026 Focus Morgan! What a weird thing to say! But had it been anyone else, I'd be a stain under someone\u2019s boot!! So, thanks for stepping on me Panne!... Ok that's just weird out loud, let's find my way outta here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stands up and stumbles while standing after such a flattening experience. He looks towards where his mother\u2019s tent would be located, a long way for his size. Almost like crossing an entire country! Morgan takes a deep breath and starts his journey across the grassy forest. After nearly what seemed like hundreds of miles, Morgan still has a long way to go to Robin\u2019s tent, despite it being in Morgan's sight. The night began to get colder, and the tiny tactician began to shiver a bit. Now he kind of wishes for the warmth from Panne\u2019s foot again, but without the trampling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh, well guess I gotta keep on going. You can do this Morgan! I'll make it to mother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan continues across the grass, he feels more footsteps coming. He turns to his left and looks up to see both Sumia and Cynthia walking together through the night walking towards him, a chance to get to Robin\u2019s tent faster! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Cynthia! Sumia! Down here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey step closer to Morgan and stop to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mother, did you hear something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I did honey. Maybe it was the wind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talk together, they both lightly tap Morgan with their feet and, of course, trip and fall over. The impact from their hilarious falls blow Morgan away from them a good distance away. As Morgan lands towards the ground, he collides with something odd, something that wasn't the grass. Suddenly, Morgan gets grabbed by darkness and is lifted away somewhere. He cannot see anything, just straight darkness from the cupped hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Morgan gets dropped down onto something. Morgan looks around to see a lit up tent and he is sitting on a bed. He looks up to see that the tent belongs to\u2026.</span></div></div>",

The tiny tactician begins to blush a bit and widens his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell.. Yeah but it's just, well-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's what? Relax Morgan, it's ok for humans to have odd fascinations I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no that's not it. You walked in my mother\u2019s tent earlier today and you didn't notice me and stepped on me. I tried to yell at you, but you didn't hear me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanne\u2019s eyes widen, and looks away in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so sorry Morgan, those hexes interfered with my senses. Had I known, I would have protected you Morgan, wait a minute, did you get stuck to my foot as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, I was. I couldn't yell with all the fur in my mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's what made my foot itch! Could have sworn I sensed something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry about it Panne! It was actually pretty soft and nice to be under your foot at least!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanne blushes a little and smiles at the miniature tactician. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you DO like my feet Morgan! You purposefully got stepped on to get near my furry feet, didn't you? Is this shrinking thing a means to get closer to the feet of the females in our army? I didn't know humans could be so\u2026 optimistic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan immediately knew that came out wrong entirely. \u201cN-no, I mean sure your feet are nice and comfy under there. But I meant that as in if it were someone else it would-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh so you ONLY like my feet Morgan? Do Taguel feet attract you? I'm actually a bit interested now.\u201d  Panne sits back up and leans back, then begins to slowly slide her feet close up to Morgan, revealing her furry bare soles to the blushed tactician. The Taguel lays her soles on their side, wiggling her toes more often, while stroking along her right foot with her fingers as a way to induce Morgan to touch it. She smiles at the boy and licks her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to feel them Morgan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stares at the soles of the Taguel, freshly cleaned and still possessing a pleasant scent. Morgan begins to think this through, knowing how perfect the Taguel\u2019s soles really felt while still a bit frightened after being dragged around like a powerless smushed insect. Morgan reaches out one hand to feel her right sole, embarrassed to do so. Morgan\u2019s hand is frozen in place, refusing to touch the colossal sole in front of him. Panne looks over her foot and frowns at the shrunken tactician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that really it? How boring. You went out of your way just to potentially die beneath me and now you're afraid to touch my foot? I'm honestly a bit disappointed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPanne I don't have a thing for your feet! I just think that-Mmmmpphh\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanne takes her fingers and presses Morgan right into her sole, muffling the rest of his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush now child. If you really want to praise my feet, you should at least do it properly Morgan. I am the last Taguel after all, little one.\u201d<br>\r\nMorgan, pressed up against Panne\u2019s foot again, sighs and just accepts doing Panne\u2019s bidding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan remained on her sole, he actually began to enjoy the feeling of Panne\u2019s smooth relaxing foot. Without the harmful strolling, there weren't any negatives to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, this isn't half bad\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan then latches himself onto Panne\u2019s upper foot section, closer to her wiggling toes that gently pat Morgan\u2019s head. Morgan even grasped Panne\u2019s middle toe to kiss and rest his head on. It was the coziest thing Morgan had ever laid on, he was just about as snug as a bug in a rug (almost literally!). Who knew a foot could make such a perfect mattress! Panne soon feels the sensation of Morgan cuddling the Taguel\u2019s foot, both enjoying every moment of it. When she feels the boy give her toe a kiss, she lets out a playful giggle and blushes. Panne lifts up her foot closer to her face only to see the small boy curled up against the delightful Taguel foot cushion as if he were about to fall into a deep slumber. Panne smiles at the pleased tactician and winks at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee Morgan? Now wasn't that enjoyable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I do love how soft your feet are Panne. They're quite lovely to lay on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou even kissed my toe too you naughty boy! You so DO have a thing for feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh, I guess I do now. But only for yours Panne, I love feeling the soft fuzzy fur on your soles! I guess this a newly developed attraction now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, aww you adorable little thing\u2026 Morgan what's wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night starts to get cooler and the air begins to pick up a bit more. Morgan begins to shiver and chatter his teeth rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I'm just a freezing is all, I can't stay warm as easily in this size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanne ponders for a bit, scratching her chin as she attempts to solve this problem. She then moves her foot back towards the end of the bed right next to her other foot. The Taguel starts to sandwich her soles together in order to make a bed for Morgan. The tactician has his head sticking out from the crease between Panne\u2019s big toe and her second toe so the boy has a way to breath. Morgan smiles and blushes between Panne\u2019s feet, surrounded by the sweet aroma of Panne\u2019s foot scent along with the warmth and comfort from Panne\u2019s furry sole. He wraps his arms around Panne\u2019s big toe to hold it close for his head to rest on and burrow his head deep within it. Panne leans over her feet and looks at the cozy tactician in between her furry feet and bends over to kiss the tacticians tiny head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleep well Morgan\u201d Panne whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blows out the nearby candles and eventually falls asleep. Morgan, surrounded by nothing by fuzzy comfort and a lovely scent, is lulled to sleep by all the heavenly factors laid before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Morgan wakes up to\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dang, that was probably the best bed I ever slept on! Who knew a Taguel foot could be so comfortable! I should do that again sometime! Hmm, but now where have I found myself at this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan turns around to see his gigantic mother looking down at him with a bit of an annoyed look. She was tapping her fingers on the desk repeatedly, as if she was bored out of her mind. Her nails looked freshly manicured and black, likely part of the deal she made with Tharja. She begins to frown at her tiny son and takes a deep breath. Morgan knew he was in for quite the lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere have you been Morgan!? I've been worried sick about you!! Do you realize how dangerous it was to go out there alone! It was nice of Panne to care for you, but she could have squished you for Naga's sake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother, I'm sorry! I woke up on the floor after your toes knocked me out and Panne walked in and didn't see me! I tried to call out to her, but she stepped on me and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe stepped on you!!! Oh Gods! Thank Naga for Tharja\u2019s hex!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what hex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, Tharja performed this hex on you that fixed up your injuries and made you invincible. Had she not, Panne could have easily made you a\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin pauses in horror at the thought of Morgan being turned into a blood splat beneath someone's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother really, it's all ok! If anything, I'm kinda glad Panne stepped on me. Her feet were so nice and soft and her soles were heavenly to sleep on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stares at her tiny son confused at the statement he had just said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute, you liked being stepped on Morgan? Huh, guess that explains why I found you between Panne\u2019s feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! Mother I didn't enjoy it at all! Well I kinda did but it\u2019s just her feet were\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorgan darling\u2026 Do you have a foot fetish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blushes in embarrassment at his mother\u2019s sentence <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! That's not what I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, it all makes sense now! Running around near your sister\u2019s boots and shocking her bare foot, jumping down into my boot while I slept, getting Panne to step on you and sleeping between her feet, Morgan darling it's pretty obvious. You've gone out of your way and risk your life to get near female feet, that's insane! Yet intriguing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nRobin smiles a bit at the idea of his shrunken son\u2019s affection. She leans her face in closer to her tiny son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with all these reckless actions in mind, I think that as your mother you need to be punished Morgan. And I think that I have the perfect idea to handle this problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin takes her hands off the desk to reach for her boot and rests it on the desk right next to Morgan. The impact makes Morgan fall flat on his back, and is a bit terrified of his mother\u2019s plans now. Robin slowly removes her boot in front of her son and places her barefoot back onto the floor. Morgan can smell a moderate stench coming from the boot, enough for Morgan to clench his nostrils shut. Robin grabs her son and holds him close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince Tharja made you invincible and your silly actions will never cease, I think it's a great punishment to make you spend with your mother\u2019s feet. After all, it is what you want honey! Don't deny it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what!? Mother you can't be serious! All of these events are just coincidences! I don't really have an attraction to feet! Please don't do this mother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat blush of yours isn't helping your case darling! Now hopefully you'll learn something from all of this! Maybe I'll even cute your weird attraction. Well honey, down you go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin drops Morgan down into her boot and lifts the boot back into the air. Morgan falls to the heel section of the boot, surrounded by an enclosed prison of sweat and stench. Morgan tries to run out of the boot, but suddenly Robin slides her foot into the boot and Morgan gets pushed deeper into the boot between his mother\u2019s toes. Robin\u2019s toenails were also pedicured and painted black, courtesy of Tharja. Eventually, the foot reached the toe section, and Morgan was trapped between his mother\u2019s two middle toes. He squirms vigorously to escape the fleshy shackles, but Robin feels her tiny son between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhahaha, honey you're making me ticklish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin scrunches her toes up a few times to push her struggling son down beneath the bottom of her foot, right about the middle of the ball of her sole. Robin\u2019s foot was quite nothing like Panne\u2019s foot, while there was no fur there was just sweaty flesh but was at least comfortable and soft from Tharja\u2019s foot treatment. She taps her foot a few times, pressing her son deep within her foot flesh clogging his face with the taste of sweat and foot stench to secure him beneath her foot. Robin giggles at the strange fun she is having with her son. Suddenly, Chrom appears behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin! I'm back from Valm. Say\u2019Ri\u2019s rule seems to be going quite well as the new ruler of\u2026 What are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin quickly stands up to cover up her act, further pressing her son deep into her sole to keep him quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing Chrom! I was just talking to myself is all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then\u2026 Well I won't be here for very long. I'll need to head to Regna Ferox to discuss the tournament festival happening there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBusy busy busy! You just always are my sweet exalt! Leaving me to run the army for you!\u201d Robin says walking towards her husband, crushing her bug sized son with each step she takes. Robin wraps her arms around her husband\u2019s neck and looks up into his eyes<br>\r\n\u201cBut I suppose it is all for the good of the world. To maintain a stable peaceful world so we all can be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin can hear Morgan\u2019s muffled yells from her boot again, and retaliates by boosting herself up to her husband\u2019s face by elevating  her toes, kissing him. Meanwhile, Morgan faces immense pressure from his mother giving his father a little sugar. She lets off her son as she can imagine the immense pain he\u2019s feeling and watches as her husband departs from the camp. Robin walks back into her tent and removes her boot and lifts up her foot to see her tiny son immediately jump off the foot and cough heavily from the lack of air. Morgan begins to walk away but his mother seizes her son beneath her big toe to hold his son in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow where are you headed off to young man? You\u2019re just getting started! Now hold on a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin reaches for something beneath the desk, and grabs her son between her fingers and drops him in...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just who I wanted to see.\" Robin's voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh gods, not her</i>, Morgan thought. Try as he might to escape his confines, the slope of the heel was too great for him to scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and Tharja looked down the heel towards their tiny plaything. The sight of the two colossal women bearing down on him froze Morgan up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks to be having fun in there.\" Tharja taunted, giggling as Morgan cowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must be in heaven right now.\" Robin added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we make it even better for him?\" Tharja beckoned Robin as she moved towards her cot, and took a seat. Robin followed, seemingly hypnotised by the dour woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja presented her bare foot to Robin, who dropped to one knee before it. \"Have fun in there, Morgan.\" Robin said as she slid the heel onto Tharja's waiting foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the heel, Morgan's jaw dropped as he watched Tharja's massive toes move towards him. With nowhere to run, he found himself pinned firmly beneath her big toe, which dwarfed him greatly. The pressure on his body grew and Tharja rose from her seat and stood, placing every bit of her weight on the tiny boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja tapped her toes on the ground, enjoying her captive's struggles. Satisfied, she strutted around the tent, putting more pressure on the steps with Morgan underneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin watched Tharja as she moved, but her eyes were always drawn to the foot which housed her son. \"How does he feel down there?\" Robin inquired, with a tint of yearning in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful...\" Tharja answered, giving Morgan another press into her sole. \"Now, if you'll follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin followed, entranced by the sorceress and forced to obey.

Through the coat's fabric, he could hear his Mother above him moving books and flipping pages, desperate for a solution to his shrinking problem. In the meantime, Morgan yawned into the darkness, profoundly bored and exhausted after all he's gone through today. With nothing else to do, Morgan got comfortable, and allowed to sleep to finally take him after a long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Boom</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long had Morgan been running? Time had lost meaning. Right now, Morgan knew only two things, fear, and forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Boom</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth trembled. Morgan was nearly knocked off his feet. Just what was he running from? The boy had no idea, only knowing whatever it was, it's 1000 times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Boom</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother titanic footstep echoed. No matter how fast Morgan ran, the sound seemed to get closer every time. How much longer could he run? Morgan despaired to think what would happen if he let his pursuer catch him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Boom</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's feet failed him, and the prince fell flat on his face. Pulling himself from the floor, he scrambled to get back on his feet and resume fleeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BOOM</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound came from directly behind Morgan this time. Whatever he was running from had finally caught him. The terrified boy rolled over onto his back, finally getting a good look at whoever, or whatever, had been chasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lucina, one thousand times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's massive sibling looked down at him with utter apathy written on her face. Despite his fear, Morgan could not bring himself to back away, or even speak. Lucina stepped closer to Morgan, placing her foot only inches from him. Morgan watched in terror as the toe of her boot lifted off the ground and swung in his direction, until it hovered over him. The sky of Lucina's boot descended painfully slowly, until darkness consumed Morgan again, and he was crushed beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan awoke with a start, sweating profusely. He patted his body over, reaffirming he was alive and no longer dreaming, and sighed. Slowly, Morgan's breathing and heart rate slowed back down to reasonable levels. Robin didn't seem to hear him scream, which he was silently thankful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't believe I'm having nightmares about my own sister</i>, Morgan thought to himself. <i>The sooner this shrunken business can be over, the better.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep now out of the question, Morgan passed the time in his mother's pocket by trying to banish the nightmarish images from his mind. The inexorable stomping, Lucina's massive face staring down at him, and being trapped under her boot like a bug...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivered. Being this small was clearly taking it's toll on his psyche. How much longer would he have to be like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Morgan was roused by heavy shaking and jostling, and felt himself be grabbed by a giant hand. Finally, it seemed Robin was letting him out of that claustrophobic space. Robin deposited Morgan onto her desk, who found saw not only his mother, but also Lucina watching over him. Butch to his dismay, Morgan instinctively reeled away from the sight of Lucina's face, the nightmare still fresh in his mind. \"So, did you find something that could help me?\" he asked the two colossal women.</span></div></div>",

He had been terrified that the impact would kill him, as he had fallen from such a height that there was nothing he could do to slow himself down. Fortunately for him, the stomach was spongy enough that he was not hurt when he landed, only winded, and he bounced up and down on the spongy flesh of the stomach floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Morgan was able to pull himself to his feet, he tried to look around him.<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh Gods\u2026 I-I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me!

In all the stories I\u2019ve read there were always mages and other spell casters who learned how to cast magic without needing a tome to focus their power through! I can try to do that to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was indeed able to channel his magic without a tome or staff, but there was one problem with his line of thinking; having no experience with such an advanced arcane art meant that he had no idea how his magic would affect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot knowing what could happen is a problem, but at this point I have nothing to lose. And besides, it might be something really helpful, like teleportation, or a way for me to communicate with Sis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan closed his eyes and began to channel his magic through his body. A faint aura surrounded him, illuminating the stomach ever so slightly.

Morgan wasn\u2019t feeling so hopeful now. He really hoped that he hadn\u2019t made a grievous mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic saturating the air in the stomach was doing something, but Morgan wasn\u2019t sure what it was.

Directly in front of his face was a bright pink... bubble, for lack of a better word. Not having the slightest clue as to what it was, he poked it, and immediately regretted it when the bubble popped in his face and sent a light spray of stew broth into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!

Bubbles of magically charged air were appearing into thin air before bursting in vibrant if pungent displays, churning the lake of stew inside the young woman's belly. Morgan was waving his arms in a panic, not sure of what his magic was doing but knowing that it couldn't have been pleasant for his beloved big sis. The churning waves of broth were throwing him around inside his fleshy prison, and he was feeling more than a little nauseous from being thrown to-and-fro so violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrgh! Dammit, stop! Come on, magic! Focus! I didn't want bubbles, I wanted a way out!\" Morgan shouted as another violent wave sent him bouncing off one wall of the large stomach he was currently trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, and as if on cue, the bubbles stopped appearing. Unfortunately, this didn't affect the multitude of colorful orbs that were already in existence inside of Lucina's stomach, and Morgan could only watch in confusion as the bubbles slowly converged. His eyes widened as he saw the bubbles merge into one super-huge bubble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! This one's gonna hurt!\" Morgan yelped, throwing his soaked and dripping arms up in front of his face.

She could swear she heard bubbles popping deep inside of her. And... Oooh, she wasn't feeling good... Her tummy was upset with her, and she had no idea what was causing it's sudden distress. Fearing that she was having a reaction to something she ate, she darted behind the mess tent, not wanting anyone to see her if she had to cough up the recently-eaten stew. She really didn't want to have to throw up her recent meal, and so dithered and dallied for several minutes while the bubbly-feeling persisted in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden, particularly powerful twinge in her belly suddenly made itself known, and Lucina nearly gagged right then and there. Groaning and covered her mouth with one hand, the nauseous girl sank back against the canvas wall of the tent, coming to a seated position.

It was as if he had been caught up in some sort of raging whirlpool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully he was able to recover and swim towards what he thought was the surface. Once his head broke through he greedily began to suck down the stale of his sister's stomach. This was soon followed by him doing his best to wipe his eyes so he could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink walls of Lucina's stomach were pulsing and the broth he was currently submerged in was swaying back and fourth. Then there was the sound the reach his ears, it sounded like groaning. More specifically, Lucina was groaning. It didn't take long for the little tactician in training to put two-and-two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to puke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization filled him with equal parts joy and uneasiness. Joy at the fact that his stay here would not be a permanent one, and uneasiness at the fact that he was essentially going to be freed in a wave of vomit. He too felt bad for his big sister as the bubble fiasco was his fault, but hey, he could always apologize later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he had to do now was wait and soon he'd be free. Nothing could possibly go wrong. At least, that was Morgan hoped. Unfortunately life wasn't that simple... and fate had other plans. A dark shadow consumed the lad, causing him to look up. What he was next would be burned into his brain forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant white ball not unlike a marble was headed his way. Fear filled the boy's heart as he let out the loudest scream he could muster. The white orb made contact with the sea of soup... and Morgan world went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Back On The Outside \u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling any better?\" An all too familiar voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you Anna,\" Lucina said with relief. The queasy feeling that consumed her had began to vanish. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secret seller smiled. \"That my dear princess was what we call a food tablet. They help with both indigestion and queasiness. They're also a great thing to have at buffets and parties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" Lucina said before making to stand. The nauseous feeling was gone now. \"Thank you again. I suppose you'll want payment now, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bluenette was surprised when the redhead shook her head. \"Nah. This one's on the house. Consider it a favor from a friend. Anyway, you be good now. Ta-ta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina continued to stand stationary for another minute as she watched the secret seller disappear around the tent. Once her mind caught up to her again she remembered her mission and again set off for the kitchen tent.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tingling sensation spread all throughout Morgan's body- he could feel it moving through him, from the tips of his ears all the way down to his toes. Everything seemed to be... well, humming wasn't quite the right word, but it sure felt like his body was humming. Thrumming! That was it, he was thrumming with power! Screwing his eyes shut, he did his best to focus despite the sweltering heat around him and the muggy, humid air sticking to him like a second skin. Recalling one of many magic lessons he'd received from his mother, he willed his magic to form in front of him. \"Light without heat,\" his mother had told him, and Morgan was rewarded with a small orb of bright white light, hovering just over his head. <i>Candlelight</i> was a relatively simple spell to cast, and most mages were able to cast it without the use of a focus. Even a relative novice like him was able to cast it, although he'd admit that the orb in front of him wasn't looking too sturdy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. In his current environment having any light at all was a welcome change, not that there was much to look at. With his light ball shedding a faint light on his new \"room,\" he could now tell that Lucina's stomach was quite spacious. There were a few chunks of food floating here and there, leftovers from his sister's recent lunch that were bobbing up and down in the large, deep pool of broth he was currently standing in. While Morgan was feeling a little hungry, his sister's partially chewed soggy leftovers were pretty far up on his list of unappetizing foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd just have to get something to eat when he got out of Lucina's stomach. And he WAS going to get out of Lucina's stomach- he knew it. His earlier attempt at focusless magic had done something, he just hadn't figured out what yet. The only thing that he did know was that he still felt distinctly... fuzzy. Like his body hadn't yet released any of the power he'd stored in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he'd unwittingly created a shield to protect himself from his sister's powerful stomach acids? The stomach was free of gastric acid for the moment, but Morgan really didn't want to stick around long enough to test whether or not he'd \"acid-proofed\" himself. Whatever, for the moment he needed something to take his mind off his current predicament. The fuzzy feeling in his body was starting to get worse, and now it felt like he was building up static electricity. Rubbing at his arms, he tried to soothe the now uncomfortable feeling- he wasn't taking his coat off inside the stomach, but within the sleeves he was sure the sparse, fine hair on his arms was standing on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, Morgan decided that at the very least he could get to dryer land. Trudging through the muck of soggy food, Morgan did his best to keep his footing while he floundered closer to the 'shore.' Progress was slow due to his thick coat absorbing liquid and weighing him down, but he refused to abandon such a precious belonging of his. Before Morgan could tire himself out completely, he spotted a particularly large morsel near the edge of the broth lake. With the last of his strength he was able to clamber up a chunk of broccoli roughly the same size as him and dive face first onto the spongy flesh of Lucina's stomach. The hunk of broccoli teetered before toppling over, splashing Morgan in a revolting spray of dark liquid. Groaning, the boy shuffled back from the huge veggie, lying back on the sloping surface of his sister's stomach. Morgan silently resolved to participate more often in the Shepherd's many fitness programs after this. The white-haired young spell-caster's stamina was just the worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least he'd made it to dry ground. Morgan was soaked, his clothes heavy and sodden, but he'd made it out of Lucina's internal lake. He could focus on rescuing himself now! Well, after he took a quick power nap. Swimming for high ground had tired him out more than he'd thought- his eyes were already feeling heavy. Morgan wasn't comfortable by any means, but his exhaustion mixed with the faint, soothing heartbeat of his beloved big sis were more than enough to lull him to sleep right now. Closing his eyes, he allowed his head to fall back on the damp, spongy flesh. He was out like a light within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blinked faintly, disoriented by the total darkness surrounding him. Not sure where he was, he called up another unsteady ball of light, his previous one must have dispelled when he fell asleep in... Lucina's stomach! He was still in Lucina's stomach! Crap. He'd really hoped that was just a terrible fever dream and that his sister hadn't eaten him, and that he was devising some horrible prank with Auntie Lissa to get back at Severa for being a jerk. He wasn't sure how long he'd been asleep for, but an outside observer would know that approximately 3 hours had passed since Lucina had unknowingly swallowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his eyesight returned to normal, Morgan squinted in confusion. Something had definitely changed in Lucina's stomach- he couldn't spot the familiar chunks of food dotting the broth pond in her belly anywhere. There were plenty of similar looking morsels, but they were all way smaller. No way they were the same. Maybe he'd slept too long, and was looking at Lucina's dinner, the girl having already digested the previous inanimate occupants of her belly. Morgan was relieved to know that his attempt at magic earlier seemed to have paid off- he was still fuzzy all over but it looked like the magic had shielded him from the harmful elements of the stomach. The only thing that seemed strange was that bit of broccoli at his feet... It didn't just look similar to the huge chunk from earlier, it was even in the exact same place as the previous one! The only difference was that it was only a third of the size of...the... wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't just look like the broccoli from earlier, it WAS the broccoli from earlier! All of the morsels down in the broth pond? The same food from earlier. Only, now everything had been downsized. Morgan gulped, feeling panic creeping into him. A cold sweat dripped down his back, and his heartbeat thudded in his ears. There was no doubt about what his magic had done now- The hunk of broccoli that he'd had to climb over earlier, a hunk that had been roughly equal to him in height, was now small enough for him to sit on. It was barely a third of his size, if that. Morgan put his head in his hands, tears pricking at his eyes. By his own estimations, he was roughly three times the size he'd been when he'd first entered Lucina's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get out of Lucina, and fast. Dark was the idea of himself being painfully crushed and suffocated by the walls of his sister's stomach when he finally ran out of empty space to grow in, but even more terrifying was the opposite idea that he might violently explode out of Lucina if her stomach did not hamper his return to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Morgan attempts to force his way up Lucina's throat! But what if he's too big to fit through the sphincter?<br>\r\n2) Morgan doesn't want to try going out of Lucina's body either of the normal way. His best bet is to cause a ruckus in Lucina's belly and alert people to his presence. Lucina would freak out at feeling something alive inside of her, but at least people would know something was wrong inside of her.<br>\r\n3) Morgan can't think of anything to do, and the POV shifts to Lucina, who is looking for her brother. Its strange, he usually doesn't disappear like this... </span></div></div>",

This time, Luci and I will be extra careful with you.\" Lucina nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa lowered her hand and deposited Morgan on a nearby desk. The prince craned his neck upward and saw his monolithic sister and aunt smiling down at him, like goddesses in the heavens. Morgan knew their grins belied their intentions, this would not be enjoyable for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of bringing their tiny plaything back to normal had almost completely disappeared from the young women's minds. Lissa pulled two chairs from the edges of her tent over to the desk, and she and Lucina took a seat in front of the scared princeling. The perfectly flat surface left nothing to hide behind, and getting down to the floor was not something Morgan could do alone without breaking half the bones in his tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women watching him knew he was now completely at their mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina turned to address her aunt, \"So Lissa, how are we going to teach our little man here some sportsmanship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa smirked evilly down at her nephew, Morgan gulped in anticipation. \"I have a few ideas, how about we...\" Lissa brought Lucina's head close and briefly whispered a few words in her ear. Lucina's eyes lit up at whatever it was Lissa had shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it, then?\" Lucina questioned. Lissa nodded, and they both bent down under the table, and out of Morgan's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan wondered just what they were doing, but was nearly paralyzed with fear of what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would not stay wondering long, however. Soon after, the two women sat back up in their seats and slid them backwards slightly. With little fanfare, they both raised their now-bare feet and rested them on the table with Morgan, who could not believe his eyes. Lissa gave her toes a small wiggle, enjoying the feeling of the air against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Morgan,\" Lissa decreed down to her nephew. \"as punishment for cheating at our friendly little game, you're going to give Luci and I a little foot massage.\" Lucina giggled at the irony of Lissa's choice of the word \"Little\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stared in disbelief at the four walls of flesh in front of him. His own family couldn't actually expect him to do this, could they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Morgan, this won't be so bad. Here, let me make it easier for you.\" Lucina raised her right foot above Morgan's head, the flawless white surface blocking out the sky from the boy's perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, No! Don-\" The foot slowly lowered until Morgan was pinned underneath it, somewhat uncomfortably, but not painfully. Morgan could hear Lissa laughing out loud at his plight, muffled by his plush prison. With no options left, Morgan submitted and began rubbing his colossal sister's sole. Lucina giggled, feeling her brother's tiny hands work her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan remained under Lucina's sole for what seemed to him like forever, massaging it as best he could the whole time. Eventually, Lucina decided that was enough, and removed her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Morgan, now do the other one.\" Lucina grabbed Morgan between her toes and carried him over to the opposite foot. With no resistance this time, he got to work caressing it's plush surface. Lucina moaned gently, enjoying the feeling of ten tiny fingers on her massive instep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, Lissa became impatient. She wiggled her toes and looked on enviously as her niece got what seemed like the best foot rub of her lifetime. Eventually, Lissa decided enough was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Luci, you've had enough. Now it's my turn!\" Lissa took her nephew between her toes and let him get to work. Lucina pouted and crossed her arms. Lissa giggled and fidgeted near constantly as Morgan worked her sole. She was severely ticklish, it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good hour or so of Morgan's treatment, the girls removed their feet and beamed down at their little friend. Morgan was humiliated beyond belief of what he was just made to do, but at least it seemed to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that wasn't so bad, was it, Morgan?\" Lucina rolled her foot from side to side, as if to wave hello to her tiny brother. Morgan didn't bother to give an answer, and only glared at the giant foot. \"Or maybe you want to rub them a little more?\" The blue-haired goddess teased, giving her toes a wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lucina, think our little friend here has learned his lesson?\" Lissa looked to her for an answer. Morgan braced himself for the worse, cursing his aunt for putting this idea of punishment into his sister's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not quite. I think he could use one more punishment, just to be sure he gets the idea.\" Lucina put her boots back on and stood up to her full monolithic height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what kind of punishment are you thinking of?\" Lissa leaned back in her chair and stretched her legs out. Lucina reached down and took her little brother between two fingers. She held him up to eye level and smiled at him. \"I know exactly what to do now.\" she said, as she lowered the boy towards her...</span></div></div>",

Morgan, through resisting and resigned to his fate, turned his gaze downward as he watched the floor come closer, dreading what punishment his sister could have in store for him next. Rather then drop her brother on the ground, however, Lucina gently deposited him in the middle of the seat of the chair she was sitting in. As Morgan lay on the hard wooden surface, Lucina knelt down to bring her eyes to be level with the seat. Morgan stood and turned his gaze to see the massive blue eyes of his sibling watching his every movement. He took a step back in shock, eliciting a giggle from his captress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina's voice piped up. \"Now Morgan, don't be scared. I'm doing this to teach you a lesson.\" She said, rising from her knees back to her full height. She turned 180 degrees on the spot, turning her back to Morgan. The boy looked up at her to see her massive backside looming over him. Morgan blushed and looked away by instinct, but when it occurred to him just what Lucina intended to do, the red in his cheeks turned pale. He looked up, paralyzed with fear as Lucina slowly lowered her rear end back onto the chair, with her brother still on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked around him desperately for somewhere to escape from the wrath of his sister. She seemed to be giving him plenty of time to deliberate his fate. Still, however, there would be no escape for Morgan except a very risky jump from his perch to the ground, a risk he was not willing to take, even in the face of the punishment Lucina had decided for him. Lucina's ever-lowering bottom cut off Morgan's headspace and knocked him on his back, until finally finishing it's descent and settling in the chair, compressing Morgan's tiny body into the hard wooden surface. Morgan struggled briefly under Lucina's titanic posterior, but her weight proved too much for the tiny boy's strength to do so much as budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina twisted her body to get comfortable, nearly grinding her brother to dust beneath herself in the process. The princess' behind was toned and firm from her experience on the battlefield, but still soft enough as to not completely crush the tiny boy trapped beneath it. She let out a long sigh as she grew accustomed to the feeling of having a tiny person under you. Lucina felt as though this may be too harsh a punishment, and that she shouldn't be doing this to her own little brother. <i>He needs to learn this lesson</i>, she rationalized to herself. <i>This is for his own good, and I'm sure he'll be fine</i>. Lucina grinned to herself, <i>Not to mention, teaching lessons like this feels... kind of good, actually</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina delighted in teaching this lesson and let her head swim with ideas as to how she could further \"educate\" her sibling. She could pressure him with her foot like she was currently with her butt. She could hold him in her palm and use one finger to toy with him to her heart's content. She could simply drop him into her breast pocket and carry him with her for a day. Or, she could slide his tiny frame between her lips and use her massive tongue to tease him. Lucina shivered to think of such things, confused as to why this was exciting her so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Morgan was still having a thoroughly terrible time pinned beneath his sister's backside. Oxygen was getting scarce, and breathing was becoming more and more difficult. Despite his furious rebellion against the titanic body of his mistress, Lucina had felt nothing from beneath her minus some very faint tickling sensation. Exhausted and broken after what seemed like an eternity of servitude to his sister and aunt, Morgan felt his mind fading, and eventually black out, surrounded by the soft warmth of his sister's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Morgan's eyes fluttered open. When he regained his senses, Morgan recognized the soft ground beneath him as a human palm. A feminine voice rang from far above him, \"Good, you're finally awake\". Morgan looked towards the source of the voice, finding it to belong to...</span></div></div>",

Gradually, Morgan began to make out the long blue hair and girlish face of the figure, and realised them to be Lucina. She stared down at her minuscule brother, still smiling. It was the same smile she had worn during the game of hide and seek, and while Morgan was rubbing her feet, and right before she had sat down on him. Remembering the harrowing events that had just transpired, Morgan suddenly became aware of how sore he was across his entire body. He held his aching body and shivered, wishing to forget what had happened to him at the hands of his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up on how distraught the little man was, Lucina took her free hand and gently stroked Morgan's head with one finger. Normally, such a gesture would calm him right down, but after what Lucina had done, Morgan was in no mood to forgive. Despite his soreness, Morgan gave his best effort to reject his sister's care and beat back the fingertip, only for Lucina to retaliate by knocking him over onto his back. \"Morgan, don't be like that. The punishment is over, you're safe now.\" Morgan was not ready to accept her after everything. \"Like hell it's over! You could have killed me!\" Lucina was taken aback. \"Do you really think I would be so careless? You were never in any danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was not convinced. \"Do you have any idea what you put me through? All this has been hell to me! What am I to you now, just a possession?!\" Morgan's rage had climaxed. \"I wake up like this and suddenly everyone in camp has gone completely crazy! I can't go a minute without someone trying to play a crazy game with me, or experiment on me, or SIT ON ME!\" The small boy raised his voice higher than even he thought it could go. \"Even you, my own sister, can't just let me be! Why can't I just get away from all this?!\" Morgan's rage subsided, and the boy breathed heavily, letting what he'd just said sink into his giant sister's brain. Lucina was stricken, she had very rarely heard Morgan raise his voice like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood in silence for a brief moment, until Morgan spoke up again, his voice significantly calmer this time. \"Look, could you just take me back to my tent? I need to sleep all this off, then maybe we can forget about it all and find a way to bring me back to normal.\" Morgan stared up at his sister, who still stood mostly still. \"Sis? Come on, please? No more of this.\" Lucina wore a hard-to-read expression, she seemed to be either seething with anger at Morgan's outburst, or struggling with remorse over what she did.</span></div></div>",

Instead, she curled the fingers of her hand into a fist around the boy, and her expression turned sour. Morgan was caught in his sister's grasp, with only his head poking outside of her massive fist. He looked up towards Lucina's face to see her scowling down at him. \"Lucina, what's going on? Why a- GAK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina tightened her grip on the boy, cutting off his voice as well as the blood circulation to his arms. \"I can't believe you!\" She spat. Her voice was subdued, but noticably bitter. Morgan feared his little outburst had had the inverse effect he had hoped for. \"You would accuse me and everyone else of trying to harm you? You cheated at a simple game, so aunt Lissa and I punished you. You brought that fate upon yourself.\" Lucina brought her captive up to face level, still gripping him uncomfortably hard. Morgan struggled to free himself, but found Lucina's long, feminine fingers to be stronger than him. \"Maybe I didn't get the message across with your first round of punishment.\" Lucina grinned evilly, giving her brother a fine view of her ivory teeth. Morgan shuddered, fearing another round of his sister's indignation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up on Morgan's fear, Lucina brought her hands together and let her brother fall into her open palm. She covered the hand containing Morgan with the other, created a shelter which shrouded the boy in darkness. With her tiny captive safe in her grasp, Lucina redoubled her pace towards her empty tent. Morgan could feel the shaking of Lucina's footsteps, aware of movement but completely oblivious to where she could be taking him. Upon finally reaching her own tent, Lucina pushed the flap open with a shoulder, stepped inside, and sat down on the side of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina opened her cupped hands and allowed the candlelight shining in her room to illuminate Morgan. He raised his arm to shield his eyes from the sudden light. Lucina stared down at him, the rage still burning in her gut. \"Clearly, you still need to be taught to respect your elders, Morgan.\" the titaness said, her voice dripping with apathy for the tiny figure in her hands. \"Thankfully for you, big sister is always willing to teach another lesson.\" Lucina giggled, nearly driving herself crazy thinking of new ways to punish her little brother. Morgan stared wide-eyed up at his sister's smiling face, unable to believe his own sister would do something like this to him not once, but twice. \"Lucina, sis, please...\" he begged, voice trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh, Morgan. We all learn harsh lessons now and then,\" Lucina said, licking her lips in anticipation. \"and this is just one of yours.\" With that, Lucina began raising her hands up from her lap towards her face, Morgan along with them. She held Morgan level with her mouth, smiling wide enough to give the little boy a fine view of hew ivory front row of teeth. Morgan backed away from his sister's plush lips, but soon found himself unable to do so, as the platform of Lucina's hands slanted upward, leaving him to slide closer to her waiting maw. Morgan screamed and clawed desperately at the massive palm for a foothold to keep himself from falling, to no avail. Lucina parted her hungry lips and let Morgan slide inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan fell onto Lucina's waiting tongue with a soft impact. Immediately, the hot breath of the princess washed over him like a small hurricane and he found himself dampened with Lucin'a saliva. Lucina closed her mouth, leaving Morgan in complete darkness, surrounded by her rows of teeth and at the mercy of her massive tongue. A wave of ecstasy rolled through Lucina's body as she used her tongue to toy with her panicked brother. The massive muscle rolled Morgan like waves in a raging sea, forcing him to the roof of her mouth and pinning him to the wall of her soft cheeks freely. For the next hour, Lucina sat in her tent reading quietly, her brother wrestling with her gargantuan tongue all the while. Occasionally, Lucina would open her mouth wide and tease Morgan with a chance of freedom, only to rob it from him by pushing him back into the moist cavern to begin her punishment anew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the candles burning in Lucina's tent grew more and more melted, she finally decided Morgan had had enough. She opened her mouth one final time and reached two fingers inside to grab her little brother and bring him out into the light once again. Morgan was unresponsive, shivering and breathing shakily, but other than that was perfectly fine. Lucina smiled, and left him on the edge of her bed began to strip her clothing off of her. Soon, Lucina was wearing nothing at all, sitting on her bed next to her brother. When Morgan began to stir once more, Lucina spoke down to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, sleepyhead. I hope we've learned our lesson now.\" Lucina smiled her iconic smile, but Morgan did not respond. He didn't even appear to notice his gigantic sister was sitting, nude, directly in front of him. Lucina scooped the boy up into her hand and brought her legs up onto the bed. She lay on her back and lay Morgan back down on her chest. Morgan rose and fell rhythmically with Lucina's breathing, and could feel her heartbeat through the soft skin.  \"Sleep tight, now. You and I are going to have plenty of fun tomorrow. And no punishments, this time.\" Lucina yawned and reached for her quilt laying in a heap next to her. \"Well, unless you earn it, that is.\" Lucina winked down at her brother, now moving, but still otherwise unresponsive. Lucina pulled the quilt up over her shoulders for comfort, and gently held Morgan to her chest with both hands. Slowly, they both drifted off to sleep, after a long day of games and punishments. </span></div></div>",

As she left, her she spoke to another visitor, unseen to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's all yours, Anna.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded merchant walked in with a spring in her step. Anna trotted over to the seat on which Morgan was situated, eyes locked on him the whole time. Morgan stared up at the woman and saw her wearing the same sadistic look his mother bore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna bent over with her hands on her knees, eclipsing Morgan in her shadow and letting him soak in the size difference between the two of them. \"Hey there, cutie.\" Anna teased, and winked at the minuscule boy. \"While you were napping, your sister told us all about the fun you had together.\" Morgan shuddered at her words. \"We thought if you went to the trouble to shrink yourself just to spend time with the women at camp, we could indulge your little...fixation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Anna continued, \"a number of women here have volunteered to sit on you, like you wanted.\" Morgan could not believe what he was hearing. \"Anna, please, no! I don't-\" Morgan's plead for mercy was cut off when the giantess spoke. \"Hush now, Morgan. We all have our fetishes, there's no shame in it.\" Anna brought her knees to the ground, so as to bring her face closer to the boy. Her massive red eyes observed Morgan's every tiny movement like a goddess from the heavens, still smiling as she was when she first appeared. \"It's perfectly natural to want to explore your own, shall we say, interests.\" Anna's own strange euphemism, combined with Morgan's clearly horrified reaction, brought her to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, there is no need to frighten. I promise to be extra gentle.\" Anna stood back up to her full height, towering over Morgan as she turned about-face to present her rear end to him. \"After all, I want you to enjoy this just as much as I do.\" the merchant declared, shaking her hips as she lowered herself onto the chair, and Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Morgan felt the all-too familiar pressure of being sat on. Beneath Anna's left cheek, the fabric of her trickster outfit combined with the softness of her rear created an inescapable prison. A thousand leagues of pressure assaulted every inch of Morgan's body, compressing him to fit the folds of Anna's posterior. For the second time, Morgan screamed for mercy into the butt of his captress, and for the second time, his voice reached their ears as nothing but mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna got comfortable on top of Morgan, crossing her legs and examining her fingernails. \"Consider yourself lucky, little guy. Normally, I might charge for this kind of privilege.\" Anna ground her ass further into the chair, twisting Morgan's body into her flesh. \"But for my favorite tactician-in-training, I'd gladly do it for free.\" Anna laughed, shaking her body and creating greater discomfort for Morgan. The tiny boy's head swam with the sensations of Anna's behind, the pressure of her weight, the softness of her clothes, and the warmth of her body. Morgan silently admitted to himself that the second time was much less awful than the first, owing to Anna's softer rear end and gentler disposition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my time is up.\" Anna piped up, lifting the pressure off of Morgan as she stood. \"Now, don't fret, boy. There are still plenty of women who want a piece of you.\" Morgan sighed, knowing his respite would be brief. \"We all agreed to service you in shifts, so you can have fun with all of us.\" With a swing in her hips, Anna went the way of Robin and left Morgan alone upon the seat of the chair. Quickly after, another woman of the Shepherds entered, eager to take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Morgan needs help' like a switch the anger was gone and Noire was her meek normal self, Lucina currently on her knees trying to catch her breath<br>\r\n'What happened to Morgan?' Noire asked hopping from foot to foot nervously and Lucina was already beginning to regret asking her: the white haired girl inherited many things from her crazy mother, her figure and obsessions (thought in her case for Morgan, as Robin is pretty much her surrogate mother) were the most noticeable to the princess, it was lucky Noire was so meek otherwise she'd have potioned Morgan ages ago and taken her brother for herself (As Tharja had tried some time before Robin &amp; Chrom's marriage). Deciding she was here already so there was no point running she was about to show her the shrunken Morgan ... until she realised she didn't have him, he'd been in her hand but after the blur of purple, white and green he was gone, immediately losing track of him. <br>\r\nLucina bounced onto her feet scanning the area around her 'he's around' she said flatly, again noticing Noire's complete change in personality upon hearing that: she began fiddling with her hair, straightening her headband and pushing her breasts up to enhance the already astounding cleavage the sniper's practice armour created. It was this action that caught Lucina's attention, or more so the fact she saw Morgan for a moment before the tactician was engulfed by the archer's breasts. She needed to get him out and fix this situation 'Noire stop!' Lucina yelled grabbing her arms and pulling them to her sides 'Morgan was shrunk, we came to you to ask for help because we think it was a curse or a hex' 'Okay but where is he?' Noire asked her eyes darting around her in a similar manner to Lucina a few moments prior 'When we came over to you he was in my hand, but after the incident between us, he's... <i><u>in your cleavage</u></i>'' Lucina mumbled the last 3 words but Noire still heard them and blushed like her face had been lit on fire.<br>\r\nNoire looked down at her large breasts, disappointed not to see Morgan, but remembering she'd just been fiddling with them it was understandable 'Morgan, he's... do you think he likes it in there?' Noire asked meekly getting an eye roll from Lucina 'Honestly, he's a boy and they're tits, he's practically in heaven' she deadpanned taking a joke at the little guy's expense was worth it... until she was once again introduced to the tree, Noire pinning her with her assets pressed against her A cups <b>''This is not a joke! Morgan isn't some perv like Inigo and Owain, he's kind, smart and oh so super sexy'' </b>''Okay Jeez I was trying to lighten the mood, Morgan fucking loves you, you could have mosquito bites like me and he'd still love you'' Lucina sighs 'Look if you don't want to help fine but Morgan chose you' before the archer could speak Lucina had stuck her hand down her near skin-tight clothing, pulling a ruffled and blushing but happy Morgan from between Noire's breasts.<br>\r\nHe was then plucked from her grasp and brought to eye line with Noire ''Is it true Morgan? Not the shrinking thing I can clearly see it's true but the other things, do you love me? did you really chose me to help you? Was it because of me or simply because I'm not mother?' Morgan sat down in Noire's palms, his small hands running circles into her skin ''Yes Noire I love you, I chose you because you're the best I know and I trust you, and if you think talking to your mother will help change me back I'll do it as long as you're with me the entire time' he answered his smile being returned in stereo from her much larger face. 'Oh Morgan' Noire cried before pulling him closer and enveloping his head between her plump lips in a deep kiss. When the 2 parted with a wet pop Noire was blushing and Morgan's hair was so wet it lay flat against his skin but he had the biggest dopey grin on his little face. Their cutesy moment was interrupted by a cough from Lucina ''Okay lovebirds, time to see what's wrong with my brother'<br>\r\nNoire sighed and sat down with Morgan on her lap as she retrieved a tome from her cloak's inner pocket, not many people knew she was a dark mage like her parents, she mostly refrained from using it, but it came in handy whenever she was backed into a corner. The book in question was too weak to use in battle but was perfect for her needs: drawing her magic out enough for her to manipulate for her own ends, in this case a basic scan of any dark residue on Morgan from a curse or hex.<br>\r\n'So do you have the answer?' Lucina asked after 10 minutes or mildly awkward silence to which Noire sighed lightly and answered...</span></div></div>",

Luckily, Morgan's father Robin only brought a small core group of Shepherds  Unlike their other missions, no lives were at stake.

Eventually, the father and daughter broke off from the rest, going down a path of there own while the others fought off the hordes of enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin studied the map of the catacombs, nonchalantly hitting incoming revenants with bolts of Thoron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan kept at her father's side, fighting enemies along the way until they broke into an altar room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this it?\" Morgan asked, almost half disappointed.

It was clear now why Robin wanted his hands on this book. Morgan turned another page, and found herself deeply fascinated at the new spell she had uncovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Object &amp; Lifeform Minimization</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an awful lot of words for 'Shrinking spell'.\" Morgan said to herself. Eager and curious, Morgan reached down at grabbed a small stone off the ground of her tent. The words in the ancient text alight as Morgan muttered the incantation. A flash of white light engulfed the stone, forcing Morgan to avert her eyes. When it subsided, the stone had shrunken to roughly 1/4 of it's original size. The once palm-sized rock was now but a pebble. Delighted that the spell worked, Morgan cast the pebble aside and eyed up the tome once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan read the text for the shrinking spell once more. \"This one could be fun. So many possibilities...\" She held her chin and stared into the book, pondering applications for this promising spell, both playful and practical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea crept slowly into Morgan's mind. The spell did say \"Object AND Lifeform\", does that mean it would work on people? Morgan smiled mischievously as she imagined shrinking one of her fellow shepherds. A test of the spell's capabilities would be necessary, but who would agree to being shrunken like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do they have to agree to it...?\" Morgan chuckled evilly. A surprise shrinking, a prank for the history books! The idea was becoming more and more appealing. Without pause, Morgan tucked the tome into her coat and walked out of her tent, into the sunlight. Who would be her test subject for this new spell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, Morgan pushed the flap of her father's tent aside. Robin was sitting at his desk, fixated on a tactical board, like he usually is. He didn't even notice anyone peek inside. Grateful for her father's intense focus, Morgan stepped fully inside and turned her tome to the appropriate page. The words on the page glowed softly, and Morgan chanted the familiar phrases. At the last possible moment before the spell cast, Morgan called out to Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, father!\" Robin turned to see his daughter, grinning evilly with her hand outstretched toward him. The sight didn't last long before the spell discharged, and the same white light engulfed Robin, forcing both parties to shield their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded, Morgan saw her very confused father, standing level with her knees. The now tiny Robin frantically examined himself, thankfully finding no physical harm to his self or clothing. The tactician craned his neck upward, meeting eyes with his daughter. \"Morgan! What in Naga's name did you just do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan laughed. \"It's a spell I found in that tome you passed on to me. Like it?\" The girl bent down and rested on her knees, bringing her father's face closer to eye-level, but still standing taller than him. \"You would not believe the amazing spells in here!\" Morgan patted the cover of the tome with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful, Morgan, but this is not funny.\" Robin tried to be stern with him daughter, but Morgan could only giggle at her diminished father's words. \"Maybe not from where you're standing, little guy!\" Morgan reached out and playfully ruffled her father's hair, the palm of her hand much larger than his head. Robin was not amused. \"Please, stop that. Now, if you would be so kind, could you undo the spell? I have some work to attend to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's gut dropped to the pit of her stomach. She had forgotten to check the book for a counterspell! \"U-uh...right now?\" Morgan asked sheepishly, holding the back of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Morgan, right now. You CAN undo this, can't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah! Sure thing, hehe...\" Morgan flipped the tome open, skimming desperately for a countermeasure to this shrinking spell. Morgan's panic grew, and Robin's patience dwindled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? I'm waiting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently apologizing for her own screw-up, Morgan opened the tome back to the shrinking spell and prayed to every god she could think of a second cast might reverse the effect. For a third time, the words glowed and Morgan cast, the white light from the spell overtook Robin. But when the light faded, the two would find their troubles were far from over.</span></div></div>",

The tiny tactician only stared at his daughter's boots, seemingly oblivious to anything being wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan.\" The minuscule figure spoke, unsettlingly calm. \"Yes, Father?\" Morgan responded, sheepish and fully prepared for Robin's incoming indignation. \"What is the meaning of this?\" Morgan breathed deep. \"Well, I found this shrinking spell in the tome you passed to me, and, well...\" Morgan rubbed her wrists, a nervous tick she had picked up from her father. \"I thought it would be funny to, you know, surprise you like this.\" The girl giggled nervously, knowing any moment now Robin could explode at her. The tactician kept his calm and nodded, shocking Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...?\" Robin probed further. \"And...I forgot to find a reversal for the spell first!\" Morgan blurted out her confession, nearly in tears. She knelt down to bring herself closer to Robin's new perspective. \"I'm so sorry! I really screwed up, and I don't know how to fix this!\" Morgan's composure had fallen apart, thankfully, Robin's did not, and he held a comforting hand on his daughter's knee. \"Morgan, calm down. I'm not mad at you, if that's what you're worrying for.\" Morgan's breathing was settled, and she rubbed her teary eyes. \"Wait, you're not?\" Robin smiled knowingly up at his colossal daughter. \"No, Morgan. No matter how bad this may look, I'm sure we can fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's words uplifted Morgan's spirit. \"Yeah, you're right!\" Morgan stood up confidently, her height bearing over Robin. \"There must be some way we can fix this,\" The girl swept her father into her palm and held him up to her face. \"And we'll figure it out together!\" Her smile proved infectious, and Robin couldn't help but laugh along with her sudden enthusiasm. \"That's the spirit! But first, take me to your mother. She's taking inventory in the store tent, and we could use her help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, dad!\" Morgan deposited Robin onto her shoulder, and he grabbed onto a loose hair for support.

Especially since I'll be manning the store full-time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secret seller shuddered as the memory of her daughter running shop came back to her. She would never view the word ''discount'' the same way again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as she was about to open up shop she heard a familiar voice behind her. \"M-Mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna turned to greet the girl. \"Ohm Morgan. How are you-- Oh my gods?!\" Faster than the girl or Robin could blink, Anna had scooped her husband off her shoulder and into her palms. \"What happened?! You're lighter than my coin purse after I let Morgan run the store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin tried to gain his bearings but his wife's voice was near deafening as she continued to freak out. All he could do was cover his ears and hope Morgan could calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Calm down Mother! I can explain!\" Morgan said frantically. Her words seemed to do the trick as Anna went silent for a moment, but the look in her told her everything she needed to know, She was worried and wanted an explanation pronto. The future gulped and began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes, the pair were sitting cross-legged on the store floor with Anna soaking in everything she'd been told. \"And that's what led us to right now.\" Morgan finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So that's why Robin's so tiny.\" the redhead understood. \"While your idea for a prank sounded good on paper, it would've been wise to look for a counter spell first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan frowned as Anna continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't feel to bad. Robin's not upset with you and neither am I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked shocked. \"Y-You're not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Anna waved off. \"Something similar happened to one of my sisters when they tried their hand in magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Morgan sked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I remember our mother was so angry. Anna had turned accidentally turned father into a mosquito.\" the redhead laughed. Morgan couldn't also help but laugh at the story. Even Robin had a small smile tugging at his lips. Better shrunken than turned into a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're really not mad?\" Morgan again asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bit. All we need is to find a counter spell. Do you still have to book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" The fellow redhead smiled before pulling the tome from her coat. The pair traded as Morgan held Robin and Anna took the tome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna flipped through the pages, quickly scanning their contents and filing away a certain spell for her own personal use later. Eventually Morgan stopped her when she reached the page containing the Object &amp; Lifeform Minimization spell. \"So this is the culprit, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's the one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" The two scanned the page and the rest of the book from top to bottom. Unfortunately for them, this tome contained no counter spells. \"Well this isn't good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked panicked now. \"W-What are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna bit down on her thumb nail as she eyed the tome. She was by no means an expert on magic. She was a master of trickery, sales, and haggling. Maybe it was time to look for some outside help? She looked over at her husband in Morgan's palm and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin... What do you think we should do?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow, where can I get rid of this?\u201d Ricken walked through the camp, carrying a bottle of potion in his stead. It was created in order to hasten an organism\u2019s growth, but was meant to be used by plants; not exactly fit for human consumption. Ricken had originally intended to use the potion on himself in order to give himself more height, and therefore more respect in the army, but was talked out of it after a quick pep talk from Sully; in hindsight, it was a good idea to opt out, he could\u2019ve accidentally poisoned himself with all the different chemicals he mixed into the solution. Now, he looked for a safe spot to dispose of the potion without causing any trouble in the camp, Ricken didn\u2019t want anyone in the army getting poisoned, nor did he want an overgrowth of plants preventing the march forward or giving brigands and Risen vantage for an ambush. \u201cUgh, this is so hard!\u201d he cried, \u201cI can\u2019t throw it in the woods because of all the plants, I can\u2019t chuck it in the river without poisoning the water supply, this is starting to seem like it was an awful decision the more I think about it\u2026\u201d Exhausted, Ricken sat down on bench and set the potion to his side, wiping down his forehead with his hat as the young mage thought of how to dispose of his solution proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, nerd.\u201d Ricken turned to see who called him and came face-to-face with Severa, brandishing a bow and face slightly sweaty. The light blue-haired daughter of Virion and Cordelia had a reputation in the army of being a crude, sarcastic jerk, and while her parents and comrades of the future insisted it was because of her rough life in the destroyed future, many of the other Shepherds agreed that genetically, she was a spoiled, stuck-up brat, being the daughter of a Duke, and though she fought valiantly with honor, she flaunted her title of \u201cLady\u201d around far too much and was a huge money sink, spending a lot of the army\u2019s wealth on expensive dresses and jewelry. Ricken sighed and shook his head, he did not want to deal with this right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, \u2018Lady\u2019 Severa.\u201d Ricken responded sarcastically. \u201cAnd what graces me with your pleasure today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, and people say <i>I\u2019m</i> the rude one.\u201d Severa responded with a smirk, clearly taking pleasure in how she riled up the young mage with her presence. \u201cAnyways, Chrom\u2019s called for a meeting of the troops, and guess who\u2019s needed to discuss the magic training regiments?\u201d Ricken sighed, why on earth was it that he was being called on now when Chrom rarely called him for meetings before? There were clearly other mages in the Shepherds, ones that Chrom didn\u2019t consider too young for war either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell Chrom to wait?\u201d Ricken replied, \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of something a little important right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNu-uh, not happening, direct order from the Exalt himself.\u201d Severa responded, shaking her head. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t really like your tone, so why should I be inclined to throw you a bone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</i> Ricken thought, <i>\u201cMe and my big mouth, think before you speak next time, Ricken.\u201d</i> The mage decided he was already in hot water, why not protest a little and see where it gets him? \u201cAnd why don\u2019t you need to go to the meeting? Aren\u2019t you part of the army too, or are you thinking of going back to Rosanne and taking Daddy\u2019s throne while he\u2019s gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just the messenger, no need to give me that smart-ass mouth of yours, little boy.\u201d Ricken fumed inwardly, he hated being called a child by anyone, more fuel for him to dislike Severa. \u201cAnd if you must know,\u201d continued the icy-haired Lady, \u201cI\u2019m training for the oncoming march. See the bow in my hand? I\u2019m practicing on my range for the battle, Daddy didn\u2019t really give me his keen eyesight, and bows surprisingly aren\u2019t one of the things Mom\u2019s good at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re training? Without your horse? And in that dress?\u201d Ricken pointed out the Bow Knight\u2019s attire, a fancy white and blue dress more meant for a princess or a cleric than a war, and Severa merely scoffed at his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you <i>must</i> know, Chrom thinks I need a little more foot training in my life, and he also thinks that if I bought the dress, then I should wear it in our marches too; he treats it like our armor we buy.\u201d Severa giggled and spun around, showing the full radiance of her attire off to Ricken. \u201cNot like I\u2019m complaining; just look how darling I look in this! It really goes with my radiant hair too, you could almost say I\u2019m the face of beauty in this army!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, number one: In terms of children, Lucina trumps you in terms of beauty. Second: I\u2019m totally busy right now, so unless you don\u2019t want the army to be healthy, then you\u2019ll leave me alone.\u201d Severa pondered it for a moment before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, then how about this?\u201d Severa drew her bow and readied an arrow, pointing it at Ricken. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a 5 second head-start before my finger slips, I\u2019d recommend you run to Chrom to tell him I\u2019m threatening you like this.\u201d Ricken flipped, thinking the young Lady lost her marbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you crazy?!\u201d he cried, \u201cYou can\u2019t just shoot me like an animal!\u201d Severa looked undeterred, closing her left eye for a better aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c5\u20264\u20263\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Alright! I\u2019m going!\u201d Ricken bolted, leaving behind his bottle of potion, while Severa flipped one of her pigtails in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat kid\u2019s so easy to intimidate!\u201d she spoke in praise of herself, \u201c\u2019I\u2019m an adult!\u2019 my big toe!\u201d Severa laughed before getting back to other matters. \u201cNow, what was he talking about? \u2018Don\u2019t want the army to be healthy\u2019 or something?\u201d Severa looked around where Ricken sat and spotted the bottle of potion, she placed down her bow and bought the concoction to her face. \u201cIs this what he was talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera sniffed the mixture from the mouth of the bottle, smelling a strong scent of lemon and citrus from the potion, a somewhat appealing aroma. \u201cWhat is this? An energy drink for the army?\u201d Severa thought it over for a moment. <i>\u201cHe\u2019s always making up those crazy chemicals in the lab, is he now working in brewery? Should I take a swig of this without any idea of what\u2019s in here?\u201d</i> Severa batted the idea around in her head for roughly 7 seconds before shaking off the thought. <i>\u201cNah, he can always make more, kid keeps a ream of notes on him!\u201d</i> Severa held the bottle up high, expecting it to help her out on her workout. \u201cWell, bottom\u2019s up!\u201d In one fell swoop, she chugged the entirety of the liquid, completely unaware of its real purpose, before throwing the bottle behind her and listening to it shatter with an audible \u201cCRACK!\u201d from behind her. \u201cThat hit the spot!\u201d she cried, satisfied by the drink, \u201cGotta hand it to Ricken; not half bad!\u201d On that, Severa continued on her training exercise, breaking into a small run before heading off into the woods, looking for wildlife and targets to aim at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho does she think she is?!\u201d Ricken continued onwards in the camp in frustration over Severa\u2019s antics. \u201c\u2019I\u2019m a proper Lady! Listen to me! I\u2019m considered royalty!\u2019 I swear to gods, Virion\u2019s going to get an earful as soon as I get rid of that poti-\u201c Ricken stopped, the color drained from his face considerably once he realized his mistake. \u201cHOLY CRAP! The potion!\u201d Ricken turned around immediately and broke into a run, hoping for the love of gods that Severa didn\u2019t mess with it, even he didn\u2019t want to see the girl get poisoned, as much as she might\u2019ve deserved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera wandered through the woods, run now slowing to a small jog as she tired herself out, firing at various targets as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so tiring!\u201d she huffed, trying to keep a steady pace as she trained in seclusion. \u201cI thought that energy drinks were supposed to revitalize you, not do nothing!\u201d Severa kept a light jog up as best as she could, before stopping suddenly when she felt something in her shoulder. Severa ran her fingers across the fabric of her dress and tried flexing her arm a little. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn I bought this thing in my size when I tried it on\u2026\u201d As she flexed her muscles more, the fabric tore around her shoulder, exposing some skin to the open air. \u201cDammit!\u201d she cried, \u201cI just bought this one too!\u201d </span></div></div>",

I feel like I could get sick at any minute!\" Just then, Severa heard another tear in her dress, coming from her left shoulder, and it caused her frustration to come to a head. \"I swear, I'm taking this stupid thing back to the store for a refu- Aah!\" Her rant was interrupted as she tripped and fell to the forest floor, responding to a pain in her foot. She sat up and looked to see if she tripped over a root, but the ground was clean and level, and she felt the pain in her foot rapidly increasing. \"What the hell...?\" she spoke in awe, inspecting her high-heeled foot and wondering what was happening to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sound of more ripping fabric filled the air as Severa felt her dress dig into her ribs; she looked all around her body and saw the seams come undone before her very eyes. The pain in her foot came to a head, and as Severa's attention came back to it, she saw both of her feet erupt from the plastic heels, scattering the blue material across the forest floor and causing the young Lady to gasp in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\" she asked aloud, slight fear in her voice as she felt the cloth dig into her body more and more. She felt more and more skin being exposed to the air as the sounds of ripping became more and more frequent. As Severa struggled to get up, she felt the expensive fabric falling from her body, and when fully erect and leaning against a tree for support, the entirety of the dress fell away and she was left in her jet-black underwear. Severa felt the smooth bark of the oak rub against her back and the dirt shift under her feet as she struggled to comprehend what was going on, but before she could even get a thought, Severa felt her bra straps begin to dig into her shoulders and her panties starting to tightly hug her hips, before the underwear fully separated from her body with an audible \"SNAP!\" and fell to the forest floor. Severa leaned against the tree more as she watched the world seem to get smaller around her, before the oak gave into her weight and snapped from its roots, falling down and bringing the blue-haired girl down with it. Sitting up, Severa felt the shifting under her feet stop completely and inspected the world around her. She stood up slowly, and looked around in amazement as the treetops of the tall forest surrounded her head and flapping birds looked almost like floating flower petals; she looked down at the ruined clothing she once wore and moved her foot upon feeling something, gazing upon her ruined bow and quiver in the imprint, and then it finally hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera was a 50 foot tall giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!?!?!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicken looked upon the shattered bottle at the floor of the camp and bit his lip tightly; he was in deep trouble now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, this isn't happening!\" He gathered up the shattered remnants of glass with his gloved hands and tried to salvage what remained of his broken container; the liquid inside was far gone now, as was Severa. \"Don't tell me that dingbat drank the entire bottle of this stuff!\" He sniffed the mouth of the bottle and smelled the faint stench of perfume, confirming his worst thoughts. Panicked, Ricken set the broken shards on the bench beside him and worriedly looked around for any sign of Severa; the woman was fast, inheriting her gale-force speed from her mother, but she couldn't have gone far. \"Okay, okay, calm down Ricken!\" he cried, \"Severa couldn't have gone far, I just need to find a trail to track her with and then there's no worry, I can use a staff to cure any poison she might have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><b>\"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!?!?!\"</b></font> Ricken heard the cry of Severa's voice from the woods; considering the intensity of the yell, she must've been deep within the woods, which would be a lengthy hike for the young mage, but there was nothing more he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well Ricken, don't look a gift horse in the mouth!\"</i> In an instant, the young boy looked around to make sure there was no onlookers and dashed off into the woods to correct whatever mistake might've gone about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little brat!\" Severa shouted in frustration. She used her hands to cover he privates and kicked trees down in anger as she continued her rant against Ricken. \"He knew this would happen, I just know it! This must've been some prank to teach me a lesson!\" Her screams became louder and rampage became more destructive to the forest as she imagined the thought of the little mage laughing at her and saying some snarky lines of moral superiority. \"Oh, when I get my hands on that little brat, I'm gonna...!\" Severa's rant slowed to a halt as she felt the breeze run across her smooth skin, causing her to note her lack of clothing. \"...I'm gonna do nothing because I'm naked. Dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera sat down in frustration; she had to get clothes from somewhere, but where? Her dress was obviously shot, and there was no way the small fabrics littered across the ground would be able to cover her appropriately, she had to find some large bundles of clothing fast and preferably with nobody looking at her body in the process. <i>\"Alright, think Severa, you need something cute-looking that could show off your curves well, where would you look?</i> Severa pondered the options in her head intensely. <i>\"Raid a town's fabric store? No, too many people, I'd cause a riot and they'd be staring at my butt the whole time. Small village? Nah, those hicks probably never saw a women, they'd freak out just looking at me. Gawds! Why was I cursed with such a great body?!\"</i> Severa narrowed down the results further and further before arriving at two options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was that she sneak into camp and start stealing the tents under everyone's noses, crafting at least some smallclothes from the white sheets; she was sure the other Shepherds wouldn't react like she was a monster or anything, especially since she now had the high ground in terms of power, but didn't want to take any risks. Although, now that she thought about it, perhaps her mother and father could support her on this, Cordelia and Virion were always very level-headed, and could definitely keep secrets if she so wished, so there was definitely an advantage on that front. The second was to use her hunting skills to take animal furs from the local wildlife in the area and craft clothes out of that, not as disgusting of a thought if she were to clean them in a nearby lake or river. Severa thought it wouldn't be a good idea to diminish the animal population in the area so quickly, as it would have adverse effects on the Shepherds food supply, but those thoughts were quickly overshadowed by the thought of how cute she would look in bear-fur smallclothes; she'd definitely be the talk of the camp then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hm, decisions, decisions...\"</i> thought the young Lady, trying to weigh safety &amp; simplicity over fashion. Though she inherited a keen strategic mind from Cordelia and Virion, her personality didn't help make the decision any easier. She looked down at her body and noticed all the grime and dirt that covered it, products of her growth and rampage, and grimaced. \"Ew!\" she cried, \"I'll need a bath before I even think about getting dressed, this forest is filthy!\" She remembered a lake she had passed by earlier, deeper into the woods, and got up to walk off, still covering herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the lake, Severa undid her icy-blue pigtails, not worrying about anybody who might've seen her, and walked into the lake, diving under to fully clean herself. She resurfaced and took 5 more reps of diving and resurfacing, fully cleansing her hair and face and leaving her refreshed. \"Ah, much better~!\" she said, feeling refreshed and in a much better mood, before sitting down in the lake, noting how it now felt like a bathtub at her size. She raised her right leg up in the air and began scrubbing the dirt from it, humming a tune as she continued to think over her dilemma. \"Alright,\" she asked herself, \"Do I go for some...relatively clean sheets to dress myself, or should I really turn the boys heads with some cute little fur clothes?\" Severa batted the idea of a giant's fashion around in her head for a while, focusing more on cleaning herself up, before arriving at a conclusion.</span></div></div>",

I should first report the matter to Chrom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicken had been nearby, still searching for any trace of Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's her!\" He exclaimed to himself, though not loudly enough for anyone else to hear. He ran after Severa, following her into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?!\" Frederick called after him, eyeing him suspicously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh- there's something I need to get! I'll be back soon!\" He didn't wait for the reply, continuing to run as fast as his short legs could carry him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera had gotten a good distance ahead, but had sat down to make  some makeshift clothes, allowing Ricken to eventually catch up.

Ricken felt the color drain from his face as he looked down at the ground, feeling nauseous at the height he was elevated; color and heat soon returned to Ricken's face as he blushed at Severa's attire, a tent-made set of smallclothes with a short, overlapping skirt that left little to the imagination, it appeared as if Severa wore a bright white bikini and pareo. \"Hey! Eyes up here dummy!\" Severa snapped her fingers in front the mage's face, bringing his attention back to her angry face, ready to chew him out. \"Why would you make a potion that turns the person who drinks it into a giant freak?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't!\" Ricken protested. \"I mean I did, but you weren't supposed to chug the entire thing! It was only meant for a few applied drops, it was originally for plant growth! Not human consumption!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop lying!\" Severa cried in anger, \"Why the hell would you put fertilizer in a <i>vulnerary</i> bottle?! You must've left it on that bench knowing I would've drank it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Ricken responded, equally as frustrated, \"I left the potion there because you tried to <i>shoot me!</i> Excuse me for being a little too panicked to react properly!\" Severa's face was reddening in anger, contrasting her vibrant blue hair; how dare Ricken take a tone with her, a Lady of royal blood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess what?\" Severa responded in a cocky fashion, \"Now <i>you're</i> going to be my little chemist and fix up a cure for me!\" Ricken responded with shock, he hadn't anticipated Severa actually growing into a giant, instead expecting her more poisoned, and maybe growing a leaf or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no cure!\" Ricken replied, somewhat afraid of Severa's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you stop with the lies already?! What kind of potion mixer makes up something that he can't cure?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I'm not lying! It's a recipe for plants, you can't just un-grow plants! It's just not possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a plant, stupid! I'm a person!\" Severa tightened her grip around Ricken, intending to intimidate the boy as she listed off her demands. \"Now, first, you're going to apologize for this stupid prank of yours, and then you're going to help me out on getting me back to normal! And you're going to say 'Yes, Lady Severa!' and 'As you wish, Lady Severa!' as you're doing it, got it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologize for <i>what prank?!</i>\" Ricken responded, reaching the peak of his frustration with Severa. \"I'm not going to apologize for something I never did! In fact, you owe me an apology for drinking my potion before I could get rid of it properly!\" The two had clearly reached the end of dealing with each other, and Severa's accidental growth had put her in a far better position of power then the young mage. For a moment, Severa thought of throwing Ricken through the sky, dropping him to the floor and grinding her heel atop him, taking him to the lake and drowning her far at the bottom; angry thoughts of torture had run through her mind quickly and furiously, but Severa managed to calm herself, taking slow breaths and adopting a more relaxed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Ricken was baffled; one moment she was grinding her teeth together, the next, Severa was all calm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said okay.\" responded Severa. \"I got other things on my mind anyways, like what I'm going to have for dinner tonight at this size.\" Ricken sighed in relief, not expecting this turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief! Now, if you could just put me down, we can-\" Ricken's thoughts were interrupted as Severa raised him above her face and begun dangling him from her fingertips by his robes. \"Wh-What are you doing?\" the boy asked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" Severa asked, \"I'm hungry, and I'm getting dinner; a big hunk of meat, fit for a giant! Down the hatch!\" In an instant, Severa released Ricken from her grasp and opened her mouth, dropping the boy inside before closing it. \"Mmm~! That hit the spot!\" The young boy started screaming, hugging Severa's tounge as she playfully shifted the boy around her mouth; Ricken didn't want to die, not like this, he hadn't even gotten married yet, something he and his family wished for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa!\" Ricken screamed, \"This isn't funny! Let me out of here right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Severa asked, ignoring the young boy's pleas, \"I dunno what you said, it's hard to hear you from inside my mouth, but it sure didn't sound like an apology!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Ricken screamed, \"I'm sorry for making you grow! I'm sorry for the prank! I'll never do it again, just please let me out of here!\" Severa grinned and spit the boy out into her palm. Covered in saliva and panting, the boy was happy to be alive, yet aggravated he had to give in to Severa's demands, apologizing for something he never did in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand the position that you're in, little boy?\" asked Severa, looking down at the soaked, frightened little Ricken in her hands. \"I'm big now, and you're still a little short-stack! You're to respond to me with the utmost respect, or I'm going to torture you even further, understand?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...\" Ricken responded, still feeling overwhelmed by the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Yes', what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lady Severa! Just please don't do that again!\" Severa smirked triumphantly, clearly feeling victorious in her empty argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" she shouted, asserting her dominance over the young boy. She set him down to the ground, confident that he wouldn't run away, and sat down, relaxing herself once more after her episode. \"Now then, onto item #2. How long is it going to take you to cure me?\" Ricken dusted off his hat, wiping the saliva from it, before responding, making sure there was enough distance between him and Severa to run and hide, should she freak out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, there isn't a cure.\" he replied, speaking slowly and calmly so he didn't have to repeat almost becoming Severa's snack. \"The potion recipe I read was for plant growth, not human growth, there's no inverse to it to reverse the effects, unlike other potions in my recipe book. And before you ask; no, there is no shrinking potion either.\" Severa looked annoyed again, and Ricken started shivering slightly, not knowing what she would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why not use a hex to cure me?\" Severa replied, \"You magic-users can do that, right?\" Ricken shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that easy; I'm not a Dark Mage, so I have no knowledge on hexes, and I've talked with Tharja and Henry on the matter, there isn't anything in the way of hexes that can change size. Believe me, I begged them both.\" Severa huffed and began twirling her blue pigtail around, clearly trying to keep her patience up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what? Are you saying I'm stuck like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so, for now at least. I can do some research into it over time, but I can't guarantee results.\" As Severa was about to shout in frustration, the call of someone through the woods caught their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Ricken! Are you out here? What's with all the noise, find that big chick out here?\" It was the voice of Sully, looking for the young boy, probably to bring him back to camp; where as Severa looked to be in a better mood, Ricken looked panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!\" Severa spoke, gladdened by the oncoming search party, \"Now we can get back to camp and I can put you to work while I go tease the boys!\" She shook her body provocatively as if to emphasize her great body and curves to Ricken, as well as her teasing outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no!\" Ricken shouted in response, shaking his hands in disagreement, \"We can NOT go back to camp with you like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why the hell not?!\" Severa angrily responded, \"I'm not staying out in this filthy forest, and at least Daddy, Mom, and the other Shepherds could be better help than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not going to get chewed out by Chrom for turning you into a 50 foot gravure idol! He's going to keep me off the battlefield and on paperwork duty for <i>months</i> if he catches wind that I almost put the camp in danger with my potions!\" Ricken got down on his hands and knees and begun begging Severa, looking almost ready to cry. \"Please Severa, hear me out! I need to be on the front lines, I have to protect all my friends!\" Severa looked at the begging child for a moment, trying to decide what to do; on one hand, she felt like her presence in camp would better put everyone at ease, herself included, and when they went to battle, Severa could absolutely decimate the enemy with her body and ensure the future's safety, but deep down, Severa was starting to feel bad for Ricken, now reducing the rowdy child to a beggar with the mere suggestion of going back to camp. Was it pity? Or did perhaps all that torture, among Ricken's robes, leave a sour taste in her mouth? Severa thought it over for a moment, then gave the child a devious smirk, sending Ricken into fear of her next move.</span></div></div>",

Please, Severa! Think of what your mother and father will do to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess paused, looking down at the small boy in her hand. \"You see the thing is, I don't really care.\" Her words were cold, taunting even as she continued her march, ignoring the tiny mage's pleas. At some point, she grew tired of his persistent whining and wrapped the rest of her hand around him, silencing him. It took her less than a minute to reach the camp thanks to her massive strides. She stopped just as she caught a glimpse of the camp, restraining every instinct to  just waltz in and cause a panic. Still, the lingering feeling of pity kept biting after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" she hummed, \"well, a proper lady always makes a grand entrance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling to herself, Severa planted herself firmly in front of the mess hall, aware that most of the Shepherds spent their free time inside. A part of her argued to tear off the roof of the cafeteria in a brilliant display of both power and theatrics, but she decided against it, opting to watch the clusters of confused soldiers pour out of the mess hall, like ants attracted to sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her, that was a perfect analogy to how she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooooo, Shepherds,\" Severa chimed, placing her hands on her hips. \"I know what you're thinking, 'Severa, where'd you get that lovely garb. Oh, I don't know. It was just lying around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to be humble,\" Ricken mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, the soldiers stood back, carefully eyeing the giant's movements as she waved her hands around while speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all the people,\" Sully sighed, gripping her lance tensely.  The group of knights around her nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just hope it doesn't get to her head.\" Frederick spoke up, keeping his distance from the blue haired giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the warm welcome,\" Severa spat sarcastically, crossing her arms over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar couple stepped forward, cautiously moving closer to the massive woman.  The icy haired giantess' eyes lit up at the sight of her parents, dropping to her knees to meet them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... Severa,\" Cordelia addressed calmly, not wanting to startle her volatile daughter, \"what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.\" Severa brushed off, \"I ate my greens and drank my milk like you told me to, Mother. I guess I grew up to be stronger than you and Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smirked to her self, satisfied with her coy answer. She kept her hands closed around Ricken, keeping her prisoner hidden, if only temporary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, my darling daughter,\" a rather posh voice spoke up. Her father Virion brought his hand to his daughter's knee in an attempt to reach out to his massive child. \"Please do not toy around with the facts. We only want to know how in case we could change you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I kinda like being big.\" Her words earned glares from the group. \"But if you really must know.\" She unclasped her palms, revealing the cowering form inside. \"This little squirt tried to poison me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not!\" Ricken defended, \"She's the one who decided to go through my things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will both of you cut it out?\" A stern voice cut in, stepping closer to the arguing group. They all turned towards the exalt who strode in between the couple and their massive child. \"Start from the beginning. What caused her height change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicken stuttered, choking over his words. \"Well, I, uh, made a potion-- for myself. It was supposed to make me... taller.\" He kicked at his boots skittishly. \"I decided against using it, so I tried to dispose of it safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made  a growth potion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the mage answered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa,\" Chrom called. \"How did Ricken 'poison' you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little booger deliberately dropped the potion where I could see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were aiming your bow at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Chrom yelled, \"the two of you are at fault. Ricken, you should have kept a better tab on something as dangerous as your potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera stuck her tongue out at the boy in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as for you, Severa,\" Chrom continued, getting the giant to stop in her tracks. \"What made you think it would be a good idea to just drink random potions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked like an ordinary vulenary. It just happened to smell different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom paused, glancing over the giantess and the young mage in her hand. He sighed in frustration, thinking of the proper punishment for the both of them. Gritting his teeth, he weighed his options before reaching a fair but stern sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you are suspended from the front lines indefinitely.\" Chrom declared, earning groans of protest from the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\" Severa demanded, \"I could literally crush the enemy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom paused, \"the last thing I want is enemies attempting to recreate Ricken's potion, so we're keeping you and him off the field until we find a way to reverse this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera huffed in frustration. \"So what? I just have to wait around camp when I could be winning wars?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing her arms, the giantess stood up and angrily stomped to the outskirts of the camp where she sat down with an earth shaking thud. The rest of the Shepherds watched her in awe before continuing their daily routine of training, save for her parents who chased after her. The two, aware of the stiff facade that hid their daughter's true insecurities, rushed over to comfort Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom kept in place, staring down the young mage who only shuffled away in defeat. Once he was alone, the Exalt began to shudder at the sudden realization of Severa's true power. If he hadn't intervened and asserted his authority, things could have easily turned out different. Still, the thought of reproducing Ricken's growth potion could prove useful, as long as it was reversible. He made a mental note to speak to Robin about the merit of recreating it.</span></div></div>",

The tactical implications of her size or how to manage her or-.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of those things.  Instead, I want to ask the merits of recreating the potion that enlarged Severa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's eyes widened for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not think that would be wise....\" She suddenly smiled. \"Though I could certainly see the merits of towering high over the battlefield, dwarfing any who would oppose us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do see the benefits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In battle yes, but giant soldiers would cause all kinds of logistic problems. They would require much more food to eat and space to rest, and at giant size would also be a greater target for the enmies mages and archers, to say nothing of the  weapons or armour that would be required.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom clenched his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't thought of that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin wasn't done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the other hand, if Ricken was able to make a potion to enlarge someone, he might be able to make a potion to return someone to their normal size. Switching between sizes would increase our options and mitigate some of the problems, especially if food or armaments could be enlarged as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom titled his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin pursed her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still not sure, though it could be worth discussing with him. If he were to help us, you could agree to shorten his probation period. But there is an additional issue, what would you do if a giant refused to obey you? You were lucky Severa stood down, because if she had not, she would be difficult to contain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true... I was calm and commanding on the outside, but inside I feared she might fling me aside or worse...\" Chrom shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if she decides to follow us to ignore her probation our next battle,  I am not sure even her parents could get her to stand down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite all this, I still think it is worth pursuing the merits of Ricken's growth potion, but we must proceed cautiously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cordelia and Virion had finally caught up with their daughter, equally impressed and exhausted with the distance the giantess could now clear, and slowly moved in towards her for comfort. As they closed the distance, the two could see their daughter sitting with her arms folded, staring out into the wilderness, stewing in anger; if she was never in a mood to talk before, chances are she wouldn't now. Regardless, Cordelia gently placed her hand on the girl's thigh and spoke softly in an attempt to get her daughter to open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, sweetie,\" she spoke, \"Are you feeling alright?\" Severa growled a little at the question, before giving her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair!\" Severa shouted, \"It's not my fault I've become so huge! Who does he think he is?!\" Severa started waving her hands around in a mocking fashion as she continued her rant. \"'Oh, look at me! I'm Chrom! I'm the big Exalt! Severa, you're suspended from the front lines because I say so! Blah, blah, blah!' I could use his stupid sword like a <i>toothpick</i>, and he has the nerve to ban me from battle?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Severa,\" Cordelia replied in a comforting manner, \"You know that Chrom wishes only the best for all of us, he must've had good reason to keep you off the field.\" Severa merely huffed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she sternly replied, \"Of course <i>you'd</i> agree with him, you practically have a crush on him! Everyone in camp knows it!\" Cordelia blushed in response, feeling somewhat offended by Severa's answer, correct as it was, and causing Virion to come to the defense of his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Severa,\" Virion protested, \"Your mother has gotten over her young crush long ago, your brilliant azure hair is proof of that. Cordelia is right though my dear, Chrom doesn't wish for your new stature to affect you negatively or be used by the enemy; intel is the worst weapon after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Negatively?</i> Here, watch this.\" Cordelia and Virion watched as Severa tore a tree clean from the ground, the two were blown away by how their daughter's strength had multiplied. A few short seconds later, Severa thew the tree at a mountain range as if it were a spear, and both her parents were astonished at how far and fast it flew out of sight; Virion could see with his keen sniper's eyes the faint figure of brown and green jammed into the grey mountainside, like a dart on a board. \"See that?\" Severa asked, \"That is exactly what I could do to the enemy, and we could be over with this damned war just like that! As for the potion, they'd need that little nerd to work on it, and I intend to keep him close to me until I find a cure for this!\" Severa thought it over for a bit longer before opening her mouth again. \"You know what? Forget the cure! Just look at me now; tall, strong, and beautiful to boot - I'm a force of nature!\" Both parents gasped and looked worriedly at each other for a moment, fearing the power would go to her head, the last thing they wanted was the entirety of the Shepherds turning on Severa and chasing her out of camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, don't say that!\" Cordelia beckoned, \"We'll get you back to normal soon enough, to the regular old Severa we all know and love!\" Severa turned her body to face her parents and looked down at her mother with a smug smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked coyly, \"Afraid I've started surpassing the things you're good at? Do you want your titles of 'Tallest', 'Strongest', and 'Most Beautiful' back already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that!\" Cordelia protested, \"We just afraid you'll abuse this power is all; we love you dearly and don't want to see our friends begin treating you as an outsider for being different.\" Severa scoffed at the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please Mom!\" she responded, \"It's not like I'm going to totally push my weight around in camp! I know my friends well, and I practically owe Lucina my life, I'm not going to overstep my bounds just because I grew up a little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, dear, won't you consider trying to shrink back to normal?\" Virion added in. \"Why, if you're this big, then how will I ever wrap my arms around you to hug you ever again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never hugged anybody.\" Virion was taken aback by Severa's observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...It's the thought that counts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Severa sighed as she stood up, \"I'm not going to let that blue-haired oaf push me around because he thinks he knows what's best, last I checked, that's what he has a tactician for! Hell, his wife and son are smarter than he is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, that's enough!\" Cordelia responded, \"Olivia isn't unintelligent because she doesn't speak freely, and Inigo is...Well, you got me on Inigo. But Chrom still is smart and resourceful, he knows what he's doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? If Chrom knew what he was doing, why did he let his sister fall off that cliff those years ago?!\" Cordelia gasped at Severa's insulting remark, it wasn't Chrom's fault Emmeryn had died, but her choice to bring peace to the two kingdoms; if Chrom heard her, he would've surely erupted into a frenzy. \"Screw this! Talking with you two is impossible!\" With that, Severa stomped off back into camp, somehow more frustrated than she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa!\" Cordelia tried to run off after her daughter, but was stopped by Virion's grasp on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let her go, Cordelia, our words  clearly have no effect on her in this mood.\" Virion looked on as Severa's blue pigtails swayed in the breeze, watching his daughter stomp off in frustration. \"I understand where she's coming from, battle is her life, her defense mechanism from the horrors she faced in the future. All we can do is wait and hope she cools down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Virion...\" Cordelia began, searching for the right words to say. \"It's just...I feel like this isn't right, watching our baby with this rebellious streak, at this size...It's just too much to handle.\" Virion sighed, understanding his wife's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say all parents need to watch their children grow up, ours just grew more literally than most. And dare I say it, perhaps the talk in camp of my royal blood causing our daughter to grow up spoiled may be right...\" Virion began to walk off, turning to Cordelia once more. \"I will attempt to engage Chrom and see if he can bypass Severa's punishment, at least for one march, perhaps that will quell her mood. Would you care to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the offer,\" answered Cordelia, \"But I'm going to keep an eye on our daughter to make sure she doesn't do anything rash in her frustration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I wish you luck in your endeavor, but please, give Severa some space, I believe that would be best for now.\" Cordelia nodded and the pair split up in order to relieve their daughter's anguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawds! How could they not side with me, their only daughter?!\" Severa huffed and puffed as she angrily strode through camp, taking care not to step on any of her comrades, but still getting stares from soldiers blown away by how big she was. Severa found a large stack of weapon crates and sat atop of them, using it almost like a stool, before resting her fist upon her chin and thinking aloud to herself. \"'Abuse this power' my foot! So what if I like being the biggest girl in camp?! It's not like I'm going to bully people into giving me their dinner or anything!\" Suddenly, the memory of torturing Ricken with her mouth ran through her mind, and she could almost taste the various chemical fumes from his robes again. \"Alright, maybe they had a point...\" Severa sighed and thought it over more. \"I just need to find something to keep me occupied, maybe that'll get my mind off this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prime thought that ran through Severa's mind was to go tease the boys in camp with her size and attire, more specifically, her friends from the future. She figured that while Gerome and Laurent were too serious to get flustered, she could always put on a little dance show in front of Inigo, Owain, Morgan, Yarne, and Brady to have some fun. The routine would be simple: a little sexy dance, a couple shots of her curves, hell, she could probably get away with putting one lucky boy in her makeshift bra for a bit to experience a little piece of heaven; she could probably get some of the other soldiers involved too and get away with it, she could definitely change the male opinion of her in camp and get a little fanbase like that - who said being big didn't have its perks? Then, another more devious thought ran through her mind; what if she were to go out and fight a band of brigands herself? Severa thought for a moment that if she could decimate any thugs in the area and bring back proof of her one-woman victory, then Chrom would have to let her back on the front lines, perhaps as a lead-in alongside the Cavaliers; for a brief moment, Severa envisioned squashing legions of the Grimleal flat under her foot and being hailed in Ylisse and Rosanne alike as a giant hero, with a parade in her honor. Severa thought over her options vigorously, trying to arrive at a conclusion.</span></div></div>",

Though they had failed in their mission, prompting the journey to the past in the first place, it was thanks to Morgan's keen intellect in strategy that the 5 of them escaped with their lives that day, and they all promised never to let each other out of their sights ever again. As the future children had found their combined job near its end, they slowed their progress to chat a little about the events of today; they still couldn't believe that Severa, their friend they've known for years, had suddenly grown into a giantess out of nowhere, it was literally only hours ago that Owain and Inigo had seen her on a training run into the woods, still small and garbed in her expensive dress. The boys had stopped near the middle of the camp to rest &amp; chat; Morgan, while carefully scanning his checklist, had opened the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, all we have left is to inspect the latrines, and we're done!\" This was met with groans from his friends, but didn't dull his enthusiasm one bit. \"Aw come on guys, if we really put our minds to it, we can knock it out real quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speaking of 'knock out',\" Inigo started, \"How about that outfit Severa's wearing now? Me-ow! What a treat for the eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you be any more of a skirt-chaser?\" Yarne responded, a bit fed up with Inigo's womanizing ways. \"I mean Inigo, how do you <i>not</i> see the problem in this? Severa's now gigantic and still as mean as ever?\" Yarne shuddered a bit as he spoke his thoughts. \"I mean, I don't want to complain or anything guys, but if she starts pushing us around while she's this big, I'm gonna start sleeping in the woods from now on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're such a coward Yarne!\" spoke the young Prince, \"Severa's still the same old girl we all knew growing up, and I know beneath that ice-queen exterior lies a sweet woman, begging for a handsome prince!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just get Chrom to unite Ylisstol and Rosanne already!\" replied Owain in a sarcastic manner. \"I'm with Yarne; if it were anyone else, the excitement of my sword-hand would be too much to control, but I'm honestly fearful that Severa might turn her 'Lady' title into 'Queen' at this size. I mean we all know she's never really been nice and always super-pushy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Brady replied, \"I mean, yeah, Severa ain't the nicest gal in camp, but she's still human, like the rest of us. 'Cept maybe Yarne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean! Look, point is, we've all been pals for years, she ain't gonna do anything crazy just cause she's got a couple inches on us now.\" Morgan nodded, agreeing with the words Brady spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, my thoughts exactly! I can't even begin to think of how many times Severa's saved us on the battlefield, and now she can do it with far more ease; whatever happens, we gotta stay positive and look forward.\" Suddenly, the boys heard the sound of stomping coming close to them, and from behind Morgan came the titanic figure of Severa, stopping short of the group and leaning against a sturdy watchtower post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Morgan, you might wanna 'look forward' now.\" Yarne said in a snarky manner. Morgan turned around and nearly fell over, showing he still wasn't used to seeing Severa at 50 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hellooooo boys~!\" Severa spoke in a playful tone and playing with a pigtail. \"I was just in the area and I thought I'd see my favorite little boys in camp for a quick chat!\" Severa broke from her lean and struck a provocative pose. \"What do you think, boys? Isn't my outfit just darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Severa!\" Inigo spoke brilliantly, \"Your dashing white clothes match the vibrant azure of your hair, while charming my eyes with your smooth, beautiful skin! Why, I could just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dial it down Prince Moron, I'm not here for just you.\" Owain and Yarne laughed at Inigo getting shot down so quickly while Brady helped Morgan up. Dusting himself off, Morgan spoke calm with his traditional smile and optimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa,\" he spoke, \"You look really cute in that outfit and I appreciate you coming to say hello, but we're a little busy, so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Morgan!\" Severa cried, leaning down to see the blond tactician, \"You always know what to say to get me in a good mood! I've always appreciated that about you!\" Morgan blushed a little at the compliment, but inwardly worked over trying to find a way to get out of this conversation without coming off as rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, we are busy with camp inspection, so is there any reason you came to see us?\" Owain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forget the camp inspection for now,\" Severa responded while getting back up, \"I'm just here to get you a bit motivated for the oncoming battles, so I thought up a little routine to entertain the troops; give it a watch and then tell me what you think!\" Following her words, Severa grabbed the stiff wooden pole of the watchtower and begun to twirl around it, rubbing herself against the pole at random intervals and wrapping her leg around it to spin. This went on for a short while, and while the other boys blushed and debated whether they should be watching, Inigo was excited by the sight, and it sent him into a frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah baby, this is what I'm talking about!\" he cried, shaking his fists in excitement. \"Severa, darling, we just <i>have</i> to do a duet sometime!\" Resisting the urge to say something sarcastic to Inigo, Severa instead noted the other soldiers in camp who were beginning to notice her dance routine, and watched as they piled in to cheer the girl on in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now this is what I wanted to see! Time to put this show into overdrive!\"</i> Severa loosened her grip from the post and began to shake her hips, breaking into a free-dance routine. Severa's hair swung wildly in the air as she begun to shake and gyrate in a provocative manner, bringing attention to her hips and chest while she danced; the soldiers and Inigo began chanting Severa's name in unison, starting loud and continuing as loud, putting a smug smile on Severa's face knowing she's successfully captured the admiration of the males in camp. As she slowed her dance, Severa opened her lips to speak. \"Thank you all!\" she cried, \"And now, as my personal 'Thank you' to the army, one of you lucky boys gets to ride up here with me!\" Severa pointed to her chest and began looking around at her audience with a finger to her pursed lips; everyone, save Owain, Yarne, Brady, and Morgan, were jumping and shouting at the chance to get close to Severa's body, and some were getting in fistfights with one another over her. Severa scanned the audience very carefully, pretending to look for her one lucky boy, but already having the perfect thought in mind. \"Let's see,\" she spoke playfully, \"I choose...You!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! M-Me?!\" Morgan pointed at himself in confusion, wondering why Severa would choose him, and looked around at everyone else giving him dirty glares, aside from Owain, Yarne, and Brady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan, you lucky dog!\" Inigo shouted in jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait a second! I need to get some work done and-\" Ignoring his protests, Severa picked the boy up and rested him in her bra, playfully pushing her breasts together while continuing her dance. Morgan looked embarrassed and distressed by the situation, and begged for her to let him down. \"Severa!\" he cried, \"P-Please let me down! Father says close contact like this is a sin! What if he catches me like this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forget Libra for one day, enjoy the moment!\" Severa blushed a little and looked down at Morgan, speaking to him in a soft voice. \"You know Morgan,\" she cooed, \"I always did admire smart, resourceful boys like you, you must've gotten it from your mother, and you definitely inherited your father's gorgeous hair and cute looks; it's almost like you had two mothers! How about you and I go on a nice, quiet date after this?\" Morgan blushed and gave a nervous chuckle, trying to think out of how to get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, uh, really nice to hear Severa! Thank you!\" he replied, \"But I'm already going steady with Cynthia, I can't just leave her for you like that! It'd break her heart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forget about the dork and get yourself a real woman! Why, just look at me - 50 feet of beauty, brains, and brawn! Woo~!\" Severa kept her provocative dance up and continued receiving cheers from her audience of onlookers; while Severa basked in the moment, Morgan looked even more distressed and tried looking for a way out of this situation, but could find none, even with his smart tactician's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"O Blessed Naga!\"</i> he prayed internally, <i>\"Please get me out this situation!\"</i> Severa continued her dance and intimate moment with Morgan, enjoying every moment of it, enjoying every cheer she received; she wished this moment could never end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Severa!</i>\" came the sharp cry of a woman from behind Severa. Cursing her jinxing words, Severa stopped her dance and turned around to see who called her, while Morgan almost cried in happiness that Naga had sent him an angel.</span></div></div>",

Feeling the need to assert her authority over her child, she took a step forward. \"Severa, just what in Naga's  name are you doing?\" She kept her voice firm, knowing that any hesitation would be admitting that her giant daughter now held control.  If what happened with Chrom earlier stood up, Severa still had a respect for authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...\" The giantess played off, her tone reminiscent of a toddler caught stealing sweets.<br>\r\n\"Don't lie to me,\" the pegasus knight pressed, \"is that... Robin's son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to hide her actions, Severa used her index finger to push her tiny prisoner deeper into her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Cordelia moved closer, curling her finger and signaling her daughter to come to her lever. Surprisingly, the giant obligedm kneeling to meet her mother at a closer level. Severa still towered over her mother, but the smaller of the two still held the advantage. The boy trapped in the giantess' bra struggled for help, finding it difficult to move against the mounds of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him out,\" the mother snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera huffed, \"fine.\" She dug around for Morgan, pulling him out easily. The boy's face was masked in a bright blush, causing the giantess to giggle in response. \"Don't worry, cutie. We'll have some fun later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped her tiny boy toy off from a safe height, and Morgan landed into Cordelia's arms, taking in deep breaths of relief now that he was free. The boy wheezed, before he was gently placed onto his feet, shaking off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Morgan was met with an onslaught of congratulatory jeers from his fellow male Shepherds. He could have sworn that he would be bruising if another person pat his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was always something about her mother that made Severa feel small. Even when she was a fifty foot giant, she still felt tiny compared to her seemingly perfect mother. Biting her lip, she just stood there as Cordelia chewed her out for her promiscuous behavior. She grit her teeth, not wanting to think about the incoming punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a single idea floated into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no reason to be just sitting there. If she wanted to, she could just walk off on her own. Sure she would be a deserter, but at the same time it wasn't like anyone could really stop her from leaving. Her parents might chase after her, but she could easily out run her mother's pegasus. Still, it would be a bit dull to be off by herself. Maybe she could run off with her new boy toy Morgan like a pair of young lovers. The idea itself seemed romantic enough to her to get her to jump up immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebating on leaving, another idea crept in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was small, relatively of course. She towered over Cordelia, and she finally outmatched her in strength. There was nothing holding her back from overpowering her mother and put her once perfect parent into her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa! Are you even listening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Her thoughts were cutoff by her mother's glare. \"Sure, I was just thinking of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue haired giantess stood up to her full height, towering over her mother, She took a deep breath as her mind settled into a decision.</span></div></div>",

Cordeia futily tried to block Severa's way, spreading her arms out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera effort pushed her out of the away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan kept running, but it was easy for  Severa to close the gap and scooped him up. Morgan tried to wiggle free, but her grip was tight enough to hold and just short of being truly painful. He looked to Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you taking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera casually strolled out the camp, still wearing that grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anywhere but here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera shrugged, her large strides carrying her far away from the camp.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, don't care.

In the mere span of a few seconds, the two had disappeared into the woods, leaving the imaginary stage for Severa's dance show now empty, with soldiers starting to break away from their circle, returning to their duties now that their entertainment left. Cordelia got to her knees and started softly weeping, feeling beaten by her daughter and overwhelmed by everything that went on today; in just the span of a couple hours, Severa managed to become a giantess, insult Chrom's dead sister, and now go AWOL with the lead tactician's son - it was a worrying series of thoughts for a mother to have on her mind. Morgan's four friends slowly shuffled over to Cordelia, unaware of how to handle the situation that just played out, yet willing to help make it right as they could; Yarne helped Cordelia up while Brady extended a handkerchief forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna need this?\" Brady asked polite as he could, pointing out Cordelia's damp eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you Brady...\" She accepted the handkerchief and begun to dry her eyes with it, continuing to hold onto it once she was calm in case another set of tears came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what was all that about?\" Owain asked, unsure of how to ask the question without coming off rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Cordelia answered sorrowfully, \"I still can't quite process exactly what's happened today, I still can't believe Severa would act like this...\" Though rude and brash, Severa always had a respect for authority and never would act like this, perhaps the potion had changed her ego alongside her height, Cordelia thought. \"Please, if you boys know anything about where she could've gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Inigo answered, \"Severa doesn't exactly let us in on her life, especially me. I doubt she could've gone far into the woods though.\" Yarne, although shuddering a tad, spoke as firm and brave in his words as he could muster, not intending to see two of his friends missing or hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start looking in the woods, if that's fine with you.\" he spoke. \"I'll tell Cynthia before I go so I can get some lookout; if I use 'Morgan' &amp; 'lost' in the same sentence, she'll surely jump at the opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Yarne.\" Now feeling more calm, Cordelia returned Brady's handkerchief and stood firm and tall once more. \"I'll notify Chrom, Robin, Libra, and Virion immediately, in that order. This is a manner of urgency and must be handled in such a manner as if we were all under attack. If you all have any more information to share, please do at once.\" The four boys smiled, happy that the army's pillar of strength returned to her former bravado, and saluted the Pegasus Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, break!\" On command, the four boys abandoned their camp inspection duties and went off to alert everyone they could, while Cordelia marched towards Chrom's tent as quick as she could, intending to nip this situation in the bud before it went out of control. <i>\"Dear Naga,\"</i> Cordelia thought, <i>\"Please keep Morgan and my baby safe!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera finally arrived at the lake she had bathed in and sat down, trying to get comfy as she settled her hands to the ground and overlaid her legs atop one another. <i>How perfect!</i> she thought, <i>\"I'm alone with the boy of my dreams, far away from those knuckle-dragging dipsticks back in camp, and we can watch the sun set together over the horizon! I must have the greatest luck ever, being huge is awesome!\"</i> Severa thought of maybe overpowering her mother some more as a show of who was now top dog in camp, but she still did love her mother enough not to hurt her, and was getting rather bored of her dancing in camp anyways. Severa stewed over the thought of where she and her prisoner could now go since they abandoned the army, since most places wouldn't exactly welcome a giant woman so easily, but she figured it was better off to save the thought for later and enjoy the moment. Severa remembered sticking Morgan into her bra as she was waltzing through the woods, tired of his cries for help on their \"romantic\" walk; she dug her hand into her right cup and removed Morgan from it, the young tactician was shuddering and looked scared out of his wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...\" Severa cooed while stroking the boy's hair with her finger, \"There's nothing to be scared of cutie-pie, I'm still the same old Severa you know and love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, please,\" begged the tactician, \"Can we go back to camp? I'm really scared right now, Mother and Father must be worried...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do short-stack!\" Severa replied as she rested Morgan down on her legs, near her loins. \"The sunset comes around this time, and it just has to be beautiful reflecting off this lake! Besides, whole army probably considers us AWOL right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?!\" Morgan cried, softly but still frustrated, \"You're the one who took me away from my work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I guess I did.\" Severa playfully stuck a finger to her lip, feigning deep thought as she continued to toy with her little captive. \"Oh well, let's forget about those small details! Now, how about you and I go on that date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, I already told you,\" Morgan replied pleadingly, hoping his words would get through, \"I'm already going steady with Cynthia, and I love her dearly, I can't just betray her like that, Father says breaking a girl's heart is one of the most evil sins you can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Cynthia, Cynthia, Cynthia! What's so great about her anyways?!\" Severa puffed her cheeks out, clearly steamed her crush chose her rival over her. \"I mean just look at her; she's a huge delusional dork who wants to be a superhero, she can't calm a horse to save her life, her hair's a putrid ash-white, her mother's a klutz, her father's a psychopath, and she's not even royalty! What's she got that I don't anyways?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a matter of sharing qualities,\" Morgan replied soft and kind, \"It's just that, well, Cynthia's sweet and nice, she never stops smiling, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that's how it is, huh?\" Severa replied in frustration, \"All the guys in camp say it, mean-ol' Severa can't get a boyfriend because she doesn't smile like a doofus, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, it's not that! It's just that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, let's see if I can change your opinion and get you interested in a real woman!\" Severa lowered her eyelids and gave an ear-to-ear grin as a naughty thought ran through her mind. \"Let's start by getting those stuffy old clothes off you so I can set the mood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?!\" Morgan looked horrified, he clutched his arms around his clothes, afraid of what was running through Severa's mind. \"Severa, don't! We can't just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh-uh! No 'if's, 'and's, or 'but's about it! But, I wouldn't mind seeing your 'but'!\" Severa giggled playfully at her own joke and wrestled off Morgan's coat, throwing it to her side as she began to work at his undershirt. \"Now, let's see how those abs look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, please stop! I...I...\" Instantly, Morgan began crying, completely despaired by the situation he found himself in. Severa instantly stopped her naughty actions upon hearing Morgan cry, she knew the boy was gentle and highly incapable of screaming or yelling at someone in anger, but she had no idea he was this much of a softie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, Morgan? Are you okay?\" Morgan curled up into a ball and continued to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I want to go home!\" he choked out in bursts of tears, overwhelmed by the situation. \"I miss Mom! And Dad! And Cynthia! A-And...!\" His sobs continued to get louder and more heart-wrenching, causing Severa to begin to feel guilt for what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey Morgan, look, I'm sorry about...What I was doing, okay? Please...Please stop crying...\" Morgan ignored Severa's pleas, too despaired to even think a happy thought, and Severa honestly felt like she would start crying herself. <i>\"This is bad...\"</i> she thought, <i>\"I didn't think he'd react this badly, I just wanted to spend some time with him! Why does Cynthia get to keep him?!\"</i> She looked upon the boy once more, face drenched in tears, and felt remorseful at her actions. <i>\"So much for the sunset. Is there any way I can salvage this?</i> Severa tried thinking of a way to keep her faux date extended, but couldn't think of anything; she thought maybe the best solution was to take Morgan back to camp and hope their friendship was still salvageable. Severa looked down at the tiny object of her affections, heartbroken by his loyalty to Cynthia, and tried reading his face for the next course of action.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you there</i>?\" The giantess and her captive stopped at the calls they heard; they could tell by the voice that it was Cynthia, out searching for her boyfriend. The repeated flaps of Pegasus wings confirmed her close proximity, and it brought Morgan back into a frenzy of joy, while Severa merely groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods, just what I needed...\" she mumbled, not ready to get chewed out by Cynthia; Severa already began wondering how many words she'd tumble over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Cynthia! We're down here!\" At the call of Morgan's overjoyed voice, Cynthia darted from her vantage point in the skies, and her face lit up when she caught sight of her blond-haired partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooorgaaaan!\" she cried, seemingly ignoring Severa in her burst of joy. In one fell dive, Cynthia managed to pluck Morgan from the giantess' open palm and safely land upon the ground with him, a move that quite nearly gave the young tactician a heart attack. \"Morgan!\" Cynthia cried, face blubbering with tears while she tightly hugged the boy, \"I was so worried! I didn't know what I would do if you were gone forever! I'd have to quit being a Hero of Justice and be a Hero of Sadness!\" While Morgan tried to return the back-breaking hug, Severa merely scoffed at the display, not trying to show how heartbroken she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd still be the Hero of Morons...\" Cynthia quit her theatrical display at Severa's voice, now aware to the fact that she was in the woods with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Cynthia cried, saddling up on her Pegasus and taking flight to stare the giantess down. \"Why'd you do it Severa?! Did you kidnap Morgan and try to eat him or something?!\" Severa's eyes bulged, and she looked terribly offended by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Excuse me?!</i>\" she cried, face turning red with anger as she continued the yelling match with Cynthia. \"For your information, just because I'm a little bigger now doesn't mean I'm a monster! What kind of screwed-up mind do you have to think I'd eat another person?! Especially the one I like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess you got a point there.\" Cynthia replied, remembering Severa indeed had a crush on Morgan too. \"But still, you can't just go out and kidnap people like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't kidnap him!\" Severa replied curtly, \"I just took him out of camp for some fun! Friendly, wholesome fun between two friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you take someone away from home without permission, it's still a kidnapping!\" Cynthia looked down at Morgan and called to him, hoping he'd add fuel to the argument. \"Morgan, did Severa kidnap you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, by your definition, yes, but Severa jus-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I totally knew it! You kidnapped him you, um...Kidnapper!\" Severa fumed inwardly at Cynthia's high-and-mighty attitude combined with her lack of vocabulary; she had the temptation to slap her rival out of the sky, but the impact would've surely killed her, and Severa wasn't dumb enough to let anger bump off her greatest rival and occasional ally. Instead, she took a deep breath and tried to speak calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Severa calmly spoke, \"In the heat of the moment, I overreacted, what with Chrom banning me from the front lines, Mom chewing me out; as much as I like being this big, I'll admit it led to some big problems alongside it. And I suppose I was a little...Jealous that you got to spend time with him more than me; I'll admit, that was no excuse to try stripping h-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>stripped</i> him?!\" Cynthia cried in shock, even she's never seen Morgan without a shirt on at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't all the way!\" Severa cried. \"Look, I realize what I did was wrong, and I was just on my way back to camp with him before y-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I showed up and stopped you from taking off his pants, you perverted kidnapper!\" Severa lost it then and there, not able to calmly speak anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawds!\" she cried, \"Can you let me finish?! What the hell does Morgan see in a moron like you anyways?!\" Severa turned her back to Cynthia and Morgan and began to walk away. \"I'm out of this dump! You two have a nice life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, wait!\" Morgan called, intending to get the Lady to open up more to him. \"Where are you going? We're all a team, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore we're not!\" Severa called back. \"I'm different now, and the rest of the camp can't accept that, so I'm going far away, where they'll appreciate a beautiful giant woman who can protect them!\" Severa shot her hand up in the air and gave a mocking wave back to the two. \"See ya Morgan, tell Mom and Dad I said bye! Hope your kids don't turn out to be dumbasses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa!\" Morgan called out. It was no use, Severa ignored her crush's cries and disappeared into the woods. Cynthia landed once more and gave Morgan a pat on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forget about her!\" Cynthia called, \"Severa's just mean and nasty anyways! We don't need her if she's going to be big, mean, and nasty to boot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia!\" Morgan shouted, softly yet sternly. He gave his girlfriend a light shove, which was about as physical as he would get with anyone but his enemies; though it felt like a mosquito bite, Cynthia knew the shove meant Morgan was about as angry as he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan,\" Cynthia replied back, \"What's wrong? Me and Yarne have been out trying to free you from that kidnapper, why're you mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm mad because we're all supposed to be friends in this army! And honestly, I think Severa's right, you can be a little pig-headed sometimes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Cynthia responded, \"That hurts! Besides, when has Severa ever done a good thing for anyone anyways?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does her assigned mess hall duties, she shines the armor up, takes the front-lines in every war...\" Morgan put a finger to his lip, thinking up another example, before snapping his fingers at the perfect one. \"When we were kids! Your voodoo doll Henry gave you broke, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember Dolly!\" Cynthia cried out. \"I remember, Father gave me that doll to play with and curse my enemies, and then I fell one day and he snapped in half! I was so sad! But then Severa came and fixed Dolly rig- Oh.\" Morgan folded his arms while the thought began to run through Cynthia's mind. \"Oh...Ohhh...Oh gods what have I done?! I just turned away one of our best friends from the camp because I was worried about you! Oh gods, I'm a monster, I don't deserve to be a hero!\" Cynthia began crying like a baby and Morgan embraced her, all too familiar to the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, I'd do the same thing in your boots.\" Morgan spoke gently, patting his girlfriend's back. \"I bet we can still get Severa back if we put our minds to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" Cynthia asked, stopping her crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we have to hurry! At this size now, Severa can cover more distance than a Pegasus could, even when walking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright!\" Cynthia cried, now all charged up, \"I got the fastest Pegasus in Ylisse, so catching up won't even be a problem for us!\" Cynthia grabbed Morgan by his arm and dragged him over to her Pegasus, nearly tearing off her boyfriend's arm with her enthusiastic might. The two sat upon the Pegasus and saddled up, Cynthia grabbed her reins and beckoned her Pegasus to take flight. \"Alright, let's go get back Severa!\" The two looked like they shot out of a cannon as they charged through the skies, looking for light-blue pigtails in a sea of green trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera stomped through the woods in anger, completely steamed by what had just happened, and overall frustrated with the events of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who does that damned girl think she is?!\" Severa cried out in anger, \"I do nothing but nice things for her since we were little, and <i>this</i> is how she thanks me?! By stealing the boy I like and accusing me of being some perverted monster?! Argh!\" Severa punched a tree in frustration, breaking the thing in two with her fist alone and with no bruising or cuts on her skin in turn. \"Well you know what?! If the camp thinks I'm some sort of monster, than maybe I should just live like one! Out in the woods, raiding villages, scaring the hell out of anyone who sees me! If they can't handle a giantess, they'll all get totally decimated by Grima!\" Just then, the memories of her time in the future raced through Severa's mind; her ruined home, her dead parents, the stench of death palpable in the air - the thought put a tear in Severa's eye as her lip quivered. \"...Again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera quit her rant and sat down against a tree, hugging her legs to her chest; in an instant, she began to sob uncontrollably, completely overwhelmed by how negatively the army reacted to her new size combined with her horrible memories. \"Why?!\" she cried, \"Why does nobody like me?! They don't like me when I'm small! They don't like me when I'm big! And nobody was around to like me when I was young! I just want to help, and I like the new me! So why can't anyone accept me for who I am?!\" Severa continued to cry and wail for a while, unable to think of anything to calm her down, and missing the sunset she went out to the woods with Morgan to see in the first place. Even though every day in the future was a living nightmare for her, Severa could definitely chalk this up as the worst day she had ever had.</span></div></div>",

She values what I say... kinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia forced a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing.\" She said in a artificially sweet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was too busy searching for Severa to notice or think about Cynthia's strange reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Severa walking speed was faster than Cynthia's flying speed, the fact that Severa had paused to vent allow the duo to gain ground. Severa's size and bright blue hair stuck out like a sore thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is!\" Morgan called out excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'll close in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia shifted her weight and the pegaus dived down, soon reaching Severa. The giantess was not happy to see them still sitting sullenly. She turned her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want? Come to berate me some more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Cynthia shook her head.  \"Severa I'm sorry I reacted the way I did, I'm sorry for being insensitive. You're not a monster your still uhh you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera rolled her eyes, though seemed slightly more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph. Glad you had the guts to say it. Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back with us, Severa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so everyone can treat me like a freak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one treated you like a freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Cynthia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I said I was sorry! And you kidnapped Morgan and half stripped him! What was I suppose to think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I really thought you were a monster, would I have come all this way to say sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not... but you did come here to drag me back to camp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Cynthia looked at each other for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well kinda. I mean we want you to come back but can't and won't make you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're way to big for us to drag along anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa is this about before? Because I'm sure most of the guys would be all over you if you just asked them out in a normal way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID FORGET IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of Severa's voice made Morgan, Cynthia and her pegasus flinch for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there's no need to shout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had enough of this.\" Severa said, getting to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of what?\" Cynthia asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People pushing me around, telling me what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shuffled closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all care about you Severa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if. I'm leaving again and this time don't follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa.\" The two tried to think of something they could say that might change her mind.</span></div></div>",

Severa stopped walking away and shuffled her feet together. She sighed, knowing full well her heart couldn't bear blowing Morgan off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn his good looks and kind heart...\"</i> Severa turned around to the two and stared Morgan directly in the eyes. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" he started, twiddling his thumbs together as he spoke, \"I know it won't mean much, since I'm already in a relationship, but if you stay with us in camp, I...I'll go on a date with you.\" Severa scoffed, not taking the offer as Morgan had intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little late for that, don't you think?\" Severa replied curtly. \"What's the point if I go out with you? Your heart already belongs to Hex-Girl, and you're really the only boy I liked like that in our group of friends. Thanks, but no thanks.\" Severa was about to turn away, when Cynthia spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, alright?!\" she called out, eyes looking like they were welling with tears. \"I didn't know you liked Morgan so much! He was just always there to brighten my day, so I couldn't help but fall for him! Look Severa, I know we've never really gotten along much, but deep down, you're my biggest rival and one of my biggest friends - now more than ever! So if you come back, I promise I'll break up with Morgan, then he'll be all yours, alright?! Just please come back home!\" Severa was stunned by Cynthia's heartfelt speech; it was still as dweebish as she normally was, yet Severa could feel a sense of warmth in it. She couldn't help but be shocked that the girl she presumed hated her the most was willing to give up her happiness just so they could all fight together once more; the act of selflessness responded well to Severa, especially considering her outburst not too long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd really do that for me?\" Severa asked. The giantess kneeled down and got to eye-level with the pair, Severa wiped down Cynthia's face with her index finger, drying the white-haired girl's eyes. \"I appreciate the offer, but you had him first, you can keep him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Severa! Please come ba-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moron! Let me finish!\" Severa took a deep breath and calmed herself again. \"Look, Daddy always taught me: \"All's fair in love and war\", and he especially held that first part true. I hate to admit it, but I'm a bit of a spoiled brat, and I really do detest the idea that some airheaded witch like you got Morgan first, but you beat me to the punch at something for once in your life, and I'm touched that you think whatever strained thread of a friendship we have is more important than your love life. Thanks, Cynthia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, does this mean you'll come back?\" Cynthia asked, confused by Severa's vernacular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawds! Do I need to spell it out for a idiot like you?! Y-E-S, yes, I'll come back to camp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Thanks Severa! I'm so sorry for what I said before, it'll never happen again!\" Cynthia lunged forward to give her rival a hug, but nearly fell off her Pegasus, prompting both Morgan and Severa to stop her from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright already, calm down!\" Severa stood back up and put her hands to her hips, speaking down to her comrades. \"And look, as an added bonus, I'll even let you keep Morgan for yourself! Who said I wasn't nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Severa, are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah! I'm a big girl, I'll get over it!\" Severa giggled at her height-related joke before turning her gaze back to Morgan, staring at him with lustful eyes and a devious smirk. \"But, since you brought it up, I'm looking forward to our private date, cutie-pie~!\" Severa giggled while Morgan gave a nervous chuckle, tugging the mouth of his shirt around his neck before gulping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"O Naga, please let this be the right choice...\"</i> Back to her usual pompous, yet cheerful mood, Severa stepped over the duo and took lead, turning her head back to look at the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get going, I'll take lead in case there's any brigands or Risen out in the woods waiting to attack. Besides, I want to give Morgan the full view of my best features~!\" Severa shook her hips provocatively, causing the young tactician to blush and Cynthia to puff her cheeks out in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I know I said what I said, but Morgan's still my boyfriend you know!\" Cynthia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just teasing, jeez! Get a grip! Let's just get back so I can throw a couple tents over my body and get an actual rest.\" With that, the giantess led her two friends through the woods, ready to get back to camp and get prepared for a better day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYarne bounded through the woods in his rabbit form, coming to a small clearing with a view of camp right through the trees. Yarne stopped himself in front of Cordelia and Inigo, both holding lanterns, and shifted back to his human form on sight of his allies. He sighed and looked at Cordelia with sorrowful eyes, afraid to give her any bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Miss Cordelia,\" began the bunny, \"But I searched everywhere for them, I couldn't find a thing.\" Cordelia bit her thumb in response, feeling guilty of what she said to Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My poor baby...\" she said, closing her eyes at the feeling of tears forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't your fault, Miss Cordelia, we all know Severa isn't the easiest lass to handle.\" spoke Inigo in a comforting fashion before turning to Yarne. \"Yarne, you're Taguel, aren't you? Can't they just, you know, use scents or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I tried to trace some scent of Severa's perfume from a broken bottle Ricken gave me, but it just led to her bow, some torn dress scraps, and her, uh...smallclothes...\" Inigo felt a hot flush of blood come up to his nostrils and stuck his hand to his nose to control the crimson flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well!\" responded Inigo, trying to calm himself, \"I'll, uh, just keep that in mind for the search tomorrow!\" The Prince wiped his face down with a handkerchief before turning to Cordelia. \"As it is now, we can't continue onward with the darkness setting in. I'm sorry Cordelia, but I'm afraid we'll have to pick up the search tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I understand...\" replied the Pegasus Knight, looking up and trying her hardest to force a smile. \"Thank you boys for all your help, Severa's lucky to have friends like you.\" Yarne looked a little fired up in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm not that brave in battle, but Severa's a friend, mean as she is; until I know she and Morgan are just fine, I'm gonna be brave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo.\" Yarne leapt and let out a girlish scream, tumbling over before turning round and coming face-to-face with Severa, leaning down to startle the group. The girl gave a smug smirk at her little trick and fully erected herself again, stepping through the trees with Morgan and Cynthia in tow behind her. \"So much for the brave bunny! Is <i>this</i> supposed to be my search party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa!\" Cordelia cried in joy, dropping her lantern and running over to hug her daughter's big toe. \"I'm so glad you're alright! I'm so sorry for what I said, I should've given you your space!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it Mom,\" replied the young Lady, breaking her toe from the hug and kneeling down to meet her mother, \"I should be the one apologizing, I acted like a huge spoiled brat back there when you were just doing that annoying motherly thing. I guess my new size is a big change for me too, not just you guys.\" Cordelia was touched by her daughter's epiphany and smiled warmly at her daughter. Morgan and Cynthia landed themselves upon the ground, rejoining Inigo and Yarne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you're in one piece Morgan!\" cried Inigo, patting his trusted friend on the back. He leaned in closer, branded eye looking directly into Morgan's, and whispered in his ear. \"So, how was your little 'boing-boing' ride? Slice of heaven, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't want to talk about it...\" replied a blushing Morgan, averting his gaze to the clearing's floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys seriously had us worried!\" Yarne spoke, heart now beating at an even pace. \"I really didn't want to think what would've happened if some brigands or Risen found you guys before we did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd squash them, that's what'd happen!\" replied Severa, giving a grin like she was ready to go on another power trip. Cordelia glared at her daughter, causing the girl to recoil and rethink her words. \"Right, sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine though!\" chimed in Cynthia, \"The forest was clear of any enemies, so we can stay put on this land for a couple more days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We talked it out on the way back,\" added in Morgan, \"Severa's not going to run off anymore, so no more camp emergencies for the time being either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Can I hold you to that Severa?\" Cordelia asked her daughter. Severa stood back up and addressed her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's high time I started acting my age! We're in a war! I frankly don't give a damn what Chrom's got to say or what his law is, but I'm not going to run away from it anymore, he's just gonna need to get used to having a giant in his army from now on!\" Cordelia looked up at her daughter with determination, pumping her fist in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you're this big, I'll help you every step of the way!\" Severa pumped her fist back and begun the lead walking off back to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm bushed! Let's get back to camp and get this over with!\" Cordelia wanted to look supportive to her daughter on this one, but had no idea how Chrom or Robin would react for basically kidnapping the junior tactician of the Shepherds, and worried that her daughter's punishment would just pile on further and further. Cordelia could only hope her husband managed to lessen Chrom's sentence and better his mood.</span></div></div>",

A map of the forest was streched across Chroms's desk, with a figure of Severa surronded by several of the other Shepard's. Ever the strategist, Robin had been drawing up a plan to confront Severa, before Virion rushed in and pleaded before them, dropping to one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But  Chrom... Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She kidnapped my son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom looked firm and serious, as he always did in a tricky situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one of the Shepards. How can we trust her after this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion scrambled for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being rendered at such a sudden size, it must have had a terrible effect on her mental state, maybe she'll return Morgan to us<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not buts. I put her on probation for bad behavior, and then she kidnapped Morgan! Even If comes back, we cannot trust her on the battlefield after this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming she does not go to rampage across the countryside or civilisation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion acted as though he had been struck, mixed in with his usual dramatic flourishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you say such a thing? Severa is still my daughter and the person we all knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom pursued his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that is the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin frown deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Morgan... we have to go rescue him. Please get out of my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion tried to block Robin's path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"  We must do everything we can to difuse the situation.  Cordelia already on her way, I'm sure she will be able to reason with Severa and convince her  to come back peacefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom folded his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if she does, how can we trust her after this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked deeped into there eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she does so, with Morgan unharmed, will it not prove her humanity is in tact?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin growled, not something she was known to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF he is unharmed. And even if that were the case, could we trust her to follow orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirison fidgeted with his cavet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin pushed past him, but Chrom merely looked at him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if Cordelia is trying to defuse Severa, why are you here and not with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion's fidgeting intensfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stopped, rolled her eyes and looked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you are here to \"defuse\" us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion smiled sheepishly, though mixed it with his usual swagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An astute observation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom also rolled his eyes. Seeing no other choice, Virion dropped to the ground, properly prostrating himself before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please lord Chrom, Miss Robin, I'm begging you on behalf of myself and Cordelia, if Severa does bring Morgan back to us, do not judge her too harshly. She is impulsive and stubborn, but not truly malevolent. I'm sure the shock fo the situation merely had a temporary effect on her mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom furrowed his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's eyes widned, almost outraged at his reaction..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom still seemed sure of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa will still be on probation, with more time added to it. If she is compliant, then I will accept what you have said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion raised his hands joyously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you most graciously!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still need to go get my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin took another few steps only to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Severa's size, she was easy to, and drew closer everyone second. She seemed much less sure of herself now, walking slower and looking at the ground, where as before she either walked in long strides or strutted. More difficult to see were the two pegasus riders flying nearby.</span></div></div>",

While normally careful and observant, Robin's maternal instinct overtook her logic, and she threw all caution aside, discarding any fear she may be squashed underfoot. Severa noticed Robin closing in and sighed, not wanting to deal with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Robin.\" she spoke, ego missing from her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap!\" Robin yelled, clearly aggravated her son was kidnapped. \"Where'd you take Morgan?! He better be safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you calm down?\" responded Severa, twitching a finger as if to tell Robin to lower her voice. \"He's safe, a little shaken up still, but safe regardless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where is he?!\" Robin shouted, feeling an urge to light the Lady's azure pigtails ablaze. \"Give him back <i>this instant!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Robin's anger was disrupted by the enthusiastic cry of a boy, and as she turned her head from Severa, Robin saw Morgan break through the crowd and run towards her, Libra walking in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan!\" Robin enveloped her arms around the boy, as Morgan did in turn, and began to spin the boy around in the air, holding him tight and kissing him intensely. \"Are you okay?! I was so worried about you, thank the heavens you aren't hurt!\" Morgan giggled as he received his affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Mom, really! A little too close to comfort with Severa, but...\" At the sound of Severa's name, Robin spun around to face Severa, still clutching Morgan tight to her, and got ready to hurl a venomous set of insults at the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already talked it over with her,\" Libra calmly stated, joining his wife and son, \"Severa had no ill intent on stealing away Morgan, it was merely her jealousy towards his relationship with Cynthia. While I don't agree with the...things she attempted to do with Morgan, I can see where she came from, and was welcome to hear her repent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What things?!\"</i> Robin inwardly thought as a series of lewd teenage scenarios flashed through her mind. She shook off her thoughts and protested her husband's logic. \"But Libra,\" she replied, \"This is our son! I don't care what her logic was, she can't just take our son away and pretend like nothing's wrong! How can you expect me to forgive her?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin,\" Libra replied, putting a hand to his wife's shoulder, \"Wrath is a sin, is it not? I don't disagree with your feelings, but we must forgive the wrongdoings of others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father's right,\" Morgan added in, looking directly into his mother's eyes, \"Can you please find it in your heart to forgive Severa? If not for her sake, then mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's a little too late...\" chimed in Severa, prompting Robin to lay eyes on her again. \"Look, Robin, I'm sorry I took your son away, it was wrong of me and totally in the heat of the moment, but let's be honest here; he's got dashing good looks.\" Robin furrowed her brow, and Severa looked for better words in response. \"Alright, look, it's not going to happen again, okay? I don't expect you to forgive me, but can you spare me the lecture til tomorrow at least?\" Robin struggled internally to decide between abiding by her family's wishes and forgiving Severa, or just chewing her out on the spot for a somewhat rude response; she tried to keep in mind Severa was still considered a friend, but what if she acted up again? Could Robin, as tactician, put the sake of the Shepherds' safety at risk with an impulsive, loose cannon egomaniac of a giantess running around camp, abducting boys for her pleasure and distracting the camp with petty displays for attention?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what's going on here?\" Chrom came forward with Virion in tow, joining the group gathered around Severa. Virion was overjoyed to see his daughter again, and ran forward to her as Cordelia touched her Pegasus to the ground to rejoin her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, my darling!\" Virion grabbed Severa's ankle and tried to wrap his arms around it, turning to Cordelia as he got situated. \"Cordelia, my dear, you truly are a great scout if you could find her in this short a time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's night-time, and I didn't exactly find her as much as she found me...\" Chrom interrupted the two by clearing his throat, bringing attention back to him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, but we need to get to the matter at hand here.\" Chrom sternly looked at Severa, adopting his supreme authority as he did before in hopes it would work. \"Severa,\" he started, \"I realize you are considered an asset to this team, skilled with both the blade and bow, and supportive to your allies; even now, the changes to your body give us a clear advantage in this war...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're too kind.\" Severa coyly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I cannot overlook your deeds ever since you grew; in just one day, you managed to distract all the men in camp with an inappropriate dance session, kidnap our head tactician's son and send the whole camp into a panic, and if Ricken's to be believed, you tried to <i>eat</i> him?\" Everyone looked shocked, while Severa merely shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wasn't the smartest decision in hindsight. It was more 'torture' and 'blackmail' than 'eating him' though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, you can't be doing these things, and I fear your size has given you an ego too big for this army.\" Chrom extended his arm forward and pointed at the giantess in a commanding fashion. \"From now on, you're off the field permanently until Ricken finds a cure for this! As added punishment, you're to take down and set up all of camp once we move spots! And if you abandon us one more time, you are to leave the Shepherds and take refuge in Regna Ferox until the war ends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's it? I thought you'd kick me out of this dump or something.\" Severa scoffed. \"Alright, fine, no more run-aways, no battle, but I'm <i>not</i> intending on getting small again, so don't blame me if I'm not around to save you from some Grimleal.\" Chrom looked stoic, but inwardly, he breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Gods, I can't believe that actually worked.\"</i> Chrom looked over at Cordelia and Virion and got their attention with his gaze alone. \"As for you two, you aren't in trouble, but you're to raise your daughter in a far more dignified manner, understand?\" Cordelia looked down, sulking, unable to protest her case against the man she harbored feelings for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, my Lord...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just wait the hell up!\" Chrom looked up and saw Severa leaning in at him, face red with anger. \"I don't care what you need to say about me, brutal as you can get, but there's no way in hell I'm standing by while you berate my parents, understand?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Buh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Buh' nothing! Mom and Dad raised me just fine when they were around, and they're doing a fine job now! Next time I hear you say anything like that to Mom, I'll drop my fist right on top of that ugly, meathead mug of yours!\" Chrom looked shocked, almost frightened, as Severa chided him. \"Now I'm tired, where the hell can I get some sleep around here without men crawling all over my body?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...M-Mess tent's cleaned out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Severa grabbed her parents and placed them upon her shoulder and then grabbed a stack of folded white tents. \"I'm taking these for blankets! Good night, Prince Jackass!\" With that, Severa coldly walked off towards the mess tent, leaving the army to look at their emasculated leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom, are you alright?\" Robin asked, concerned as Chrom kept looking down, traumatized by what just transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Do I really look like a meathead...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera reached the mess tent and set her parents to the floor as she crawled in, flipping around to get comfy. As Severa admired the perfect room and isolation from the other Shepherds, Cordelia and Virion were still stunned by their daughter's outburst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really didn't need to do that, you know.\" begun Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Kidnap Morgan?\" Severa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that whole rant against Chrom! If you weren't in hot water before-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, screw him!\" Severa replied, \"I'm not scared of him! I just didn't want you to look like some kind of doormat to the rest of the army!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear,\" Virion begun, \"While I appreciate the thought, this doesn't bode well for your punishment I so worked at trying to lessen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, nice job on that by the way. If it were any normal-sized girl, they'd have left the army by now.\" Severa stopped trying to get comfy and leaned forward to look at her parents. \"Look, I got over my problems with Morgan and Cynthia's help, but I'll be damned if I let Chrom scold you two for bad parenting. I've been a jerk ever since I got here, and you still get on my side whenever I ask for it. I really don't say this enough, but I love you guys.\" Severa gave a warm smile and grabbed her parents, bringing them close to her chest for a hug; the two smiled and hugged what they could in turn. \"Alright, I'm going to see how well I can manage to sleep at this size, so don't bug me, 'kay? Good night you two.\" Severa let her parents to the ground again and the two turned to leave for their shared tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Severa! We love you!\" they both called before leaving. With a smile on her face, Severa laid down and draped whatever she could of the tents around her body and laid the rest down under her head as a pillow; the cool grass underneath was a natural soft bed at Severa's size, feeling like a fine cloth couch. Severa ran over the events of the day in her head; she managed to become 50 feet of beauty and brawn, attract attention from every boy in camp with her beauty and outfit, work past a few emotional issues, and tell off Chrom &amp; get away with it in one day. Sure, there was some bad alongside all the good, but once she had hit the bottom, there was nowhere to go but up. As Severa drifted off to her dreams, one final thought entered her mind, and she spoke it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being this huge is going to be awesome.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Severa awoke the next morning with a yawn, getting up, stretching, and rubbing the sleep from her eyes, vision still blurry. She shook her head with a hand atop her forehead and spoke aloud to herself to confirm she was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had the strangest dream last night...\" she started, \"I drank a potion and became a giantess, and from there, I got a fan club from all the men in camp and got to push around Chrom...\" Looking around, Severa noticed that she wasn't in her usual tent, but in the mess tent, only it looked smaller than before. Severa looked around further and noticed she was sleeping under a pile of tents, and she wore a makeshift swimsuit out of torn tent fabric to cover her body. \"Oh, that's right, it wasn't a dream!\" Severa giggled and sprang from her rest; she crawled out of the mess tent and stood fully erect, towering over the other tents in camp and head just slightly higher than the surrounding treetops. Severa looked at the sun and stood firm, ready to start her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera began walking through camp slowly and carefully, making sure not to step on any of her comrades, and waved back to the soldiers who gave wished her a good morning or gave catcalls. Severa noticed they were fully dressed and ready for action, and combined with the hue in the blue sky, Severa realized it was a bit later in the morning than she usually awoke. <i>\"I must've overslept,\"</i> she thought, <i>\"Now that was a good rest last night!\"</i> Severa closed into the tent of her parents with each step she took; Cordelia and Virion were sitting on some boxes, heating a barrel of food and a small pot of stew with a fire tome. The two looked at their daughter and smiled, happy to see her in bright spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Severa!\" called Virion, cheerful as ever. Severa sat down and crossed her legs, getting comfy as she smiled down at her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Dad, Mom.\" Severa sniffed the scent of the barrel heating before her and looked over the food. \"Smells good, what are you cooking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast.\" Cordelia replied. \"You actually woke up at the perfect hour, I thought we could all eat together as a family! We didn't have enough stew ingredients to go around for us all, so we had to cook you something else instead; I hope that's alright sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I realize it could get hard to feed me.\" Severa stuck a finger in the barrel intended for her and licked it, trying to judge the taste. \"Mashed potatoes, with a hint of cabbage. Where the heck did you guys get all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not, the rest of the soldiers in camp donated extras from their meals this morning!\" Virion replied cheerfully. \"Why, if I remember correctly, the fellows handed over their potatoes one-by-one, saying: 'Lady Severa can have as much food of mine as she wishes, so long as she continues that dancing!'\" Cordelia shot Virion a small glare. \"O-Of course I told them that your mother prefer you didn't! I hope that's to your liking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not complaining, it keeps me fed!\" Severa grabbed the barrel and started chugging the potatoes as if they were mead, while Cordelia and Virion began ladling stew into separate bowls and digging into their meals. As Virion watched his daughter chow down, he cleared his throat and begun an anecdote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Virion began as Severa looked up from her meal, \"Long before my family begun the Dukedom of Rosanne, we were merely a family of Valmese farmers. Why, it was my great-great-great-great-great grandfather who ran a potato farm before he led a campaign to reform the nation; legend tells that he looked over the crop of his farm and said: 'This dirt is poor, yet what grows from it has become nice and big, beaming with radiance, like the people of this nation! I wish for all my descendants to become strong and healthy just as my crop has!' Why, if only he were alive today to see how you have grown big like the potatoes he treasured so!\" While Virion expected awe, he only received looks of confusion from his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, not all fathers compare their daughters to potatoes...\" Severa responded. \"I mean, I guess it was a good enough story. Thanks Dad, I guess...\" Virion didn't know whether to attempt to reaffirm his story's point or not, so he just smiled and took the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia came by before you came,\" Cordelia stated, \"She said that Chrom just looked very distressed and sounded very self-conscious this morning; what you said really must've had an effect on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?!\" Severa asked. \"Who would've thought I could intimidate the Exalt just like that?! That's hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Severa,\" Cordelia responded, \"It's not polite to take pride in others misery. You should probably apologize to Chrom when you get the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fat chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine! But he needs to apologize to you two first, and I need to hear it! I'm not just going to let him get away with whatever he wants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Severa, he is the rightful Exalt of Ylisse, he does have some weight to back his words.\" Virion added in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm the rightful Lady of Rosanne with 10 times whatever weight he's packing. No apology, no apology, that's just how this is going to work.\" Cordelia and Virion nodded as Severa chugged another helping of potatoes. \"Has Robin said anything to you two yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Cordelia replied, \"She doesn't seem like the type to hold grudges, but she did look angry last night. I talked to Libra through, he and Morgan seem to forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Libra is Libra, and we all know how nice Morgan is.\" Severa responded, taking down another swig of her breakfast. \"I just don't want her to keep me from seeing Morgan, I still want to be friends with the little booger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really did like him, didn't you?\" Severa shuffled her feet around at her mother's question and hugged her knees to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not, dear Severa,\" Virion replied, \"I promise that when the war ends, we will find you a charming rogue who can calm your aching heart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want a rogue though!\" Severa replied, \"I wanted Morgan! There's never going to be anyone cuter and nicer to me than that boy, and I let it slip through my hands, just like that! I mean, Cynthia's nice and all, but really? Cynthia? Now that's just kicking a girl while she's down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Severa,\" Cordelia replied, closing her eyes for a minute, \"I believe we had a conversation like this yesterday; Long ago, my heart ached for Chrom, and I was absolutely devastated when he chose Olivia to be his bride. I spent a lot of time alone and took up some drinking to ease the pain until your father came along and started filling my head with his kind words, until eventually, I just up and stopped thinking about Chrom romantically, just like that. It may hurt now, but I guarantee you, that perfect boy will come along some day; maybe in this camp, or maybe in some far away kingdom - but they'll come and steal your heart away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's indeed correct!\" Virion added in, \"My head was filled with the bewitching charms of another woman long ago myself until she was married, and like a moth to a flame, I found myself attracted to your mother as a kindred spirit, and I've never been happier since! Just keep your chin up, you're a strong girl, a wise girl, and - dare I say - a big girl now! The world is your oyster, my dear daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I get it, thanks guys. It might be a bit hard finding a boyfriend who can handle me at this size though, don't you think?\" The group giggled and got back to their meals, Severa neared the bottom of her barrel before a thought hit her. \"Wait a minute, who was this 'other woman' you fell for Dad?\" Virion stopped and adjusted his cravat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now! T-There's no need to go over the details of that!\" Cordelia looked at her husband with a smug smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Virion, I thought you had an anecdote for everything?\" coyly replied the Pegasus Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, there's a time and a place, and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Daddy, pleeeaaaseee~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sully. It was Sully.\" Severa erupted into laughter while Cordelia giggled, clearly having heard the story before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sully?! Really?!</i>\" howled the Lady with laughter. \"Dad, I thought you were into <i>women</i>! What in Naga's name made you want to marry <i>Sully?!</i>\" Virion looked red with embarrassment while Severa chugged her barrel between spurts of laughter. Once done with breakfast, Severa dropped the barrel and got up, wiping her lips off. \"Well, that was my laugh for the day! I think I'm gonna swing by the lake and take a quick bath before I get the rest of the day done with. Thanks for breakfast Mom, Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good bath sweetie!\" called Cordelia, giving an energetic wave. Virion tried his best to wave with a straight face, but just looked embarrassed and defeated. Severa walked off into the woods, now breaking into a stride towards the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached it a short while later, Severa disrobed herself and hung her makeshift outfit from a few branches before undoing her pigtails and walking into the lake. Like before, she dived under a few times to cleanse her upper body and began scrubbing herself, wiping dirt and potato from her body. \"I'm going to need a new lake soon at this rate.\" she commented, watching the white clumps disappear from her arms and under the water. Severa leaned back and looked up at the clouds, wondering what move she should make next. <i>\"What's the plan for today?\"</i> she thought, <i>\"Should I go pay Morgan a visit? Maybe talk with Cynthia about last night? I don't really feel like dancing today, I need a new routine...</i> As Severa thought it over, she basked in the beauty of the clouds in the clear sky, for once, actually taking pleasure in a world where the sky wasn't covered in smog and ash.</span></div></div>",

The girls would certainly be more likely to act something close to normal around her, but they probably wouldn\u2019t be wooed by her charms. Well unless any played for the other team or were\u2026 curious, which would be an amusing way of finding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thinking of Morgan made her feel something deep inside. He was so sweet, so innocent despite everything everyone had gone through and caring and smart\u2026 well kind of. But even his ditzy moments could be charming in an odd way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupid Morgan, making her feel like this. She had to go see him today. Robin wouldn\u2019t like that, but so what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a pang in her stomach. Wasn\u2019t he already with Cynthia? But then Cynthia had given her permission\u2026. Would Morgan ever choose her over someone as nice and sweet as Cynthia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. Probably not, but she still wanted to see him. Even if nothing more came of it..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off that lingering feeling of dread, Severa got out of the lake and dried herself off as quickly as she could and strode off for to Morgan\u2019s camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and his family were relaxing in their tent, only to be jolted by the impact of Severa\u2019s steps .The Shepard\u2019s were getting used to Severa\u2019s tread but as the sound grew louder and louder, Robin growled. She clenched her fists and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Severa, she\u2019s coming this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibra was erriely calm, as usual, still drinking his tea.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\u201cShe has no doubt come to see Morgan again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let her kidnap our boy again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not going to do that again.. I think. She probably just came to say hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibra stood up and placed an arm around Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin, she willingly returned Morgan to us and  has apologized for what she did. Prehaps she is merely here for atonement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnlikely!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibra sipped some tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps not, but we all deserve second chances, do we not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Robin could respond, Severa poked her head through the tent flap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, is Morgan around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robin had every urge to chew Severa out for yesterday, especially now knowing what she tried to do after Libra explained it to her last night, but she instead took deep breaths and internally counted, trying to take her mind off the giant before her. <i>\"Deep breaths Robin,\"</i> she thought, <i>\"She hasn't done anything else to aggravate me yet, just play it cool and she'll eventually leave.\"</i> Morgan walked forward to greet his friend, having recovered from yesterday's far too intimate event with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Severa!\" he greeted with his usual cheer, \"Any reason you wanted to see me today?\" From outside the tent, Severa fidgeted and twiddled her thumbs together; inside the tent, she blushed a little bit and gave a small smile, looking sideways as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I dunno...\" she replied, feigning ditziness, but bordering on the actual feeling. \"I guess I couldn't keep you out of my mind this morning, go figure. Maybe we could, I dunno, try that date out?\" Severa stopped herself when she realized how warm her voice was getting, remembering that Morgan was already spoken for. \"F-For friendship of course! Nothing else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" replied the boy. \"Dad, Mom? Can I go hang out with Severa today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course, Morgan.\" replied Libra with his usual warm smile. Robin however scowled, motherly instinct taking over her forgiving nature and kinship with the other Shepherds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just hold it!\" Robin shouted, losing whatever cool she could muster. \"Morgan, do you really think it's wise to just forget everything that happened yesterday? She tried to <i>strip</i> you for Naga's sake!\" Severa winced at Robin's mention of yesterday's events, she really just wanted to forget that entire stupid, selfish episode she had and start anew. Morgan did not react in such a way, instead taking a breath and calmly responding to his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, I am well aware of what happened yesterday, but I'm not going to let that ruin a good friendship with Severa. We all make mistakes, it just means we're all human.\" Human - Severa liked that word, it reminded her that people still remembered she was a person and not some giant monster, not just her parents. \"Please, can I go? I promise we'll both behave.\" Robin folded her arms, not content with her son's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but still...\" Robin mumbled. \"Morgan, you're smart, I know that, but I can't just trust Severa so soon. It's a motherly thing, you understand, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Robin?\" Severa spoke up, prompting the tactician to stare the Lady in the eyes. \"You're not wrong in mistrusting me, hell, sometimes I don't even trust myself on some things. But for just this once, can you throw me a bone? I still want to be friends with your son, but I won't blame you if you don't want me seeing him again.\" Robin shut her eyes and took some deep breaths again, thinking up the possible scenarios that could play out with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Where would you be taking him today?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Severa replied, \"Just somewhere out of camp for today. Could you let Chrom know if I do by the way? I know you have as much pull in camp as him, and I'm not exactly looking to talk to him anytime soon.\" Robin inwardly fumed, trusting Severa less and less now knowing she wasn't speaking to Chrom. Libra saw his wife working her mind over and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgiveness, Robin.\" he spoke, \"Remember the virtues of life.\" Robin calmed herself at Libra's words and finished her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll allow it,\" she replied to the giantess, \"But you're to spend time in the woods if out of camp, and in secrecy so you don\u2019t cause a scene with the townsfolk nearby. I'm setting a curfew for sunset exactly, any more time and I'll let Chrom place whatever judgment he wants on you.\" Robin pointed directly at Severa's face. \"And another thing: If I find out you've done anything lewd with my son today, then there'll be hell to pay, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. Thanks Robin.\" replied Severa with a smile. \"All right, let's go Morgan!\" Severa pulled her head out of the tent, and both Morgan and Robin followed, the latter staying near the tent flaps so she could get back to her book soon. Morgan allowed himself to be picked up by his huge friend; Severa intended to rest the boy on her breasts for a cushion, causing Robin to grimace at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for safety!\" Severa replied, \"I don't want him falling and hitting his head!\" Robin merely growled in response. \"Fine!\" Severa sat Morgan upon her shoulder instead and walked off to the center of camp with her passenger on board. Robin sighed when the two were out of sight and retreated back into her tent with a hand upon her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to be more trusting.\" Libra spoke to his wife, attention focused directly on her. Robin flopped upon her cot and sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just...Look, see it from my perspective: What would you do if your son got kidnapped and the kidnapper just wanted to come back and visit the next day? Would you be so trusting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan is my son too, you know.\" Robin groaned as Libra got up and joined his wife on the cot; he placed a hand to her head to help relieve her tension. \"I understand where you come from. Severa is undoubtedly different now, and what she is capable of now is indeed a frightening thought, but she is still a person, like the rest of us. We must all be respectful towards the needs of others, and what Severa needs right now is a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d Robin said as she sat up on the cot. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t be so judgmental. I\u2019m sure Severa knows enough authority and care to bring Morgan back safely and on time\u2026I hope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s the woman I fell in love with.\u201d Libra replied with a smile. He brushed away Robin\u2019s hair and kissed her on the forehead, bringing a smile to the stressed tactician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera sat upon a large stack of weapons crates and removed Morgan from her shoulder, instantly resituating the boy in between her breasts. Morgan blushed and looked up at his friend, confused by her action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSevera,\u201d he replied, \u201cDidn\u2019t Mother say not to do that?\u201d Severa scoffed at Morgan\u2019s words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of what she said,\u201d she replied with a huff, \u201cBut I\u2019m not taking any chances. One gust of wind or if I trip backwards, then you\u2019re a goner from this height. I\u2019d rather you take the cushioned seats, if you catch my drift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I can see your logic there, but didn\u2019t you put your parents on your shoulder last night when you went to bed? Shouldn\u2019t you care about their safety more?\u201d A hot blush came over Severa\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-That\u2019s because they have more balance! There's no need for safety with them! They're used to it, dummy!\" Morgan gave a playful giggle, realizing Severa's true intent by her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll play along for now, just to make her happy!\"</i> Morgan thought to himself before clearing his throat. \"Okay Severa, safety first after all! But is it alright if I sit in your palm right now before we go?\" Severa nodded and grasped Morgan, opening her palm up and allowing the boy to sit on the edge of her hand, easier for conversation. \"Thanks Severa. So, do you have any place in mind in the woods? We could go bird-watching, I have some great reference books on local wildlife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had a place in mind, just not the woods.\" Morgan tilted his head at the response, not understanding the context. \"How about you and I go to town for lunch? If I'm stuck eating potatoes for the next couple of days, I'm gonna go crazy.\" Morgan looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa! We can't do that!\" he protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'll pay you back, not like I'll be buying any new clothes soon anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that!\" the boy responded, \"You heard what Mother said! We can't cause a scene with the townsfolk, or else Chrom will kick you out of the Shepherds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan, I'm gonna let you in on a secret.\" Severa leaned down closer to Morgan. \"I'm not afraid of Chrom, but if last night is any indication, he sure as hell is afraid of me. He says he can remove me from the army, but even as we speak, he's in his tent shaking in his royal boots. Let's just live a little for now, and then worry about the rest later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't someone see you Severa? No offense, but it's not really easy to hide a giant woman from a town full of people.\" Morgan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a tactician, aren't you?\" Severa responded, \"It can't be that hard to find a way to sneak me into town for your brain! If it's really that bad, then just get some take-out and we'll have a little picnic.\" Morgan thought the situation over carefully, examining all the options presented to him. He could go with Severa's plan and go out for lunch with her, which would be sure to keep his dear friend happy, but at what cost?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If what Severa said is true,\"</i> Morgan thought, <i>\"Chrom is no threat, but Mom and Miss Cordelia definitely won't be happy with us, I don't want our families to fight. I could always take the blame for Severa if word comes back from town, but Mom would definitely figure it out, and I don't think Cynthia would be too happy with me if I took the blame for something so reckless. I could always just keep at the bird-watching idea, maybe Severa would think it's fun if the finches are in season...\"</i> Morgan looked up into Severa's hazel orbs, looking back down at him with expectation. <i>\"Oh Severa, don't look at me like that! I don't want to get you in trouble!\"</i> Morgan kept batting the ideas around in his head, looking for the best solution.</span></div></div>",

Maybe they'll think I'm the most beautiful woman they've ever seen! Cause the boys at camp certainly liked this!\" She patted her butt, though from where he was, Morgan could only see part of her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but that's because the guys at camp already knew you, the people in town might think your- uhh.\" Morgan cut his sentance short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera placed both her hands on her hips and glowered down, leaning in until her head was directly above him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monster?

You can be such a nerd sometimes, you know that?\" Severa got up and put her hands to her hips, looking down at her chest-bound passenger. \"But you're going to buy me some take-out from that place in town that sells the racks of lamb before our next march, got it? I'll pay you back whatever it costs.\" Morgan looked up at Severa and gave her a warm smile, happy his dear friend could listen to reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Severa!\" he cried, \"I promise to buy you whatever food you want so long as you're this big!\" With a small smirk, Severa got up from her resting place and walked off into the woods with Morgan, ready to try and enjoy the day with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Severa! It's a family of deer!\" It was hour four of Severa and Morgan's nature hike, and while the boy was enthusiastic, busy at work with both a sketchbook and a notebook, Severa was bored out of her wits. She sat with her legs bunched up to her chest and her chin resting upon her hand, trying to resist every urge to fall asleep on Morgan; rude as she was, she at least had the manners not to fall asleep on dates. Morgan was hard at work surveying the nature around the two of them, skipping and dancing around the forest as if it were a wonderland; a flock of birds flew from a treetop, prompting the boy to point them out. \"Severa, look at that! It's a flock of Summer Tanagers! They aren't even supposed to be in this season! Look at how pretty they are, a full scarlet coat! What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I think?\" Severa responded, looking up from her daze at Morgan. She unbunched her legs and flopped over backwards, laying on the floor of the forest and staring up at the clouds. \"This suuuucks!\" she groaned, flopping her arms about. \"I can't even see half these birds because they're too damned small, there's not a single trace of civilization this far out, and we can't even try for the sunset again because 'Empress Robin' stuck a curfew on us! This blows!\" Morgan walked over to Severa and stuck a hand on her arm, not even remotely looking hurt by her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair enough,\" Morgan responded, \"You never really were a 'forest girl' type when we were growing up anyways. Still, sorry about making you come out here, I just value your safety as a friend, too many risks with the nearby towns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's not your fault.\" Severa replied as she sat up again, turning her head to stare down at the tiny tactician. \"I'm just a little bored, alright? Daddy's cushy life choices just kinda rubbed off on me early on, the woods just isn't my thing, compared to a nature-freak like you. If it's fine, can we just spend the last bit of time, you know, just talking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright!\" Morgan replied, putting away his notebooks in his coat. He sat upon a small flat rock with his hands to his thighs and looked up at his giant friend with his usual cheerful demeanor. \"So, what do you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\" Severa stumbled with a hand to her chin; even though she suggested it, she had no ideas about what to talk about. After a couple seconds, she snapped her fingers, finally having a thought. \"I got it! Boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk about boys?\" Morgan asked. \"Gee Severa, I'm already taken for, and even then, I don't think I'd swing like tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that, you blockhead!\" Severa responded. \"Gawds! I probably should've just hung out with the girls today! No, what I meant was romance advice, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That's what you meant! Duh!\" Morgan playfully gave himself a light knock on the noggin before getting back on topic. \"So Severa, what kind of advice do you need? Father and Mother taught me a lot about situations like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Severa started, twiddling a pigtail around with her fingers. \"Considering you're already dating Dopey, the Magical Knight, I figure I need to get over you eventually and find another boy to be my tiny Duke. Mom said I'll find someone that'll help me get over you, but I just can't see it; you're way too nice and cute to just get over, and that shiny blond hair...\" Severa shook her head, rubbing her hands erratically through her hair. \"Argh! Being in love sucks! I just want you to help me find a boy, okay?! Give me some advice here, Mr. Junior Tactician!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright!\" replied Morgan, as he put his hand to his chin and got up thinking some ideas. \"Well, first off, what traits do you want to see in a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I guess they need to be cute, that's a definite, they need to love me and only me, and they need to be able to carry their own weight so I don't need to rescue them constantly...\" Severa thought it over a bit more, letting the gears in her head turn slowly. \"...I guess they'd need to be a good cook &amp; a good hunter, since I'm going to be eating a lot more from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems like a pretty steep list...\" Morgan replied. He let the thoughts run in his head a bit more, trying to think up specific examples in the army, specifically, in their group of future-friends. \"Well, how about Gerome? He's strong, he hunts a lot, and he's a good cook to boot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He fits the bill, sure,\" Severa responded, \"But he's too serious all the time; what's the point of dating if I can't tease him with my body? Besides, that mask thing he's got going on is creepy, and he has an attitude like sandpaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, then what about Laurent?\" Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Science nerd, no fun, I can't even find the guy half the time to talk with him for meetings. Next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a little cute, sure, but that thing he does with naming the weapons and screaming attack names is absolutely creepy and weird. Next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yarne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Total coward, next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His face looks like it was run over by a carriage, next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inigo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would rather stick my head in a bee's nest then ever have to hear another one of that perverted moron's little compliments ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that just about covers everyone in our circle of friends...\" Morgan thought it over a bit more. \"Did Miss Cordelia say anything else when you were talking with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...I think Mom said something about a 'far away kingdom' or something, like we'd have to look outside of Ylisse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that could be a start...\" Morgan tried to think up any faces he might've seen in Valm or Regna Ferox that Severa would've thought cute, but nothing came to him. \"Well, let's try this: What's your idea of a dream boy? Describe to me the perfect men you could see yourself marrying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect men, huh?\" Severa closed her eyes and tried to imagine the perfect dream boy for her. \"Let's see...Maybe a cool, Pegasus-riding warrior, or a strong-willed, easy-going Cavalier, ooh, or a nice, strong, blond-haired hunk of Prince! I could marry into royalty if I play my cards right! But then I'd have to stay there instead of going back to see my parents...\" Severa shook her head in frustration and opened her eyes again. \"Ugh! Even thinking of a dream-boat is a chore! Sorry Morgan, but I still got you on my mind, and it's hard to get you off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's alright, I feel we've definitely made some breakthroughs here!\" Morgan got up from his seat and walked a little closer to Severa. \"I'll see what I can do on my end, maybe I can find a secret admirer for you in our circle of friends and I could set you two up. And hey, if there's no spark there, once we defeat Grima, then we'll go off to find you that special dream-boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Severa asked, touched, \"You'd really do that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! We're friends! It could be you, me, and Cynthia off on a big journey together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you were doing good up until that part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right...\" Morgan responded, \"Well, regardless, we're always here to help!\" Severa gave a huff, but she wasn't annoyed or upset in any way, rather, she gave a light smile to her tiny friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Morgan. You're a dumb little squirt sometimes, but you got heart to back those good looks. You make me feel...human.\" Severa looked up at the sky and noticed the tone of orange that was starting to overtake the blue, the sign sunset was coming soon. \"Great,\" Severa growled, \"We must've spent a while out here, and I took you so far out too chasing after that pack of boars; the last thing I want is for your mother to tear me to shreds.\" She turned back towards Morgan. \"You ready to go home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, I think I held you hostage out here quite enough!\" Morgan joked. Severa stood up and picked Morgan up from the ground, resting him in-between her breasts again and beginning to tread back through the dense forest they traveled into, towards camp before the sun finally set.</span></div></div>",

Who else  you got in mind for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought this through, pretty much everyone who joined the Shepard's before us have found a special someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know, that's how we're all here in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what about the people who joined AFTER us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera stopped and bent down, staring blankly at the tactician. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean those people Chrom picked up recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera placed a hand to her head, as though she had a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Morgan wasn't dettered, as bright and cheery  as ever when he was relaying a successful strategy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about you're preferences, and the closest match I could think of was Yen'fay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera responded without a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pass. That guy is just like Gerome, just without the mask. His attitude isn't any better either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure he just wasn't interested in you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan quickly cut himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind there are others. I bet no one is stronger than Walhart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, that guy is crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from that there's Gangrel-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>\"NO!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volume of her voice stunned Morgan, briefly causing him to lose his train of thought, though he wasn't surprised Severa react that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you'd say.

He clung on to the end of her bra to avoid being thrown off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Severa was in thought. For a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I dunno, he is strong but he's kind of weird. Does he even like women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People said the same thing about the Radiant Hero Ike and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera looked incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he REALLY Ike's descendant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I mean if Mist had the kid and Ike trained him, would it still count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera stared blankly then shrugged with all the apathy she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? Not all of us enjoy reading boring old wars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan bristled, standing as tall as he could manage, which wasn't actually an impressive sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There not boring! You can learn a bunch of interesting tactics from their battles, like when-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Would I even like him? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan relaxed, confident in his plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's strong, and if I understand what women are attracted to, he's good looking, i think even Cynthia get's gooey eyed when starts talking, at least until he starts going on about chi or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera soured at that name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked a little desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Severa, he's the last eligible guy in the army, if you turn him down I'll run out of options!\" He stopped before lighting up again as new inspiration struck. \"Unless you're into woman, in which case that opens a whole lot more. I bet Kjelle would be a great match for you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh fine!  I guess I can meet him, but would he even be into me?

Severa didn't want to give up her cushy life so easily, especially now that she could enjoy it from a whole new perspective, and scouring the globe looking for strength didn't sound appealing; if her silver tongue was persuasive enough, she could get Priam to serve as captain of Rosanne's military force and sate his thirst for strength like that. Then came the issue of age, she didn't want some weird age-gap relationship going on between the two of them, the less stares in the army, the better. \"How old is this guy again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last I checked, 20 years.\" replied Morgan. Severa reeled back in shock, sending the small boy tumbling around between Severa's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?!\" she replied, \"That guy's built like a brick house, how did he get so strong at 20?!\" Severa thought it was perfect, in theory; she was 18, so any relationship they may share might look normal, at least, as normal as you can get between a bear-wrestling mercenary and a rich, snobby giantess. Severa gave it a bit more of a thought, crossing her arms, eyes shut, weighing the options in her head, before giving Morgan her response. \"...Alright, I suppose I could give it one date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Morgan cried, \"That's wonderful! I'll search him out tomorrow and Cynthia and I can set you up a date!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, it's <i>one</i> date, alright? If I don't like this guy, then it's back to the drawing board with you!\" Severa removed Morgan from her breasts and set him upon her shoulder again, remembering Robin's reaction to Morgan's comfy vantage point, and continued marching onto camp with the boy in tow. \"This better work Morgan; if this war goes on any longer, I might just go gay before I find a little Duke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it's going to go well Severa!\" replied Morgan with his usual cheer. He sat quietly for a brief moment while the trek back to camp continued, before turning back to Severa's cheek. \"Hey, if you were to fall in love with a woman, who would it be if not Kjelle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why the hell do you want to know that, you creep?!\" Severa replied, face reddened, taken aback by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I'm just a little curious is all!\" Severa sighed, letting out some blush with the exhale, and gave the query a brief thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, probably Lucina. She's strong and beautiful enough, and being royalty of two kingdoms wouldn't be that bad of a thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see! So that's how it is!\" Severa's blush returned again at Morgan's answer, despite the innocence of his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's that supposed to mean?! You don't give an answer like that when asking something so personal!\" Severa tried to wrestle Morgan down upon the flesh of her shoulder with her finger, careful not to put to much pressure on the boy or drop him, while the tactician just laughed heartily, happy to be spending time with his dear friend and helping her out to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stood outside of her tent, not brandishing her signature coat, as she stared intensely at a pocket watch. \"It's almost sundown...\" she spoke, biting down on her finger in anticipation and doing double-takes between the sky and her watch. Libra, in the process of chopping firewood, took notice of his wife's worry easily, the sight almost distracting him from his duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin,\" he spoke, \"Please do not worry, I'm sure Severa will be back with Morgan without any problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Libra, you're too relaxed, or maybe you're just too forgiving.\" replied the tactician, not taking her eyes off the minute hand of her watch. \"It's almost 6:00, what if Severa just decided to steal our baby again? With her size, she could easily just run off and nobody would catch her, it's the last problem we need on our march.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we not talk about this earlier today? I understand your worry, but we must place trust our comrades. If you worry about protecting Morgan from Severa, then you might as well just drink Ricken's potion yourself to match her stature.\" Robin broke from her concentration at Libra's somewhat sarcastic comment and rubbed her hand to her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? That actually isn't a bad idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bother...\" replied the clergyman, putting a hand to his forehead. The two began to feel a soft rumble coming closer to their tent, and in a mere matter of seconds came Severa into view, with Morgan upon her shoulder. Robin folded her arms and adopted a look of smug satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like you are capable of following direction at this size, I'm impressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, laugh it up, real funny; at least I'm a giant and not a fell dragon.\" Robin fumed inwardly at Severa's response, but recognized she probably deserved it for the way she spoke. Gently, Severa removed Morgan from her shoulder and let him down near his mother; almost immediately, Morgan ran over and gripped part of Robin's tank top, excited to tell his mother about the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great Mom! You should've been there! We saw deer, boars, bears, and a whole multitude of birds, some of which weren't even supposed to be around this season! Nature really is a beautiful thing!\" Robin smiled and ruffled the boy's soft golden hair, wrapping an arm around his shoulder once she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear! And Severa, was she good on this trip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! She's still nice and helpful you know! In fact, Cynthia and I are gonna help her find a boyfriend from here on out!\" Severa's face reddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't go around telling the whole camp!\" Robin giggled, feeling a sense of schadenfreude at Severa's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you had a good time Morgan.\" Robin turned back towards Severa. \"Thank you for taking care of my boy, I bid you good-night.\" Robin turned around and began walking to her tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin...\" Libra spoke. The tactician stopped in her tracks; she took a deep breath and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa?\" she asked, catching the giant's attention. \"Look, tonight we're...I mean we're going to...What I'm trying to say is...\" Libra sighed and put down his axe, stepping forward to take over for his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa,\" he spoke calmly and warmly, \"Tonight, we intended to have dinner with your parents, separate from the mess hall in order to discuss your predicament, or rather, fortify the relationship between your family and ours. I've taken the liberty of inviting Cordelia &amp; Virion, and Cynthia insisted on joining as well; if you could join us tonight, we would be honored, and we promise to make you feel right at home.\" Severa sighed and set a hand to her chin, impulsively tapping her cheek with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's not like I have a choice if you've already invited my parents; it's almost as if <i>I'm</i> the one who's being held hostage now. What time is this again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've decided on 8:15, in order to give you time to prepare.\" replied Libra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know exactly what preparation I can do, it's not like they make a makeup brush in my size. I guess I'll shake some twigs out of my hair and see you guys then.\" Libra gave a warm smile and Morgan cheered, excited by the proposition, but Robin didn't look too happy about it, rather worried in fact. Severa turned around and gave a wave, walking back to her parents' tent in an upbeat stride. \"See you guys in a few!\" she called out while continuing her stride. The two boys waved while Robin merely groaned, receiving a look of confusion from Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what's wrong?\" asked the boy. Robin tried her best to put on a straight face, to avoid looking totally stressed by the turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing dear, just a little...exhausted by Severa is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Exhausted'?\" inquired the boy, \"What's exhausting about Severa?\" Robin shook her head at the boy's innocence, not knowing how to break it through to him; Libra saw his wife's mental strain and took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother is still worried about you being around Severa,\" he responded, \"She's afraid she may try to run off with you again or worse.\" Morgan sighed and tried to speak quell his mother's worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, look, I can handle myself around Severa, just as well as she can handle herself; she's still a person you know. Why, just today she suggested we go to town for lunch, and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?!\" Robin replied. \"After I specifically told her not to?! Doesn't she understand the panic a giant could cause?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mom, you're not listening! We just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm listening quite clear! Why, when Chrom hears this, he's gonna-\" Robin's thoughts were interrupted by Morgan throwing his arms up in the air and groaning, ejecting shock from the tactician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Severa's right! You are impossible sometimes!\" The boy began to storm off from his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan!\" Robin cried with worry, \"Where are you going?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to Cynthia's tent! At least she's not as judgmental of her friends! I'll see you at dinner!\" Robin felt hurt as she watched her son walk off, causing Libra to put an arm around her in comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it,\" Robin thought aloud, \"Why is Morgan so rebellious now? Is Severa putting ideas in his head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly you don't get it.\" Libra responded. \"Robin, forgive me if I come off as rude, but you need a lesson in humility and understanding, your motherly instincts cloud your judgment heavily. I would recommend a quick reread of the scripture before dinner tonight if you continue to have these thoughts, or else you may just lose your son to your attitude.\" Libra went back to chopping his stack of firewood, leaving Robin to retreat back into her tent and think over how to win her son's love back, as well as plans of how to deal with the giant girl that so causes her frustration.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As everyone went their own way, Robin stood where she was, ruminating what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she done the wrong thing? Severa had always been bratty at the best of times, even before this happened. When she kidnapped Morgan she revealed herself as a clear danger to him. Surely she was correct to put her foot down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet her family did not think so and she had isolated the family she sought to protect. Had she failed at her objective?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Libra was right about the whole forgiveness thing. She had more than a few misgivings about letting  Walhart or Gangrel join the Shepard's, yet they had so far proved trustworthy, following every command issued to them to the letter, though she never completely lowered there guard around either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true that if Severa had truly wished to harm Morgan there would have been little that could be done about it, at least as the situation stood. If Ricken's potion could be reproduced then leveling the playing field would be a simple matter. All it would require would be for Robin to bide her time..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the fact she had safely returned Morgan not once, but twice hinted that maybe Severa really did regret her actions. Prehaps her size had gone to her head, but her son had showed Severa the error of her ways. If even someone like Gangrel could receive a second chance, then perhaps Severa deserved the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, if she were to refuse she would risk isolating herself from Morgan forever. And looking at Severa with an open mind did not mean completely dropping her guard. She could still analyse her and any risk she posed, but right now it would be best to go along with this. Maybe she would find a chance to make up with Morgan over dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera tsked stumbling on another downside to her new stature. She wanted to look her best for this dinner, but how was she supposed to do her hair and clothes like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prehaps I can help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera looked down and around, only to see her mother at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what could you even do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia disappered, only to come back minutes later on her pegasus, flying level with Severa's head, brandishing a lance. Severa stepped back, looking at Cordelia as thought she was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to hurt you I promise, hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia flew to several hair and pushed a part of it straight and down, using the shaft as a crude comb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia was still smiling as she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you want to look good for the dinner, and I know they don't make combs in your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral folded her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph I guess it's not bad...\" Severa said, grudginly impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what we can do for a dress, but maybe Maribelle will have some idea.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morgan sat outside Cynthia's tent with her family, trying to calm himself from his mother's outburst; he figured that being around his girlfriend's kind family, weird as they were, would easily bring down his temper by mere proximity. Cynthia sat next to Morgan, cuddling him and ruffling his hair, while Sumia brushed her Pegasus and Henry prodded at some Risen limbs in a questionable fashion, possibly thinking up a new hex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't get it Cynthia,\" Morgan lamented as he felt his blond tuft shift around, \"Mother has only seen Severa few times when she was small, and they seemed to get along just fine. Suddenly she becomes large, and now Mother considers her a menace, to both the army and me. Is a height change that severe? I would've thought Mother would be fine with letting me around Severa since we were friends before, especially since she allows me around Walhart and Miss Tharja. Er, uh, don't tell her or Noire I said that.\" Cynthia tried to think up some comforting words, letting her mouth speak as she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Maybe she's just worried? Severa was never known to be the nicest person around, so I guess it makes sense for Robin to worry if she's never really talked much with her.\" Morgan gave a light groan at Cynthia's suggestion, tired of hearing the word \"worry\" bought up when talking about his mother and Severa. \"Sorry Morgan, but that's all I got. For my future mother-in-law, I don't seem to know a lot about Robin, it's a little embarrassing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could butt in,\" Sumia interjected, poking her head up over her Pegasus, \"I think Cynthia's right, there's really no other explanation for it. Mothers worry a lot about their children, Fathers too, it's just a natural thing we do; I'm sure Libra must've been worried sick about you when you went missing, even if he was calm when you came back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for all he knew, a bear could've eaten you, and then he'd have to tuck the bear in every night! Lemme tell you, that's not easy! Nya Ha!\" Henry added with his signature cackle. Morgan looked at Cynthia's parents, trying to understand their words, yet feeling the cloud of emotion still covering his judgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that,\" Morgan rebutted, arms folded, \"But it still feels hurtful that Mother would turn away one of our friends like that. Severa's just trying to do the best she can, it's not like she asked for this in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is she enjoying it?\" Sumia inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, she hasn't complained about being big, and she didn't talk about wanting to be normal again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then there shouldn't be a problem. If Severa's anything like her mother, she's a strong girl, and I don't think anything Robin says can shake her confidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Miss Sumia, but it's less Severa's feelings I'm worried about and more Mother's.\" Morgan tilted his head forward and looked at the ground. \"She's been constantly threatening to report Severa to Chrom, and I don't want to see her get kicked out, where could she go? What would she do? I doubt a town would be so willing to store a giant woman, except maybe Regna Ferox, but she'd freeze to death up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Morgan,\" Henry interjected, \"I could always just curse Robin's mouth off! Like literally, it'd just fall off her face like that, no fuss, no muss!\" Everyone recoiled in horror, not sure when Henry was joking or being serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!\" Cynthia shouted, \"We just want to help Severa out, not hurt Robin!\" Henry just let out a childlike giggle in response, an eerie thing to hear, but one his family was used to by now. With her cheeks puffed up, Cynthia looked at a small pocket watch and sprang up the moment she saw the clock's face. \"Holy crap! Dinner's almost starting, we're gonna be late!\" Morgan immediately sprang up as well, partially due to Cynthia gripping his arm, partially due to his polite, timely nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Father's making bear steak, he'll be upset if we aren't there on the dot! Mr. Henry, Miss Sumia, thank you for listening to me!\" Morgan bowed politely to the couple while Cynthia ran over to hug them, starting with Sumia and following with Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise we'll be back before nightfall!\" she cried as she ran back over to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun dear!\" Sumia cried while she and Henry waved to their daughter and Morgan. The couple waved back and ran off back to Morgan's tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibra worked tirelessly to set whatever he could of the table, setting platters and silverware across the oak, moving tables and benches together for everyone to sit, making sure enough room was cleared for Severa to sit down; if he didn't say anything, one could easily mistake Libra for a housewife. As he continued setting the table, he noticed Robin through the flaps of their tent, sitting on her cot, looking deep in thought, bordering between sad and devious looks. Libra felt bad for his wife, he could understand the stress she went through, but didn't agree with her methods; talking was of no help because Libra simply parroted the same psalms he was taught in the clergy, something that clashed with Robin's motherly paranoia and frustrated her to no end, and there was no action that could be taken to keep the giant Severa in check without drastic consequence - it was a puzzle of emotion that stumped even the star tactician of the Shepherds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin.\" Libra beckoned while poking his head through the tent. Robin looked up in response. \"Dinner will be ready in a few minutes. Does something ail you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Libra,\" Robin responded \"I'll be out in a bit.\" The woman returned to her deep thoughts as Libra removed his head from the tent. The clergyman couldn't get over the lack of feeling in Robin's voice, no, rather it was as if she was concentrating on another matter entirely. Libra couldn't help but wonder, was it a reaction to Morgan's prior outburst, or did Robin have something more on her mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!\" Libra's thoughts were interrupted by the cry of his son; Morgan ran over and enveloped his father with a hug, an action that Libra warmly returned, as he noticed the presence of his son's girlfriend behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Morgan, and good day to you as well Cynthia, I'm glad you could join us tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you let me come!\" replied the energetic girl, \"I'm sorry I springed the invite on you so suddenly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright, you may become part of our family one day, it's only natural. And speaking of family...\" Libra looked Morgan deep in the eyes; almost sensing what he was going to ask, Morgan glanced away from his father's face. \"Morgan, is there something you'd like to say to your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Only if she apologizes to Severa first. It's not fair for Mother to judge Severa based on how big she is now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. I'll see to it your mother apologizes proper.\" As if on cue, in response to being talked about, the stomping noise of Severa's footprints reverberated across the ground, and in just a few seconds, the three saw Severa come into view, parents upon her shoulder. Her hair was properly brushed by a lance and looked more radiant than ever, and her clothes looked cleaner than when she took them from the tent stack; for a giantess, Severa cleaned up pretty nice. Virion and Cordelia were let to the ground gently, and the duo greeted Libra warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day Libra, Morgan, Cynthia, thanks for having us over for dinner tonight.\" Cordelia greeted with a smile and a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We realize that our daughter's attire isn't exactly the norm for a family gathering,\" Virion added with his usual innocent smarm, \"But I do hope you'll forgive us in that we couldn't find anything else to wear, and dear Maribelle could only manage to clean it with her magic. Besides, doesn't Severa just look lovely in that bright, angelic white?\" Severa blushed and nudged her father with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" she cried, \"You're such an embarrassment! Talking about my clothes is creepy as hell!\" Severa stopped prodding her father for a moment and looked down at the rest of the group with an alluring smile. \"Though now that you mention it, I do look hot, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good tonight Severa.\" Morgan replied with his usual friendly demeanor. Severa let out a light giggle, clearing getting what she wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Morgan, you know exactly what a girl wants to hear. And seeing it from up here, you and Cynthia do look a little cute together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks Severa!\" Cynthia replied, giving her rival a big thumbs up with a small jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dial it down a bit.\" Severa responded, always never a fan of Cynthia's wild enthusiasm. Robin exited her tent, hearing the commotion outside, and joining the rest of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening everyone.\" Robin spoke with a smile. She tried to pat her son's head, but Morgan wrestled himself from Libra's arms and clung to Cynthia's waist, not easy to forget what went over just moments ago. Robin looked at her son with a soft sorrow in her eyes. \"Morgan...\" she lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Mom.\" Morgan responded. \"You know what'll make me forgive you.\" Robin glanced at Severa and locked eyes with her; the two women muttered soft grumbles under their breath, their eyes seemed to do battle with one another, sending a tension through the air that told everyone the night wasn't going to be easy. Noticing the mood, Libra motioned for the night to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should take our seats. I hope the food is to your liking, may we bless Naga for our bounty tonight.\" Everyone took their seats at the table as Libra rolled out the food, a bountiful feast of bear steak, boiled potatoes, and fresh-made coleslaw; Libra only wished the food he prepared could make the night a good one for everyone present.</span></div></div>",

She sighed and lowered her head a little. \"I didn't want to admit, but I think i was wrong about you. I can see you brought back Morgan  safe and sound, that you genuinely care for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph. I'm glad you've finally figured that out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan jabbed her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera sighed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... thanks. I guess I didn't make the best impression when I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's eyes narrowed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kidnapped my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera threw her other arm up in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! But I brought him back and he was just fine with me today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sat back, relaxing her posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that now. I was too blinded by worry to see it earlier, I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibra leaned forward and smiled, placing an arm around Robin's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is human to err, but the gods grant us the grace to forgive so that we may learn from our mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded emphatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is only natural for mothers to worry about there offspring.

As long as you treat my boy well and bring him home in good time, I will not interfere with you're friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was clearly relieved. Cynthia even clapped at Robin's speech, before the looks she recieved told her this was not the proper time. Robin suddenly glared at Severa again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you ever harm him, I don't care how big you are I will find you and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan yelled out, loudly scolding his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was suddenly aware of herself.

So can we agree a truce?\" Robin held  out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera met it with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truce, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was plainly relieved, but the same tension still hung in the air, albeit it at a lesser volume.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the night came to a close, no other incidents had come up between the two women, and everyone present had breathed a sigh of relief. Both the families of Severa and Robin had felt it a breakthrough for their respective family member to set aside their feelings towards one another for one night, and hoped the truce they set in place would last a while. As the table was being cleared, the children had segregated themselves from their parents in order to speak; Severa, Morgan, and Cynthia sat together out of earshot, the latter two atop their titanic friend's shoulder, talking away of the day's events and the future from that point onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad you and Mom made up!\" Morgan cheered with enthusiasm, \"I didn't know how longer I could go on spurning her, it just tore at my heartstrings! Oh, I hope she's not too hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you did Morgan, it was just right, don't sweat it.\" Severa rebutted with a gleeful smile. \"I hate to ask though, but could you stay the mediator on this one? I dunno how long this truce between us could last; I could probably stay good if Robin doesn't ride me, but I've got no idea what's going through that woman's head half the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do Severa! You can count on me!\" An over-enthusiastic thumbs up was all Severa needed, she was glad Morgan was such a helpful and kind young lad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sev!\" chimed in Cynthia, \"Morgan tells me you got the hots for Priam!\" A bright blush came over Severa's face, and she turned her head to shout at the Pegasus Rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot!\" she cried, \"I don't 'have the hots' for him! I'm thinking about taking him on one date, <i>one</i>! I don't even know if the guy's more than a meathead, he's so hard to find around camp!\" Despite getting shouted at, the innocent grin didn't disappear from Cynthia's face, she took pleasure in getting such an excited reaction from her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Sorry!\" she responded, \"I'm just a little excited to play matchmaker with you two is all! Maybe I could be a bridesmaid if you two hit it off well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugggh, stop talking! You're so embarrassing!\" Cynthia couldn't help but giggle as Severa ruffled her azure curls in frustration, Morgan found himself smiling at the two girls reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do all we can to make sure you're happy like this, Severa. We know it hasn't exactly been easy for you to get around in camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Morgan, that means a lot to hear, I appreciate what you and Cynthia are doing for me.\" Severa pointed her finger up towards her shoulder, tip aimed at Morgan's chest. \"However, whatever catering you two are providing for this date better be damn good, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pick out the finest lamb from the town over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled!\" Severa grasped her hands around her two friends and lowered them to the ground. Once she had dismounted them, Severa got up and started stretching, untensing her muscles as she let out a light yawn. \"Alright, it's been a blast, but I need to get to bed. I'll see you two tomorrow, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! We'll talk to Priam first thing tomorrow, kay? Have a good night!\" Both Cynthia and Morgan waved to Severa, the Lady grinned at their kindness and waved back, turning towards her parents, talking to Robin and Libra, and kneeling down to gather them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Mom? Dad? I don't want to sound rude or anything, but I'm feeling bushed, I think we should leave Morgan and his family alone so they can tuck in at a decent hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that sounds good. Robin, Libra, thank you for having our family tonight, it means a lot to us. May your rest be pleasant.\" Cordelia gave a bow to the two, Virion following in turn, before the two stepped upon their daughter's palm and found themselves raised to her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks you two, I appreciate the dinner. It was nice to feel normal.\" Robin and Libra nodded at Severa's words, Libra with a warm smile upon his face, and in an instant, the Lady walked back off to her parents' tent. Once they were out of eyesight, Libra turned towards his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" he asked, \"A little acceptance can go a long way Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hmph...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't be like that,\" he continued, \"I'm quite proud of you for your civility towards Severa tonight, as would any other member of this army be. Kindness can make powerful allies, and I don't just say that because of Severa's condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that Libra,\" Robin responded, \"But deep down, I still don't feel good about this. There's a lot of danger Severa now presents, and she was known to be a loose cannon even before this. I mean, who will respect me if I let a potential threat roam in camp unchecked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of one person...\" Libra responded with a warm grin. Morgan ran over and threw his arms around Robin's waist, gripping her tightly and rubbing his cheek against her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so proud of you!\" he cried, \"You don't know how much it means to me to have apologized to Severa, it really means a lot to her too!\" Robin looked a little puzzled for a moment, the thought of her son spurning her still fresh in her mind, and had no idea how to react; Cynthia lagged behind her boyfriend a bit, finally closing the distance between her and Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was a really nice thing to do, but just be sure to keep that truce up, kay? Wouldn't want the camp to turn into a battleground between you two!\" Robin looked blank for a moment, but then proceeded to smile, returning the hug her son gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I get it now.\" she spoke. \"Yes, of course, I'll make sure to treat Severa right from now on, I trust her. Still Morgan, just stay safe, okay? I don't just mean around Severa, I mean in general, you mean the world to me you know.\" Morgan gave a rapid series of nods and continued to bury his face into his mother's tank top. Robin looked at the smiling faces of her family and shifted her hands to stroke Morgan's hair, she found herself now content with the situation she was in, and wished nothing could change it. \"I love you all...\" Robin cooed, as she closed her eyes and embraced the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera reached her parents' tent and lowered them to the ground, allowing them to retreat into their tent before she went off to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm off to bed, I got a big date tomorrow.\" she called out before turning heel. \"You two have a good night now, alright? Thanks for helping me prep for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, dear, wait.\" Virion called out. Severa stopped and turned around to face her parents again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Virion spoke, \"We just wanted to say that we're proud of you for reaching a truce with Robin. From what Libra told us, things haven't exactly been easy between the two of you, I'm just happy that nothing came to a head tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing,\" Severa responded, \"I just wanted to make sure I didn't kill my chances of seeing Morgan again. I don't know exactly how long Robin will keep our truce going, but Morgan did say he'd try to keep her civil, so I'm gonna put my faith in him on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad to hear it!\" Cordelia gleefully spoke. \"And, if you'll forgive a mother's curiosity, when you said 'date', who exactly are you planning on going out with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, nothing gets past you, doesn't it?\" Severa grasped her arm and rubbed it, not sure how to answer without feeling embarrassed. \"Well...I talked it over with Morgan, and he and Cynthia are going to...well, hook me up with Priam...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Priam!\" Virion sung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the hell's wrong with that?! He looks like a good enough guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's wrong with it sweetie!\" Cordelia responded with a chuckle, \"In fact, we're proud of you for finding someone you might like, it's just that we don't know much about Priam, he's very much of a...how do I say this nicely? 'Loner' type?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, the thought crossed my mind,\" Severa responded, \"But he looks cute enough, and he can hold his own, and that's what I want to see in a guy. Besides, he seems to be unfazed by plenty of things, so I think he'd be accepting of a giant woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, my dear,\" Virion spoke, \"I assure you, everyone would be far accepting of your size once they get to know you. Why, once we all return to Rosanne, I'll see to it that they see you not as a giant, but as a respected Lady of the great House Virion, no matter the cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll <i>make</i> them accept me, you don't need to lift a single finger Daddy!\" Virion gave a nervous chuckle, fiddling with his cravat as the scenarios his daughter could play out ran through his head. Severa let out a yawn and rubbed her eye. \"Well, if that's all, I'm getting to bed. Sweet dreams you two, have a good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Severa, we'll see you tomorrow!\" Severa smiled at her mother's words and marched off to her tent, ready to get to sleep. Once she reached it and crawled inside, Severa stacked the tents atop another, threw a stack of cloth atop her body, rested her head atop the pillowy mass of cloth, and drifted off to bed; a warm smile crept along her face as she went to sleep, bright dreams of her and her family &amp; friends entering her mind, some of which she was small again, some of which she was still large, all of which were enjoyable.</span></div></div>",

Though now something else occupied her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis \"Priam\"  guy, what was he like? He did seem strong, his men giving the Shepard a challenge and  the man himself diving into the thick of battle, but what else did she know about him? Those troops did seem to like him, so he must have had a certain charm, but around here he was strange. No one seemed to know much about him, other than the fact he liked to keep to himself and when he did get talking, he could be something of a wind bag. As if she needed one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill he was an invaluable fighter, and Severa couldn't deny his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a while since Severa had been on a date.N-not because she was unattractive or others didn't get her of course, but the war and the events in her timeline hadn't given her much time. But now that the opportunity was here, she would make the most of it, even if this Priam guy was wierd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then at her height was she in a position to judge who was weird? No she couldn't stand thinking like that, she wasn't weird she was different, and if others couldn't accept that, well to hell with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan always accepted her.. but however nice he was to her, could she really compete with Cynthia? Cynthia had got this heart first. However supportive Morgan was, would he really give that up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera closed her eyes. Now was not the time for such thoughts. She was going to have to get ready for her date. Though at her size, that was easier said than done. Her would doubltess help with her hair, Severa could try and bathe at a nearby stream and as for her attire... she would have to hope the sexy jungle look was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera got to her feet, she would have to reach the stream before the guys would be roaming. Her frantic footsteps slowed as another thought occurred to her. Who cares if someone saw her like this Unless it was someone from town and the ruckus reached Chrom, or worse her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeh, it would be worth it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Severa spent nearly a half an hour in the stream, feeling the cool, crystal clear water run across her body as she lounged. \"This is perfect!\" she mused, \"Who knew I could find a stream this large, this clean?\" She leaned back and let her hair dip under the flowing water, and as she ran her hand through the azure strands, she could feel how soft and clean her hair was, as if the stream was a natural conditioner. Entranced by the natural relaxant, Severa laid her whole body back, allowing it to rest at the bed of the stream, smooth as a tortoise's shell and free of any rocks or wildlife. As the water ran past her body, Severa let out a sigh of relief, taking the time to appreciate the moment of silence she had from the camp's usual bustle. \"Ah, it's such a shame that we'll be marching in a few days,\" she lamented, \"This is such a perfect bathing spot - no dumb animals, no filthy junk from upstream, no meatheads coming to ruin my private moments; maybe Morgan was right, nature is awesome!\" Severa felt a leaf from the treetop above touch her cheek, and she let out a giggle and relaxed. \"I could just take a nap right now, maybe Priam wouldn't mind if I'm an hour or two late...\" Severa closed her eyes with a smile upon her face and let her body loosen and unwind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Severa!</i>\" Severa's eyes shot open and she grumbled as she leaned up, feeling her private moment ruined by Cynthia's voice. Severa watched the girl dart through the trees on her Pegasus, coming to the edge of the stream and touching down gracefully. She watched as Cynthia elegantly dismounted her Pegasus, putting a hand to her face to control her frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for the perfect moment...\" Severa mumbled before turning to Cynthia. \"Cynthia, what is it? How did you even find me out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, the power of friendship of course!\" Severa groaned at Cynthia's ridiculous answer, while the young girl just giggled at her jest. \"No, I just saw you walk this way early in the morning, so I just followed the stream; I was up pretty early trying to help you out with your date!\" Severa grumbled and went back to laying backwards again, trying to enjoy her bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the thought,\" she replied, \"But I'm in the middle of bathing here, as you can see, so can you buzz off for like, oh, I dunno...An hour? I'll come find you and Morgan after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see, whoops...So should I send Priam home?\" Severa darted up from her resting state and immediately placed her hands to her breasts at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Priam's here?!\" she cried, \"Where?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that clearing back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dolt! Why the hell would you bring him here?! Can't you see I'm <i>naked</i>?!\" Cynthia took a bit of time to register Severa's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I guess that was a pretty bad idea in hindsight! Clumsy me!\" Cynthia lightly knocked her head as Severa felt her fury boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>guess</i>?! Don't you know how private girl time works?! Send Priam home right now until I'm do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia, are you over here? Where is this 'strong warrior' you keep telling me about?\" The color drained from Severa's face as she saw Priam come into view, the worn Ragnell sheathed at his side. Though frozen in place, Severa's mind was still active, and she couldn't help but be amazed at how well Priam looked; his hair was a beautiful dark blue, his face was rugged, yet handsome, and he wore his armor well, not a slob like the rest of the soldiers in camp. Priam looked at Severa for a moment, not very phased by the situation. \"Oh, you're that giant woman that's part of the army - Severa, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Cynthia butted in, \"This is the strong warrior I mentioned! She's excellent at battle and she's got noble blood to boot; pretty awesome choice for a partner, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't care less about her blood,\" Priam responded, \"But I can definitely sense her strength, even from here. Her arms are the perfect size, her stomach's well-toned, and her chest is the right size for ar-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's it!\" Severa shouted, returning to reality. She shifted her right arm to cover both her breasts and used her left arm to grab whatever foliage she could. \"<i>Out! Now!</i>\" Severa begun throwing leaves, twigs, rocks, and whatever else she could grab at the two, trying to get them to leave so she could dress herself. Cynthia yelped in panic as the foliage hit her, but Priam just felt a exciting grin overcome his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got a really good throwing arm!\" he complimented, \"Great form, even when seated! She must have a great exercise routine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can admire late- Ow!\" Cynthia grabbed Priam by his arm and drug him onto her Pegasus, shaking the reins to direct it to the forest clearing. \"Retreat! Retreat!\" As Severa watched the two disappear into the woods, she was left to her own thoughts, face beet-red and burning hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" she thought aloud, \"First date and he's already seen me naked. Good job Cynthia, you're the best.\" Severa sighed and stood up from the stream, grabbing her clothes from the nearby branch and beginning to re-do her pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the clearing, Priam and Cynthia waited patiently for Severa, the poor Pegasus Rider massaging the lumps on her head, while Priam paced, deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Priam- Ouch!\" Cynthia spoke to the swordsman, \"I think I might've jumped the gun on that one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's completely fine Cynthia,\" the warrior responded, \"I'm very impressed with Severa's skill, I can tell she's a good warrior just from first glance. You have impressive comrades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and how 'bout that whole giantess thing she's got going on, right? Imagine how strong you two would be together!\" Priam merely shook his head at Cynthia's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Size means little for a warrior, only their skill. She's good, but I feel I could best her in combat.\" Cynthia let out a small snicker, ready to rebut the claim, but chose to keep quiet as she felt the ground increasingly tremor. Soon enough, Severa joined the two in the clearing, now fully robed, face still reddened. Priam gave a quick look over Severa's body, admiring the good health she was in and good posture she carried. \"Sorry about earlier,\" he called out, \"But for what it's worth, it was a good display of your skill. I also respect your boldness for the lack of armor in this war.\" Severa just rolled her eyes, already expecting a crazy-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't really make armor in my size, if you didn't notice.\" she replied. \"Even then, I prefer a nice, embroidered dress far better, but I can't complain about the sexy jungle girl look either.\" Severa looked to the side and started twirling one of her pigtails around, feeling nervous over her lack of dating experience. \"So, uh...Are you ready for this date or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm unfamiliar with dating as well, don't worry.\" Severa stopped her actions in shock, it's almost as if the warrior read her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That whole mind-reading thing! I thought you brawny types were supposed to be total meatheads!\" Priam felt humbled by the insult, thinking 'meathead' was a compliment towards his diet plan. He folded his arms and begun explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't reading the mind so much as reading your actions.\" he spoke fluently. \"By training my mind, I became able to size up a warrior by their actions, and it's easy to tell what they think or who exactly they are by how they act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Mr. Radiant Hero,\" Severa responded, squatting down towards the swordsman, \"Size me up, and it better not be a joke about my height.\" Priam took a moment to gaze at Severa, trying to collect his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be strong,\" he begun, \"You have great form and carry yourself well, and though you don't wield one now, your arms are proof enough you've practiced with a sword and bow; you definitely trained well. However, you don't seem disciplined by the manner of your speech, and you have this air of overconfidence towards yourself; as I told Cynthia, I could easily beat you in combat as you are.\" Severa smirked and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this guy for real?\" she asked Cynthia, pointing at Priam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, everyone does say he's a strong guy.\" Cynthia replied. Severa giggled and began prodding Priam with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, look at the little man!\" she scoffed, \"He thinks he can beat a woman ten times his size! That's just adorab-\" Instantly, Priam yanked on Severa's finger and the girl found herself crashing to the floor, leaving Cynthia amazed at the sight. As Severa shook her head wondering what the hell just happened, Priam walked up near her face and begun to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said,\" he lectured, \"You need discipline. But you're undeniably strong, a great asset to our team.\" Severa scoffed, feeling emasculated by the incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'll take the compliment. Let's just get back to camp and get this over with.\" Severa got to her knees and turned towards Cynthia. \"Is Morgan awake yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" she responded, \"He went out to the town to buy some lamb, he should probably be back by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then let's get this over with.\" Severa got to her feet and picked Priam up, holding him in her hand and using the other to point to her shoulder and breasts in a rapid series. \"See these? You got to earn these. Work hard enough and you might just see yourself next Duke of Rosanne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Titles don't interest me,\" Priam replied, \"But if you're giving me a challenge to overcome, then I'll take it on full force!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such enthusiasm!\" Severa complimented, \"Maybe you won't be so bad after all!\" Severa kept her date steady and begun walking off back towards camp, Cynthia flying behind the two in tow.</span></div></div>",

Though with sufficient training you will learn how to use your extra mass effectively. On the other hand, your size makes you a bigger target on the battle field and not being able to wear armor makes you vulnerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh I didn't meant tactically I meant- never mind. That move you pulled earlier was impressive, but I'd just step on most soldiers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, despite your size you are quite swift. You have clearly trained your speed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera rolled her eyes, but also smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad someone noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's true most soldiers would not know how to fight against a giant, but those truly disciplined would know how to target you as I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh is fighting all you think about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all, but it is often on mind. I strive to be a worthy descendant of the Radiant Hero. The path of a swordsman is never ending, there is always something new to learn and the journey to improve oneself is lifelong and these as lands never know peace, there is always someone to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really a descedent of Ike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hope my skills would be proof enough, but if they are not.\" Priam drew Ragnell, showing the side of the blade to Severa. \"Ragnell would not allow me to wield it otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. So are you saying the reason you're so strong is that you're training all the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam was more more animated now, his arms swinging with restrained excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, yet there is more to it than that. Everyday I seek to push myself beyond my limits and to find new challenges, eagerly realizing what they have to teach me. More so I see to learn every I can about being a warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well could you share some of it with me then?\" Severa tried to sound like she wasn't THAT interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam looked her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are asking to be my pupil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, just teach me some stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Priam examined both Severa and her surroundings. \"Do you have a weapon sized to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, I guess I can lift a tree out of the ground or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are serious about fighting at your size you will need a proper weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft I'll just crush anyone I come across.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kind of over confidence will prove fatal on the battlefield. Besides, a good weapon is an extension of the warriors own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that it matters anyway, Chrom's banned me from the battlefield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam blinked, fixing his gaze on her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you just accepted that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera looked to the side, fidget with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not really, I mean I could just ditch him  but I don't want to leave everyone behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam nodded, seemingly satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can respect that, a warrior should value there comrades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera tried to act casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides I'm sure if I just behave for a few days Chrom will change his mind once he sees what I can do! So mr fancy warrior, is there anything you can teach me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam paused in thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can work on your stance, and I can teach you of the ambient energies around us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you on about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It is difficult to grasp at first, but as you train, you can feel this energy begin to flow. That is, IF you prepare your mind. You must remove all barriers to self-knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft. This sounds like nonsense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam narrowed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not think you would be so close minded. Do you really think a warrior as practiced as I would cling to blind superstiation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera said nothing, but had that cynical look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well I see you require a demonstration. Place me back on the ground\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera did so. As soon as he was back on solid ground, Priam drew Ragnell and turned towards a thick oak tree. Instead of charging at it, he relaxed and took in a deep breath, standing completely still for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera huffed and tapped her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam did not speak, instead he move gracefully at the tree, in perfect harmony with his sword and cleaved in two. He turned to face her again, as though he had done nothing out of the ordinary. Severa's eyes went wide for a second, though she quickly tried to avoid looking too impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that wasn't bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam looked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you willing to believe me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, tell me what you know.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Severa stood on the edge of camp, just where the campground met the woods, trying to balance herself on a single leg whilst hoping nobody could see her in such a ridiculous pose. Somehow, Priam managed to appeal to her warrior's instinct, and the date Severa envisioned had become a training session out of nowhere; she couldn't complain if Priam's techniques could get her back on the field, but there was still those girlish &amp; noble instincts in the back of her mind telling her to ditch the training and try to do something fun &amp; dignified for a Lady, like a shopping spree. Severa held boulders in her hands and kept her arms wide and rigid, as part of the exercise; Priam watched intently while pacing, like a drill sergeant, while Cynthia sat on a rock, cheering her friend on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sev!\" she cried, \"Balance the <i>snot</i> outta those rocks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you shut up?!\" Severa yelled in response, looking strained and exhausted from the balance exercise. \"Gawds, it's hard enough trying to keep these stupid things in place, give me some peace and quiet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A true warrior shrugs off all distractions,\" Priam spoke, \"That is true balance. In fact, it reminds me of a story from my youth.\" Severa groaned, realizing what those words meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh boy, story time...\"</i> she thought. Priam sat upon a stump and took a deep breath of air, gathering his thoughts and beginning his long-winded ramble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was young, of the age 8, training myself atop the trees, leaping from branch to branch and balancing upon each tiny wooden structure. Along my travels, I encountered a flock of birds, of the small chirping kind, who had broke out in song at my expense. While soldiers come home to parades and instruments, hailed as heroes after a war, true warriors require no fanfare, they must block it all out and focus on the path that lies ahead of them. I trudged on and on as the birds began to circle me in a playful romp, so I looked into my inner chi, focusing my thoughts into my aura, so that I may block out...\" Cynthia listened with bright eyes as Priam rambled on, but Severa couldn't stand the droning story, it dug into her ears like a drill and gave her a headache. She leaned right as she struggled to concentrate, allowing the boulder in her left hand to tumble from its perch and onto her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ow!! Son of a-!</i>\" Severa yelped in pain and grasped her pained, swollen toes, leaping into a sitting position as she cursed and massaged her digits, dropping the other rock in tandem. Cynthia darted over to check on Severa while Priam slowly walked over, oblivious to his distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one of the disadvantages of your unarmored frame.\" he spoke, \"I suppose we can take a break for now.\" Severa's eye twitched in response, she looked ready to lose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, when I get up, I am gonna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa! Priam! Are you guys here? I bought lunch!\" Severa inwardly blessed her luck that Morgan had arrived, else she'd end up doing something she'd regret. The boy slowly joined the group, carrying a cart of lamb racks in his stead, all roasted to perfection, the heat radiating from the wood. Morgan stopped as he saw Severa upon the ground, massaging her foot, and didn't know what to make of the situation. \"Uh, are you alright Severa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had an accident. An annoying accident.\" Severa shot a short glare at the oblivious Priam. \"Anyways, it's nothing a healer's staff can't fix. Think you can help a girl out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\" Morgan produced a healer's staff from his coat, a memento from his father, and waved it at Severa. In a warm ray of light, the pain disappeared from Severa's toes and the purple, swollen skin returned to its healthy peach color and usual contraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, much better! You're a godsend Morgan!\" The boy blushed and ruffled his hair, humbled by the compliment. Severa peered over the boy's shoulder, noticing the cart of food behind him. \"Is that what I think it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Fresh lamb from the town! I had them roast it as much as they could manage! I hope I didn't interrupt anything important by showing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've just reached a resting point in training,\" Priam responded, \"And meat is an optimal step in a warrior's training. You've shown up at just the right time Morgan.\" Morgan looked confused by the word \"training\", expecting Severa to partake in a more casual date, but brushed it off as he retreated to the back of the cart. In a short span of time, Morgan set up a pair of blankets across the ground, one for him and Cynthia, one for Severa and Priam, and both groups found themselves sectioned off to each blanket; Morgan and Cynthia helped themselves to a small plate, while Severa and Priam had the rest of the cart, due to the former's stature. Severa popped each rack in her mouth like a small candy, chomping down on both meat and bone with no effort or discomfort, and watched as Priam cleaned the meat off his bone like a ravenous wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure seem hungry.\" Severa quipped, a bit amazed by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, meat strengthens the body and soul.\" Priam explained while wiping his mouth. \"To eat is to absorb the essence of the creature, to build its strength onto your own, and that is why you must never waste any of your food. I am gladdened that you eat so much, it's the mark of a good warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have a choice,\" Severa replied, \"Bigger I am, more food I need to live. I try not to think about it too much.\" Severa looked over her shoulder at Morgan and Cynthia and watched as they ate; Morgan was feeding Cynthia small bits of meat from a fork, the two lovingly giggling at each other as the scene played out. Severa looked at them a little sadly and looked back at Priam, chowing down on his meat; she rubbed the back of her neck and struggled to speak. \"Look, Priam...\" she started, catching the swordsman's attention, \"I don't think this is gonna work, you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem with the training?\" Priam inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, rather the problem <i>is</i> the training.\" Severa responded. \"I'm not doubting your strength or anything, but gawds you're a cold fish when it comes to dating. I expected something just nice and relaxing today, you know? Like a normal boyfriend and girlfriend do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't boyfriend and girlfriend though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, but don't you want to be or something? I mean come on, who wouldn't want a girl with this body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a man who's interested in such concepts of beauty or appearance.\" Priam replied, \"I am dedicated to the way of the sword, how someone looks means nothing to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I figured as much. I guess we're done th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, you have agreed to become a student of mine in the path of the warrior. I've never had much students, but those I've trained in my journey I have never let down. I realize this might not be the best path for you, but I don't intend to let you down here Severa, so if there's anything you wish to change about our routine, then feel free to speak to me - remember that we are equals in this army.\" Severa was shocked at how such a thick-headed, narrow-minded guy could be so thoughtful to see from another angle, though she never remembered officially signing on to be Priam's \"student\". The Lady thought it would've been such a shame to let a handsome guy like Priam go so quickly, perhaps she should at least see how Priam reacts outside of his outlandish training routines and long-winded stories, to see if he's actually a sweetie deep down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you mentioned it...\" Severa started, twirling a pigtail around, \"Perhaps we could, I dunno, spend the rest of the day doing some normal, non-training-related things? Like normal dates go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Priam responded, \"What do you recommend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I dunno,\" Severa replied, \"I usually like to go shopping, but obviously I can't do that without causing a scene. Gawds, being a giant is harder than I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps star-gazing tonight? You can see the constellations the best from center of camp.\" Severa was taken aback a bit by the response, not expecting such a casual, non-crazy answer from Priam, but as she thought it over, it wasn't really a bad idea; stars were always pretty to see, and as Severa recalled, Morgan told her about how he first asked Cynthia to be his girlfriend during a star-gazing session - perhaps Priam wasn't such a cold fish after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, yeah!\" Severa responded, \"That's actually a good idea! Gosh Priam, I didn't expect you to have an idea like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course,\" Priam responded, \"Astrology is an important concept for the warriors of the old times, it's vital to study. I was but 11 when I was thrown into the mountains on a training expedition, armed with only a blade at my side and no map to guide me. I had to find my way back to the village, but there was no way to find myself through the bewildering woodland in the deep night, it was almost like an illusory maze; using my wits and the stars above me, my only illumination, I used the images of Polaris, the North Star, to guide me back alongside the instinct my chi spoke to me with - I owe my survival to the Ursa Minor. Come to think of it, I think that was the same day I was attacked by that bear, was I 12 back then? I remember that encounter like it was yesterday: It came like a raging beast through the dense woodland, so with the energy of the woodland around me, I charged forward, and released my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You know what? I'm gonna keep from flattering him until something actually happens between us...\"</i> Severa mused inwardly, hoping Priam's ramble would soon end.</span></div></div>",

How could he be so smart and so stupid at the same time? How come it sometimes seemed like her understood her perfectly, and other times he was a clueless bore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere all men like this? Except Morgan. She sighed at the thought. Then again, even he was prone to bouts of cluelessness at times... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And this star reminds  connects to the Ura Major.

I thought you would find plenty to learn about from the many tales of my exploits. Why just a month ago there was the time I was heading back and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera stood up and glared down. Most men would be intimdated by the size difference, but Priam hardly seemed to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really this clueless?! Do you not know when you are boring someone to death?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam glared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My men have never had a problem with my stories, they have always hung on my every word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera gnashed her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There just being polite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we all think you're a wierdo who talks too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean we?

Ever notice it keeps happening and you keep doing it anyway?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam was silent, merely looking into Severa's eyes. Severa initially assumed she had either stunned him, or he trying to hold back his mounting anger. Had she gone too far? Was she going to alienate other Shepard with her attitude? Stupid, stupid..  she should be better at this by now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever a few seconds later she realized Priam was contemplating what she had been saying, though as usual his face betrayed little emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, that would explain many of my past episodes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you're not mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam was as calm as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were blunt and rude, but you cut to the heart of the matter. There is nothing to be gained beating around the bush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sought to impart my wisdom but it is true that I have talked enough.\" Priam sat back down, as though nothing had happened. \"Tell me a tale of your exploits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I shall listen in earnest.\" He leaned in a little closer, appearing true to his word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh-\"  <i>Gawds!

She didn't exactly have a lot of happy memories to share or exciting tales to tell, unless Priam was really into listening about hellfire and corpses, nor did she exactly want to share what she had, preferring to forget the despair of the doomed future. Severa glanced around, trying to find something to detract the warrior's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she started, \"I don't really have any stories to share, but uh...\" Severa looked at the mess tent off in the distance and thought. <i>\"Should I ask him for recipes? Or will he get into a crazy story about that?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell me about your future if you so wish.\" Severa put her attention back onto Priam with shock; she never got used to that \"mind-reading\" she did, but she didn't expect he had known about where she had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wasn't going to talk about that!\" Severa responded, trying to keep her fa\u00e7ade of an aloof ice queen up, but her expression shortly softened as she tried to pick his brain. \"But out of curiosity, how did you know about the future? Weren't you a recent addition to the army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still a part of this army regardless, and Chrom, Robin, and Lucina have felt it necessary to inform me of the Outrealms to truly understand what we're up against. That, and Owain keeps begging me to take him in as a pupil.\" Severa rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures, that guy's got a story for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, I'm not looking for a story of your exploits, I just want to know you better as an ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Ally', huh?\" Severa put a finger to the corner of her lips, deep in thought; she hadn't really thought Priam's tales, or rather anyone else's, as just annoying show-off yapping, but maybe Priam was on to something in trying to understand his allies - his strength when paired with others was definitely something to boast over. Severa thought it over a bit before addressing Priam again. \"Alright, how about this? The story of how I got so big in the first place; how's that for 'knowing me better'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a good start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" Severa relaxed herself and sat down, trying to think back to those few days ago. \"It was a few days ago, I was just doing my usual training run, but then I ran into that little dork Ricken and he got me to chug one of his wacky potions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He forced it upon you?\" Priam inquired, \"I didn't think a boy that young had the strength to do something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, I kinda...drank it myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then was it not your mistake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no! He shouldn't have left it out in the first place! Who knows what kind of crazy poison that could've been!\" Severa folded her arms and looked off to the side, clearly not willing to admit her mistake. \"Anyways, I drank it, grew, tore all my good clothes to shreds, and now here I am. Bam, normal life, gone just like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet I haven't heard you complain about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it should go without saying!\" Severa replied, \"I mean, I don't got any good clothes anymore, I don't have any nice cots to sleep on, and how the hell am I supposed to continue my bloodline like this?!\" Severa let a small blush come to her face before continuing. \"I mean, besides the me of this world actually being born...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, you find enjoyment in your predicament.\" Priam responded, calm and collected, deep in thought. \"I believe you said it yourself, the 'sexy jungle girl look'? Your size hasn't kept you from your desire to date as Morgan and Cynthia tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I guess you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me,\" Priam asked, \"When you grew, how did you feel?\" Severa tried to think back to that moment, closing her eyes and envisioning the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt angry, confused, upset, and...naked, I guess...\" Severa furrowed her brow, trying to think harder. \"But I guess I felt...powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't complain afterwards, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I remember trying to throw my weight around a bit, then there was that bit with Morgan, and it was just normal after that.\" Severa opened her eyes, feeling like she just reached an epiphany. \"Come to think of it, this new me has been nothing but good! My life's been better than ever! You know, aside from the lack of cute clothes.\" Severa looked down at Priam. \"So I guess that's what you wanted, right? Do you 'know me better' now or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Priam rubbed the small hairs on his chin as he put forward his analysis of Severa. \"You're prone to mood swings and you tend to focus on the bad in a situation; you feel as if the world's made to suit you, a real princess stereotype.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gee, beat up on mean ol' Severa, haven't heard that one a million times before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That having been said, I think behind all that lies a great warrior with truly good intentions. I think you need discipline, but more than that, I think you need to vent your problems if you want to truly find the better you. If you want to continue our training, then I'd be happy to listen to you.\" Severa shrugged, figuring that was the best she could get out of Priam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno if I want to keep working on this 'training' stuff you're making me do,\" she replied, \"But if you don't mind me venting my frustrations to you once in a while, I'd be happy to visit and listen to whatever crazy tales you got for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be fine enough with that, a good warrior is always welcome to assist his comrades.\" Priam responded with a small grin. \"As for your 'dating', would you like to continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't really call tonight a 'date' since we kind of just talked and junk instead of the regular hanky-panky stuff like Morgan and Cynthia do...\" Severa started before adopting a warm grin and continuing. \"But I'd be okay with coming to see you again as a friend. And once Chrom lets me back on the field, I'm definitely going to seek you out as a sidekick. Who knows? Maybe something might spark!\" Severa shot Priam a wink and then looked up at the moon, noticing its height in the sky. \"Alright, it's getting late, but I guess we could do one more story. Want to spin me one of your epics and help me get to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's fine with you, I'd rather you tell me another one.\" Priam responded. \"Listening to others' tales is rather enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really putting me on the spot here, chief...\" Severa thought it over for a bit, trying to think of something interesting to talk about, before arriving at a conclusion. \"Alright, how about dreams? I had a good one the other night, or are those not realistic enough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dreams are fine, in some circles, warriors use their dreams to determine the future ahead of them.\" Severa mulled over Priam's words for a bit, finding that last bit interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Ahead of me', huh? You might be onto something, Mr. Swordsman Psychiatrist.\" Severa shook off the thought and went back to her storytelling. \"Alright, anyways, I had this dream the other night: I was a servant for the princess of a far-away kingdom, and we all fought together alongside her family against a large dragon; scary, but it had nothing on Grima. I was on the field supporting the princess' sister, a Manakete, as we fought these big green monsters; I drove my sword right into one of their masks, and the big stupid lug ran around like a chicken with his head cut off! There were a couple more around me, so we paired up together and rushed forward...\" Priam sat and listened intently as Severa went into almost-realistic detail, the two forgetting the time passing around them as they got real into the story.</span></div></div>",

Priam almost shook with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Orion is above us! This reminds me of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam looked sheepish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I forgot you were not as engrossed with the stars as I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" She looked up and smiled \"Huh... they do look kinda of nice out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? And even in the dead of night, they can lead us back to camp, we just follow these ones west and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't  believe we've been out here all day. I didn't like how it started, but I guess it's been fun.\" Severa couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam leaned closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I too have enjoyed your company, when would you like to do this again? Tommorow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera shuffled back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, don't get ahead of yourself. But I'll meet up with you for more training whenever I'm free. And I guess I'm not going to be that busy.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam didn't seem bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Training would be a good use of your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't let me think about it or something. Let's just get back to camp.\" She started to get up, when Priam stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. The Shepards are likely asleep. Even your lightest tread is likely to rouse many everyone their slumber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, not Stahl, Grima could march into camp and he'd sleep through that. But yeah, I get your point. We sleep out here tonight. But no funny stuff, I'm not the kind of girl to give herself up on a first date!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam almost chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I would be glad to sleep under the stars with a fellow warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera was silent for a moment before she spoke again., trying to glance at him without letting Priam see her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Were you thinking about.... you know.... that?\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam shrugged. Severa tried to keep up her ice queen act, but couldn't help but sag a little at his casual attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A warrior must consider his lineage-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS THAT ALL YOU WERE CONSIDERING?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I to would not rush into such a thing. Though a part of me wondering how the deed might be done and the effect it could have on the offspring. Not to mention the possibility of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, do you have to make a philosophy out of everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A warrior must consider all possibilities, and prepare themselves for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera rolled on her side, facing away from him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night.\" She said curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam lay near her, though not close enough to be crushed if Severa were to turn in her sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera's mind was not yet at rest., Despite the awkward end to the \"date\" she had enjoyed herself. She couldn't remember the last time a day had  passed her by so quickly, or she had ever shared as much as she did. She did want to do this again, though she hoped Priam wouldn't push her so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe their were good men out there, besides Morgan. Though did they all have to be so clueless?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Severa longer to fall asleep than Priam, but both slept well and awoke feeling refreshed, though some of Severa's muscles still hurt. By the time she was awake, Priam had been long up, but waited by Severa, while performing his morning exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you have awakened. Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I did.\" She got to her feet. A part of her was surprised to see him up and active, but after spending the last day with him it surprised her much less than it would have before. \"Come on, let's go get some grub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, we should return to the camp at once\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I thought you would want to hunt or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true that foraging is an important skill for any warrior, and one must be able to substain oneself off the land, but the Shepard's are expecting us back and have likely prepared such for us. I would not allow the work and sacrifice to go waste so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess thats easier than scrounging up something here.\" She sat up and held out her palm. \"Climb on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam complied and Severa placed him on her shoulder  before beginning the walk back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shepard's were alerted by her tread,  and at her size she could be seen some distance off. Most had gotten used to it by now, but her parents and Morgan had awaited anxiously for her return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera entered camp and placed Priam down. Morgan and Cordelia ran to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa!\" They both called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your date go well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not certain how much Severa would classify as a date, but we were satisfied. We will be meeting again, prehaps today. It reminds of when-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera made a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, It was alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you...\" Morgan twiddled his fingers \"You know....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Not on a first meeting! What kind of girl do you thik I am?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did take me and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera urgently cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was different!\" I barely knew Priam before today and I stopped when- Nevermind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam looked up and glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did not mention any such incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera tried to look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh do I have to share everything?\"  The suspicious look on Priam's face intensified.  \"Look nothing happened ok!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Cordelia was ready to bail her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you are well, but why were you back so late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're both adults!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason we're back so late is  because Priam said my steps are too loud and would wake everyone! Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam nodded. Cordelia looked a little embarrassed, but was satisfied with that answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see. I just wanted to make sure you were ok, and also tell you that we are marching on. We were waiting for you to return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera folded her arms across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, great, I haven't even had breakfast yet. What happened anyway?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a simple attack, but an attack nonetheless; a rowdy bunch of Risen had found their way into the nearby village, and by simple chance alone, had found themselves spotted by Chrom, Robin, and Lucina during their morning marching ritual of checking the perimeter for the start of the march. It didn't take much to lead them away from the village, just tossing a used-up tome at the chieftain's head, but the 3 managed to drag the zombies back closer to camp and away from the villagers. Though it wasn't a large army of Risen like they were used to, small groups of reinforcements came from the camp when the watchtower sounded the alarm, slowing the packing process for the march. Blue-hooded lance soldiers fought in small platoons against the weaker Risen while Chrom, Robin, and Lucina fought against what could be considered \"the strongest\", mere remnants of Plegian Berserkers and Sorcerers; Robin controlled the enemy march with her summoned flames while Lucina swiftly danced through the shambling masses of corpses, cutting down each Risen with each gap she cleared. The blue-haired woman peered her head above the torso of a bulky Berserker she had felled and watched as her father fought against the chieftain, a howling revenant swinging around an axe; Chrom stood his ground firmly, dodging blows with ease and landing slash after slash with Falchion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!\" Lucina called out as she stabbed her blade through another Risen's chest, \"Are you alright?\" The Exalt wiped a small trickle of sweat from his head, clearly exhausted by the zombie's unwavering assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Chrom responded as he blocked a blow from the axe, \"Focus on your enemies!\" As he said this, a Risen Assassin had made a mad dash from behind Lucina, intending to take her life with a dagger in one split second; in just one split second, the corpse was instead baptized in a searing jolt of electricity, collapsing to the ground before dissolving into a shadowy miasma. Lucina shot a glance at Robin, bobbing her head in appreciation for the save.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads up Lucina, more on your left!\" The tactician dashed to the princess' aid, creating a flamethrower from the pages of her tome, burning the creatures as they shambled forward and allowing Lucina to cut them down with further ease. Chrom looked at the sight for only a second, admiring how the two worked together smashingly, and in that second the Risen chieftain had slammed an elbow into Chrom's cheek, sending him stumbling backwards and leaving him open. The zombie bought its axe down on Chrom's shoulder and a loud scream had broke the air, alerting Lucina and Robin as they finished their streak. They looked in horror as Chrom clutched his wound, blood spraying from the gash, and the Risen dashed charged towards Chrom with its axe; with his sword arm incapacitated, Chrom had no way to defend himself, and the two women ran desperately to clear the distance and save their leader from death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Chrom!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Father!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chieftain attempted to bring down its ghastly axe, it was punted skyward by a massive foot and screamed in agony as it left the ground; in just a few seconds, the howling stopped as it exploded into a dark dust. The 3 tried to register what just happened, too concerned with the thought of Chrom's demise, and as they returned to reality, they finally saw Severa, pumping her fist in the air at her kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\" she cried with glee, clenching her teeth in a large grin, \"How's <i>that</i> for a close save?! Better luck next time Grima! Try sending something a little bigger next time!\" Severa's victory chant was interrupted as she felt a sensation at her heel; she looked down and saw Lucina clutching it in as big a hug as she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods Severa,\" she warmly spoke, \"Thank you for saving Father! If you hadn't shown up, I don't even want to begin thinking what would happen!\" Severa removed her heel from Lucina's hug and spun around, leaning down as she rubbed the back of her neck in a smug sense of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing Luce!\" she replied, \"Heck, if you should be thanking anyone, thank Mom; I'd still be looking for breakfast if it wasn't for her!\" Robin walked forward, stuffing her tome into her coat and clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Severa,\" she began, \"I <i>was</i> going to lecture you for not being in camp in the morning, but that was an impressive save you just made.\" Severa merely groaned in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too? Look, it was Priam's idea to sleep outside of camp, not mine, and we had good reason too. Go lecture him if you want to yell at someone.\" Robin let out a giggle, with only a hint of smug arrogance in her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, you saved Chrom's life, and there's no way to properly thank you for that. We're in your debt, and I'll be sure to thank your mother too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa.\" Chrom called between gasps of chugging a vulnerary, the healing potion already having effect on the wound. The azure-haired girl looked down at Chrom with a slight glare, still not forgetting the insult to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want? We're not exactly on speaking terms, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Chrom replied, \"But you did save my life, and I have to give you thanks for that. So thank you, I owe you my life on this.\" Severa merely scoffed, not wanting to hear the Exalt's thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your butter-talk, your son already gives me enough of it already.\" Severa clicked her tongue for a moment, giving Chrom's admiration a second thought. \"But now that I think about it, if you really wanted to give me thanks, you'd let me back on the field for the next couple of battles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.\" Chrom replied with a smile, \"Your ban's lifted as of now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah!\" Robin protested, waving her palms in the air, \"Chrom, look, Severa just saved your life, I realize that requires a lot of praise, but didn't you yourself want to keep the knowledge of Severa's size from the enemy? To prevent further giant problems? Hell, just to prevent panic of seeing a giant woman from nearby villages?\" Severa winced a little at the phrase 'giant problems', not exactly appreciating Robin's tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did say that,\" Chrom replied, \"But if it wasn't for her being so big in the first place, I wouldn't be here right now. I might as well give Severa what she wants.\" Robin sighed a little in defeat, but quickly recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't argue that logic I suppose...Alright, I'll begin planning her position for the next battles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep watch over her Robin, Father.\" Lucina chimed in. \"I'll make sure nobody captures Severa for as long as I can wield a blade.\" Severa appreciated the way she was being treated like the princess she felt she deserved to be, but couldn't help but wince at Lucina's claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now don't say that dummy,\"</i> she thought, <i>\"The last thing I want is you losing your life over me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright then, I suppose we should get back to camp and prepare to march.\" Robin turned towards Severa again and looked her in the eyes. \"Severa, is there something you'd like to say to Chrom before we go back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked, \"'Stay focused on the enemy next time'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, you know what. Remember? That first night you grew?\" Severa folded her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no. I'm not apologizing for Chrom making an ass of himself in front of Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa,\" Chrom chimed in, prompting the giantess to look at him, \"Your mother came by yesterday to check on me, I promise you that I apologized for the way I spoke to her that night. It was a stupid thing of me to say, I admit that. If you don't want to apologize, then that's completely fine, I understand.\" Severa rolled her eyes at Chrom's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to check with her you know,\" she replied, \"To make sure you aren't full of crap.\" A little blush came over her face as she looked off to the side. \"But...I guess I can say I'm sorry for yelling at you, even if what I said wasn't wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Severa.\" Chrom responded. \"Now let's get back to camp, I'll fill out your paperwork for rejoining the field before we march.\" With a nod, the giant Lady stood back up again and begun her march back to camp, the other 3 following in turn. Robin closed the distance between her and Chrom and whispered softly into Chrom's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope you know what you're doing with this...\" she whispered, wary of what Grimleal and brigands could be capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't,\" Chrom responded, \"But I'm going to put trust in Severa on this.\" Robin rolled her eyes at Chrom's far-too-trusting nature and ran forward a bit to discuss with Lucina formations and defense plans for Severa on the field.</span></div></div>",

Clearly out of shape and out of manners, he choked out small gasps of air and smacked his lips, wiping away the sweat of panic from his head, and pointed at Severa, intent on singling out the giantess. \"Exalt or no Exalt,\" he cried, \"We villagers won't tolerate you bringing that <i>thing</i> anywhere near our village! She could just as easily step on any of our people on complete accident, then what will we do? Huh? She's a menace to us normal people!\" The rabble of villagers seemed to rally behind the portly man's shouts of prejudice, raising their farm equipment and fists and shouting in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a girl, that's a monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of woman wears something like <i>that</i>?! Think of the children!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speech frustrated Severa to no end, as well as a sizeable chunk of the other Shepherds, but mostly Virion and Cordelia found themselves furious, having their child spoke about in such an undignified manner. Virion stepped forward, ready to defend his daughter, shouting with the pride of a lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough!\" he cried in fury, pointing his finger straight at the chunky troublemaker's chest. \"I'll have you know that Severa is of the royal blood of House Virion of Rosanne! She is not only human, but of a pure and dignified bloodline, statuses you lack you vile swine! You will treat my daughter with respect or feel my wrath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure!\" the plump man rebutted, \"Being royal makes it <i>soooo</i> much better! Great to know that monster's considered more human than us hard-working village folk!\" The cries rallied from behind the man as he rubbed his fat cheeks, focusing on Virion's face and trying to remember his words. \"Hold up, did you just say 'House Virion' before? Aren't you him? That Duke who turned tail from his country when an armored lobster started building an army? What a damned loser! Anything that came out of your loins is hardly considered 'royal'!\" As the porky man chortled in self-satisfaction, Severa found her rage boiling; she could tolerate her insults, but how dare this no-name wannabe fatso try to drag her father's name through the mud - she wanted nothing more than to smash this jerk into a fine red mist. Priam and Morgan took notice of the giantess' trembling fist and reddening face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you ungrateful son of a-\" Severa's rampage hadn't even begun yet when she felt Priam's armored hand touch her ankle. She looked down at the Radiant Hero, observing his eyes were closed and he looked to be in a sense of calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember your inner chi, Severa. Let your mind wander.\" Taking his advice, Severa calmed herself, taking deep breaths and assessing the situation before her; her father looked like he was going to explode, and her mother was about ready to give the village rep a black eye - this wouldn't end well for the Shepherds' reputation unless someone did something, and Chrom &amp; Robin themselves didn't look too happy about the hate speech going on before them. The Lady cleared her throat loudly, bringing all eyes to her and halting any action that might have been ready to erupt. She took a short while to gather her thoughts before she spoke, and let loose her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, look,\" she begun, \"I don't give a damn what you think about me, but I really don't appreciate the tone you're taking with my Father, Chunks. As much as I'd love to throw you halfway across this country right now, that'd look pretty bad for everything the Shepherds worked for, so here's what we're gonna do.\" She leaned down as she got into her speech, singling out the portly gentleman, watching the rest of the villagers shuffle away from him. \"We're going to march onward, right now, as we get closer to the giant Fell Dragon that's threatening your entire livelihood, and we aren't coming back here anytime soon. And as much as I'd like to curl up in my Father's nice, comfy castle and start living like the princess I deserve to be, I think I'm going to take my sweet time working toward that goal, on the off-chance that another pack of Risen come crawling near your village.\" Severa let a nasty smile come over her face and prodded at the fat man's belly. \"I'm going to let you in on a secret: They go for the meaty ones first. Believe me, I've seen it.\" She got back up from her leaning position and walked off back into camp, intending to start packing away all the Shepherds' equipment; the village's last look at Severa while she walked off was of a full view of her backside and a middle finger directed at all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...I...A-Are you just going to let her talk like that?!\" shouted the portly man to Chrom's face, \"Isn't she part of <i>your</i> army?! What kind of soldier speaks like that to a village they're supposed to defend?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\" Chrom responded, \"Last I checked, it's not a <i>monster's</i> job to be nice to an ungrateful lot of villagers, am I right?\" As the portly man was taken aback by Chrom's words, Chrom turned to Virion and Cordelia to address them. \"I got this one handled you two, go check on Severa. Make sure she's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my lord.\" Cordelia nodded her head in respect, as did Virion, and the two ran off back into camp to go check on their daughter. The two made it to the mess tent where Severa had usually slept and were treated to the sight of their daughter beginning to take it down, easily removing the ropes and posts at her massive stature; her face looked like it was welling up with tears, and she sniffled a little as she was taking down the tent. Severa didn't notice her parents getting closer to her, and was finally startled when Cordelia spoke. \"Sweetie, are you alright? Are you crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Heck no I'm not crying! I just got something in my eyes is all!\" The Lady stopped her packing duty for a moment and sat back, allowing her legs to stretch out and her palms to rest upon the ground. \"Although, now that you mention it, I'm a little steamed about that guy back there. Gawds! Where does Naga find the time to make people like that?! He didn't just stop at insulting me, noooo, he had to go and bring you guys into it! You didn't do anything wrong!\" Severa's parents moved closer to comfort her as the girl hugged her knees to her face, very steamed about the incident; Virion was the first to clear his throat and speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be fair, my reputation does tend to precede me, and not in a very positive light...However, my darling daughter, you mustn't worry about us, you've clearly fought enough battles in your time, so please allow us to defend you once in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virion's right dear.\" Cordelia added in, smiling warmly. \"Look, just focus on yourself for now, you deserve a break from fighting, physical or not. I don't know how being that big is, but I'm sure it must not be easy, so until you work into the right rhythm, don't worry about us, we'll take care of you and ourselves. We're more than happy to help you with anything you need - just say the word.\" Tears welled in the young Lady's eyes as she heard her mother's words, getting flashbacks of her parents before their demise in the future; when she usually thought of their last words, she thought of it with selfish malice, but having grown older and spent more time with their past selves, Severa found Cordelia's speech to be heart-warming, and a very loving gesture. The girl plucked both of her parents from the ground and squeezed them tight to her chest, pulling them in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAH! Y-You guys are the best parents a big girl could ask for! Don't ever leave me, okay?!\" As Severa sniffled in bliss, Virion and Cordelia struggled to free themselves from the bone-crushing hug, sandwiched between the flesh of Severa's arm and her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes! We promise! J-Just please stop crushing us!\" Virion struggled to shout, feeling the air draining from his lungs quickly. Hearing this, Severa quickly set her parents down, listening to them gasp for air as they tried to regain their composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Whoops. Guess I forgot my own strength...\" Severa rubbed the back of her head and looked at the rest of the tents around camp present; she thought it'd be easy to rip them from their foundations and fold them up, but when it came to all the little knick-knacks the Shepherds owned, she was a lost cause. She looked down at her parents, still trying to recover, and coughed a bit as she re-spoke. \"So, um, if it isn't too much to ask, can you guys help me with packing up camp? You know, 'more than happy to help' and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sure thing honey...\" Cordelia gasped out as she clutched her knees and tried to take in more air. \"Just...Just give us...5 more minutes...\"</span></div></div>",

She wore a sullen look, and  most of the Shepards kept their distance, as Severa's bad moods were the stuff of campside legend, even before she grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever those closer could not feel Severa's usual rage, but melancholy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion and Cordelia followed after her, struggling to match her pace, even though she was walking slower than usual <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia placed an arm on her Daughter's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still thinking about that village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion did the same, taking the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brush it from your mind, that mayor was a scoundral and a cad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera sighed. Cordelia and Virion were more than familiar with, but this was different to her other sighs. It wasn't merely Severa being annoyed that she hadn't got her way again or the feeling she was being held to her mother's standards, this was something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked a wad of dirt in front of her , still looking at the ground ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point of it all? I try to be good, I train hard and when I run in and save the day I get called a monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful.\u201d Coredlia cautioned. \u201cAnd that was just one village, Chrom was greatful you save his life.

You ended your probation and won the Shepard's respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But everyone in that village...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion gestured dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what of the village? You're comrade in arms appreciate you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera huffed loudly, hitting the air with her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DON'T GET IT!\" She shouted, louder than she intended, startling the couple. \"I get it, everyone here knows I'm still human, the same moody girl I was before.\" She sighed loudly, her more familiar \"no one understands me\" sigh. \"But I saved that village from Risen and they thought I was a monster, how is it going to be any better when we reach another village? I bet they'll run screaming at the sight of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia tried to make eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't assume every village is going to react that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, let's be real, before I drank Ricken's stupid potion, how would the Shepards react if some huge person came marching in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion stood by Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit it would be quite alarming, but perhaps if they did not appear hostile we could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come, you would totally lose it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you saying you don't want to be a giant anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera paused and starred at the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. don't know. I mean at first I felt like I was invincible and could do whatever I want, but now it just feels like I'm an eyesore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia stroked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did a good thing today, even if not everyone appreciated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes you have to do the right thing, for it's own sake.

I meant the village people!\" Severa's words stung Virion and took the wind right from his sails, leaving Cordelia to only giggle at her husband's misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, but just know that we'll still be here for you sweetie, so if you ever want to talk, just say the word.\" A small blush came over Severa's face at her mother's words, so she turned around and went back to working to hide her mixed feeling of joy and embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Whatever.\" Cordelia let out a giggle and helped her husband back to their tent to prepare for the march, counter-balancing the hurt pride that weighed him down. Severa looked over her shoulder once more as she undid the final rope from the mess tent, glancing at her parents before going back to folding up the cloth structure. <i>\"What a bunch of goobers...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe march took a whole day, but the Shepherds had managed to set up camp westward. The work was far easier at Severa's size, as she was able to carry about half of the camp's supplies all by herself with such tremendous strength; setting up was a completely different story, as grounding the tent poles and arranging each Shepherd's tent around the perimeter was such a tiresome task for Severa, having to constantly lean over the whole time, not doing wonders for her back. Eventually, after 2 hours of strenuous assisted work, camp was all set up, and Severa took the time to lay down in a grassy field just a small bit outside of camp, meaning anyone could easily check on her and get her back into camp in case anyone showed up, lest the Shepherds have a repeat of their last campground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'm exhausted!\" Severa complained while fiddling with her hair. \"At least the boys in camp appreciate what I do for them, but really, why do we need <i>that many</i> tomes and swords? Meh, at least I can take the time to relax now. The grass feels pretty nice around here, and I like the peace and quiet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Severaaaa!</i>\" Severa groaned at hearing Cynthia's voice, it usually was never followed by anything good, but rather headaches instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And there goes the peace and quiet.\"</i> Severa lifted her head up and saw Morgan and Cynthia walking toward her, the latter skipping with her usual spring in her step. The two came just short of Severa's head, and the Lady turned over on her side to speak with them more comfortably. \"What do you two want? I'm trying to relax after all that setup work I just did, if you haven't noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Severa,\" Morgan answered, \"We just thought about checking up on you after what happened at that last village. Are you feeling okay?\" Severa let out a gruff scoff in response, but truly did appreciate Morgan's thought about her as a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, you don't need to worry about it. My parents do enough already to keep me in a good mood. Though, it's definitely going to impact my thoughts on saving the next town we come across.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't say that!\" Morgan replied, \"I know that it doesn't seem like it, but there are people who truly appreciate what the Shepherds do, and that includes you; don't let one mean old man ruin your entire perspective of people in general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!\" Cynthia shouted with glee, jumping up and down, \"I know what we should do! Let's take Severa out into the nearby town to meet some townsfolk! That way, they'll be used to having a giant hero come and save them from some monsters and Grimleal!\" Severa gave Cynthia this look like she had two heads, baffled by her suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you completely lost it? Is your head full of rocks? Are you actually suggesting I go into town and scare the hell out of people right after we <i>just set up camp</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know that for certain!\" Cynthia protested. \"Look, it's almost late into the night, which means the rest of camp's gonna be asleep soon; we can just go out, come back, and then the rest of camp will never know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, unless we scare the hell out of the townsfolk first and lead an angry mob back into camp!\" Severa massaged her temple in frustration, losing her patience on Cynthia's absurd plan. \"Morgan, please talk some sense into your girlfriend, you're the smart one in this relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think I agree with Cynthia on this; I'm all for order and everything, but I think it'd be beneficial if we try to get some townsfolk used to your stature first. Besides, it could be fun!\" Severa couldn't believe what Morgan was saying, he was always one of the most brilliant members of the Shepherds, sensible and calm, and here he was suggesting one of the most harebrained schemes she had ever heard; either she was having a crazy dream, or Cynthia had rubbed off on Morgan too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan, are you insane?! Do you <i>want</i> to see pretty old me roped up and put on display in a circus like some monster from one of the stories you read?! Is this whole army going to come down with the crazy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Severa, I promise I'm not going to do anything to expose you in such a negative light,\" Morgan assured, \"I promise that we'll just do a perimeter check around the town and we won't do anything to frighten the townsfolk, we'll only look for church-goers, children, and other good-natured townsfolk to prove to you there are some good people who will accept you for your size; I promise the moment you feel uncomfortable, we'll go right back home and never speak of it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Severa, pleaaaaseeeee~?\" Cynthia looked at Severa with gooey eyes and her hands clasped together, expectation in her voice. Severa wanted to say \"No\" and have that be the end of it, but she just knew Cynthia would be on her case the whole time; even then, there was some nagging voice in the back of Severa's mind telling her to humor Cynthia, to prove to her that there are good people out there and get the vile thought of the entire previous town calling her a monster out of her mind once and for all. Severa looked down at Cynthia and Morgan &amp; weighed the choice presented to her carefully.</span></div></div>",

She immediately shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia stepped towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Cause you seemed-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"SHUT UP!\"</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volume of Severa's voice momentarily startled the two, and even managed to knock Cynthia's hair out of place. When they recovered, Cynthia was distressed, but Morgan's eyes narrowed. Severa hadn't seen this too often but he was actually angry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa! We only want to help you! There's no need to yell at me, and espeically not Cynthia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera looked down at the ground, away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... I know you're only trying to help, but what makes you think this will turn out any better than last time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia immediately recovered her peppy attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this time we'll find better people!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms swung through the air as she came back to life. Severa merely rolled her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked serious again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa. don't you trust us? Don't you trust my judgement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera paused for a second, first looking at Morgan, then at the sky behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Most of the time. But you've been wrong before. And...\" She clenched fists and gritted her teeth, as though in pain. \"I don't want to go through that again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan walked towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't make you come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia jumped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah your super hu-\" The look Morgan and Severa gave told her that maybe she should hold back for just a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And even if we could, we wouldn't. But if you don't do this, you'll keep wondering if they would have accepted you and you'll keep worrying about the same thing every time we pass any kind of settlement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera folded her arms. She glanced at Morgan before continuing her till stare into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Her expression softened<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia skipped next to Morgan. Now was her time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you gotta put yourself out there or you'll never know who you could have been friends with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera pursed her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say.\" Severa muttered under her breath, louder than she intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Cynthia and Morgan were surprised, though Cynthia more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind.\" Severa turned her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan decided not to dwell on that out burst. He held out his hand to the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So will you join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera glanced at him peripherally, but did not meet his shake. Cynthia vigorously extended her own palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way daddy will suspend you again after you saved his life! And even if he did, I can talk him out of it, because I'm his Pega Pony Princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera rolled her eyes. Only Cynthia could say something that stupid with a straight face. They still kept there hands out. They were nothing if not optimistic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Morgan did raise a compelling point, if she refused his invitation, would she not be running and hiding herself away from people? How would she find someone who might like her if she did not put herself out there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost a minute of further hesitation, Severa came to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Severa said grudgingly, meeting Morgan and Cynthia's outstretched palms with her pinkie fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's do this thing... I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Morgan and Cynthia pumped a fist into the air before Cynthia ran towards the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get my pegasus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to wake anyone up, I don't want to be busted before we even foot near this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia stopped running, her sprint changing to a slow, careful walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Opp sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Severa waited, as Cynthia carefully led her steed back, only taking to the skies when she outside of camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew down to Morgan, tapping the back of her pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hop on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan did so, then turned to Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here, we'll be back when we find some good people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera sighed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure what was going to happen, she felt nervous yet a part of her was curious and eager.</span></div></div>",

The couple walked into town, going through the alleyways, until they found themselves in the main plaza of town. As they looked around for someone, or rather a candlelight to a tavern, store, home, or structure of the like, the two began to notice an eerie silence around them, combining with the darkness to make an unsettling scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is odd...\" Morgan mused, placing his fingers to his chin. Morgan peered around, looking for any sign of life, feeling a slight sense of dread in the back of his mind the more he gazed off into the darkness \"Cynthia, maybe this wasn't as good a plan as we thought, Severa might be right, but not for the right reason. Should we just...\" Morgan trailed off as he looked at his girlfriend sniffing the air, like a puppy looking for food. \"Uh, Cynthia? What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father taught me how to pick up scents of other animals, he learned it from a pack of wolves growing up!

I don't doubt Mr. Henry, but he's a little, um, eccentric. I don't know if we're going to find anyone like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found someone! This way, come on!\" Cynthia started walking off towards the scent's source, Morgan following closely behind her. After a couple twists and turns, the two found a church, causing a light smile to come upon Morgan's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, men of the clergy! If they're anything like Father, they should be understanding of Severa's condition!\" Cynthia gave the air a final whiff, and her light smile turned to a confused grimace. She gave the air a couple more whiffs, prompting Morgan to look at her. \"What's wrong Cynthia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's wrong Morgan. I smell-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, young ones!\" The two were interrupted by the words of a priest, they watched as he had come closer to them, and Morgan bowed in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello minister, praise be to Naga!\" answered the young boy in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes.\" the minister answered, a tad unenthusiastic. \"You two must be exhausted to have come out here in the middle of the night, please, come inside and rest.\" Morgan followed behind the priest without pause, but Cynthia seemed reluctant to go, ducking behind Morgan and holding his shoulders tight as she followed him. \"Your woman friend seems to be afraid of something. That hair, that complexion, she is Plegian, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only half-Plegian, and I assure you father, her faith in Naga is as unshaken as my own. She's my partner in the Shepherds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Shepherds? The squadron of knights from Ylisse? Most interesting.\" The three had found themselves inside the church, it was well-lit and spacious, the floor, pews, and pedestal seemed to be well-cleaned, the sight pleased Morgan immensely to see the church in good condition. \"Now then, what brings you two out to this town in the middle of the night?\" Cynthia seemed reluctant to talk, so Morgan immediately picked up for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well father, we've come looking for some people for our friend. She's come down with a condition, and she needs some support from another person to keep her morale up. The last encounter with a town left her in a bad mood, and we just want to help her smile again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, child, I'm sure some sickness wouldn't cause a town to shun her, people are good-natured by, well, nature after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not exactly a 'sickness'...\" Morgan ruffled the back of his head and took a deep breath. \"You see father, our friend is a, well, a giant.\" The priest let out a little chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you children a little too young to be drinking? Giants don't exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please father, you have to believe us. We can't really explain it either, but she had drank a potion that made her like this. We ask only that you and any of this other town's people could treat her nicely to put any fears in her mind to rest. And please, refrain from using the word 'monster' around her.\" The priest put a hand to his chin and pondered the thought before giving his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I understand child. Please, allow me to explain the situation to the other townspeople. I'll just be a moment.\" The priest left the church, leaving Morgan and Cynthia alone in the building by themselves. Cynthia let out a tiny sniff and whispered to Morgan, afraid people would be listening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan, I don't know about this, something isn't right. We shouldn't have told that priest anything.\" The smile Morgan had left his face and he adopted a serious expression as he looked at Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I felt it too. I had to make it seem like things were normal, I'm sorry.\" Morgan looked around the church, and the cleanliness of the building began to unsettle him. \"You looked so worried before, did you smell something horrible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, at first I smelled a person, then I smelled people, but more than anything, I smelled the stench of blood, and it was strong.\" Cynthia gave another light sniff. \"In fact, there's blood around us right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lets investigate.\" Cynthia began sniffing like a dog and Morgan followed as they tried to find the stench of blood's source. They looked around for a bit, before stopping at a door in the back wall of the church; from what Libra told him, Morgan knew this was to the storeroom. Morgan set his hand on the handle and turned to Cynthia; the two nodded at each other before turning back to the door. \"Alright: 1...2...3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door was opened, Cynthia stuck her hands to her mouth and Morgan looked ready to vomit; the two were appalled by the sight in front of them. It was a small mound of corpses, faces all frozen in fear, and from the look of their clothes, they seemed to be the residents of the town; drawn on the wall in blood was the symbol of the Fell Dragon, a mark Morgan was too familiar with, branded on the back of his Mother's hand and strewn across the future he and his friends came from. The sight was sickening, and Cynthia in particular looked ready to cry, taking note that the smell of blood was fresh; this implied to her that she and Morgan could have saved them, had they only been minutes earlier, had they only elected to bring Severa with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Morgan, this is...!\" Morgan buried Cynthia's face into his coat and began stroking her hair, trying to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Cynthia, I know, but we can't do anything now. We have to get out of here and report back to Mother and Chrom, right now.\" Morgan clutched Cynthia's arm tight and began leading her out of the church, opening the door slowly and peering around for that priest or anyone else, now knowing they were purely Grimleal and nothing else. The two began to quietly run back the way they came, hoping to reach the alleyways and fly back on Cynthia's Pegasus; as they ran, Cynthia sniffed the air and smelled someone's presence - she looked in the direction of the scent, at an adjacent alleyway, and saw a glimmer of light shine in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Morgan, look out!</i>\" Cynthia pushed her boyfriend forward into safety, and as he was pushed into a safe zone, Cynthia instead took the arrow meant for him, hitting her square in the chest. She cried out in pain and fell backwards, blood began to slowly drain from the wound and Cynthia's breathing became more intense; Morgan looked behind him and the color drained from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Cynthia, no!</i>\" Morgan immediately went to Cynthia's aid and tried putting pressure on the wound to stop the bleeding, panicking frantically in response to the surprise attack. He drew a small thunder tome from his coat with a free hand and begun looking around in a panic for the attacker; as if on command, a Plegian assassin came out brandishing a bow with a wicked smile upon his face, followed by three other swordsmen and the \"priest\" from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well boys, look what we got here: a couple of Ylissean dogs who're try to disrupt Master Grima's advent upon this world. How about we put 'em out to pasture, huh?\" Morgan glared at the priest with malice, he couldn't defend himself and keep Cynthia alive at the same time, so he tried to delay the attack with words, something that could let out his anger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! How dare you! You hurt my girlfriend, murdered the townspeople, and sullied Naga's name with your imitation! You Grimleal are the worst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, whoops, did we hit your little lover with that arrow? Don't worry, you'll be joining her in the afterlife soon enough.\" The false minister raised his hand, signaling his assassin friend to ready his bow. \"Gotta hand it to you kid, you did a good job trying to make that 'giant woman' nonsense sound real, we could use writers like you back in Plegia. I tell you what, I'd love to run my hands across her legs, those things must run for miles!\" Morgan grit his teeth and spat out his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything I said was the truth, charlatan, and if you strike us down, Cynthia and I will at least look down from Heaven knowing you incurred her wrath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, whatever you say kid. When you see that old lady Emmeryn up there, be sure to tell her that her message of peace had no place in Master Grima's world.\" Morgan had no idea what to do, if he tried to defend himself, Cynthia would surely be killed, but if he threw himself atop her, she could probably still be safe until help arrived, provided help arrived, at the cost of his own life; though irrational, he much preferred the second option, because at least he could die knowing he tried to protect the love of his life. Dropping the tome, Morgan threw himself over Cynthia's wound, putting pressure on it to stop the bleeding, and closed his eyes as he waited for death to come.</span></div></div>",

Its clear that Severa has either kidnapped my boy again or dragged them both into town and is likely causing a wave of hysteria.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t do that again , would she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry sniffed the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't smell Severa but I can smell... death!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeath?!\" Robin grunted. \"This better not be one of your jokes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he means the risen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy Naga I hope not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia drew closer to the town, having to fly down lower than she normally would to see it at this time of night. She looked back to Robin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any sign of Severa, and if she were here, we would have seen her immediately.\u201d<br>\r\nRobin wasn\u2019t satisfied, and checked  around herself. Something was wrong, she could feel it.<br>\r\nSuddenly a flash of magical lighting filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d Robin pointed to the light. \u201cThat\u2019s the flash of a thunder tone! It could be Morgan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoredlia steered her pegasus in it\u2019s direction, diving down to get there fast. As she did, she heard the thunk of an arrow.  The pegasus wretched in pain and start heading for the ground. Cordelia tried to ease it's landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pegasus has been hit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet us down, I\u2019ll handle this!\u201d Robin said. She chanted something, then launched a large ball of fire in the direction of the arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia stroked the neck of her pegasus, trying to calm  it down as she prepared to land for landing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arrow flew at Sumia\u2019s Pegasus, but forewarned from the attack on Cordelia, she was able to swerve and dodge it. Henry gleefully reached for his tome and chant something. Dark light struck the assassin and he writhed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest looked annoyed, but then he smiled, like a predator going in for the kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone clearly cares for you. No matter this just gives more bodies for our horde, and these look to possess quite the amount of quintessence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gaped up in delight as he struggled to stall the advancing Risen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia landed next for them, with Sumia right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing out so late?\u201d Robin scolded, before remembering where she was. \u201cNever mind, <br>\r\nwe have to fight our way out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia caught sight of her injured daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia!\u201d  She quickened her descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry snarled, suddenly looking serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh we're going to make you pay for this!\u201d<br>\r\nSumia landed as quickly as she could, and brandishing a stave as she approached her daughter, while. Cordelia took her mend stave and worked on her pegasus's wounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia's eyes flickered open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom? Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia whirled round to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere's Severa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe told her to wait outside town, we had no idea there were risen!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan,Robin and Henry were flinging spells at the advancing horde, but they kept coming! Morgan began losing his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s too many to fight with just us, what do we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked behind her, scanning the battlefield for any possible exit. Unfortunately there didn\u2019t seem to be any, only Risen marching from all sides. She bit her lip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep fighting and see if we can cut a path out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's eyes grew wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we really fight a whole town of Risen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, but we\u2019ve survived worse than this!\u201d Robin checked the battlefield again. \u201cThe one <br>\r\ndressed as priest is directing them, we need to take him out! They have archers, so falcon knights <br>\r\nstay on the ground and heal, we'll take point!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he was protected by several swordmasters and the assassin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did there best to fight through,  but soon found themselves surrounded by risen going in for the kill. They weren\u2019t sure how much longer they could hold out, but could suddenly feel enormous steps drawing closer and closer to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She will make an exquisite Risen! Archer and mages, focus your fire on the giant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera staggered back as the volley hit here, crying out in pain, staggering back and almost falling over. She couldn't handle another assault like that, but what was she supposed to do? Her first instinct was to charge forward, regardless of the pain she felt but she stopped. The area was too small to allow her to move around much, and its was true her unarmored body left her exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it Priam said? Something a warrior and their weapon? Making the best use of her body? <br>\r\nHow was she supposed to do that now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mages and archers readied themselves for another volley. Close range units she could handle but at range she felt helpless. She quickly searched for something that might help. Priam was right, she did need a weapon and armor.  That was it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving with extraordinary speed, she lifted up a nearby house, using it to and careful movements to block the incoming strikes. Another barrage came and she did the same, changing her stance and guiding her \u201cshield\u201d into the path of the attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u201cpriest\u201d scowled but sneered at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep doing that forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera grimaced but tried to appear confident. At least there was a little more room to dodge, but he was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archers and mages readied themselves for another volley\u2026. Only to be interrupted as Robin and <br>\r\nHenry cut their way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d The priest howled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was her chance, as the mages and archers tried to engage the new attackers, Severa closed in and stomped them down, eagerly tramping the risen under her. The risen that had been left behind came after them, but now Severa was gleeful, confident in her close range prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave this to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you need healing!\u201d Cordelia raised a stave and Sumia followed her lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks I guess.\u201d Severa brushed Herself off. \u201cNow its time to end this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera charged forward and trampled down the remain risen, waiting only till she had crushed the last one before pausing to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose the best Risen crusher EVER?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin glared up at her, as though the size difference between them was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dragged my son into danger and have the nerve to start boasting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera glared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saved your behinds! Your welcome by the way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were only in danger because you dragged them into town!\u201d<br>\r\nMorgan fidgeted with is neck, for a second daring not to speak. Somehow more afraid to face his mother\u2019s wrath than the Risen. But he soon found his courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop! Mom it was me! It was all my idea to go into town! I even had to  talk Severa into going!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin whirled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie for her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia moved forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not! I even helped talk her into it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan seemed on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to show Severa their were good people out there, people who could appreciate and see her as something other than a monster. I didn\u2019t think the first village we picked would be filled with risen\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to put everyone in danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia handed him a handkerchief. Severa twitched uncomfortably, not enjoying Morgan being so upset on her behalf<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDry your eyes kid, I appreciate the effort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the battle was over, Severa looked at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the hell is dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur pegasi can only carry two people at a time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked to Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd my dad\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin hesitated to look for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe thought I was overreacting! But look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re being unfair to Severa, this wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, how did she know we were here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was told to wait outside town, I saw your pegasuses-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's pegasi-\u201d Morgan tried to stop himself realizing that wouldn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera ignored him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. Your PEGASI flying into town. How many other people are going to be riding them at this time of night? And mom knows how to ride a pegasus, she isn't going to dive like that unless she's been hit. So I ran in and saved your hides. You're welcome by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin hung her her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. I\u2019m sorry Severa. Though we told you not to approach villages, especially at night!\u201d She also looked at Morgan and Cynthia as she said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera placed her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you can\u2019t blame me for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis time I agree with you.\u201d Robin focused all her attention on Morgan. \u201cWhat do you have to say for yourself? We have curfews for a reason you know! Risen prowl around at night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan choked back the tears, barely able to get a word out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia placed a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin wait, they shouldn\u2019t have been out this time, but they did this for my daughter, they just wanted to find someone who would accept her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia stood next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know my Cynthia, she always means well. Whatever her involvement, she was just trying to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made Robin angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you taking his side?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t possibly have known there would be so many Risen here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we made sure those Risen will never bother anyone ever again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin glared back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe saved you as much as you saved us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft.. I\u2019d loveee to have seen you take on all those Risen without me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan tried to get between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fighting please! If either of you hadn\u2019t showed up we\u2019d both have been-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, your appearance did give us a chance to regroup and heal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I guess I\u2019m glad someone drew fire away from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia raised a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does this mean we\u2019re off the hook?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were met with cold silence from all three mothers.

The adult ladies readied their weapons, cautious in case of another Grimleal attack, but Henry instead threw his arms up, motioning the group to hold it, as he sauntered over to the alley with his usual unsettling cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, ladies, I got this! No need to get feisty!\" he called out with his usual childish smarm. \"When you learn how to use your sniffer like me, then you can easily tell the enemy from some scared folks, and oh man! It sure smells like someone needs a wardrobe change! Nya ha!\" Henry stopped at a pile of garbage and ruffled around it for a while, whistling a cheerful, yet creepy tune as he worked; in just a mere manner of seconds, he found a small child hidden away in the trash, shuddering in fear. \"Hey guys! There's a kid here! What should we do with her?\" Upon hearing this and taking a look at Henry's robes, the little girl shuddered even further and begun screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Grimleal!!! Go away! Leave our town alone! P-Please don't kill us!\" Henry looked with a little confusion, looking at his robes before snapping his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I just knew I was forgetting something when I joined the Shepherds! I gotta retire this old Plegian stuff and pick up something more bubbly and Ylisse-like!\" Sumia tumbled on over in an attempt to control the situation, realizing just how scary her husband could be sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, dear?\" she asked, \"Could you just go over there for a bit? I think Cynthia would appreciate your attention.\" Henry flashed a thumbs-up and skipped away back with the party, allowing Sumia to have some alone time with the girl. The Pegasus rider put a hand to her cheek, trying to control the little girl's tears and fears. \"Shhhh, shh, shh. Nothing's going to hurt you dear, the Grimleal are all gone now. We're part of the Ylissean knights; my name is Sumia, what's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sally...\" the little girl choked out in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally, I get that it's a bit scary with all those nasty criminals and Risen about, but I assure you, they're all gone. Could you take my hand and meet my friends with me?\" With some reluctance, the young girl extended her arm towards Sumia's, and the Pegasus rider helped the girl to her feet, beginning to lead her out into the open and into safety. The first thing Sally noticed was the massive frame of Severa's legs towering above the rest of the party; at first, she yelped and whimpered in fear, but as her eyes travelled up the monoliths, she saw Severa staring down at her, hands at her hips, and instantly took note of how pretty the giantess looked, calming her a little. Severa was less than impressed by this reaction, and let out a huff as she turned her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, another knee-jerk reaction. Didn't see that one coming from a mile away.\" Cordelia shot Severa a glance, unsure of whether to scold or comfort her child, before shaking off the thought and stepping forward and kneeling down, getting on eye-level with the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, Sally!\" she begun, trying to lighten the mood, \"My name's Cordelia, I see you've already met my best friend Sumia; the both of us are Pegasus Knights in the Shepherds of Ylisse, and we're out looking to keep innocent people like you safe from the nasty monsters and brigands. Tell me, have you ever seen a Pegasus before?\" Sally shook her head no, clutching the shoulders of her clothes tightly; Cordelia just rubbed the little girl's head, ruffling her hair up. \"Then I guess we'll just have to show you what one looks like, huh? These are the rest of our friends, Henry, Robin, Cynthia, Morgan, and the big girl in the back is Severa; you might not believe it, but she's actually the princess of a kingdom in Valm, despite the strange choice in attire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Severa yelped with a blushing face, embarrassed by Cordelia's antics. Cordelia giggled as Sally looked confused at the \"Mom\" response. At this time, Robin came over and got down to eye level with the girl, trying to get more information on the situation in a gentle and approachable way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally, do you have a home around here?\" The girl shook her head yes in response. \"Great, how about a family?\" Again, a yes response. \"Alright, and do you happen to know where they are right now?\" Sally looked down and rotated her leg around the ground a bit, unsure of how to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, I don't know where they are, mom and dad. Th-They usually go to the church for town meetings, th-they might be there...\" Hearing \"church\" Morgan waved his mother over and beckoned her ear to his mouth. Having the town's fate whispered to her upset Robin deeply, and she could see Sally didn't look any happier that she wasn't getting a straight answer. Taking a deep breath, Robin walked back over to the little girl and got down to her level again, trying to mask the upsetting news as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to send a squad to investigate first thing tomorrow morning, is that okay?\" The girl reluctantly shook her head yes, a little upset that she didn't receive her family's fate straight-up, and Robin stroked her cheek in return. \"Alright, that's good. For now, I don't think this town is the safest place for you to be right now, so I want you to come back to camp with us. We have fresh food, fresh water, and there's extra room in my tent for you to sleep in; is that alright with you?\" Sally clutched her body tighter and looked highly resistant to going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But what if there's more Grimleal and monsters?! I-I don't want to go! No! P-Please don't make me!\" Cordelia gently put her arms on the girl to try and get her to stop shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey! Calm down! I promise you, nothing bad is going to happen to you as long as we're around, okay?\" Cordelia turned around and pointed to her daughter, her face turned sideways towards the night sky, looking at the moon. \"Do you see Severa up there? She's the one that squashed the Grimleal around here, quite literally I might add. As long as she's standing, she'll be able to keep you safe, and it's going to take a whole lot of rope to bring her down, even to a knee.\" Severa glanced down at the two for just a moment, still trying to feign disinterest, and saw the little girl worriedly coming closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, spit it out.\" she spoke up, \"I'm in the middle of stargazing.\" Cordelia was a little annoyed Severa was acting so cold, but Sally looked undeterred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miss Severa?\" she asked, \"I-Is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I mean yeah, I <i>might</i> have stepped on, like, one or two of those Plegian jerks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And you'll keep us safe? Y-You're that strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strongest darn girl in camp!\" Severa replied, some bluster in her voice. \"That's not a problem, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no, no!\" Sally replied, waving her hands back and forth, \"I-It's just that, um, the princesses in my storybooks aren't all that strong, a-and you look just as pretty as them, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really? You think I'm pretty?\" Severa rubbed the back of her neck with a slight blush, then shook off the thought and kneeled down towards her little fan. \"Well, most storybook princesses aren't 50 feet tall either. I mean, we got two of those types back in camp already, so you could always talk with them, but if you stick with me kid, I could show you how a <i>real</i> royal parties!\" Cordelia shook her hands back and forth, imagining a repeat of Severa's sexy dance show from day 1 of being a giant, while Sally just blushed and let out a small cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow! Three real princesses! O-Okay, I'll go back to your camp, but can Miss Severa show me around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'm sure she'd be happy to!\" replied an enthusiastic Morgan. He twirled around and looked up at his friend, staring her in the eyes. \"See Severa? I just knew you'd find a friend around here! No need to give up hope just yet!\" Severa let a small smile come to her face and the two friends went on smiling at each other for a short moment. This moment was soon interrupted by Robin tugging at Morgan's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you so happy about, Little Mister? <i>You're</i> still in trouble for organizing this little operation in the first place! You almost got your girlfriend killed!\" Robin begun dragging Morgan off and beckoned for Cynthia to follow her. \"Cynthia, sweetie, where did you put your Pegasus? I'll fly it back home for you while you recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure thing Mrs. R! It's uh...I think I put it this way...\" The three wandered off in the alleys as Morgan shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Mom! Ow! That's my earlobe! Please lighten your grip for just one second! Ouch!\" Once out of sight, Henry and Sumia got on their shared Pegasus and Cordelia began to saddle up on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa, dear,\" Cordelia called out, \"I need to make space for Cynthia to rest, could you carry Sally back to camp for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" Severa gently put her hand down and let the little girl climb on. As she got up, she watched the little girl tumble and try to keep her balance, and Severa instantly began to rethink the mode of transport. \"Yeah, maybe my hand isn't the best idea. You wouldn't mind the Bra Express, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa!\" Cordelia cried at the lewd suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! It's alright Miss Cordelia! I-It looks safer and warmer in there anyways.\" Severa stuck her tounge out at her mother and tugged open the front of her makeshift bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, down you go, little lady!\" Severa tilted her hand and let Sally tumble into her cleavage, before removing her finger from the hem of her bra and fondling her breasts to make sure it was comfy. The two girls smiled at each other while Cordelia put a hand to her face, feeling a small headache coming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief...\" With that, the group departed from town and back to camp.</span></div></div>",

So how did you get so big and strong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh... \u201c Severa stopped herself, not wanting to tell her what she really did.

You saved used from the monsters!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you see a saviour, and everyone else just sees a giant freak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?!

Just enjoy the ride, kid!\u201d She tried to look away, while still preiphally looking at the path in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally still didn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if you saved them why would they not like you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know!\" Severa flailed her arms in frustration. \"Some people are just jerks...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stood up, despite her unstable position. She stretched out her slightly to improve her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere just mean people! I know there are people out there who think your pretty and amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera made a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo far it's just you. And sit down\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy and Daddy will see it to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera bit her lip and looked away, trying to hide her pained expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever... people keep telling me that but your the first one I've met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than being detttered, Sally was even more fired her up, pumping her her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know we'll find more! How many villages have you been to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c2... so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee! There could be way more out there who like you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that... enough about me, lets just enjoy the scenery....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, flying on their pegasi, the  others arrived back at camp before Severa. Their absence had been noticed and Chrom was there waiting for them, a hand on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you go?! You know Risen roam at night..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed as she dismounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRetrieving our wayward children.\u201d She pulled at Morgan's ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan tried to loosen himself from his mother's grip. \u201cOw Ow! Not so rough Mom!\u201d He faced Chrom and lowered his head. \u201cIt was all my fault, after that last village Severa felt alone and I wanted to show her there were still good people out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia ran to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I wanted to help to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrome's firm gaze was focused on the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where is Severa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's heading back on foot carrying the last survivor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurviour? Was the village under attack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt had been taken over by a Grimleaf cult, the head priest had raised a horde of Risen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan prostrated himself before Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry! I dind't know,  I couldn't have known!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom relaxed and motioned for him to get him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe you. You shouldn't have wondered so far from camp but you were only trying help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrom, if I may, Morgan acted hastily but his plan was not without merit. Ever since Severa became a giant, Severa has felt like an outcast. If it would not be too much to ask, could we not scout around for a village that might accept my daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom looked thoughtful but uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.. I don't know.. it's hard to tell how anyone would react to her. Even that village we saved turned her aside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Morgan, I believe there are good  people out there would accept Severa, and if we found these people, it would be good for moral.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin turned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we find such a village? Almost everyone would panic at the sight of a giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia held her hands together..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe that is the case. Many but not all, we just need to find somewhere open minded.\" She had been adressing Robin, but slowly turned to Chrom, hoping she had persuaded him.  </span></div></div>",

Morgan\u2019s idea was not a bad one he just shouldn\u2019t have<br>\r\ndone it alone or only with Cynthia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirion stood by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it was unlucky the first village he picked happened to be overrun by Grimleaf. On the other hand, if you hadn\u2019t stumbled upon that village what other lives could have been lost to them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia placed an arm around Virion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly, you\u2019re a hero Severa, and even if you don\u2019t feel that way I\u2019m sure your passenger does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Severa is the greatest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm whatever. I\u2019ve had a long night, I\u2019m going to hit the hay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera stomped off, passenger in toe.</span></div></div>",

If Chrom wouldn't let her back on the front lines then she would  have no choice but to put her new size to good use and show him just how wrong he was. Slowly she rose from her \"seat\" as she was again gawked at by her fellow soldiers. They still couldn't get over the initial shock of how big Severa had gotten. She ignored them and they cleared a path as she headed off into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone would report her no doubt but she didn't care, once she came back victorious, Chrom would be begging her to be front and center for the next battle. Just the thought of the blue-haired leader begging her for anything brought a genuine smile to her face. All she had to now was find a group of brigands to squash. That shouldn't be too hard, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Hand over everything ya gots.\" A brigand spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't hurt us.\" A woman cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have anything.\" Another man added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only served to piss the brigand leader off. He backhanded the man to the floor, much to the shock and horror of the woman. \"Don't you lot know who I am\" I'm the all mighty Groh and I said hand over everything ya got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was crying now as she tended to her companion. \"Please! We really don't have anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lier!\" Groh roared as he kicked the woman down. \"No one makes a fool outta me. Got nothing my ass! You got a ring don't ya? Ya got earrings, don't ya? Hand em' over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have mercy.\" The man begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercy?\" Groh laughed. \"This isn't a fairytale boy, this is the real world. Mercy a joke.\" he then moved in closer, pressing waving his knife dangerously. \"Now hand over everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the couple could comply, a dark shadow fell over the area. The pair's eyes widened as the brigand leader remain ignorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Who turned off the sun!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroh slowly turned his head... Then he wished he hadn't. While he was frozen in a state of shock the odd couple took this time to run away. The brigand leader still couldn't believe what he was seeing. A woman, a giant woman. A titan! He thought they were just a story to scare little kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroh gulped nervously. This wasn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera stared down at the insignificant man with a scowl on her face and her hands on her hips. She'd been wandering around the forest for ages until she stumbled upon this sight. Needless to say she wasn't happy. Severa hated bandits, especially the ones that got off on harming the innocent. This guy was lower than dirt in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one would care if he suddenly disappeared under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Severa addressed the \"bug\" at her feet. \"What are you going to do now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robin sighed as she continued her trek through the forest. Apparently Severa had decided to go wandering off while she and Chrom discussed the possible merits of Ricken's growth formula. Needles to say, the grandmaster of Ylisse was anything but pleased. This is exactly what she was worried would happen, Severa going off and doing whatever with her new size. Hopefully she didn't wind up in any trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now all Robin could do was fallow the footprints the angry giant left behind. They were honestly big enough and deep enough to put a hot spring in. They also helped to put the larger woman's scale into perspective. At her size she could probably take out whole squads of enemy units in one go. Robin wouldn't envy anyone unfortunate enough to wind up under her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the master tactician continued to think over Severa's new set of skills, a small tremor seemed to rock the ground. It caused her to stumble a bit but she still remained standing. \"What on earth was that? Could it have been Severa?\" the snow haired woman wondered. There was only one sure way to find out. Scanning the area intently, Robin spied what appeared to be smoke rising in the distance. Robin eyed the trail she was fallowing and it led right to that area. Severa no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste anymore time, Robin broke out in a sprint. The tremors began to grow more frequent and powerful. It sounded as if a battle was taking place, and those were definitely the cries of screams and rage. The rage coming from a very familiar source. The now fifty foot Severa who appeared to be dominating a large force of bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin took cover behind a shrub and watched in both awe and slight terror as Severa literally stomped a group of brigands flat. This wasn't even really a battle as far as Robin could tell... this was a massacre. Did these fools have no sense of self preservation? Clearly not as they continued to charge at their much larger opponent. Severa either stomped them or flicked them away with her fingers. This was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's eyes analyzed everything she saw. The battle applications of having a fifty foot titan where just too much to ignore. The tactician could already picture a number of scenarios in her mind. All the ways she could unleash Severa on flying units, ground forces, and even large battleships. So caught up in her thoughts was she, she almost failed to notice the screams had stopped. The battle was over. Severa was victorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin couldn't believe it. It was one thing to talk about a giant in action, it was another thing to witness it. That large group of idiots never stood a chance. Granted they were most likely weak, but still there was strength in numbers. Numbers that mattered very little in the face or at the feet of a giant. Robin bit her bottom lip. She was torn. After a display like that could she really leave Severa on the sidelines? Maybe she could override Chrom and revoke her suspension?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Robin wrestled with her thought's, Severa was more occupied whipping her feet against the ground. Defeating those bandits may have been easy, but it sure was messy. More messy then running a sword through one of them. \"This is seriously gross.\" she muttered. It was then that she sat down for a minute to collect herself. She'd done what she set out to do and crushed an enemy group by all by her lonesome... literally. All she needed to do now was find proof of her victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to start looking until she felt something poking her foot. Looking down she instantly recognized the dark cloak of the Shephard's chief tactician. Instantly she felt her mood sour, had Robin come to reprimand her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Severa greeted plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin fixed her with an unreadable expression. \"We need to talk.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would reprimand her and send her back to camp where her parents and Prince Chrom were no doubt waiting to give her an ear full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, I'm in trouble for sneaking off, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin noticed the tone of her voice and noted how annoyed she sounded. Then again, from what little interactions the two shared she knew Severa always sounded like this. She was probably expecting to be reprimanded, granted she would be later on, but for now that could wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed you were missing after my meeting with Chrom and came looking for you. I half expected to find you all by your lonesome, but to my surprise I instead find you engaged in battle against a group of brigands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera eyes widened a fraction. Robin had seen her battle? If that was the case then just maybe... \"S-so what did you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gave the giant a small smile. \"I can't deny that I was indeed impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera's head nearly spun. Not only had Robin not reprimanded her so far, but she'd seen her battle and was... impressed. Gods, she'd impressed the Grandmaster of Ylisse! \"Then does that mean...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't speak for Chrom, but I will push to have your suspension revoked.\" Robin answered. With that display of power, Severa would be more of use on the front lines then hanging back around camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious!?\" Severa asked with hope in her voice. Was this really happening? Had her plan really worked? If Robin could get her suspension revoked then this war was as good as theirs. \"Ha, take that Prince! I told him I could be out winning wars!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin rolled her eyes at the disrespect. \"Don't go getting too excited now. I still need to talk to him first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more than enough for me!\" Severa grinned at her small victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin pinched the bridge of her nose. \"Anyway. From what I saw of your battle you completely dominated those bandits. They were a large uncoordinated force and yet you rendered their numbers moot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Severa's turn to roll her eyes. \"No duh. I'm like fifty feet tall and their not. They couldn't even wound me, let alone knock me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin listen closely to her words and for a brief moment thanked the gods above that Severa was on their side. She might need to look into a contingency plan later though, just in case. \"Interesting. You seemed to be able to take on other humans with very little effort. So how well would you fair against risen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave the giant pause as she thought over the question. Humans were smart and easy. Risen were essentially dumb undead, except for the generals. \"Hn. Risen would be no problem for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\" Severa assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin thought it over. Maybe they should test this theory?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trouble always did seem to find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" Severa grinned before slowly rising to her fell height. Despite already having stood close to the girl, this would still take some serious getting used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Note to self, speak to Ricken as soon as possible.\" Robin whispered to herself. Despite being an ally and the power display earlier, Severa still had her issues and a temper to boot. It would be in the tactician's best interest to get some of that growth formula soon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting that Robin wasn't moving and just staring at her, Severa decided to comment. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Robin answered. \"I'm still just getting used to the new you is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera nodded. That was understandable, though it still annoyed her a bit. But then again that feeling wasn't anything new. \"You want a lift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were still trying to get used to the new me, so how about a lift back to camp. It'll be a lot quicker if I do the walking.\" Severa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin placed a hand to her chin in thought. The very idea of Severa carrying her anywhere made her feel uneasy, and yet at the same time she found herself curious. What would riding on a titan back to camp be like? Would it be pleasant or would it be hell? She wasn't really sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis needed to be tested. Despite herself, Robin would answering, \"Alright. I accept your request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera smiled, \"Good.\" Things were going great. She hadn't been reprimanded, Robin was going to talk to Chrom about getting her back on the front lines, and she was about to impress the army's tactician personally with her new stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy didn't things swing this way for her all the time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crouched down to the normal sized woman and extended her palm to the ground. \"Hop on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was slightly hesitant but complied all the same. Needless to say it was beyond bizarre to stand in the palm of another human being. Severa slowly rose to her feet as to not jostle her precious cargo. Just like with Robin this was quite the bizarre experience. Ricken didn't count because she was blinded by fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter readjusting herself a bit to the new atmosphere, Robin noticed she could see over the trees and saw the forest extend for what seemed like miles. She could even see camp off in the distance. \"Wow.\" she breathed in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess giggled. \"I know right. So lets find a secure place for you to ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miriel flipped through the pages of the tome, looking through its contents to see exactly what it was capable of. The pages were a worn yellow with ink that had browned over the years, Miriel took note of its age as she turned each page, making a mental memo to publish a revised edition the next time her hands were free. The words were as common magic speak as regular tomes such as Elfire or Arcthunder boasted, but the symbols in the book appeared to be different, the usual triangular and circular shapes inside the text containing what appeared to be drawings of a person diminishing in size as the circles were viewed clockwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating...\" Miriel mused while rubbing her chin, \"This appears to be some sort of shrinking tome judging by the symbols and title. What exactly could its purpose be, I wonder?\" Miriel looked at the cover again and rubbed her finger across the book's leather - White, a color normally unseen in the army's usual library of tomes. \"Size manipulation would fall more in line with a hex from the dark arts, and yet, this book is not bound by any tint nor shade of purple. How intriguing...\" As she focused on the book, a small black speck entered Miriel's vision, a spider, hanging from a thread on her hat. With quick thought, she gently removed the arachnid from its thread with her finger and placed it upon her desk; she got up and begun to wield the tome, fixing her glasses to focus on the insect and aiming her palm at it. Reading the ancient texts, Miriel shot an orb of bright white from thin air at the spider; the light was absorbed into the insect and it quickly begun to dwindle in size, completely disappearing from sight on the candlelit oak and further piquing Miriel's interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How curious.\" She grabbed a magnifying glass from her nearby nightstand and sat again at her desk, aiming her sight at where the spider once stood. It took a bit of effort, but she had found the insect, a now-smaller black speck upon the desk, no bigger than a speck of dust as it tried to panic and run, but only managing a small speed. Miriel had immediately jotted down the effects of the tome within a journal at her side, before her focus was bought to the journal itself rather than the contents. Preparing the spell again, Miriel cast it upon the journal, expecting an effect, but instead of absorbing itself into the journal, the light dispersed into particles and disappeared. Jotting down another piece of info in the unaffected journal, Miriel sat down the tome on her desk and sat rigid in her chair, tapping a foot upon the ground and massaging her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work on inanimate objects, but rather on living creatures.\" she thought aloud, churning thoughts about the tome around her head. \"I would assume its application would be that of capture, to take a singular creature for transport, or perhaps it was made for a purpose of assassination? Perhaps for hiding or escape?\" Miriel shook her head. \"No, no, that would be illogical to assume if the caster cannot change themselves back, they would not even be able to wield this tome at a diminutive size. Furthermore, it is unknown if the subject can even grow again; I will have to test the theory on that spider.\" Miriel lifted the tome and reached for her magnifying glass again, intending to find the spider; it was only after a minute she had found a speck of blue upon her desk, remnants of hemocyanin from the crushed insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How disappointing.\" Miriel spoke over the spider's demise, \"I'll have to find another subject, one of the Shepherds should do since we have the benefit of human communication skills. Perhaps I should start with a male, or would a female be more willing?\" Miriel's eyes found themselves affixed to a mirror as she tried to leave her tent, and she soon found herself examining her frame in the mirror as she adjusted her glasses. \"Or rather, perhaps I should shrink myself and examine the tome's effects from that perspective? That way, I could better ascertain the thoughts of whomever wrote this tome themselves; after all, the thought of self-experimentation must have crossed their mind at one point or another...\" Miriel sat back down again and closed her eyes, tapping the tip of her chin as she thought what her next option should be.</span></div></div>",

It was a long day of potion-brewing he had partaken in, not wanting to let down the Shepherds when Robin had tasked him with chemistry work as part of a camp-wide movement in magical studies for the Shepherd benefit. Just as he was nearing the end of his chapter, he had looked up to see the familiar figure of a red-haired mage staring down at him, startling the boy and sending him tumbling out of his cot. The young mage massaged his slightly aching forehead and stood up, turning around to address his familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww, what a shock...\" complained Ricken, still trying to shake off his small fall. \"Sorry Miriel, you just startled me a bit is all. What brings you here?\" The red-haired mage fixed her glasses in response, gathering her thoughts as to explain her plan to young Ricken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ricken,\" she began, \"There is another experiment I require your assistance in. I was wondering if you would wish to participate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another 'natural truths'-type thing? Well sure, what do you need? A second hand for tome-work?\" Miriel simply shook her head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing like that, this experiment would be considered more of the 'combat application' you previously inquired about. At least, I suppose that was the intent of this tome.\" From her robes, Miriel produced the white-bound book and showcased its cover to Ricken. \"This tome, titled 'World Enlarger', is used in application to shrink an animate creature. I have no idea who created it, nor when it was created, yet I can't help but feel it will further enhance our combat abilities as an army if used properly against our enemies.\" Ricken had a slight twinkle in his eyes, entranced by Miriel's description of the tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A size-changing tome? That <i>does</i> sound like it'd be cool on the field! Just imagine if we could write an entire library of those things!\" Quickly though, Ricken's enthusiasm had changed to worry as he begun to register the implications of Miriel's visit. \"Wait...If you need my assistance, then does that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I wish to test this tome out on you.\" Ricken threw his arms up and waved them around, making a wildly expressive attempt to deny Miriel's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-uh! Absolutely not!\" the boy protested, ruffling his robes the more he moved around. \"Miriel, I spent my whole life trying to make myself a little taller so I could fight, why would I want to do the opposite of that?! Can't you try it out on someone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have considered that possibility,\" Miriel replied, \"However, I feel none could match the enthusiasm towards both magic and science that you have exhibited with me in our continued experiments, and you would be far more cool and collected in this experiment than any of the other Shepherds.\" Ricken felt Miriel's words buttering his ego, and he stroked his chin with a blush upon cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm cool, huh? Well, I suppose I am pretty enthusiastic when it comes to magic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assumed you would be completely willing to cooperate with me on this experiment. I suppose I'll just ask Robin instead.\" As Miriel attempted to make her leave, Ricken stopped her, fully entranced by her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Miriel! I guess I overreacted a bit back there, I'd be happy to help you out with your experiment if you'd let me.\" Miriel fixed her glasses in self-satisfaction, stroking Ricken's ego had seemed to work in her favor as she had assumed. She turned around and faced the young mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic. We will proceed with the experiment in here, and I shall transport you back to my tent for further planning and experimentation.\" Miriel produced the tome and prepared to work its magic on Ricken, but the young mage shuddered a small bit in response, not exactly looking forward to the tome's magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Miriel?\" he inquired, \"This isn't going to hurt, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you it is most salubrious, the spider I had tested this on showed no signs of visible harm, just a small panic when observed.\" Miriel opened the leather-bound book and begun to cast its magic on Ricken, the white orb of light producing in her palm as she used the bound paper to fix her glasses. \"Of course, I do not know if there's a remedy to the shrinking spell in this tome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what-\" Ricken had no time to finish his thought as the ball of light shot him square in the face, absorbing into his body. Miriel watched as Ricken quickly disappeared into his clothes, leaving a heap of cloth where he once stood. Miriel got to her knees to look for the small boy, and watched as a lump shifted around in the blue robes on the floor of the tent; Ricken removed himself from the heap of cloth and looked up at the giant face of Miriel looking down at him, her signature glasses adjustment responding to the recent turn of events. \"Wow Miriel, you're so big! I guess that tome really does work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" the mage replied, \"Your frame appears to have completely shrunk in the same proportions as your usual size. Your physique appears not to have dwindled either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My physique?\" Ricken looked down for a moment trying to understand what Miriel meant, seeing his decently-built arms, his slim torso, and his- \"HOLY SMOKES!\" Ricken gripped a piece of cloth and wrapped it around himself like a blanket to cover his nudity, his face completely red as he attempted to hide himself from Miriel. \"M-Miriel! You didn't tell me this wouldn't work on clothes! I can't be seen like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assumed you would've known based upon my explanation of how this only works on animate objects. However, there is no need to worry.\" Miriel produced a small set of clothes from her robes, hanging from a small wooden hangar. \"Libra was more than happy to provide me with a set of doll clothes he sewed for the orphanage children's toys. I did not explain to him this experiment for I felt no need, but I'm pleased to note his kindness comes without reason needed.\" Ricken wanted to be thankful, but he couldn't help but bob his head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Miriel?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ricken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...You do realize those are clothes meant for a <i>girl's</i> doll, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It was all Libra could provide me with. Why? Is there a problem with these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there's a problem, you realize I'm a...You know what, forget it, just give me the dress.\" Miriel passed Ricken the pink and white frilly noblewoman dress and stood up, turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will allow you a moment of privacy to dress yourself, and then we'll proceed to my tent.\" Miriel begun looking at Ricken's bookshelf, admiring his collection of tomes, while the small boy sighed and begun to put on the dress, distressed at the situation he found himself in.</span></div></div>",

As she walked, she spoke softly, touching her fingers to her chin and putting very little attention into where she was going. \"Now,\" she thought aloud, \"How should I make my entrance into battle? Flower petals? Nope, too redundant. Smoke bombs? Nah, that's the same as the last one; come on Cynthia, think!\" She walked and continued to mull the simple-minded thought, before snapping her fingers and shouting with jubilance. \"I got it! I'll set the enemy in front of a mirror, and then I'll just walk through it, and while they're all freaked out, POOF! It was really the great hero Cynthia! ...Wait, no, I'll need to learn magic to do that. Ugh, back to the drawing board...\" She continued spouting her rather loud thoughts, paying no attention to where she was going, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SMACK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, ow, owww!\" Down to the floor both Cynthia and whatever she crashed into went. The girl clutched her forehead in pain, gritting her teeth and closing her eyes in reaction. \"That really smarts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cynthia? Are you alright?\" The girl opened her eyes slowly and saw the image of a green-armored hand reaching out to her; she recognized it immediately, but let her eyes travel up the arm to confirm her suspicions; it was Stahl, her fellow Shepherd, clutching his forehead as Cynthia did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" Cynthia cried, gripping Stahl's hand and working herself up in turn. \"Stahl, I'm soooo sorry! I didn't watch where I was going and-\" The green-clad cavalier laughed softly and waved his hand in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I'm just glad none of us broke anything in all of this gear!\" Both parties stopped clutching their foreheads and shifted into a more casual conversation. \"From the sound of things, you were thinking up more heroic entrances, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm!\" Nodded Cynthia. \"I really want to do something to strike fear into the hearts of our enemies and joy into the hearts of innocents worldwide, something with a 'BAM, POW, WOO!'-feel to it, but that's no excuse to not pay attention to where I'm going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia, I told you it's fine.\" Stahl took a slight glance at Cynthia and noticed the wet stains on her attire. \"From all that sweat, I suppose you must've been doing a lot of combat training, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Gotta keep my lance-hand strong, you know? You never know when an enemy will strike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anytime soon I hope,\" Stahl replied, \"Thankfully we're in a perfect moment of peacetime here, so the need for us Shepherds is in lack for now. Your mother definitely makes a great Queen Cynthia, but I would've thought you'd rather try being more of a princess now since you never got to in the future.\" Cynthia shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I feel much happier being a heroic knight and knowing my skills could rescue somebody in peril rather than just doing those boring war council meetings and wine-tasting parties and those really boring operas, you know? Better off leaving the princess stuff to Baby Cynthia and Baby Lucina, I'm gonna make sure they get to grow up in a peaceful world to enjoy all that crazy royal stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have the drive for a hero, that part is down perfect! If you ever need any help in your training, just call on me and I'll take as many lance strikes as you need me too!\" Cynthia bobbed her head in joy. Stahl looked at Cynthia one final time and noticed something odd about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cynthia?\" He begun, \"You're looking a little strange today, are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right as rain, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be my imagination, but I always thought you were shorter than me, and right now, it looks like we're about the same height.\" Cynthia moved closer to Stahl and moved her hand to the top of her head, slowly moving it towards Stahl's to compare heights; she was beat by about an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, still looks like you're taller than me, I dunno what you're talking about. I probably might have gained an inch or two when we fought Grima back then.\" Stahl's face reddened a little as he continued to inspect Cynthia, noticing her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, uh, *ahem*, your, uh, clothes are a little, um...\" Cynthia looked down and noticed a huge tear in her combat dress, exposing her stomach. Face reddening, she moved her arms down to cover her navel and buckled her knees a bit to prevent any further damage to her attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Pegasus poo!\" she shouted, \"I just got Mother to fix this the other day! She's not gonna be happy about this!\" Cynthia turned around, intending to retreat into Castle Ylisstol and go see Sumia. \"I gotta go Stahl, I'm so sorry about the headbutt, bye!\" As Cynthia ran, Stahl noticed slight tears forming in Cynthia's skirt, slightly exposing her underwear and causing the green-clad knight to cover his face in embarrassment. Cynthia ran and ran, reaching the courtyard &amp; front door, before feeling a small tingling sensation once again. <i>\"There's that weird feeling again,\"</i> she thought, <i>\"Is this just a bad day for me, or some sort of enemy attack?\"</i></span></div></div>",

She couldn't see any enemies around, and mercifully no allies who would see her in this predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, why would any enemy be after my clothes?</i> Despite the situation, she took a moment to think about it and gasped.<i> They must be trying to attack my moral!

She was used to looking up or across to her mom, but now she was looking down, easily a good head taller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! This is one late growth spurt.\" Cynthia didn't know if she should be happy or worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think its possible for anyone to grow a head taller in the space of a few days.

Cynthia stood in front of the wooden frame of her door, pigtails untied, wearing Lucina's tightly-hugging pajamas that looked far too small for her, brandishing a small letter opener; slowly, she stood with her back to the door and etched into the frame with the letter opener just above her head, a habit she's been doing every week since she permanently moved into the castle after the war. She put the small knife to the side and picked up a ruler, sticking it to the mark she applied last week and slowly following the tickers; to her surprise, she had to shift up the wooden tool once just to reach the other etching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Holy crap!</i>\" she cried. Sumia, just outside the door at that moment, literally tumbled in and hit the floor, the clothes she carried spilling all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Cynthia?!\" Sumia cried, a little too panicked. Cynthia helped her mother off the floor and helped to pick up the pile of clothes she dropped, which she noted was her combat dress by the color and the newly-added stitchings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mother!\" Cynthia replied, feeling bad about startling her. \"But look-\" Cynthia pointed at the door frame. \"That etching last week read 5'6\", and that new one reads 6'11\"! The ruler doesn't lie!\" Sumia looked at the etchings with a small murmur of worry in her heart, afraid of what would happen if her daughter kept on growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is worrying...\" Sumia mused with a frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, I don't think it's worrying,\" Cynthia responded while rubbing the back of her head, \"It's just a little unexpected, you know? Like BAM! When you get hit by a carriage after helping an old lady cross the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia, I don't think this is a laughing matter.\" Sumia replied, \"I've never seen anything like this before, and I have a feeling that rock had something to do with it. Why, if your Father were home right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mother, cheer up! I just got a little taller is all!\" Cynthia sat down on her bed, and both her and Sumia were startled by the slight creaking noise the bed made upon her seating. \"Oookaaay, maybe that is a little worrying...But still, I haven't felt any different in the past 4 hours or so, maybe this whole thing is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still Cynthia, rocks don't just make people change like this.\" Sumia put a finger to her lips in thought. \"Well, except maybe Panne and Nowi, but they aren't 100% human...Either way, I feel a right to worry as your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, if I had a bullion for every time I heard that one...\" Cynthia thought it over for a bit before spouting out her words. \"I mean, I did have this thought that this could all be a very calculated enemy attack, but I don't get the point in trying to make me bigger...Oooh, unless they're trying to turn me into a monster! Yeah! I'd be all 'Rawr! Grrr! Crush the buildings! Eat the townsfolk! Shoot fire breath!' That'd be neato!\" Sumia didn't like the twinkle going on in Cynthia's eyes, she always seemed so fired up over the most childish of fantasies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia, please!\" Sumia pleaded, trying to get her daughter back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, whoops! Sorry about that, got a little carried away there!\" Cynthia cleared her throat a bit and shifted the tone of her words. \"I'm sure that whatever's happened to me is nothing like that. Probably. And anyways, Father and Lucina are away on that trip to Valm, right? The way I see it, we got about a week to figure this out, it's nothing that some good ol' knights of the sky can't handle!\" Sumia let out a sigh and broke into a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose your right sweetie, but just promise you'll come find me the moment something happens, okay? It's not like we can exactly keep this a secret with all the guards running about, so be sure to talk to them and send them to fetch me, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Sumia patted her daughter's head and moved to the door, placing her hand on the stack of clothes on the dresser. \"Anyways, your clothes are right here, I managed to sew up the big tears, but don't try to put them on again, okay? I don't want to have to sew an entire dress back together piece-by-piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Mother, thanks again.\" Sumia prepared to exit the room and blew a kiss towards Cynthia's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Cynthia, sweet dreams!\" The door gently shut and Cynthia could hear a crash from outside her room. Upon further inspection, a piece of Sumia's dress was caught in the door; Cynthia watched her mother open the door again and pull the piece of cloth from the door frame before shutting the door once more. With that out of the way, Cynthia slowly laid down on the bed, trying not to break it in two as it creaked and shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Alright Cynthia,\"</i> she thought, <i>\"This is a whole new chapter in your hero epic, you just gotta outsmart the situation at hand and aim for the happy ending! In fact, this could be the heroic power up happy ending!\"</i> Cynthia felt a hard binding pain in her chest and quickly identified it as the pajamas she wore, the top only buttoned once as that was as much as she could manage. She tugged hard to try and get her pajamas comfy and felt the single button snap away from the cloth as she made repeated, jerky tugs; the button recoiled off the ceiling and hit Cynthia square in the forehead, she clutched it in pain. <i>\"Okay, definitely not a happy ending! I'm gonna need some serious coin for a tailor at this rate!\"</i> Feeling the urge for sleep, Cynthia closed her eyes and let her mind adrift, taking the sheets of the bed and throwing it over herself quite sloppily. <i>\"Welp, you can worry about it in the morning Cynthia, but for now, there's a village of unicorns that needs to be defended from some evil nightmare knights; nighty-night...\"</i> In just a few seconds, Cynthia completely fell asleep and begun to loudly snore her cares away all throughout the night; as she slept, small tears began to form in her pajamas, and her frame shifted atop the bed slowly.</span></div></div>",

Her bed had collapsed and her legs and body stretched far beyond it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia took a moment to take this all in. Her pyjamas were torn to shreds thought the bedsheets would just about cover her vulnerable areas but she still didn't want anyone to see her this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just how big am I going to get? As big as the castle? As a big as a dragon? </i>Cynthia suddenly had the mental image of her slamming down a dragon with some awesome wrestling technique. The thought made her smile and she found herself bobbing up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" She pumped a fist into the air. \"Super giant dragon slammer Cynthia!\" She let the sound hang in the air. \"Hmm... I should probably work on that name....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe haze of fantasy passed for a second. Cynthia wondered what she could wear. A hero could hardly go around butt naked after all. But if these spurts kept happening she could hardly ask her to keep redoing her clothes every few hours. She could try waiting it out. but how long would that take and what if it never ended?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't possible, surely? I mean no stone could make her grow and grow until she was bigger than the planet or something? Then again how did a rock do this to her in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia breath quickened at those thoughts. No, she had friends and family who wouldn't let that happen to her. She steered her mind away , and back onto thought about being a giant hero and the poses and quips she would need to make. On the other hand, she would also need to find something to wear. Clothes weren't going to cut it, and bedsheets were barely doing the job as is, and if she had another growth sprut they would go kaput! But what else could she wear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrapes! That was it! She might still outgrow those, but it would at least buy her some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia tried to stand up, noticing one obvious problem with her size and instead settled on crawling through her room. She hoped if there were any enemies for her to fight, they would be courteous enough to fight her outdoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the drapes and wrapped it around  her body and thighs, before tying the back in a knot. It was far from perfect, Sumia would probably have done a much better job but it would keep her covered for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled towards the door and tried to squeeze through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh they really don't build these things for giants!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cynthia got her body halfway through the door before reaching a problem. <i>\"Uh oh.\"</i> she thought as she could feel something was wrong; her rear end was stuck in the doorway, keeping her from moving in the wooden frame. She grunted and wiggled to try and get through the door, but couldn't no matter how hard she tried, there just wasn't enough force her hips generated to bend the frame. <i>\"Oh come on now!\"</i> Cynthia inwardly thought, <i>\"I can't get bested by a door! There's no folk tales about heroes whose arch-enemies were doors! I mean, unless the story was about a thief.\"</i> Suddenly, Cynthia blushed a bit, realizing the gravity of her situation - there she was, freakishly huge, half naked, and with her body stuck inside of a door frame; it truly wasn't one of her finer moments in a long list of blunders and pratfalls on her quest to become a hero. <i>\"This just feels so embarrassing right now, I hope that nobody comes along and sees this...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia's thought was interrupted by the sound of spat-out coffee flying through the air, some of the liquid hitting her arm and bringing a chilly sensation over it. Cursing her awful luck, Cynthia turned her head to the side and saw Frederick, free of his armor and wearing his usual butler's garb rarely seen by many. The knight captain looked shocked, like he didn't know what to make of the situation, it's no wonder Chrom dubbed him \"Frederick the Wary\"; Cynthia could hear him gulp and clear his throat as he tried to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Cynthia,\" he spoke softly, \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' Frederick!\" Cynthia replied, nervously giggling, \"Wow, that was one heck of an overnight growth spurt, am I right?\" Frederick seemed further calmed hearing the princess-by-birthright's voice; Cynthia could only imagine this meant he saw her as some sort of monster, but she couldn't blame Frederick, he only wants to protect the kingdom, she remembered stories told to her of the animosity he showed Robin, Henry, and Tharja at first, wary of Plegia. Frederick took a breath and regained his composure, unfurling a handkerchief from his breast pocket and coming closer to Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, milady,\" he spoke as he began wiping the coffee from Cynthia's arm, \"I don't know what came over me, it's shameful to call myself a servant of the Ylissean royal family and act in that manner towards you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's fine! I'd probably do the same in your situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how, pray tell, did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, now that's what I'm trying to figure out.\" Cynthia shifted her arm to rest her chin on her palm. \"One moment I'm cute little Cynthia, and the next moment, I'm turning into a giant. Mother's starting to think it's this weird rock I found, but I still think there's an enemy mage out there who forced me into a growth spurt for some nefarious purpose. Not that I'm complaining, once I get out of this door, I'll be all 'Hi-yah!', 'Bam!', 'Pow!', I'll be the incredible Super Cynthia, bringing smiles to the innocent masses and capturing no-good evil-doers in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm assuming your lack of clothes is directly related to this 'growth spurt'?\" Cynthia immediately moved her arms to cover as much skin as she could, her face was as red as a tomato upon Frederick's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, don't make it weird Frederick! It's already embarrassing enough that I'm stuck in this door, I don't want people seeing me in my makeshift smallclothes either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, forgive me milady.\" Frederick responded, not realizing how blunt he could be sometimes. He looked at the door frame closely and could see Cynthia's hips stuck behind the wood, part of her body tightly wedged between the frame, meaning she wasn't going anywhere without renovating the castle. \"I can now see what the problem is milady, shall I go fetch my axe and bust down the door frame?\" Cynthia panicked a little, images of a bloodbath flashing through her mind if Frederick missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nononono! That's alright! If, uh, you could get someone else to help though, that'd be real neato! <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Oh please get someone else...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, I shall go fetch for the finest carpenters in Ylisse.\" Then Cynthia started getting flashbacks of the looks she got yesterday from the guards, and she'd rather not have a squad of burly carpenters oogling her as she died from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound like a good idea either,\" Cynthia replied, \"I've already had some guards give me looks yesterday when my clothes were coming undone, I don't want to have a bunch of strangers doing the same.\" Frederick raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Looks', you say? Which guards? I'll send them out for squat-jumps around the castle walls for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there was Stahl in the barracks who first told me my dress was tearing, and then as I went by, there was Blake, Adam, and Holm...Wait, no, way off-topic here! Could you just fetch Mother for me? She'll know what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood milady, I'll get Queen Sumia immediately. On my way, I'll fetch some jam from the kitchen, lubrication could get you unstuck.\" As Frederick began to leave, mental images of her hips getting covered in strawberry jam flashed through Cynthia's mind, and the thought skeeved her out a bit. She wiggled around and reached out her arm towards Frederick as he jogged down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Frederick, scratch that last part! Just Mother, no jam- and he's gone.\" Cynthia flopped to the floor and pouted a bit at her misfortune, another in a collection of unlucky moments the young hero-in-training has gone through in life; it wasn't a great way to start the morning off. \"Man, why does all this really kooky misfortune keep happening to me?\"</span></div></div>",

Silence. How long would it be before Frederick returned? How long what it be before someone came along and found her this way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long am I going to be stuck here anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia suddenly felt like she had to act. Both hands against the door frame she tried to get herself out but to no avail. She tried and tired again and soon felt a dreadfully familiar prickle and suddenly found herself growing rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of her efforts combined with her growth spurt snapped the door and finally let her crawl out, for all the good it did. She could feel her shoulders ripping through her makeshift outfit and the hall was becoming so tight she could scarcely correct this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her body rapidly growing body, even the hall was fast becoming too tight for her and she found herself legs then arms cramped against the wall even as she continued to grow larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs flustered as she was, Cynthia gazed  down around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever evil doer is doing this to me come out!\" Cynthia shouted down, surprised at how loud she sounded.<br>\r\nThat quite voice inner voice she didn't listen to often enough to told her that maybe drawing further attention to herself wasn't a good idea. Too late to worry about that now, the walls and ceiling were closing in on her and she wasn't sure if she would crush them or they would crush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't end like this!\" For the first time in a while, Cynthia felt mortal terror, but this wasn't different to being on the battlefield, she had time to consider it and see her life flash before her eyes. \"I still have so much to do.. mother...\" She thought of that other timeline and shivered. A tear formed in her eyes and she flashed back to when she was but a helpless little girl. Cynthia shook her head. \"No, I can't think that way! I will get through this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith what little mobility she had left, she tried to make herself as small as she could manage and prayed this strange growth spurt would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her growth continued, she realized she had a choice. She could continue lying back in her predicament, hoping it would end or someone would come save her or she could make a desperate move to save herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her legs being pushed against the wall and gnashed her teeth in pain. Gritting her teeth she  stood up as much as she could, pushing against the ceiling with all her strength. Seeing the combined might of her spurt and her own strength free her from the door way she hoped she could achieve the same result here. Maybe the ceiling was less heavily fortified, or maybe she was just that strong but to her relief she forced a hole and was able to climb out and down to the ground below. It was only when her feet were back on the ground did she realize how little of her outfit was left and the sight she might cause.</span></div></div>",

Unsurprisingly her size and sudden appearance had drawn some attention and several of the guards were drawing weapons or alerting their fellows, though some were indulging their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey think I\u2019m some kind of monster! This is no way for a hero to be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia raised a hand, still keeping a hold on the casltle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait don\u2019t fire! It\u2019s me, Cynthia! Don\u2019t you recognise me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was pretty sure she stood out during training, though not for the reasons she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the guards lowered their weapons or at least hesitated, however others kept their bows or javelins on hand and awaited a signal. Cynthia tensed up knowing she was vulnerable at this size and in this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don\u2019t suppose the arrows would bounce off me cause I\u2019m a giant or something? </i>She tried to convince herself but couldn\u2019t buy it. <i>Still it would be better if she talked her way out of this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey come on! You can\u2019t think I\u2019m a monster just because I\u2019m really big! Didn\u2019t anyone tell you it\u2019s what\u2019s underneath that counts? I mean just because I am big it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to be all ME SQUISH HUMANS NOW RAWR! \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat quiet voice in her head came to life again, telling her that maybe this wasn\u2019t the best time to mention squishing people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh I mean- please don\u2019t make me into a pincushion!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archers looked confused, looking to their leader for directions.

She thought of jumping down, but the instant she did that she would be fired upon. Fortunately someone familiar was coming her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia?! What happened to you?\u201d Stahl shouted up to her, simultaneously in disbelief yet flustered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just got really big! Can you tell these guards to back off so I can get down from here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, Cynthia did not understand why he was flustered, then finally remembered the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh uh-\u201d Cynthia did her best to cover her with her free hand the bit of the castle she had to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStahl!\u201d One of the guard said, and the attention of several others were drawn to him. While Stahl did not stand out among the Shepards, many of the guards knew he was one of those who fought along side Chrom, though in what role they weren't sure. \u201cWhat should we do about this giant? We found her on the roofs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt ease, this is Lady Cynthia, she wouldn't hurt a fly no matter how big she was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she really is-\u201d \u201cForgive us Lady Cynthia!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alight, just let me pass and get Mother. Oh and give me a little privacy please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey promptly complied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd.. thanks Stahl, you\u2019re a life saver!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, thoug still avoidied looking directly at her, a red line visible on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia looked for a place where she wouldn't be exposed, but still within easy reach of everyone. She settled for a clearing outside the castle, believing her mother would find her easily enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow no longer worrying about the guards or peepers Cythia\u2019s thoughts drifted back to taking notice of her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just how big am I going to get? </i>She had some terrifying mental images of her towering over Ylisse. <i>Well I\u2019m not feeling that thing I felt before I grew, maybe its done for now?  She really hoped so. Maybe I can finally get some clothes that I wont tear to shreds and then I can be giant hero Cynthia! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought shook her out of her fears<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled, and she realized that with all the excitement she hadn't eaten. <i>Oh man, what am I going to eat like this? I bet I\u2019m going to need like a ton of throat or a bunch of boars or bears or something!</i></span></div></div>",

Even with her busy schedule, Sumia found enough time in her life to make periodic visits down to the stables and personally care for the Pegasi, out of kindness and duty to keep the animals happy and healthy. When the call had come in from her guards that her daughter had grown again and required her help, Sumia was worried, yet ecstatic, for she could use hiding the knowledge of her daughter's gigantism as an excuse to get away from the cushy chauffeur travel and ride the wind once more; Sumia saddled up her personal Pegasus, the same she had cared for those 3 years ago, and took to the skies in her riding gear, bound to the forest clearing, glad to feel the old armor bound her shape once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Woah! Careful there girl! Let's just go- ah!\" Sumia's movements weren't as graceful and controlled as they used to be, her Pegasus going a little wild now that she had action again after so long a break; still, the two were in sync with each other, and though the flight wasn't as short as expected, it still remained a good refresher course for Ylisse's Queen in the art of flight. Touching down on the forest floor, Sumia tied her Pegasus' reins to a small, but sturdy tree, and walked for a short while to reach her daughter. Once in sight, Sumia now understood the urgency in her guard's words; the once petit daughter she had come to love, with vibrant blue pigtails that brightened everyone's mood, was now a towering giantess with her hair undone and unkempt, completely naked with her legs hugged tightly together and to her chest, a hand full of leaves and berries, and evidently a mouth full of them too. \"My, my,\" the Queen spoke calmly, \"I didn't think things would get this out of hand. What happened to you Cynthia? And why are you holding all those leaves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, these?\" Cynhtia replied, \"Well, I first tried to make some smallclothes out of them for comfort, but they didn't want to stay together, so I just started eating them to try and keep my belly full. Preeeetty sure they're poisonous though, they taste like soap...\" Sumia sighed a little and sat herself on a log, wanting to get to the bottom of this quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Cynthia,\" she spoke, \"I want you to walk me through this as detailed and carefully as you can. What happened between the time I last saw you to now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I woke up larger and naked after bed last night, and then right after Frederick came along, I got big again, and I wrecked part of the castle. Which reminds me, sorry about that, and the drapes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyways, me and Stahl had to talk the guards down from shooting me silly, and then I came down over here and just waited for you to show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Sumia looked over her daughter once more, observing the scale Cynthia now stood at. \"How you've grown this much in just two growth spurts is a little worrying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, three.\" Cynthia corrected, looking a little flustered, \"I got a teensy bit bigger while waiting for you, but I didn't break anything that time, so I didn't think it was important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless Cynthia, you're now almost half the size of the castle, and I don't know if this is going to stop any time soon. We're going to have to do something before this gets out of hand. Hmmm, if only Chrom were here now...\" Suddenly, lightbulbs went off in Cynthia's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, oooh, oooh! What if you got Robin to help us out?!\" Sumia looked up at the ecstatic face of her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Robin's great at all this tactical stuff, if anybody can figure out why I got so big or how we can stop it, Robin definitely can!\" Sumia rubbed her chin for a bit and mulled the thought over; she didn't exactly like the idea of letting more people know about Cynthia's predicament more than she had to, but it's true that Robin could give them a clear advantage in understanding the nature of this problem. Sumia shook her head in agreement and let out a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I got you Cynthia, I'll go fetch Robin and bring them back here. But I can't make any promises about fixing this, or how quickly we could do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Mother!\" Cynthia replied with her usual cheer, \"A hero needs to keep grinning through even the worst of situations! No dumb rock's going to break this girl's smile, that's for sure!\" Just then, Cynthia felt her tummy rumble a bit, bringing a small blush over her face as she felt the naked flesh of her stomach rub over her legs. \"But uh, if you could bring back a little bit of food, like some meat or something, and a really big cloth I could blanket myself in, that'd be super-duper...\" Sumia giggled a bit in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I hear you, I'm sure I can find something in the kitchen and storage rooms for you to use.\" Sumia worked herself up from the log and dusted off the skirt of her armor, getting ready to ride once more. \"Alright, I'm going to be gone for a few hours, so I want you to stay put, okay? No confronting strangers, don't freak out if you start growing again, and please stop eating those leaves if you think they're poisonous, okay?\" In response, Cynthia immediately dropped the leaves and saluted her Mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, I'm heading into town then. We're lucky Robin's so local, else this could be an issue.\" Sumia turned around and slowly walked back to her Pegasus in the woods. \"Stay safe Cynthia!\" Sumia waved as she left, disappearing into the cool shade of the trees. Cynthia waved back until her mother disappeared from her sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By Mother, happy flying!\" Once gone, Cynthia was left to her own thoughts, alone in a quiet forest. \"Alright, gotta pass the time until Mother gets back, what to do? Are there any tales of giants having fun while they wait for the hero to fight them?\" Cynthia looked up at the sky, hoping to count clouds, but was instead met with the clear blue sky and bright, shiny sun. \"Well, that's disappointing...\" In her disappointment though, Cynthia felt the rays of the sun beat down on her head, and then she remembered that Ylisstol was currently in the middle of the summer season. \"Though while I'm here and unclothed, I guess I could work on a tan...\" Cynthia uncurled herself from her sitting position and flopped over on her belly, letting the sun shine down on her backside; she hummed in pleasure as she felt the warmth hit her spine, and smiled wide as she got in a relaxing position. \"Oh yeah! Let the sun shine down on where the sun don't shine! This isn't so bad of a situation after all! Maybe I should take a vacation with Father, Mother, and Lucina to the Hotrealms before I get back to normal!\" In her relaxation, Cynthia shut her eyes and drifted off into a small nap, letting the sun tan her body as she dreamed up some new fighting poses and lines to say.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately Robin, her husband Priam and Morgan were training just a short distance from the castle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia called to them, getting Robin\u2019s attention, though Priam was too focused on righting Morgan\u2019s sword swings. She lowered her Pegasus to the ground. Robin turned to greet her. Her posture drooped, clearly from fatigue, yet she was as cordial as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sumia.\" Even though Sumia was a queen, she had insisted her friends still call her Sumia, though some of the knights we\u2019re reluctant to do so.  Robin suddenly became serious when she got a clear look at Sumia\u2019s face. \"I haven't seen you this worried since our battle with Grima, whats the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Robin, you always knew me so well! I- I'm really not sure how to explain it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell me everything, we've fought together through thick and thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia hesitated for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 It's going to be very hard to believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom\u2019s daughter travelled through time to try to save him from an ancient dragon possessing me, I'm sure it can't be stranger than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia took a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about Cynthia... she's turned into a giant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin blinked and was momentarily lost for wards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg you're pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan froze for a moment. In his moment of distraction, Priam knocked his wooden sword of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam turned his head, looking oddly intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... she must have a lot of Chi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia wasn't sure how to react to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind him, hes still constantly thinking of swordplay and how to get stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam almost smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you my love.\"<br>\r\nRobin smiled back at him for just a second before facing Sumia again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway did we hear you correctly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know it sounds impossible but-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s eyes widened as he struggled to take it all in.. \u201cThat sounds like something out of a fairy tale.. then again so does time travel\u2026\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia explained everything that had happened and hoped desperately that Robin had some kind of answer. \"Do you have any idea what could have caused this and how it might be undone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin took a few moments to think about it but shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard or read about anything like this.\" She looked to her husband and daughter. \"Have either of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard fanciful tales of giants, but none about a human becoming one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan did likewise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah me to. Though I don\u2019t even remember all the stuff I read\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin placed a hand on Sumia\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me to see Cynthia, maybe seeing her will spark a buried memory. Or failing that, we will devise a plan forward together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam was also in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At that size, Cynthia must be stronger than any man. Though she would need to train carefully to direct that strength\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rare for Sumia to get angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really isn't the time for that kind of talk! My daughter needs help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia has always desired to be a hero has she not? Though after the war those who knew of our exploits could consider us heroes but I can tell she is not the kind to be satisfied by that. She, like me seeks to continue to improve herself, to be the best she can be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed having seen Priam go on a lecture more than a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you've done it\"<br>\r\nSumia tried again to cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I mean I came to Robin for help returning Cynthia to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gestured for Priam to cease and he did..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming such a thing is possible... I'll do my best but I can't guarantee anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that is what she truly wants?\u201d Priam asked. \u201cHeedless as she was, she was one of the most spirited of the Shepards, I imagine she would-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't go through life like this!\" Sumia said, accidently yelling. \"I mean.. I need to get her some help before she grows any bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, I'll come along right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Let me get some food from the castle, and then I\u2019ll take you to see her..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam and Morgan stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come to.\" \u201cMe to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\u201d Sumia said, sharper than she had intended. \u201cI mean my pegasus can only hold two people at a time, especially if we're carrying supplies and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin immediately understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-At her increasing size I imagine you have yet to find something for her to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia turned away slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin began to climb on Sumia\u2019s Pegasus, it being familiar enough with her to aloow her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get the supplies and head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam turned back to Morgan, holding his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll continue training Morgan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gulped, picking up his own sword while Sumia and Robin departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia and Robin flew first to the castle larder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that. Priam means well but he can be single minded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm just glad you're here to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Sumia\u2019s faith in her, Robin did not look confident.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how much I can help, but I'll do what I can. Though as strange as it sounds, I think my husband may have a point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia froze, nearly dropping what she had been gathering. She was too shocked to speak. Robin was nto surprised to see her react that way and took advantage of Sumia's momentary silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I would not choose to inflict this on anyone, and I will do all I can to help Cynthia. I certainly do not know her like you do, but I know that she is someone who has always saught to use her strength to help others, and has been restless even during peace time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Sumia still had trouble putting together what she wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I have not worked out the logisitcs of it, and I do not yet understand what it is that's affecting her,, but it is unlikely such a magic effect could go on indefinitely, if I'm right her growth spurts will have to end sooner or later, then she can decide what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how will we keep her fed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I do know Ylisse has had an abundant harvest this year.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get back to Cynthia before she gets any larger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished gathering and departed as quickly as they could. Sumia feared for a second that they would be face with an even larger Cynthia towering over the castle, but fortunately that was not the case. Cynthia was lying there asleep, at the same size as before. Even Sumia and Robin landing did not disturb her slumber.  Robin looked over Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. I don't notice anything out of the ordinary, aside from the obvious. I'm not detecting any strange auras of magic around her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean whatever it was has died down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly, though I don't know everything about magic. You should probably have fetched Miriel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026 I just find you easier to talk, and you've helped us overcome every other problem we've faced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the confidence you have in me but this is no battlefield. Still.. you mentioned a rock causing all this? Could you show me where it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, I mean,\" Sumia began, \"Last Cynthia and I talked, while she was smaller, she had taken it back to her room with her before going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Robin replied, \"So then it should be in that room also, correct?\" Sumia looked off to the side and made a noise of sucking air through her teeth, clearly not knowing how to answer the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Cynthia went through a huge growth spurt this morning, and in that growth she kind of...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">wrecked the castle...</font>\" Robin groaned and rubbed the bridge of her nose between her eyes, causing Sumia to clasp her hands together and bow apologetically. \"I'm sorry! I knew I should've kept better track of it!\" Robin giggled at her friend and put a hand on her shoulder, working her back up to a standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, what are you apologizing for? You had no clue things would get to this level so quickly, you aren't at fault here.\" Robin gave a pat to Sumia's back, causing the Queen to blush and puff her cheeks, a little embarrassed of her apologetic nature. Robin folded her arms and went back into thinking mode. \"Still, we can't exactly have this stone lying around where anyone could find it...What are the extent of damages to the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An entire chunk of wall and ceiling on the upper east side have been broken down, and sections of the floor in Cynthia's room and hallway have fallen through to the halls below. Frederick's currently getting an estimate from the masonry; we're still in the process of thinking up a cover story to prevent panic in Ylisstol, but that's starting to seem unlikely with the gossiping Shepherds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, we'll have to go back to the castle and look through the rubble. Shall we depart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Robin,\" Sumia interjected, \"I'd much prefer it if one of us could watch Cynthia, I don't like her being alone in the woods like this.\" Sumia fidgeted her legs around a bit. \"I really hate to ask you, but could you stay here with her? I'll go look for the stone while you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like this to be at least a two-person job,\" Robin responded, \"But I'm not about to deny an order straight from Ylisse's Queen herself! I'll keep watch over Cynthia until you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you, Robin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But look,\" Robin continued, \" I want you to get Priam and Morgan to help you, alright? Priam's great at clearing rubble away safely, and Morgan's magic can help us extract this stone safely; if it did this to Cynthia on physical contact, who knows what it could do to you if you touched it...\" The mental image of a super-sized Sumia tripping over and destroying Castle Ylisstol under her body entered Robin's mind - mean as it was, it caused her to giggle, and Sumia immediately picked up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's rude! I'll have you know I'm not all that clumsy anymore, if that's what you're thinking! Olivia's been giving me dance lessons to keep my steps straight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry, it won't happen again.\" Calmed, Robin grabbed a corner of the large cheesecloth they brought with them and faced Sumia again. \"Now then, before you go, should we drape this over Cynthia?\" Sumia nodded and saddled up on her Pegasus again, gripping the other end of the cloth; she flew over Cynthia's rear with Robin as an anchor, forming an arc of cloth over the girl's backside, which slowly and gently inched up her back as the two women travelled the length of Cynthia's gargantuan body. With Cynthia fully blanketed, Sumia took to the skies once more, looking down at Robin before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how long I'll be, but I'll try to get back by nightfall. If I'm not back, then just grab one of the sleeping bags from the basket, okay? Thanks again Robin!\" With that, Sumia took off into the sky, leaving Robin alone with the gigantic princess. Robin looked at the content, smiling face of the sleeping princess and blessed her innocent joy she carried, even through this seemingly scary experience. Robin walked off towards the basket of goods they bought and fumbled through it a bit, looking for some supplies she could use; she soon found the sleeping bag and unraveled it, inspecting it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well I'll be,\"</i> Robin thought, <i>\"Sumia was really planning ahead with this, huh? She knows how to be cunning when she wants to, that's for certain.\"</i> Robin set the sleeping bag down near a log and looked through the basket again, finding some assorted meats, vegetables, sauces, and spices in the basket, all of very high quality, fit for royalty, alongside some cookware. Taking a frying pan, a bottle of marinade, and some chunks of bear meat &amp; cabbage, Robin made a flame with her Arcfire tome and sat on a log; she used her Elwind tome to chop apart the ingredients with quick precision and sent them into the pan, holding it above the fire and occasionally adding the marinade. <i>\"Cynthia always was a great meat-eater, and she must be hungry after this whole experience; if this recipe could get Priam to touch vegetables, it'll certainly do wonders for her!\"</i> Robin begun to jovially whistle a tune as she cooked, occasionally adding some sauce and spice when needed, and listened to the light noise of Cynthia's gentle snores in tandem with the chirping tune of birds in the distance.</span></div></div>",

As Cynthia slumbered peacefully, Robin continued to wander about the situation. What kind of stone could have done this? Was it anything of this world? She had never seen or heard anything about this before,  but there was plenty about magic she did not know of. Still if such magic was available, even if it were rare and difficult to acquire, Robin would have expected to have seen giant solders on the battlefield, though that would carry it owns logistical issues and make them a target for archers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what kind of stone could have done this?

If it were<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin soon finished preparing her feast, though at Cynthia\u2019s size it would likely merely be a light lunch. Robin continued thinking  about the strange stone, when suddenly  she felt the ground  shake beneath her. The sleeping giant was waking up! Cynthia sat up and rubbed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm I had a wonderful dream.... huh Robin? \u201c  Cynthia bent over Robin. \u201cWhat are you doing here?!\"\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin winced slightly and  sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud.\" She said. Cynthia was always loud and excitable, even at her normal size. The only thing that appeared to change was the giant Cynthia not being aware however powerful her vocal chords were \u201cAnd keep the cheesecloth on.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had fallen off when Cynthia sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry!\" Cynthia said, hastily covering herself..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin flinched again. Cynthia tried to be more quiet but was still too loud. Robin covered on ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your\u2019re still a little too loud..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia lowered her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d She said, quieter this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, your mother came to me, hoping I would be able to help with your.. condition. She also realized the two of you had lost track of the stone and set out to find it, asking me to look out for you while she was gone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me mom would-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled to herself, wondering if Cynthia had the same image of Sumia Robin had. Robin shook her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I told Sumia not to touch it and to report back to me so I could use my magic to extract it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia rubbed her brow, visibly relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... though it would be less lonely with mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gestured to the baskets of food she has prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prepared you some food you must be starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia\u2019s eyes grew wide at the sight. She immediately grabbed a basket and scarfed it down, before moving to another, stopping a few second later as she remembered her manner, licking bits of salad off her lips, looking self conscious as she realized how rude she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh umm.. thank you Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I understand that after going through so many growth spurts and going without food you must be starving. I'm just glad you're enjoying my cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia nodded enthusiastically, giving two thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stood straight, taking pride in her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't completely sure you would go for this, since like Priam you prefer meat but-\"<br>\r\nCynthia paused,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. now that you mention some meat would be good....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed and pointed to the basket filled with bear meat. With a small cheer Cynthia wolfed it down in no time. When  she was finished she licked her lips and rubbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you really are a great chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I've had a lot of time to practice as of late, and I knew I\u2019d have to prepare something big to keep your going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the word \u201cbig\u201d Cynthia looked as though she had been stricken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm going to get any bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be certain, but no I don't thin. As far I can tell there's no further magic effecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia\u2019s excitement built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'll ever be normal again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until your mother finds the stone I can't be certain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyntia\u2019s shoulders sagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stepped towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will do everything we can to help you. If I cannot figure out the stone\u2019s  mysteries I will try to find someone who can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin placed a hand to her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut If worse comes to worse, we\u2019ll help you adapt to your new size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh I really don\u2019t want to be like this any longer! I wrecked the castle and nearly got shot at!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the castle wasn\u2019t designed for something like and your sudden appearance must have been a surprise, but I\u2019m sure everyone who knows you still recognized you as a human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia thought about it and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, Stahl recognized and even stood up for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly, and you\u2019re mom and me. I\u2019m sure everyone in the Shepard\u2019s and anyone who got to know you would feel the same way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Cynthia punched the air. \u201cNo matter what happens, I\u2019ve still got all my friends and family!\u201d She stood that way for several seconds. \u201cButtttt\u2026. I\u2019d really like to be normal size again.\u201d She lowered her hand to about her old height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, and as I said, I will do everything I can to help. But it wouldn\u2019t hurt to be prepared for the worst, even if this is just a temporary predicament.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia slumped, lying down on the ground with a thump. It was amazing how quickly her mood could change. RobIn tried to cheer her up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the positive side, it might be possible to use your new size and strength to help people.\u201d<br>\r\nCynthia suddenly struck on her heroic poses, holding the cheesecloth like a heroic cape and  almost knocking Robin off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Giant hero Cynthia!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful Cynthia!\u201d Maybe mentioning that wasn\u2019t such a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia looked down at her feet and adjust her postion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpps sorry again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was fortunate Cynthia was not as clumsy as her mother, or she could be in a lot of danger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robin took out a small pocket watch to check the time - quarter after 4, meaning the two girls had about 4 or so hours until night fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Robin spoke, opening the forum for conversation, \"We have a few hours until nightfall, and based on your mother's report on the severity of damages to the castle...\" Cynthia's mood dampened at this, looking a little guilty for wrecking her room. \"I estimate she could be back anywhere from late tonight onward. Until then, we have some time to kill. What would you like to do?\" Cynthia stuck her finger to her lips, unsure of how to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. There aren't any folk tales of what giants do for fun, so I'm a little lost here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Robin spoke, \"Just because you're huge doesn't mean you don't have to do normal girl things anymore. It just needs a little...adjustment, is all.\" Cynthia listened to Robin's words and then took a clump of her hair in her hand, bringing the blue strands to the side of her vision. Cynthia looked at her hair and could see all manner of rubble, leaves, and twigs covering it, detracting from the royal blue luster it normally provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Cynthia begun, \"I know it's a tall order, but is their anything you could do about my hair? I hate to ask you, I know you didn't become a hair-stylist or anything after the war. What did you become anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Librarian, dear.\" Robin replied, making her way over to a basket of goods. \"And that doesn't mean I don't know anything about the trade either; there's a couple books in the reserves on the history of hairstyles and their effects on the culture of kingdoms &amp; morale of the armies - it's quite a fascinating read! I could bring it over to the castle sometime once we resolve this situation.\" Cynthia let out a little smile and waved, resisting every urge to laugh at how much of a nerd Robin was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm fine, thanks though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself.\" Robin produced a large hairbrush from the basket, possibly Sumia's by how large it was in Robin's hand, and made her way over to Cynthia. Once reaching the titaness, she raised her hand upwards as if giving a signal. \"Could you raise me up a bit?\" Cynthia complied and let her hand down, allowing Robin to get on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the help Robin,\" the princess spoke, \"But I don't think it's going to be easy with that brush. I mean it's big, but not too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your concerns, but don't worry about it, I'll just use my magic to handle the rest of your hair. In fact, I found some old tomes when cleaning out the library, so I got around to practicing with them for a bit.\" Robin was bought up to Cynthia's eye level. \"Just move me behind your head, dear.\" Cynthia complied and Robin got the full view of the back of Cynthia's hair - she could see the chunks of brick and foliage caught between her blue strands. \"Now, this is going to feel a little cold, so try not to react, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold?\" Before Cynthia could inquire, Robin produced a small blue tome from her overcoat and begun preparing the magic. In an instant, a cool stream of water was produced from the pages and engulfed Cynthia's hair, washing away the bits of debris caught within it. Cynthia jerked forward a bit, not expecting anything like it, but soon relaxed as she felt the soothing water touch her scalp; she immediately felt refreshed. \"Wow Robin! Was that a <i>water tome</i>? Where the heck did you find something so cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Storage room,\" Robin answered, \"The place was so unclean for years, the city council just let me take home whatever I felt like; of course, they had to step in a bit once they saw Priam carrying a huge cart of books behind him back to our house!\" The two girls laughed a little at the story before Robin continued. \"I did some research, and it turns out that this tome was crafted based upon the legends of Nohr and Hoshido.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the mythical kingdoms? Mother used to tell me about them all the time when I was young! And, uh, still a little bit nowadays, when I can't sleep.\" Once finished washing, Robin begun to work on Cynthia's hair, a brush in one hand and her Elwind tome in the other, brushing droplets of water away from Cynthia's hair until it dried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you know the part about the water-wielding songstress? The author of this tome based the spells in here upon her, in fact, some of her fabled lyrics are in this tome too. The author must've been around when the legends were first crafted, I would assume.\" Cynthia smiled as her hair continued to be brushed, but her expression turned to that of deep thought as a question rattled her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Robin?\" Cynthia asked, \"Do you know Inigo's wife, Peri? The one he just showed up with one day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the girl with blue &amp; pink hair?\" Robin asked, \"Yes, I know her, she comes in to check out cookbooks once a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't she kind of look familiar to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, I just assumed she was from somewhere in Plegia based on her combat abilities, skin complexion, and...generally unsettling behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, it might be just me and all, but I swear I remember someone who looked like her from an old picture book on Nohr that Mother used to read to me. Could they be the same person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense Cynthia, those stories are a myth, a myth created thousands of years ago too, I might add.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a thought, she's always dodging the question with jokes and stories about Inigo whenever I asked her where she came from. But I mean, that girl in the story had a green eye, and Peri's is red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be heterochromia.\" Robin answered, smiling mischievously as she played upon Cynthia's paranoia. \"She does have her hair covering her other eye. You could always get closer and check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck no am I getting anywhere near her! She scares me!\" Robin giggled at Cynthia's somewhat childish reaction, causing her to puff her cheeks out. \"You wouldn't be laughing if you were in the same platoon as her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'll take your word for it.\" Robin wiped her brow after finishing the back of Cynthia's hair. \"Alright, the back's done, could you help me out with the sides?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Cynthia moved her arm to her right shoulder, allowing Robin to step off her palm and onto the shoulder, where she begun to go to work the right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've probably bored you with my book-talk a bit, so why don't you hit me with a topic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I like talking about old legends!\" Cynthia replied, \"But since you asked...Oh! Just the other day, I was in the market, when there was this thief who stole from the fruit bazaar! Naturally, the first thing I did was leap into action! So after recovering from tripping, I ran full-speed ahead, and then the next thing you know...\" The two girls went on for hours sharing stories and gossip between one another, until Cynthia's hair was luscious and full once more, and night began to set over the sky.</span></div></div>",

She grinned at Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew we could have so much fun just hanging out together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled and lay back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it has been a while since I've been able to relax and hang out. Between my job at the library, my husband's constant training sessions and teaching Morgan, I've barely had a moment to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia rubbed her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that means some good came out of this.. then again I didn't need to get really big just so we could hang out....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is true that with our busy schedules we would not have thought of it otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sad, friend's shouldn't need an excuse to hang out with each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but as we get older we find more and more demands on our time. And when we were at war, I had a lot of duties and a lot of people demanding my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia  rest her head on  her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I see....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin tried to think of something to cheer up. The obvious question immediately sprang to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about everyone else from the future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhh most them went on to do their own thing.\" Cynthia suddenly became animated. \"Oh oh! We should totally reform the Justice Cabal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia bounced up down obvious to her surroundings. Robin was knocked off her feet, now sitting in Cynthia's  palm. She stood and looked at Cynthia with scolding eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful! At your size you could cause a lot of unintended damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia looked down sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. yeah I found that out the hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin dusted herself off, suddenly looking puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... the Justice Cabal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Cytnhia bounced again. Robin wobbled, but this time she kept her balance, and gave Cynthia the same withering stare.  Cynthia was sheepish once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Opps sorry. Anyway its a game I used to play as kids with Owain and Gerome before Gerome got too grumpy pants for it, but Morgan agreed to replace him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. that might be an idea. I some sure Morgan would like to spend time with you again and I'll see if Owain is around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" This time Cynthia stopped herself from bouncing too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was curious though wary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you do in this Justice Cabal thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly we just pretend to be heroes of old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.... though I'd prefer we get you some proper clothes... Morgan is at that age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what am I supposed to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose for now tying the cheesecloth around you should suffice, maybe adding something to it to ensure it stays on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that sounds easy enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked a little longer before being interrupted by the  sudden beat of pegasus wings. Sumia was riding along, with several bags t of food tied to her pegasus. Cynthia turned to her, delighted to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia was flying  level with her daughter's face and flew closer..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it took me so long!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok, we've had a great time just hanging out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you manage to find it?\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and don't worry I didn't touch it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, take me to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia flew next to Cynthia's while Cynthia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wait here, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If all goes well I'll be able to restore you to normal soon enough, though I can't promise you anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia moved her plam closer to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will it take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry can't say... could be minutes could be hours, if i can find something. If I can't... I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i guess I'm spending the night out here by myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin lowered her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia rode her pegasus higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can spend the night with you if you really want. Just this once though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCytnhia forced a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I wouldn't want to force you out of the nice warm caslte. I'll be fine, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia pumped her other fist through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally! i can handle anything, this will be nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. if you're sure....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin climbed onto Sumia's pegasus. She turned and waved to Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Cynthia. Don't worry, we'll see each other again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they flew off, Cynthia rested her head on the grass, taking handfuls of the food her mother had left for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. alone again. I never knew being a giant could be so.. lonely.. I guess if Robin succeeds everything will be back to normal but if I'm stuck like this....\" She shivered, imagining  herself all alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I still have my friends and family no matter what happens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven that couldn't completely push away her negative thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still... if I get any bigger I bet the whole of Ylisse will be able to see me!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At Castle Ylisstol, Robin and Sumia had gathered themselves inside the royal bedroom Chrom and Sumia shared to examine the stone. On a small coffee table, an orb of bright light contained the magic stone Sumia had found, the orb bound in place by one of Robin's tomes. The two girls sat in two regal-looking armchairs, just watching the stone and theorizing with each other what it could be; Sumia looked away for one moment, and could see a blush set over Robin's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin?\" Sumia asked, \"What's wrong?\" Robin seemed startled for a moment, as if she was just bought back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry!\" she replied, \"It's just that, well, it's a little odd being in Chrom's bedroom and all, even when he's not here. It just seems a little strange after all we've been through together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're referring to the time he walked in on you on the bath?\" Sumia begun to giggle, remembering when Chrom recounted the story to her; she remembered how embarrassed he felt, and how he recounted how bad of a welt thrown soap could leave on the skin. \"Even I don't think I could be that clumsy! And that's saying something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Sumia...\" Robin replied, a mischievous grin on her face. \"If memory serves me correct, Lucina came into my tent one day, draped in only a blanket, and exposed herself to me because 'Mother said this would strengthen our bonds!'.\" Sumia's face became as red as a tomato, and she quickly clocked her head towards the shimmering orb on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Anyways!\" she begun with a stutter. \"So Robin, this stone, can you analyze what exactly it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't see anything odd when preparing this setup, but I could always try again.\" Robin got up from her armchair and begun examining the stone inside its magical casing, making sure she wasn't close enough to accidently break the seal on her magic or trigger any reaction from the rock. \"It seems to be an onyx-like stone, black, with a small shimmer of light towards it. I can feel it in my bones though, this light it puts off isn't a normal jewel's glitter, it's magical in nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what could it be?\" Sumia inquired, \"Is it a natural magic, or a trap as Cynthia insists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This I cannot say. Natural magic does exist, however, I've heard no tales of anything like this happening. On the other hand, turning Cynthia into a giant has no strategical advantage whatsoever for any enemies we might have, which are limited purely to random brigands and other ruffians now that Plegia and Valm have calmed down.\" Robin took her head away from the stone's inspection and carefully went back to sitting down in the armchair, turning her head towards Sumia to continue the conversation. \"Further experiments would need to be run in order to figure out exactly what it is, and between you and me, I don't exactly want Miriel or Laurent touching this, lest we have an infestation of giants on our hands. I think the best course of option is to look through some books from the library, and if that fails, then we'll just have to find a way to transport this to Tiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Sumia asked, feeling let down. \"But Valm is so far away, we don't know if we have time or not to travel there. What if Cynthia continues growing? Furthermore, Chrom and Lucina are still away, who will run the kingdom in my absence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bring up good points,\" Robin replied, \"Which is why we're going to have to just do some reading research until they get back. I could always try sending a letter to Tiki, but that will take a few weeks to arrive via carrier, and she could always be in one of her regular month-long naps too.\" Sumia looked down, feeling defeated by the luck of the situation. \"Hey, cheer up Sumia. If it helps, Cynthia hasn't grown an inch since we waited for you, and the way you and her put it, she grew pretty fast in the span of two days. If I had to guess, she must've topped off around say...60 feet? There must be a limit to the growth this stone gives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good to hear at least. Still, I don't think it's fair for Cynthia to have to go through this alone, she could end up feeling persecuted by her new size. I know it doesn't look like it Robin, but Cynthia really has some low self-esteem; I've had to pull a couple guards aside and chew them out just for chatter about 'weird hero poses'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel you Sumia, it's only natural for mothers to worry about their kids. If something like this happened to Morgan, I'd probably worry myself until I had a heart attack. Keep in mind though, I'm going to do everything in my power to help Cynthia - we're all family, you, me, and the rest of The Shepherds.\" Sumia gave a big smile, and moved her arm over the edge of the chair, grasping Robin's hand tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Robin, you're a true friend.\" Robin smiled back, glad to be a help to the humble Pegasus Knight-turned-Queen. \"It's getting to be late, you should probably get back to your family soon. Is there any chance you could have some tea with me before you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, I'll go fetch my favorite blend! Be right back!\" Sumia got up off the chair and began to work her way towards the small kitchen attached to the bedroom. Robin looked down and could see a hump in the rug from uneven settling; this surely meant disaster for Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia, look out! There's-\" Robin's words came too late as Sumia's foot came in contact with the rug, causing her to slip backwards and hit her head on the coffee table. Be it because of poor luck or loose legs, the table tilted with great force, launching the tome up in the air and shattering the magical barrier around the stone. Robin's heart froze and she felt a pit open in her stomach as the stone began to glow violently when airborne and it began to come back down, free from its magical prison.</span></div></div>",

Ow!\" Sumia suddenly understood as she felt the pain of her tightening clothes. She started stripped.\"But what if someone comes by?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure the way is clear. For now throw the bed sheet over yourself and follow me. If your growth is like  Cynthia's there should be enough time to get you out before you get stuck. Wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin ran ahead, telling any nearby guards, servants and any other personal to go to another part of the castle. As Chrom's trusted advisor her word's were listented to. Robin came back and led Sumia out the castle. By now she was having to bend her head to avoid the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call for your pegasus, we want to reach the clearing as quickly as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but I can't be sure how fast I'm growing and I don't want to risk putting that much weight on my pegasus\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gave her a questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if people see you like this or naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia\u2019s eyes widened at the thought btu then she looked resolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd rather they don't but I'm not going to risk harming my pegasus..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,  we're just going to have to run as quickly as possible.\" Robin said. Sumia  ran after her and with her longer legs soon overtook her, though she soon tripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that about not being clumsy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia got herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ve been getting better. But my body feels weird.. I don\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm it makes sense that your centre of balance would be thrown by a sudden growth spurt.  Hopefully you\u2019re growth will stop at a fixed point and you\u2019ll be able to adapt to your new size. We\u2019ll have to keep you away from crowded areas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia nodded reluctanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia did not want to waste further time talking, focusing on reaching the clearing. She was a fair bit ahead of Robin, who also knew she could not catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have back to the castle and get you  another cheesecloth. Hopefully you\u2019ll only grow as big as Cynthia or there abouts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia continued on her own, soon reaching Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia\u2019s eyes grew wide at the sight of Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?!\" She leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to show Robin where the stone but I tripped and landed on the stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia tried to hug Sumia against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mom, I didn't want you dragged into this to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia smiled and placed a hand on Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so tight dear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Cynthia said, loosening her grip, letting Sumia sit in her palm, though Sumia no longer fitted it so perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026 I-I'm sure Robin will find a way to help us.\u201d Sumia tried to sound confident but couldn\u2019t keep the doubt out of her voice.  \u201cOr at least someone find someone who can. At least now you don't have to do this alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia looked thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how big do you think you\u2019re going to get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell none of us can be sure, but Robin thinks I might end up the same size as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great!\u201d Cynthia said without thinking before frowning. \u201cI mean.. it wouldn\u2019t be great that you\u2019re stuck like this to but at least we won\u2019t be alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean, dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what dad and sis are going to say when they sees the two of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia giggled, imaging then both shocked..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll be in for quite a surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia let out an involuntary yawn. She rubbed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so tired it must be really late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia yawned as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m tired as well. Maybes its stress or maybe its something about this stone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia lay down, while keeping careful hold of her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s get some shut eye! Good night mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night Cynthia.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morning broke through the trees in the clearing, rays of light illuminated the green, dew-covered grass, the chirping birds, and two giantesses, both at 60 feet, sleeping next to each other, curled-up and snoozing. Cynthia looked at peace being next to Sumia, as Sumia with her daughter; the two slept so close to one another, they were practically cuddling, Sumia even managed to drape part of Cynthia's cheesecloth over her body like a blanket, covering both their naked frames. Into the peaceful grove, two figures approached, one large, another small, and slowly made their way towards the two titanesses. The larger of the two set a hand upon Sumia's calf and begun to jostle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia, wake up.\" No response. Another jostle. \"Sumia, it's morning.\" The large queen smacked her lips and yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhhh, five more minutes Chrom...\" The larger of the two sighed and made a signal with their hand, prompting the smaller of the two to pull out a fire tome. They aimed it skyward and begun firing it off, the fireballs exploded with a loud, audible \"POP\" mid-air and dissipated into nothing. The fireworks prompted Cynthia and Sumia to awake, and they did so with a jolt. The cheesecloth was discarded to the ground and both giants sat up with astounding speed, exposing their nude bodies; the smaller figure blushed and covered their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're under attack! Man the ballistae! Guard the castle walls!\" Cynthia cried in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my lance?! Quick, save the Pegasi!\" Sumia cried in equal panic. When the two girls came to, they realized they were awake in the forest clearing, looking around like maniacs. As the two tried to calm themselves, the large figure extended an arm, a large piece of cloth held in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's that cheesecloth, Sumia.\" Sumia grabbed it slowly, bowing her head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Robin, it was a cold...Wait, <i>Robin?!</i>\" Cynthia turned her head to her mother's viewing angle, and her eyes became equally as large as her mother's. There kneeled Robin, looking a little grumpy, about the same size as both of them, body draped in black velvet wrapped to resemble a strapless bikini. Robin sighed and looked left, leaving an awkward silence in the air, which Cynthia soon broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, what the heck happened to you?!\" she cried, partially panicked, partially enthused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my way back to the castle, I seemed a little taller. Imagine my surprise when I fished around in my coat pockets and found the stone. I'm pretty sure you kicked it into my coat pocket when you got up so hurriedly last night, Sumia.\" Sumia chomped down on her bottom lip and started twiddling her thumbs, feeling embarrassed. \"I ran home to get another magic prison for the stone, but I could barely fit into my room anymore. I had to strip down, rip the drapes down, break open the roof, run to the castle, grab the cloth, then come back here, all without causing a panic in town - all in all, not a great night.\" Sumia began to bow apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry! This is my fault! Me and my clumsy behavior! Please forgive me Robin!\" Robin raised a hand and waved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I'd be lying if I said I never saw something like this coming. Just...They were really good drapes too...\" Robin shook off the melancholy emotions towards her repurposed curtains, and continued her explanation. \"In any case, the stone's safe, I chucked it in my room and Priam's guarding it; he's swamped down by questions of a 'giant naked librarian' running through the streets at midnight, he's not going to let anyone into my room with his skill. Morgan and I are going to be working with you two from here on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan?\" Cynthia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" came a gentle, polite voice. Cynthia and Sumia turned to see Morgan covering his eyes, face red as a tomato. \"Cynthia, Miss Sumia, could you please, um, cover up...?\" The two girls looked down and jumped; they immediately got to work covering themselves tightly in their cheesecloth dresses before relaxing back into a seating position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Morgan! You can look now!\" Morgan heeded Cynthia's words and uncovered his eyes. The first thing he noticed was how pretty Cynthia looked with her hair down, the brilliant blue of her hair blending with the vibrant white of her skin, the pale yellow cloth wrapped tightly around her like a spring dress. The second thing he noticed was truly how large she had become, which having seen his own mother become titanic in front of him, didn't bother him in the least. Morgan's eyes got all gooey, which Cynthia picked up on; she chuckled and scratched the back of her head. \"Okay, okay, you can stop staring now.\" Morgan immediately snapped back to reality and turned around, feeling embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, um, sorry Cynthia! I didn't mean to make you feel weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine! It's fine! Though really, you're coming off a bit weird here though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! What's that supposed to mean?\" Both Robin and Sumia looked at their children in slight bliss, noting how perfect of a match they'd make together. Sumia turned back towards Robin, staring the white-haired tactician deeply in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the stone is completely safe, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct.\" Robin answered. \"Short of dropping through the gaping hole in our roof, nobody's getting into my family's house while Priam's on the prowl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. In that case, let's just go into town and get it.\" Cynthia and Morgan stopped their back-and-forth conversation and looked at Sumia, a little thrown back by her suggestion. Robin raised a brow in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mother,\" Cynthia began, \"Won't the townspeople be staring? I thought that our goal was to prevent a panic with this?\" Sumia looked around at her staring audience and begun to twiddle her thumbs as she tried to explain her logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean...Robin makes it sound like people have already seen her as a giant, so I didn't think it would cause a panic, and plus I'm still the Queen, and townsfolk really like me, and um...\" Robin heard enough, she raised her palm, indicating Sumia to stop her thoughts and relax a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to agree with you Sumia, we got nothing to lose at this point. I'd rather we cause a panic over this then to have a potentially dangerous situation erupt in town with people touching the stone. At this point, I'm starting to think even research into this stone might get dangerous. We might even need to dispose of it altogether, throw it into the ocean or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what then?\" Cynthia asked, a little worried. \"Are we going to have to stay big like this? I'm not really seeing the benefits of being a giant hero anymore, to be completely honest...\" Robin sighed a little, seeing Cynthia's concerns; she didn't exactly want to do her job as a scantily-clad giant, and handling late fees and the stamp-book would become near-impossible at this size. Morgan raised his hand, indicating he had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, what if we just tried the Outrealms? Or maybe Naga herself? I'm sure one of the traveling Anna sisters have seen something like this all throughout their journeys.\" Morgan looked at Cynthia deeply. \"Look Cynthia, we're really good friends, so I'm not going to leave you hanging like this, I promise. If Mother's too big to work, then I'll just pick up right where she left off.\" Cynthia blushed a little; it wasn't the world's greatest or most motivational speech ever, but Morgan sounded so cool and level-headed when he said it, and she admired that about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled,\" Sumia spoke, \"We're marching right into town and fixing this situation!\" She stood and pointed towards town, fist pumped, to get all charged up; Cynthia looked at her mother's pose and giggled, feeling like she rubbed off on her a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it's alright if I have all you around me!\" Cynthia leapt to her feet, sending Morgan a little off-balance, no effect on the other two giantesses. \"But you know, if we head into town now, we might just really cause a panic. Like, a super big one that'll cause riots n' stuff.\" Sumia's pose drooped slowly until her hands were at her sides and her head was downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could always travel by night, giving us some element of surprise.\" Robin added in, trying to cheer up Sumia's mood. \"Priam should have our house locked down for months if I know him, so we certainly have the time to wait and plan this out.\" Robin turned her head towards Cynthia's. \"Really, I think it should be your call Cynthia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Me?!\" Cynthia replied, pointing at herself in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you. You were the first of us to grow, so technically, you're like the leader to us all. From what Sumia and Chrom tell me, you're aiming to become new captain of the Pegasus Knights, right?\" Cynthia rubbed her hair, looking off sideways with a blush and goofy grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, that'd be really cool and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll use this situation as a test for your judgment and leadership abilities. I'm at your command, Cynthia.\" Sumia looked towards Cynthia, she looked ready to panic a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine sweetie,\" Sumia spoke, \"Just breathe a little and think, we have all the time in the world. If you need help with anything, we're always here to help out!\" Cynthia shook her head at her mother and started breathing deeply, making poses and gestures with her hands as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, breathe deep - in, and out. In, and out. I'm calm now. Cynthia's calm.\" She looked around at the faces of her friends and family as they waited on her decision.</span></div></div>",

I don't want to sit around here all day <b>again</b> but I don't want everyone to start screaming as soon we go into town....  but wait.\" Cynthia looked at Robin. \"You said people saw you last night but you didn't scare anyone right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... though it did help people recognise me. In sense..\u201d Robin put a hand to her head. \u201cActually I wish I hadn't been recognised, I could do without people reminding us of this later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did not damper Cynthia\u2019s mood/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means if we head into town we might be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can't be sure, invariably people will react different but at least some will see us as frightening monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s eyes widened, clearly bewildered that anyone could view these woman as monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could never see you that way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin half smiled and half frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it helps that you recognise us and that you have an open mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia pumped a fist into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! Morgan could head into town and say that we're coming! Like \"Here comes Queen Sumia, Royal Librarian and Giant he- I dunno what title I want for myself Cynthia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The direct approach.. I cannot factor in how an entire town would react to us... and Morgan, you are not used to public speaking, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was nervous but tried to appear brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no but I could still give it a shot.\" He tried to stand a little taller, as though that hide his fear, but the three giants saw through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia spun round to face Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You said I was the leader and you'd give my idea a shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to minimise the risks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia placed a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was a good idea honey. But maybe we should start with the guards and fellow Shepards, their sure to recognise us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia held herself and shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I nearly got shot full of arrows!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said Stahl recognised you on sight, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin saw her chance to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we approach slowly and carefully, Castle Ylisse will surely recognise its Queen, Princess and Royal Librarian.\" She forced a smile. \"Maybe my new size will encourage people to return the books on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia jumped to her feet, the impact nearly knocking Robin and Morgan off theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled! Let's do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful!\u201d Robin scolded.  \u201cThe two of you should practise moving at your sizes before you go anywhere near the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I got this! I just need to move slowly and watch everything around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you also need to watch yourself when you get excited, especially in a tight. Around here you've only damaged a few trees,but in a crowded areas you could damage buildings or endanger lives. Not to mention if Morgan was too close to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it! I get it! Take it slow, don't get too excited.\" Cynthia tried to restrain her movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia looked at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it was because I was clumsy that Robin and I were enlarged...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely.  So both of you take it slow and.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia carefully got up and took a few steps.... only to hit the ground face first. Sumia winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I had gotten better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia offered her a hand while Robin offered guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had, but growing to giant size has changed your centre of balance. Don't worry, we have time to practice this, just make sure you are nowhere near my boy. And Morgan, keep away from Sumia while she practises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia continued practising walking at various speeds before plummeting to the ground. She must surely have been noticed by anyone even close to the clearing, but fortunately no one dared to approach the 3 giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Sumia felt practised that she thought she could walk as ably as she could at normal size. She was proud fo the progress she had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! Now if I just take it slow I can avoid tripping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded. She was larger now, coming past Sumia\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. No matter what happens both of you need to be constantly aware of your surroundings. You both have issues with this. Though it would be best if you avoided standing anywhere crowded or cramp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia creased her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm that does sound tough...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia looked nervous for a second but pushed it away with her usual fist pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we can do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin made a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take this lightly! Lives could be at stake.  In fact even when you are just waiting around you should always check to see who and what is around you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it, I get it! We just need to be aware of everything like you, Robin! Though come to think Robin is aware, she\u2019s SUPER aware!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin rolled her eyes but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike Morgan says that on a battlefield she sees ALL the enemy soldiers and all of us at all times, no matter how far away everyone is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia turned to Robin, suddenly awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow could you teach us how to do that? It would help us a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy. I was born with an aptitude for it.\u201d Robin shuddered, recalling what she was told by Validar  \u201cBut I imagine even then I had to work at it. But I will teach you what I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia went on, sounding more and more excited with each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-And I hear she sees each part of the battlefield as a tiny square and knows exactly how far everyone can move at a time and can see all the weapons the enemies have an exactly how strong they are and even sees numbers above our heads that indicates how healthy we are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney I think you\u2019re exaggerating\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed casting a look at Morgan for spilling her secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on everyone.\u201d She bent down to her son and held out her open palms. Morgan climbed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walked slowly and carefully towards the castle. Sumia and Cynthia  were almost side by side, with Sumia just a little in front. Robin walked a few steps behind so she could keep an idea on the other giants, while Morgan rested on her shoulder, keeping hold of a strand of hair just to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they were in sight of the castle They several more steps until Robin ordered them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait I see archers preparing to fire, we have to show them we are not a threat. Hold at your hands as though you were surrendering.\u201d Robin demonstrated and Sumia and Cynthia followed suit, though Cynthia hesitated for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked towards the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold your fire! I am Royal Librarian Robin and beside me is Queen Sumia and Princess Cynthia. We mean you no harm! We have been enlarged due to a magical accident that I wish to make right. Please lower your weapons and let us pass. Call for any of our fellow Shepards and they will be sure to recognize us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia took a tip toe forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me Sumia, I mean Queen Sumia, you can trust us! Even though we are giants, surely at least some of you recognise us?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The group could hear some chatter amongst the rabble of guards and Shepherds below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is that really Queen Sumia?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, how did they get so big?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Cynthia's wearing clothes this time, now if we can just get that castle fixed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe! I bet they could really kill a whole lotta bad guys at that size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar red-headed Shepherd ran up along the length of the wall, looking perplexed, aghast, and very concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia?!\" Cordelia shouted, concerned by her best friend's growth spurt. \"Dear Naga, what on earth happened to you?! What happened to you all?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Cordelia!\" Sumia kneeled down and grasped the border wall, shaking it slightly as her fingers dug into the concrete, causing the guards along the wall to stumble, some toppling over. Sumia spoke fast and panicked, as she usually did when recounting her issues to Cordelia. \"There was this rock and it made Cynthia grow and then I accidently made me and Robin grow and now it's at Robin's house and we need to get there fast and-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down! Calm down!\" Cordelia waved her arms, trying to focus Sumia's attention onto her and detract her motor-mouth. \"Take a deep breath girl, there's no need to freak out.\" Sumia took Cordelia's advice, unhanging herself from the wall and turning around, sitting with her back to the wall as she began to take deep breaths. Cordelia focused her attention on the other two giants. \"Now then, what's Sumia talking about? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey there Auntie Cordelia!\" Cynthia spoke up, waving politely to her mother's dear friend. \"So, uh, this is gonna sound kind of weird, but, uh, we got stung by a nasty rock, and then we became huge. What a day, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Cordelia asked, furrowing her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an adverse reaction to a magical stone.\" Robin cut in, trying to clarify the situation. \"We don't know where it came from or why it's done this to us, but it's potentially dangerous. I was hoping we could retrieve it from my house before someone gets hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Cordelia tried to process the situation, taking deep breaths to calm herself. She glanced over at Sumia and could see that she was having a tough time trying to stay calm, more than usual; Cordelia walked over slowly and gripped a couple strands of Sumia's hair, the gargantuan strands comparable to rope, and begun to rub them. Sumia tilted her head slightly, making sure she didn't clumsily drag Cordelia to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Cordelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time Sumia.\" Cordelia looked up at Robin again, trying to get further answers from her. \"So what happened to cause this? 'Stung' by the rock? What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia's not exaggerating, that stone was touch-activated. If you touch it, then you grow, from a rate of anywhere slow to quickly, depending on how reactive it is. Don't touch it if you find it, if you do, then your clothes aren't coming with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains your...interesting choice in attire, Robin.\" Robin blushed and tried to cover herself, both arms over her navel and her legs scrunched together, trying to hide as much skin as she could. Morgan blushed too, now realizing that the rest of the Shepherds could basically see his mother in her smallclothes. Cordelia giggled at Robin's embarrassment, before getting back on track. \"So where is this rock now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin's house.\" Cynthia answered. \"We need to get into town, but we're probably gonna scare everyone if we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see how you'd think that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Auntie Cordelia? Could you help Morgan let the town know that we're here and huge? So the town doesn't get thrown into a panic? He doesn't like public speaking all too much.\" Cordelia looked at the young boy atop Robin's shoulder; he let out a small wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, it's not that I don't want to, but...Would the town even believe us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course! You're one of Ylisse's top Pegasus Knights! You're the captain for Naga's sake! You're so loved by the people, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm still one person, Cynthia, and with Morgan, that makes us two. A town with a population of tens of thousands large would be a hard sell if there were just two people walking around like raving lunatics, talking about giant humans, much less our Queen being one of them.\" Cynthia looked a little down, feeling like she didn't think this through enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Morgan piped up, focusing all the attention onto him. \"If it's no trouble to the other knights here, we could probably all go around town and tell them about Cynthia, Queen Sumia, and Mother. Two alone would be a little unbelievable, but if we had a hundred or so of Ylisse's trusted royal guard speaking to the people, we could probably soften the impact of shock towards seeing giant humans.\" Cordelia put a hand to her chin, intrigued by the young tactician's plan; Morgan glanced at his Mother a bit before continuing. \"Besides, there's been rumors about Mother running through the streets huge and nude since last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan!\" Robin shouted with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" Cordelia responded, \"I think this plan could work, we'll have you all stay here until we've assured the whole town of how big you've allo become. All I'd need is a royal order from the Queen herself, and we'll be ready to move out.\" Cordelia stopped stroking Sumia's hair and leaned on over towards her friend, staring her directly in the eye. \"What do you say Sumia? Would you mind if we go out marching a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, are you kidding?\" Sumia answered, \"This whole experience is really scary, I just want to go back to being Sumia-sized again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you command, my liege.\" Cordelia replied jokingly; she knew how much she didn't like royal titles. Cordelia turned around to face the other guards and Shepherds in the courtyard, and spoke to them in a loud, commanding voice, worthy of her title as captain. \"Alright, listen up! Our mission is to march through town and let all the townsfolk know about the now-giant Cynthia, Robin, and Queen Sumia! We'll separate into six groups, each with a captain to command each district of town, each with a team of 30-40 soldiers.\" Cordelia begun to point out each of the Shepherds, pointing out the commander of each small army. \"Stahl, you take care of the North Residential District.\" As she named them, each Shepherd gave a salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sully, you handle the Industrial District.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it, Captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaike, take the West Residential District.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't the sexiest job in the world, but you can count on me, Captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kellam, take the Administrative District.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you noticed me? That's a relief. You can count on us, Captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peri, take the Commercial District.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Maybe I can find something new for dinner with Inigo tonight there! I'll scour the area reeaal good, Captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the East Residential District, Morgan and I will handle it; all of my squadron is not to step anywhere inside Robin's house until our situation's properly assessed, is that clear?\" An approving rabble came from the courtyard below, following Cordelia's words. \"If that's so, then we break now! All troops - march!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" The troops in the castle grounds gathered into six groups; five of them scattered through the gates through the wall, while another six waited for their Captain's beginning march. Robin removed Morgan from her shoulder and lowered him to the floor of the wall, next to Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Morgan,\" Robin spoke, \"When you and Cordelia get inside our house, don't let her touch the stone, nor you either. Get my sealing magic from my bookshelf, it's in the silver binding. Use it on the stone, and if it doesn't look movable, then just leave it there and let Priam guard it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Auntie Cordelia?\" Cordelia turned to look at Cynthia. \"Thanks for helping us, I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time Cynthia, you're practically family, you know?\" Cynthia giggled and blushed, making a teasing swipe at Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop it, you're such a tease!\" Cordelia giggled, then whistled, causing her Pegasus to come forth and touch down on the stone wall. She saddled up on it and helped Morgan onto the winged equine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ridden before, Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit, on the back of Cynthia's during the war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, be sure to hang on tight either way. I'll go slowly, in case you get airsick.\" Cordelia stared down at her troops and begun to issue them a command. \"All troops, move out!\" Cordelia took to the skies and begun to head East, towards Robin's home, with her troops following behind her. After all was done, only the three giantesses and a small handful of troops remained within the castle grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, on that note,\" Sumia begun, \"Are you all feeling hungry? I could get some chefs to whip something up. Hopefully we don't run through the entire food supply before Chrom and Lucina come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it Mother, I could really go for some meat or something now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Sumia. I'll just have something light, like some salad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright then.\" Sumia stepped over the walls of the castle and into the grounds. She kneeled down towards some guards and begun to address them. \"Um, excuse me? Could you get the chefs to make something for me, my daughter, and my friend? Nothing too big, despite how we currently are, I don't want to inconvenience the castle workers.\" The guards saluted and retreated into the castle. Cynthia and Robin stepped over the walls and sat down next to Sumia, forming a triangle between the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, I guess now we just play the waiting game. What should we talk about?\" The three girls begun chatting gossip with each other, waiting for their meals to come out and for the Shepherds to return with results.</span></div></div>",

I noticed the effect I had on the border wall. I know we're giants, but I'm surprised how strong I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin scratched her chin, equal parts worried and curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is strange.. given the unintended damage we've caused, we're much stronger than I'd expect. Perhaps its a side effect of whatever enlarged us or perhaps beings of our size need this kind of strength to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia slammed her fist down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!I like the bit about being able to kill loads of bad guys at this size!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin glared at her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told you to be careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" She took a deep breath and spread her arms out, consciously trying to still herself. \"Keep calm, keep calm no sudden movements....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia leaned closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure there are many \"bad guys\" left anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. we can't be certain. Though things seem peaceful we don't know what is being plotted behind closed doors. And I suppose their will always be brigands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Cynthia's arm twitched as she fought the urge to pump her fist through the air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia placed her hand on Cynthia's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though you would need to be careful as having a lot of strength would come with a lot of...\" Sumia tried to search for the right word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Responsibility?\" Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, exactly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I heard Owan say something similar once.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was now deep in though, as though she was preparing the Shepard's for a mighty battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While it's true our sizes grant us a lot of strength, they also make us easier targets, especially to enemy archers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we're super strong than maybe we're super tough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible, but an arrow or a lance is likely to hurt at any size....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, I hope you don't mind me saying this, but you think about war a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Sorry, it helps keep my mind focused while avoiding other worries.\" She shivered, then looked down at herself. \"Now that I'm not thinking about tactics, I'm reminded I need another Cheesecloth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, I'll get someone to bring you one!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we all like to think about other things when we're feeling worry or scarred. Read any good books lately, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia looked a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have been cutting down, but I did like Tharcia 776, even if it was very difficult to get through at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever read anything about giants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I've only seen giants in fiction, and they are usually treated as simple monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh no wonder people were so scared of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not aware of any historical accounts of giants.

Indeed they had attracted quite an audience, though more eyes were on Robin than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia waved back at her observers and bystanders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are three really big ladies, I guess its only natural people stare, I mean how often does anyone see this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked  flushed, trying to cover herself with her arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think most of them are looking at me, and not for any good reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sent someone to get another Cheesecloth, I'm sure they''l be back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming their not part of the gallery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you see them if they were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see through walls! My abilities are not magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from the spells you cast?\" She ask in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin shifted into teaching, she relaxed, forgetting about her wardrobe malfunction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are magic. Though thinking of it that way, I suppose both do require an attentive and focused mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia's eyes widened and she lurched forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean Miriel could do what you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An interesting example. Not to the same degree I can, though when she is not distracted by one particular detail she can be very preceptive. Mages are generally good at perceiving what is around them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even Ricken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, though since he is still young he is easier to distract than most mages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo servants approached the group, carrying another Cheesecloth. They placed it down at Robin's knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you-\"  Robin's eyes suddenly widened as she remembered why she had asked for it, hastily trying to wrap it around her. \"This is not ideal but I suppose it will do for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia shut her eyes. and pursed her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, if we're still stuck like this I'll try to get you some proper clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was not normally one to laugh at others but she couldn't help but giggle. For all of Robin's constant lectures, it was amusing to see her forget her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you forgot why you asked for the other Cheesecloth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, even as one who prides herself on her awareness I can still occasionally be distracted. Awareness is not merely about seeing with your eyes, its keeping your mind on what you are doing, and I doubt anyone who is completely immune to distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... but sometimes it's fun to think about other things. Like how our conversation got our minds off the whole giant thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, one can't focus all the time or they'd drive themselves mad, the key is balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia opened her eyes..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how I cut back on the amount of fiction I read, but still enjoy it in moderation\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia's eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... my dreams of being a hero. Other than sis and some friends, it was all I had during those times... I needed to get stronger just to survive, so I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia wrapped her arms around her and drew and her closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there, it's all over now. Grima is dead, his cultists are scattered and we're at peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mom, and I'm glad but... it's not just that. I spent almost my whole life training and now what? And before when I messed up, some people might laugh but now....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just need to be more careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.. I never needed to worry about that stuff this way before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin placed an arm on Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia regardless of whether or not I can get us back to normal size, I will help you find a use for your strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" She suddenly pounced on Robin and glomped her. \"Thank you!

We have covered all of Ylisse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia clapped her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin merely looked satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Methodical as always, Cordelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you actin' like she did it all herself!\u201d Vaike shouted from below.\u201d The Vaike told plenty of people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin suppressed a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not mean to imply it was not a group effort. Thank you, everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaike puffed up his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though I have to say it was a mighty tall tale! I dunno how many people really believed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will soon see the truth for themselves. The important thing is that when civilians see us, they will not think of us as monsters or invaders.\" Robin got to her feet, gesturing for Sumia and Cynthia to do the same. \"It is important the citizens of Ylisse see me walking with you, so that they'll know I am a companion of yours. This way I am also less likely to be bothered while I do my research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quickly checking nothing and no one was near her, Cynthia pumped her fist through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And remember, take it slow and careful. Pay attention to everyone and everything around you, lives could be at stake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia and Sumia spoke almost simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" \"Understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 giantess approached Ylisse, Robin walking directly behind Sumia and Cynthia. Their pace was slow and deliberate, Sumia even holding her arms to improve her balance. Fortunately practice and Robin's guidance proved to pay off, as the trio had no problems approaching the city. Gasps were heard as they neared, but having been forewarned their presence did not send Ylisse into a frenzy, though there plenty of commotion and gossip. Robin moved closer to Sumia and whispered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..\" She cleared her throat. \"I am Queen Sumia. With me is Princess Cynthia, and our Royal Librarian and Tactician, Robin. I know our sizes might seem alarming, but we are still the same people we always were. We mean you no harm and merely wish to pass through Ylisse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension in the air lessoned, crowds parter to let them through. The gossiping and murmuring did not completely stop, and many eyes were still on them, filled with differing emotions. Cynthia tried to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't going bad... I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin took a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even forewarned, it will take Ylisse a while to adjust to us, but hopefully this will the worse of it. Now let's head to my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in single file. Even with the peasants clearing out of the way, the streets were still tight for the trio, though their larger sizes allowed them to step over several buildings, and Sumia and Cynthia merely slowed down when they needed to.. Now that she towered over all the buildings, Cynthia marvelled at her new view of the city, and how it appeared like a model to her, though Sumia and Robin simply focused on getting to Robin's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not being able to walk as fast they could, their longer legs carried them across Ylisse quicker they had thought possible and they soon found themselves at Robin's house.. Priam was waiting, but at the sight of them, especially Robin, the normally stoic Priam looked more surprised than anyone had ever seen. Robin allowed herself a moment of levity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a lot take in aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam, who could normally talk the hind-legs of a donkey was lost for words. Robin was not surprised, but turned to Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be able to research our condition now. If I need anything else I'll let you know. Though if you can find me something that could clothe me better, I would appreciate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do we do now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Until I complete my research, I suppose all you can do is wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well at least people don't think I'm scary monster anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Night approached quickly after the hullabaloo of the day calmed down. The mood of the townsfolk in Ylisse was still a little tense; many couldn't believe that there was now 3 giants that lived in their kingdom, of which 2 were of the royal family. There were small meetings made in each district of the capital, small discussions between homeowners, business owners, peasantry, and the like - there was no clue within the town demographic of how to react to the giants, and the growing size and intensity of the ramblings just went to show how much the topic monopolized the minds of the townsfolk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really okay to trust them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it's a trap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't look like they mean harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're our rulers and neighbors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but Queen Sumia's so clumsy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These giants are a menace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, I'm a little scared...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intensity of the discussions were at their worst in the East Residential District, where townsfolk had a full view of the giant-sized Robin, sitting in the giant hole she had put in her roof, toiling away with small books and scraps of paper as she did her research, her smaller family standing guard around the home to prevent any injuries or magical accidents. Despite this, the discussions were quiet and controlled, and evenly split down the middle in opinion; for the while though, it seemed as if there wouldn't be violent outcry in response to the 3 titanic girls. Within the walls of Castle Ylisstol, the mood was far more relaxed; though surprised at the 3 giants, the castle's servants and the Shepherds were used to arguably far more unbelievable scenarios, and at this point, they were already dull to the fact their fellow Pegasus Knight and Queen they served stood as 60-foot tall monoliths. As for Cynthia and Sumia, away from the rest of their family, they only had each other to entertain each other, and tried to make the best out of their situation; the two girls sat in a large wooden tub of water, of which a small ring of fire surrounded it, and tried desperately to relax after the hectic last couple of days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh~!\" Cynthia sighed in relief, \"It was so nice of the other Shepherds to let us use the water tower to bathe! I can just feel all my troubles melting away!\" Cynthia sank her body deeper into the hot waters with a wide grin on her face, feeling relaxed. Sumia looked a little more rigid, looking around nervously, despite the small smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is nice...\" she agreed, \"But, you know...It just doesn't feel right to bathe out in the open like this, people could be watching...\" Sumia's gaze focused on some cavaliers marching by; she took notice of their stares and immediately covered her arms over her area of cleavage uncovered by the water, her face blooming into a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, you worry way too much sometimes; we're around trusted friends here, nobody's going to make any advances on you or anything! Except maybe Vaike...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess you're right...\" Sumia let her arms relax and took a deep breath, sinking a bit into the bath waters. Cynthia flipped over from her relaxing position and hung her arms and head over the side of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, could you scrub my back for me? I got an itch back there that's been killing me all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure thing!\" Sumia reached over the side of the tub and grabbed a large broom, used for washing the wyverns in Shepherd employ, and begun to scrub Cynthia's back with it. The princess let out a delighted purr, enjoying the soft bristles against her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! That's the spot! Just keep that going for like, 5 minutes or so!\" As she scrubbed, Sumia's eyes affixed to the Brand of the Exalt on Cynthia's right shoulder blade; the regal design never ceased to impress Sumia, despite seeing it daily upon Chrom's shoulder and Lucina's eye. Sumia smiled and ran her fingers softly across the brand, causing Cynthia to jump, splashing water over the side of the tub and putting out some of the flames surrounding it. \"<i>Eek!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm sorry Cynthia! I didn't mean to scare you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, no, it's fine! Your fingers are so ticklish, just warn me next time before you do that!\" Sumia looked a bit down as Cynthia ran her palm across the spot her mother touched. \"You were touching my Brand, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\" Sumia replied. She looked at her daughter with a smile, her eyes showed she was in deep thought. \"I just couldn't help but think how alike to your father you became, almost right down to your Brand. You're a true contender for his heir when up against Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so? I mean, at least Lucina can use Falchion, that should be proof enough that she's next-in-line for Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's true, but aside from that, I couldn't help but notice the similarities. You're both kind, brave, a little reckless, have a strong love for justice, and you both break far too many things during practice; now that I think about it, the only thing you probably inherited from me was your love for animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mother, all those things can apply to you too. Especially the 'breaking stuff' part.\" Sumia blushed and giggled a little, not expecting Cynthia to be so blunt about her clumsiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was just a thought. You and Lucina took away a lot of royal genes from Chrom, right down to your hair color, I just couldn't help but wonder if there was anything I passed down to the both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're both girls, that needs to count for something, right? And besides...\" Cynthia let out a sharp whistle, and in a short instance, Cynthia's personal Pegasus had come from its stall and flew to her master, perching upon the rim of the tub. Cynthia used her oversized finger to rub the winged horse's back, and it let out a pleased neigh as the finger stroked across its back. \"If it wasn't for you, I don't think Lucina or I would've ever taken the path we did. When Father was killed in the future, we were truly sad, but we had you to raise us, and you always taught us the importance of fighting for the friends and family you cared for. The day you died was the day we took up our sword and lance, and then from there, Owain, Severa, Inigo, and everyone else joined us as well, to change the fate of the future - when you get down to it, you're probably the thing that got Grima killed in the end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess when you put it that way...\" Sumia let out a laugh and stuck her hand on Cynthia's cheek, stroking it gently. \"Have I ever told you how proud I am to have you two as my daughters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never a single day without! And you'll always have the two babies in the castle to care for too, so you get Double-Daughters Funtime! Oh, hey! That could be a really cool special move name!\" The two girls laughed before getting back to relaxing; Cynthia only had 12 seconds of R&amp;R before a thought ate up at her mind. \"So hey, if we're gonna be this big from now on, how are you going to handle Baby Me and Baby Lucina?\" Sumia flipped over and took a look at the castle, watching some mason workers begin to repair the sections Cynthia broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be a little tough to tuck them in, or read stories to them from now on, but I'll find a way. Heck, I'm still trying to think about how I'm going to sleep with Chrom like this...\" Sumia flipped back, looking Cynthia directly in the eyes. \"Cynthia, sweetie, I hope you're not feeling outcast by this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, I'm cool! It was a little terrifying at first, but I think I'm used to it now - I'm more worried about you to be honest!\" Cynthia leaned back over the tub's rim, letting her blue hair drape over the side as she stared at the stars. \"I can easily get used to this, but I want to know where that rock came from. Someone could really get hurt if that magic gets in the wrong hands, and what kind of hero just lets her townspeople become endangered with no response?\" Cynthia pumped her arm skyward, pointing a fist towards the constellations above. \"No, not while Super-Giant Hero Cynthia's on the job! I wanna use this magic to my advantage; I'm gonna find whoever or whatever that stupid rock came from, and then I'm gonna kick the crap out of them, once for embarrassing me, twice for putting my city in danger, and then three times for making Mother huge &amp; sad! There's no brakes on this pain-carriage!\" Sumia giggled at her daughter's enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least it's good to know you're psyche is still strong! For now, let's just wait for Robin's diagnosis, and then I'll be happy to let 'Super-Giant Hero Cynthia' do whatever she needs to keep Ylisse safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Sumia looked at the sky, watching the moon shine down directly over the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late, I think I'm done bathing for the night. Do you want me to leave the fire on for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm gonna keep soaking &amp; relaxing for a bit. I'll take care of the fire before I hit the hay, knight's honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then I'll be in the barn, come join me when you're ready to come to bed.\" Sumia used her arms to cover her privates before climbing out of the tub, watching cautiously to make sure no one was watching her. Quickly, she grabbed her cheesecloth dress from the watchtower it was draped over and wrapped it loosely around her body, enough to cover her as she marched to the barn. \"Goodnight Cynthia!\" Sumia held her arms together and stepped slowly, being careful not to trip, as Cynthia sank into the hot bath water and continued her daydream of her gigantic hero adventures, accompanied by mental songs, cheers from the people, and heroic special effects.</span></div></div>",

For the most part, the Shepards still treated them the same way as before, but others who did not know them so well were still visibly wary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they'll ever get used to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can only hope so.\" Sumia tried to appear strong, but she couldn\u2019t hide her folded lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, they could see Robin heading for the castle. She tried to manurer through the village as carefully as she could, using her almost supernatural awareness. At the sight of her, Cynthia instinctively wanted to spring up, but Sumia raised her hand, reminding her to be careful. Taking heed, Cynthia got up slowly, making sure to look around. Sumia was just as excited, if not more so, but feared that if she showed it Cynthia would get careless. She stood up soon after  Cynthia, ready to greet Robin. Instead of running to meet her, they waited for Robin to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is as I fear, nothing like this has happened in recorded history. And if rocks turning people into giant had happened in the past, I'm sure it would be recorded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia puffed her cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Really? I'm sure I read a story like this before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be your imagination. Anyway, I've tried to study the magic that's effecting us, I must confess I am not as well versed as Miriel or Laurent, but it is like nothing I've seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia\u2019s frowned deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's nothing you can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia clasped her arms together, unable to hide her building anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean we're stuck like this forever?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin barely showed any hint of distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully not. I said there was nothing I could do, but others may be able to help. We could have Miriel and Laurent analyse the shards, though we would have to make sure Miriel's curiosity would not get the best of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia brightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But even they may not be able to counteract the stone's magic. It possible this stone is other worldly in origin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do we do then?\" Cynthia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone can do it, it would be those two. Should it prove impossible, we could ask Tiki for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia\u2019s eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiki?! But the Divine Dragon Grounds are so far away! And I'm pretty sure we're much to big for any boat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. And I would rather not travel in this state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't want to leave my kingdom without a king or queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I propose that if Miriel and Laurent are unable to help us, we send a message to Tiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that means staying like this for longer\u2026. And I will be expected to hear my subjects soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have to live with it for now We've endured worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.. but I'm not sure people are willing to see the queen like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia had been quiet as she listened. She wasn\u2019t as worried as Robin and Sumia, her arms almost flaliling with exictment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey maybe I can help people like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. there is already a backlash brewing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of backlash?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been observing the townsfolk and overheard plenty of their mutterings. Some still see us as we are, others fear what we might do, intentionally or otherwise-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia looked at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean their worried I'll crush someone because I'm clumsy.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin placed an arm on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you have been doing your best to improve, but not everyone sees that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.. I'll just have to keep my distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wouldn't it make things easier if I tried to help out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps when things settle down. Right know, no not when people are still frightened of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin has a point. We can\u2019t risk frightening the townsfolk anymore. Maybe when things calm down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia sighed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia called for Miriel and Laurent. It had proved fortunate that Chrom had employed them as court magicians. Robin explained the situation as succinctly as she could, the two mages listening with interest. Robin showed them the strange rock, keeping it carefully wrapped up, and cautioned them not to touch it no matter how curious they were. The two were excited at the chance to study such a strange and powerful artefact, Miriel more than her son but they both promised  to do what they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left, Cynthia swung her arms, mindful of everything around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh I\u2019ve never had to be so still for so long! Can I please go and train or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gave it a second\u2019s thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome exercise could do us all good, though not here. If you want to practice you can use the clearing you rested at.  And I know you might find it difficulty to practice without a lance suited to your size, but if this persists I\u2019m sure Priam will be happy to help you work out a training regime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? He\u2019d do that for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes he\u2019s too into his training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, which are Morgan and Priam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin almost rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed you ask? Priam talk Morgan off to their usual morning training session. Speaking of which I should go check up on them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia and Robin got up and began to go there separate ways. Cynthia turned to her mother, who remained seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you coming to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to but I can\u2019t. Someone has to hold down the fort while everyone is away. Oh Robin! Aren\u2019t you hungry? I can get you something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s ok-\u201d Robin stopped, putting a hand on her stomach. She looked sheepish. \u201cHmm.. it seems I am hungrier than I realized.  I tend to forget such things when my mind is on a problem. I wouldn\u2019t mind something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell have fun!\u201d Cynthia said cheerfully, though as she turned form them she frowned, suddenly feeling alone again. As she walked, thoughts followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if we really are stuck like this? She tried to push it back Well we\u2019ll just have to make the best of it!\u201d But the villagers are still scared of us. \u201cThey\u2019ll come around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cynthia drew closer she heard what sounded like a panic yell. She was sure that someone needed her help! Robin and Sumia\u2019s word briefly came into her head, but she shrugged. A hero, no a Shepard could not ignore anyone in need of assistance!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cynthia dashed past the walls of the castle, running through the countryside outside of town to cause as little damage as possible, but still being mindful of how she could get to the source of the yell quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hold on, troubled citizen, I'm on my way!\"</i> Cynthia's feet pounded across the ground, leaving deep indents in the earth as she ran; small earthquakes shook up the surrounding area, sending those unlucky enough to the ground, usually on their rear. Eventually, Cynthia's eyes focused onto a small farm settlement, disconnected from much of the surrounding village, yells erupting in greater intensity from the house as she approached. <i>\"Found you!\"</i> Cynthia leapt from the ground, lunging forward towards the farmland property like a bird taking off from its nest. As she hit the ground, her heels dug into the earth, creating small canals as the velocity pushed her forward; Cynthia spread her legs apart and struck a fighting pose, ready for action. \"Giant Hero Cynthia is at your service! No need to fear! Point me to the trouble and I'll help right out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you wanna know where the trouble is?!\" Cynthia looked down at the small family of three below her, a farmer, his wife, and their son; the farmer was pointing at Cynthia and his face looked positively steamed. \"There it is! Right there! Look at what you done did to my farm!\" Cynthia looked back towards the path she took; footprints marked the destroyed grass where she stepped, the ground was cracked and swollen with uprooted dirt and minerals, and Cynthia actually took notice of what her leap did to the famer's vegetable field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...Um, whoops...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops ain't gonna cut it sweetie! Who's gonna fix my darn farm?! And for the love of Naga, close your legs up!\" Cynthia looked down at the young boy staring up her makeshift dress; it suddenly occurred to her that she wasn't wearing any underwear, and she quickly clamped her legs shut and pulled down on her dress, trying to cover up as much as she could as her face bloomed into a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Omigosh! Omigosh!</i>\" Cynthia eventually kneeled down at the apex of her embarrassment, creating more indents in the farmland, and making the farmer angrier in turn. He stormed off into the barn, presumably to shout as loud as he could, leaving Cynthia to talk with the farmer's wife and child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetie, don't mind him,\" the wife spoke, \"Clerics in town say he's got high blood pressure, he does. You're one of them 'giant people' everyone in town's been talking about, ain't ya? Sorry ya had to get yelled at like that, it's gotta be bad for you since ya ain't normal and all.\" The words stung Cynthia a little, but she tried to stay positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma, she sure is pretty.\" The child spoke up, erecting a blush from Cynthia, both of embarrassment and of joy towards the complement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about the farm Miss. But uh, what exactly was your husband yelling about before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothin', some of the cattle just broke loose last night is all, there was talk about thieves stealing livestock for a while now, so he freaked out, but I just think they're out in the woods grazing, they usually come back all good like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean,\" Cynthia responded, \"It could be brigands, couldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" the wife retorted, holding her chin, \"It always could be...\" The woman shook her head. \"But what are we supposed to do then? We ain't got weapons or nothing, and it's not like we can't just start milking the goats instead. We make a comfy enough living, and we could probably afford more cows this season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if it is brigands, then they could just steal the cows again!\" Cynthia slowly stood up, making sure the young child couldn't see under her dress again. \"How's about I go into the woods and look for the cattle? If it really is a pack of thieves, at this size, I'll give them such a scare, so much that they'll never come back again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it'd be much obliged and all,\" the wife responded, \"But my husband's right though, the vegetable fields are ruined; thankfully we didn't plant nothin', but how are we gonna till the soil in time for the season?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could do that too. I'm not familiar with it, but I could try.\" Cynthia started to feel bad about her accidental damages again and bended over apologetically, unknowingly letting the young child get a good look at her cleavage. \"Sorry again about this! I promise I'll fix the farm and solve the case of the missing cattle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that sweetie, it's good to know young people today take responsibility for their actions; you could be a big help.\" Cynthia perked up at the compliment, especially the use of the word \"big\" in the sentence. I'm gonna try and calm my husband down a bit, and I'll let you decide what to tackle; personally though, if you could take the farm first, that'd be a real fine help. Come along now.\" The woman tugged on her son's arm, trying to break his gaze from Cynthia's breasts as they retreated into the farmhouse. Cynthia stood tall and firm, fixed her dress, and turned around, staring at both the destruction she unintentionally caused and the woods the cattle disappeared into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Alright, do or die time!\"</i> Cynthia thought, <i>\"This is gonna be the make or break moment that makes me into a giant hero; I can't let the nice farmers down now that they're counting on me!</i> Cynthia took takes at each focus, deciding what she should do; if she fixed the farm now, then the family would have a stable source of income sooner, but the cattle could potentially be long gone, either attacked by beasts or truly stolen by brigands - on the flipside, searching for the cattle could potentially lead to discovery of crime, which she could nip in the bud easily, and if she worked quick enough, she could easily come back and fix the farm over time. Cynthia thought long and hard about the effects of each decision she could possibly make, then quickly made her choice.</span></div></div>",

She started to bend down, holding her dress to avoid another wardrobe malfunction. But if I don't chase the bandits now they could get away! I can always fix this latter.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, resolved, determined and kind of excited. She took another step, this time watching both her feet and the ground beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come back with your cows soon, I promise! Then I'll try and fix your farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia headed out, relieved when the village was behind her and she no longer had to watch her steps so carefully. Robin had warned her about the risk she posed to people or buildings, but she never thought she'd damage the land just by walking! She really had to watch her feet now, though she was sure she was getting better at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet... hmm... were they always so small? Proportionally, obviously since at this size they were huge. She heard people comment on how small the Shepard's feet were, but assumed it was just idle complaining.. No time to worry about that now, she had bandits to find!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia had no idea where the bandits could be. Of course it was quite possible they were far away by now, but she hoped that wasn\u2019t the case. At least her height gave her a great view of the forest, as she easily towered over just about every tree and her long legs let her cover a tremendous amount of ground. The trouble is, from this height much of the forest looked the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... gonna have to think this one through. I've had to do that a lot more lately.\" Cynthia was used to acting on the first though that came into her head, but she realized now that was she was giant sized, every action, every movement could have terrible consequences. She still wasn't used to slowing down, but it gave her some new perspective. \"I could charge around the forest but I might never find them and I'd probably do so much damage..... Hmm... if I were a bandit where would I put a hideout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia moved slowly across the forest now trying to look for any area that stood. Over there! That far away circle with no trees. It was almost certainly much too large to be natural, it could easily be bandit's encampment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to run, but stopped herself. Aside from the damage she might cause to the forest, if she started running now, they would hear her footsteps and move themselves and the stolen cattle on before she could reach them. She could chase after them, but if the woods were dense enough her size could work against her. Besides it would be to much better effect if she slowly approached their camp, then when they knew she was coming for them she would pick up speed and be on them before they could escapes with the cows. If this was the encampment, then it was likely they had a makeshift pen to hold them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect! She couldn't help but smile, this was going to be great! She wondered if she'd have time to strike a good heroic pose. Maybe if she was quick.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew nearer she quickened her pace, breaking into a run. Those bandits were going to wet themselves when they saw a giant charging at them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Taking a brief glance down she could they had spotted her  and were suitably panicked. Excellent! She decided to add to the effect with a fierce battle cry, boosted by her size, suitably terrifying the bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood over the encampment, taking another step so they could hear her loud stomp. She post quickly, stretching her arms out as she normally did, though without her lance her pose seemed incomplete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HALT BANDITS! IT IS I, GIANT HERO CYNTHIA! GIVE BACK THE CATTLE YOU STOLE!\" Cynthia loved the way her voice carried across the forest. Her new size had some nice perks. She would have given a longer, more flowery speech but knew bandits were not the honourable sort who would stay and listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd naturally, after taking just a few seconds to gawk in terror at her, each and every bandit turned tail, there screams filling the air as they scattered. Well she wouldn't them all to deliver her message. With just a few steps she caught up with one trying to reach pen holding the cattle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed him and dangled him in front of her face, letting him hang upside down. The bandit wriggled and squirmed, trying to free himself of Cynthia's grip, apparently fearing the fall less than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia stuck her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat you? Bleh, I don't eat humans and I bet you taste terrible. The village sent me and you better leave them alone or next time I'll really make you regret, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit nodded dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, get going and tell the others!\" She placed him and he ran as fast as his legs could carry him. Something occurred to Cynthia and she called after him. \"And if you attack any other villages, I'll make you sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia beamed, taking a moment to bask in her work. She had just subdued an entire gang of bandits without needing to raise a weapon! Maybe she really could help people like this, maybe she could truly be a hero. A weapon.. she still didn't have a weapon, and wasn't sure where she might get one. She could try fighting at this size but it would leave her vulnerable. She wondered what would have happened if they hadn't been cowed into surrender. She was sure she could handle it but no matter how she was an axe would still hurt....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put those thoughts to the back of her mind, remembering her objective. She bent down the pick up the cows who were mooing fearfully or trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess being this big wouldn't just scare bandits.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to animals, Cynthia was not particularly gifted or practiced, having once neglected her own pegasus but she tried to calm them down, making soothing noises and stroking them. This had only minimals effect, so Cynthia scooped up as many as she could, carefully holding them in her arms. She could sense their anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you and you'll soon be back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strode back, eager to return to the village, feeling at last like a real hero.</span></div></div>",

Well their was one villager astonished at her return.... The angry farmer from before, now gawking up at her with eyes filled with gratittude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cows.. you brought them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Cynthia puffered out her chest. \"And I scared away the bandits! I told them if they ever came back or terroized any village I'd come back for them! So you'll never see them again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farmer's wife smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in a days work!\" Now Cynthia really felt like a hero. She bent down, preparing to put the cows down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not there!\" The farmer scolded. \"Can't you tell their frightened?\" Their anxious mooing still filled the air, though to Cynthia it had become become noise. \"The second you put them down they'll run for the hills!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry. Where do they go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farmer pointed to a pen across the land Cynthia had damaged. She walked very slowly, almost tiptoeing, not wanting to cause anymore destruction. One by one she put the cows in, who ran from her as soon as possible. She sighed, reminded again that would never be as good with animals as her mother, especially not when she was so large. But at least she could help people and convince them she wasn't a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" She said brightly. \"And I know I accidentally messed up your farmland, but I promise I'll do my best to fix it!\" <i>Even though I don't know much about farming.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia dropped down on all fours, wanting to fix the farmlands immediately. There we no tools for Cynthia, but her hands were larger than any shovel, and she wasn't afraid of some dirt, at least if it meant cleaning up a mess she made. She pushed the dirt she had moved back into the holes she had made, and patted it down with her hands, also wiping some of it off her feet, since it just occurred to her that some of it would be stuck to her soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially Cynthia had visions of restoring the farmland to the way it was before she arrived, but once again reality wasn't matching her imagination. Disheartening as it was, she soon realized that without proper tools, knowledge and resources it was impossible for her to do a flawless job, not to mention the parts of the land that had unwitting stuck to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was never one to quit, even if she couldn't make things completely right, she was still going to do her best!</span></div></div>",

By that time, the sun began to set, and the sky became a creamy orange, a sight that relaxed Cynthia after a whole day of strenuous work. Cynthia wiped the sweat from her brow and fixed her dress, dyed with splotches of brown from the dirty earth; she waltzed over to the barn where the farming family were finishing dinner and rapped on the large door with her fist. The three came outside and looked up at Cynthia, awaiting the status report on her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried my best sir!\" she cried enthusiastically. Cynthia pointed to the farmland with her right hand and balled her left fist to the big smile on her face, waiting for praise. \"Tell me how I did? Am I a farmland hero or what?\" The farmer looked at the land, once previously destroyed, and observed the work Cynthia did. The land was hand-plowed with unaligned grooves of varying length and depth in the dirt, the fencing was bent in numerous places and equally unaligned, and the dirt looked dampened in some places, while bone-dry in the others; it was pure amateur work, very sloppy in a lot of areas, but it was better off than it was before. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw one of Cynthia's deeper footprints now filled with water, forming somewhat of a small lake, or rather, a large pond on his property. The farmer tried to look a little enthusiastic, but he couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment at how good his farmland looked compared to Cynthia's work; he sighed and chose his words carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not terrible, but...\" Cynthia looked disappointed, her face beginning to contort into a pout. \"Either way, it looks a lot better than that pile o' mess from before. I guess I can patch it up tomorrow. Thanks missy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that,\" Cynthia started, \"But I just feel bad about making you work Mr. Farmer, especially after I ruined it in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's fine. If it wasn't the crops, it was gonna be looking for them darn cows. I'd say you've been a big help today with that, literally.\" Cynthia felt a little bit happier about the compliment towards her cattle-rescue, and her face cracked into a small smile once again. \"In any case, we gotta reward you somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no thanks! A hero's just happy knowing she helps people out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, seriously, you're gonna want this, sugar.\" spoke the farmer's wife. She retreated into the barn with her son for a moment, and when they came back out, they both carried a huge, bunched up piece of burlap and set it to the ground in front of Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Cynthia grabbed the burlap and unfolded it. When unfurled, the burlap made the shape of a triangle, with a hole in the top and two holes in the sides. Cynthia's face erupted into a blush after putting the clues together. \"I-Is this what I think it is?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is,\" answered the wife, \"We done took an old grain sack we weren't using anymore and cut a couple holes in it for ya. We figured it'd be so folks aren't looking at your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm familiar with how smallclothes work!\" Cynthia looked at the gift some more before turning back to the little family below her. \"Do you, uh, mind if I duck behind the barn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing sweetie, take your time.\" On that, Cynthia slowly walked behind the barn and looked around to make sure nobody could see her. Slowly, she fit her legs into the burlap and pulled up on the makeshift underwear, pulling them up to her hips and making sure they were tight. Cynthia twisted around, making sure they were comfy around her hips, and did a couple squats to make sure they'd stay together. Once satisfied, Cynthia stepped out from around the barn again, prompting the wife to speak up. \"Well, how do they fit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\" Cynthia stammered, eyes focused on the young boy below, hoping she doesn't accidently embarrass herself further. \"They're pretty comfy and all, I gotta say, and nothing's wrong with an extra degree of privacy. Thanks for making them Miss.\" Cynthia looked at the sky, making a judge of her time. \"Well, it's getting dark, and a knight can never rest! Fiends do come out in higher rates during the night and all! Sorry again about the farmland, I hope I was a help with the cattle and fields!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime sweetie. You ever wanna pop in again and lend a hand, come right on over.\" The farmer shot his wife a glare, not intending for another \"heroic entrance\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, justice awaits!\" Cynthia spun around and made a stance, ready to bolt into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walk slowly!\" shouted the farmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right...\" On that, Cynthia calmly and slowly walked away from the farm, satisfied by her work, and made her way back into town. During her stride, she thought to herself. <i>\"Well, that could've gone better. But hey, at least I fixed the farm a bit, and stopped grand theft cattle while I was at it! Being huge rocks!\"</i> Cynthia stared up at the sky, the creamy orange began to turn a magenta color, and the moon began to show through all the clouds. <i>\"It's gonna get dark soon, Mother could be worried about me. I should probably get home soon.\"</i> Cynthia stuck a finger to her lips and stopped her halt. <i>\"On the other hand, this could be a good opportunity to look for more trouble! There have been some reports about muggings during the night, imagine how safe the town could be if I knock 'em all out in one night!\"</i> Cynthia thought over her options a bit, weighing the consequences, before reaching a conclusion.</span></div></div>",

What could be more heroic than that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she remembered the damage she caused to the farmland, and Robin\u2019s words about the town folk being afraid of her. She still wasn\u2019t completely used to her giant body, and she  couldn\u2019t see as well in the dark as she could during the day. It would be very easy to cause more unintended destruction, making the townsfolk even more afraid of not only her, but Sumia and Robin as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia sighed. She would have to put her heroic ambitions on hold at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if restrain was part of the hero\u2019s way. Before being turned into a giant she never really had to worry. Though on the positive side, she could potentially help far more people now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped. If Robin had found a cure, she didn\u2019t want it anymore. She could understand Robin and Sumia wanting to return to their normal lives, but after the war, she had become just another solider, albeit one with famous friends and family. She tried not to let it get to her, but whereas Chrom and Lucina were viewed as legends, she aware of those who viewed her as a joke, no matter how hard she trained. She had wondered if she would ever be like her sister Lucina, strong and confident, that people instinctively rallied behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing big allowed her to help people on a scale she couldn\u2019t before, but she had to admit she would likely never be a leader like Lucina or Chrom. Still as long as she could carve out her own niche and continue helping people and fighting evil could be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she really didn\u2019t want to be \u201ccured\u201d. Maybe if she asked nicely Robin and Sumia would let her stay like this\u2026 though that did assume Robin had found a cure. Could even someone like a Robin find a cure to something previously unknown so quickly? It didn\u2019t seem likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm... Where would Robin be? Cynthia\u2019s first guess would be at Robin\u2019s home or out training with her husband. But it was likely Robin would be spending less time in town, with the Ylisse being uncomfortable around her, and even Priam couldn\u2019t train all day and night\u2026. could he? Surely Robin was exaggerating about what she said before\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a good chance she was at the castle, and even if she wasn\u2019t mother would be there. It was decided then, to the castle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked through the night, almost as though she was on a casual evening stroll but she kept her eyes and ears open, not only to avoid any unintended harm, but also to listen out in case there were any muggings nearby. She wasn\u2019t going to stomp around town, at least with things as they were, but if she came across any\u2026 woe betide that evil doer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was surprised how well she could hear at her size. Even with people appearing relatively fair away from her or talking quietly, she could hear them clearly. Was sharper hearing another perk of being a giant? All the easier to find those in trouble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Cynthia\u2019s relief and disappointment, her journey to the castle was uneventful. As she approached, she held out her hands and announced her presences. The guards had started to recognise her again, though with Sumia and Robin being the only other giants it would be hard for them not to recognise her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cynthia approached the castle, Sumia immediately stood up and spun to face her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia where have you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey no need to worry, I\u2019m a big girl!\u201d Cynthia knew it was a bad joke, but she wanted to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia\u2019s face creased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia became serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know mom, but it\u2019s fine, I watched nearly every step I took but.. I may have stepped on some farmer\u2019s farmland and spent the last couple of hours fixing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia you do remember what Robin told us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know and I tried! But the farmer\u2019s cattle were also missing and I not only got them back, I scared the bandits so that they\u2019d never come back again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that is something\u2026.\u201d Sumia was unusually cautious with her praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia did not pick up on her mother\u2019s ill ease as she was so caught up telling her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-And I promise I watched my feet the whole way back! Hey have you noticed we have really small feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes dear, I\u2019ve heard people point that out before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia spoke faster, almost too fast for Sumia to hear, certainly too fast for her to get any words out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo after I brought back the cows I worked really hard to fix the farm. The sun was high in the sky when I started and when I finished it was night. I didn\u2019t do a perfect job, but I tried my best. And when I saw it was night I wanted to go after the muggers, but I knew the townsfolk were still afraid of me and you would be expecting me back.\u201d Cynthia took a deep breath.  \u201cHey where\u2019s Robin? Did she find a cure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin is with Priam. She kept trying to search for something but didn\u2019t find anything. She thinks Tiki is our best hope, so we\u2019re going to have to wait for the messengers to return.\u201d Sumia couldn\u2019t hide her sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well I was thinking... even if a cure is found, maybe I could stay like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia\u2026 but why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can help so many more people like this! And I\u2019m getting better at moving around everyday, in no time at all I\u2019ll be as nimble as before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut were you always clumsy, like but less so. At our size that could put a lot of innocent lives in danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m being careful! I have to admit I\u2019ve never had to be so careful in my life, but I think starting to get the hang of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia was silent for a moment.</span></div></div>",

Besides, it's not like I haven't been ostracized before!\" Sumia tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a lot of it was back in the future, but people always called me names and stuff for trying to be a hero, Severa especially. She still did it a bit when we met up again in this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sumia asked, concerned for her daughter's feelings. \"But I thought you and Severa were friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are, but she's kinda a bully between you and me, I think she got even a bit more bully in her when she came back from that long trip...\" Cynthia shook her head. \"But that's not the point! Point is that I'm used to mean names and hurtful words! Let 'em at me! I eat words for breakfast!\" She stepped forward a bit to illustrate her intensity, and was met with the tap of a blade's hilt upon her foot. She looked down to see Sully and Peri, standing close to her foot, handling a small group of horses by their reins, leading them to the stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you watch where you're stepping?!\" Sully barked, a little irritated. \"You almost took my arm off there!\" Cynthia stepped backwards and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigosh! I'm so sorry Sully, Peri! It's super-lucky you two didn't get hurt! It won't happen again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, you're lucky you're Chrom's kid. If it was anyone else, I swear to Naga...\" The two continued walking to the stables; Cynthia swore Peri shot her a glare before they left that carried a sense of murderous intent behind it, and it creeped her out as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Cynthia? That's exactly what I'm talking about! I know you try, but it's hard to be careful when we're the size of buildings, someone could get accidentally hurt without your knowledge.\" Sumia stepped closer and put her hands to her hips, making a commanding face. \"We're going to ask Tiki about this, and once we find a cure, I want you to go back to normal along with Robin and I, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mother-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No 'but's!\" Cynthia looked defeated, and shuffled her feet around the floor of the courtyard as she looked down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiiine...\" Sumia relaxed her face into a smile and shook her head in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I promise you Cynthia, this is for your own good.\" Sumia outreached her arms towards her daughter. \"Now, could I get a hug?\" Cynthia waited a bit without saying anything, eventually moving into a hug with her mother; Sumia rubbed her cheek against Cynthia's affectionately, happy that she got through to her daughter. The hug was shortly broken and Sumia followed up with a light yawn. \"Anyways, I'm feeling sleepy, so I'm going to get to bed early. Is there anything else you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but wake me if you need me for anything. Goodnight sweetie!\" Sumia turned backwards and walked off slowly to the courtyard barn, taking care not to trip and break something. Once her mother was out of sight, Cynthia sat down and leaned her back against the castle walls, and thought to herself about the interaction with her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Darn it Mom!\"</i> Cynthia thought, <i>\"You just don't get it! Being a giantess is what makes me a super-special hero like Lucina, without it I'm just a run-of-the-mill soldier!\"</i> Cynthia balled up her fist and started beating her cranium with it. <i>\"Gah! Stupid, stupid Cynthia! Why didn't you just tell her all this stuff?! Stop thinking up smart rebuttals after the conversation's over!\"</i> Cynthia stopped beating herself and sighed. She shook her head and looked up at the sky; judging by the position of the moon, it was nearing the late night, not midnight, but about two paces from it - she had to be well-rested, or else she couldn't be the best hero she could be. <i>\"Welp, better hit the hay too. Just another day before we get the cure and I gotta stop being big...\"</i> Cynthia got up and prepared to walk off to the barn to join Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second.\" Cynthia stopped as she put the words together in her mind. A nasty thought had sprouted in her mind, one so brilliant that someone could even call her an evil genius. <i>\"What if that cure never comes? Like, if I just got rid of the rock before Robin can do something about it?\"</i> A big goofy grin came over Cynthia's face as she continued thinking over the nasty plot. <i>\"Yeah! And then while I'm at it, I can make a whole bunch of people grow too, so we don't accidentally step on them, and we can make a big force to make the townsfolk accept us!\"</i> Cynthia bobbed up and down, shaking the earth a bit as she moved around in excitement. <i>\"Oh Cynthia, you are a friggin' genius! Let's see, who should I grow? Maybe Severa, Kjelle, Miss Cordelia, definitely Luci, aaannnddd...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia's excitement stopped for a moment as Sumia and Robin flashed in her mind, her smile dwindled as she thought about them. Was it really right to do something so devious and throw away the stone? Sumia and Robin obviously didn't like being big as much as she did, and seem very intent on finding a cure. Furthermore, what about all the people she forced growth upon? If they didn't want to be big, then would it really be right to rob them of their lives? Cynthia figured they could all create a new kingdom of giant women if push came to shove and then ally under Ylisstol, but then she'd have to think up how to run the culture of the race, and that took a whole lot of thought-work she didn't want to devote time into. Cynthia rethought over her nasty plan, and internally debated with her morals and her desires.</span></div></div>",

Maybe I\u2019m just lonely? I won\u2019t force the stone on anyone, but I bet there are others who want to be big to. Like Kjelle! She\u2019s all about getting stronger, and what\u2019s stronger than this? And I bet sis could enjoy it, at least if I talked her into it and maybe and Severa.. wait I don\u2019t think a giant Severa would be a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s no way mom would let me use the stone on them but maybe if I asked Tiki or got Robin\u2019s permission\u2026 Robin would never\u2026 unless she thought it was a tactical advantage or something! Hey maybe Robin could stay big and we\u2019d hang out together again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm.. a voluntary force of giants. Her mom would never approve of the idea, but if Robin truly though the realm was still in danger maybe she could sell the idea to her, and if that were the case it would be easy to convince Chrom and maybe Luci!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought filled her with excitement and she instinctively wanted to clap again, but quickly checked her surroundings. All was clear. Having to watch her every moment had been tough at first, but Cynthia was getting used to it, and the way slowing down had changed the way she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excitement suddenly drained out of Cyntha. She realized her time as a giant could be ending. For all she knew the messengers could be back the very next day with a cure, which would be great for her mom and maybe Robin but Cynthia could be back to begin a normal soldier and back to being a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to act before it was too late! Cynthia leaped to her feet, inadvertently rousing Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia where are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh uh...\u201d Cynthia was not good at thinking up lies, especially not too quickly. \u201cI just want to go for a walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia narrowed her eyes for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d She paused. \u201cWell, be careful Cynthia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe daintily stepped over the castle wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere could Robin have got to? She tried to remember where Priam liked to train. Or would Robin at her home? Or staying elsewhere? This could be tougher than she anticipated. Pausing to gather her thoughts, Cynthia still thought walking through Ylisse at night could be risky, and there was a good chance Robin wouldn\u2019t be there. Cynthia recalled there was a particular spot some-way Priam liked to train. It was semi remote, so Robin may have gone there if she wished to avoid others at  size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia set off, hoping her hunch was right. She thought of making a grand entrance, but realised the tactician would not be amused if one of Cynthia\u2019s heroic poses woke up her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tread carefully towards where she hoped they were, almost tiptoeing. Sure enough as she drew near she could see Robin lying down in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached carefully, struggling to keep cool. Was Robin asleep? It looked that way, as she came closer she could see  Robin holding Priam and Morgan agaisnt her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin?\u201d Cynthia called to her as quietly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin\u2019s eyes flickered open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia?\u201d She whispered \u201cWhat brings you here this late?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia held out her hands and stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry! I didn\u2019t wake you, did I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shook her head. She did not rise, turned ever so slowly, keeping watch of Priam and Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I was just doing some thinking before I went to sleep.\u201d She smiled and looked at her husband and son. \u201cThese two were tuckered out from the days training. Grima could come roaring by and I doubt they\u2019d wake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026 I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why are you here at this hour?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia pursued her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t found a cure yet, have you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. This is beyond anything even they know of. Tomorrow we will send a message to Tiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia held her fingers together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking\u2026 when you find a cure could you not cure me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know if our condition can be reversed, but do you really wish to life your life as a giant? I\u2019m sure you have noticed how lonely it can be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut without this I\u2019m just a normal soldier! Except people think I\u2019m a joke\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stood up and placed her other arm on Cynthia\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a capable fighter and a hard worker. Perhaps you spend too much time with your\u2026 flourishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia quickly corrected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeroic poses!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin ignored this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you were fine soldier and an asset to the Shepards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I know how to swing a lance.\u201d She motioned as though she holding a lance, even adding approite battle cries before Robin cut her off with a sharp glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t wake my husband and child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-But you said not even Grima could wake them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a figure of speech. Though at this size you could give a run for his money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I guess I could try grabbing his neck and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin raised her voice ever so slightly, but enough to make her disapproval clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t being literal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia stopped and stood rigidly straight, as though Frederick had told her to stand in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I was saying, you were a fine soldier, even if it seemed you didn\u2019t take battle as seriously as you should have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia raised her fists, though not in a threatening way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I gave it my all out there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so loud. And I do not doubt that, but when you are on the battlefield the slightest move can make the difference between life and death. That is why I did not always appreciate your heoric poses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they help keep everyone\u2019s spirit up, especially my own.\u201d Cynthia shivered a little. \u201cWhen we were in the future I needed something to keep us fighting when everything seemed hopeless\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. I believe you\u2019re learning to strike a balance. You are quite capable of protecting and inspiring people even at your normal size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia brightened a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter how much I train, they\u2019ll always be people better than me like Luci. She\u2019s way better at inspiring people and a better hero and no one ever thinks she\u2019s a joke!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all do what we can, Cynthia. When I make battle-plans, I do so knowing that every soldier will have a role on the battlefield, and that includes you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do so much more like this, inspire and protect so many more people. You said that we would always need soldiers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin rubbed her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true\u2026 though I hope humanity one reaches point when it isn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia stood taller, looking her dead in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut as long as there are bad people out there who would hurt the innocent the world will always need heroes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I agree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mom thinks that when you find a cure, I should shrink down because I might be dangerous to everyone. Could you tell her that maybe it\u2019s ok if I stay big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was silent for a moment, looking at Cynthia with those analytical eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few days ago I would have agreed with her. You are headstrong and prone to rushing in, and at this size, that is very dangerous. But I see you are doing your best to improve. Keep practising, continue approving yoru awareness and balance and I will speak with Sumia. Though you should have talked it out with her rather than gone behind her back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried but she wouldn\u2019t listen! I just thought it would be easier to talk to her if I had you in my corner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Was there anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was also thinking...\u201d Cynthia hesitated, though only for a second. \u201cIf this giant thing isn\u2019t so bad, how about we get others involved?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia-\u201d Robin started to say, but Cynthia was speaking very quickly know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean using the stone on anyone who doesn\u2019t want it! W-would I think of anything like that? I mean enlarging other people who would help protect Ylisse like Sis or Kjelle\u2026 I mean if they wanted it! We could make a special defense cabal or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin drew in a deep breath and exhaled, carefully considering what Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bold suggestion. Not something we can rush into carelessly, it would require planning and I would have to  talk it over with Chrom and Sumia but..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia\u2019s eyes grew starry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like the idea?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has a certain appeal. Though we would need to make sure we have the logistics to support giant soldiers, and that they would be both willing and not prone to abuse their new statures, so likely soldiers we already know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike the other Shepards!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps...\u201d Robin yawned. \u201cI am more tired than I realised, was their anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m good. Thanks Robin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Night Cynthia.\u201d Robin lay down again <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNight Robin! Thanks for the talk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling as though a weight had been lifted from her, Cynthia returned to the castle and slept outside it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sky was a bleak dusk, dark and shadowless as the dawn prepared itself to surface. The pitch-black sky was the perfect cover for a small group of wyverns &amp; a few Pegasi to sift through the sky with, all carrying upon them bandits of varying genders. The leader at the head of the pack was a rugged-looking, yet gangly man, clearly up to no good; he looked forward whilst addressing his caravan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, run this by me again:\" he spoke, \"My men were scared off by some giant lass near Ylisstol, right in the middle of the livestock smuggling operation?\" He glanced a bit back, taking care to keep one eye on the skies, and gazed upon a bandit, shaking a tad and face coated in a thin layer of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Boss.\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" The bandit leader faced forward again. \"With such a crazy tale, anyone would've thought you'd be throwing back a couple pints of ale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious Boss, I'll never forget how that lass dangled me from such a height, high enough to kill me; why, she could've swallowed me whole right on the spot she could've!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could've had your head rolling on the floor of our hideout if I'd wished it for a tale like that. You're lucky I'm such a believing man, what with all them zombies popping up around here from 3 years back.\" The burly man looked back at a female upon a Pegasus, armor a striking red like all deviant Pegasi riders. \"You got the goods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir!\" she cried, holding up a bag of staves. The leader gave a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then let's look for this 'little lady' and get back to our work.\" They flew for a while with the bandit leader hard at work looking across the land with a telescope. It took a bit of focus in the dark, but he took notice of a set of footprints pointed towards a farm. He traced them back into the walls of Castle Ylisstol, and eventually took note of the gigantic Cynthia, sleeping along the side of the castle; the sight surprised the bandit a bit, but he quickly shrugged off the surprise. \"Bingo, that really is a huge lass! Guess I had you sissies pegged wrong, but she should be no match for us.\" He took note of the sentries along the wall, noting how they were sleeping or lazing around, seemingly a product of peacetime in the halidom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go.\" he commanded as he pointed towards a forest enclosure near the castle walls, prompting his group to touch down, hidden by the trees. The leader climbed skyward with his wyvern and whispered a command in its ear, before leaping from its back and watching it fly the way it came from. The bandit unfurled a layer of cloth from his person as he fell; it formed a parachute when it fully went spread, and slowed the man's descent exponentially, allowing him to touch down within the castle walls, shrouded by the darkness. Quietly and swiftly, he made his way towards the border wall and knocked a brick, resonating a sound through the cement; in response, his crew had teleported in next to him with the use of a staff, fully joining the small band once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, those Rewarp staves do wonders! I ain't never seen anything like that on this continent!\" cried one of the lesser bandits. Immediately, the leader slugged him across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, do you want to get the blasted guard on us?!\" he whispered quite irritated. The lesser bandit bowed as the leader grunted. \"Alright now, let's take this freak out. Maybe while we're here, we can take some of the riches in the castle, that'll be a damned fine retirement plan.\" The group made their way towards Cynthia, hugging the wall and using the palpable darkness to their advantage. When they finally reached her, the group stood in awe at the scale of the girl, admiring for a short moment how a human could get so big in the first place; one bandit stood next to Cynthia's foot and rubbed his hand against it, admiring the softness of her skin in some sick show of pleasure. \"Stop screwing around!\" the leader softly barked, prompting the man to get back in formation. \"Now, use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman of the group nodded, and protruded a staff from her satchel. She pointed it skyward and yelped, bathing Cynthia's titanic frame in a soft white and blue light, a cold breeze coming from the magical discharge. Cynthia woke up upon feeling the freezing feeling, a little groggy; she tried to get up and stretch, but found she was unable to move her arms or legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? I can't move...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yell, and we'll scale you and cut your jugular.\" Cynthia's eyes shot open at the unfamiliar voices, and she found the group of thugs standing in front of her, weapons drawn in case anything went wrong. \"It's called a Freeze staff, it's from a foreign land lost long ago by time. They stop your movements in place and make you completely helpless; powerful stuff, but it's rare, so we made sure to stock up - never once did we think we'd be using our stockpile on this though.\" Cynthia took notice of one of the bandits before her, remembering him from the cattle rescue she pulled off earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" she cried, trying to lurch forward, \"You're that thief who was taking the cows!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good eye,\" spoke the leader, \"He's the guy in charge of the cattle rustling operation, one of my many money-making pet projects on this continent. And I'm his boss, the guy you screwed a good chunk of gold out of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, fiend?!\" Cynthia asked, trying to wriggle around, \"Your actions were hurting a farming family's finances! You better not go back to doing such dastardly deeds, or I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Squash us to a pulp? In case you haven't noticed lass, you're not exactly in a position to threaten us.\" The boss saw Cynthia's fingers starting to twitch, and he lifted his head in response, prompting his female comrade to use the Freeze staff again, locking Cynthia in place once more. \"And honestly, the cattle rustling is the thing you're most upset about? I'd have thought by our weapons and grouping, you'd have had us pegged for murderers and organized criminals already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All crime, no matter how small, is crime I can't ignore! A hero solves everyone's problems with a smile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's gonna suck for the city, cause they're gonna be out one hero.\" The boss turned to his other comrades. \"Raid the palace, take everything that's shiny and valuable, don't kill anyone, else you're gonna get the whole royal guard on our asses.\" The bandits nodded and ran off into the backdoor behind Cynthia, carrying some staves in tow. The boss faced Cynthia again, with a look of anger on her face. \"You could probably already tell, but we're going to kill you, far away from this castle with some warping staves we got; your body's gonna be quite a feast for the little beasties in the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll know I'm gone! And when Father finds out, he's gonna shove Falchion so far up your rear, you're gonna be throwing up Naga's blessing!\" The man's ears piqued with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah, back up; Falchion? As in the one the Exalt carries?\" A smug smirk came over the man. \"Well, that changes things, now does it? To think a freak like you is a princess! You're gonna make fine bank on the slave trade, that you are! Hell, I could probably find some guys who'd love to get a closer look at that chest of yours!\" Cynthia was getting angrier the more the bandit spoke, and spat back at the man with fury, her intent being to get as loud as she could without them noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? You think you're so clever?\" Cynthia asked. \"Well guess what: I'm not the only giant girl in this army! There's more of me, and we can easily get more giants too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got big somehow, I don't disbelieve you...\" The man gave a smug smirk. \"But frankly, I think you're bluffing me lass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's how it's going to go: You tell me how you got so big in the first place, and then we'll be on our way, off to your new home. Sound good?\" Cynthia scoffed at the bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't negotiate with villains! This hero's lips are sealed!\" In response, the bandit shot an arrow into Cynthia's pinky toe. \"<i>Augghhh!!</i>\" Cynthia tried to grab her foot, moving her hands forward a bit, and was quickly refrozen in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it again missy, and you'll get another arrow. I hate damaging merchandise, so work with me here, or else we're going to go back to the whole 'killing you' plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna-!\" Another arrow hit her toe. \"<i>Aaaahhhh!</i>\" Cynthia clenched her teeth tight. \"I'm not gonna talk, evil people like you deserve a nice, cold jail cell to reflect on your actions!\" Another arrow, another scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on girly, the dawn's gonna come up soon. Eventually, you're gonna get so many arrows in you that even a healing staff won't fix the ton of puncture wounds.\" Cynthia literally spat at the bandit, drenching him in a blob of saliva. His eye twitched in anger, he turned and faced his crew. \"Draw your bows and nail her. Three of you get the Freeze staves and keep watch with me for guards.\" On command, the small group started firing a massive volley of arrows at Cynthia, puncturing her skin in various places, deliberately missing her vitals in a torture-like manner. Cynthia felt tears begin to well in her eyes as she endured the pain, she knew that if she screamed loud enough, she'd be dead in an instant; she had to do something, but with the Freeze staff's effects on her, nothing could be done. All she could do is endure and hope her previous cries alerted someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please Naga, send me some help! I need a miracle!\"</i> Cynthia continued to endure the volley of arrow stings for what seemed like forever, waiting for help to come.</span></div></div>",

On some level she knew something was wrong but for all she knew it could have been a bad dream. Soon after she jolted awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia immediately got up and looked to where Cynthia was supposed to be sleeping, hoping it was just a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia?!\" Sumia yelled out, forgetting about the sleeping people around her. Guard's and sentries were roused at the sight and sound of their giant queen, but Sumia was too focused to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was gone. She gasped, almost screaming and nearly lost her balance, causing her to trip again, though stopped herself at the last minute. She placed a hand on her chest, trying to slow and stabilise her breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she's awoken early and has gone off to train or play hero.... no. I definitely heard something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia concentrated, harder than any time in her life, desperate to pinpoint where the sound could have come from. She couldn't pin down the exact location but it was definitely towards the forest. She ran towards it, heedless of anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CYNTHIA!\" She yelled, before running closer and trying again. \"CYNTHIA WHERE ARE YOU?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell before Sumia reached the bandits they could see her towering figure running in their direction, gaping up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...... the Queen?!\" One of them sputtered out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia smiled triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! I told you there were more of us! You better let me go before sh- I mean we crush you all to pulp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit leader folded his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that.  If there were truly an army of you, they wouldn't have sent just your mother to look for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia arched her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Urk she's still going to squash you flat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit leader sniffed, almost snorting at her boast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not likely. We brought you down we can do the same again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bandit leader looked to his goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your weapons on her throat if she says anything-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mo-\" Cynthia felt the prick of metal against the nape of her neck and shut herself up just in time. She bit her tongue to avoid yelling out. If she made the slightest movement she knew what would happen. She hated being in this situation, but right now it was all up to her mom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia drew closer, unaware of the lurking danger, continuing to call for her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia!\" She now see her daughter and vaguely make out the men at her daughter's throat.. She did not see those who hide closer to her and was struck in the knee by several arrows. She lost her balance and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia felt a deathly chill, like the harshest winter of and suddenly couldn\u2019t move. She tried to fight it but to no avail. The bandit leader took a step towards Sumia, though still kept his distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have here? The queen herself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia tried to stand up but could only move her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to Cynthia?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing yet, though that will change if you don't cooperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia's scrunched up as she continued struggling against the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother struggling, this is a freeze staff, I bet you've never seen it before it, as you can guess it freezes you in the spot, so no matter how big you you're helpless! Someone get to her throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia\u2019s mouth opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want from us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit leader smiled, enjoying his power over the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for starters, whatever made you so big. And you'll tell us or the princess gets it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia gritted her teeth. She couldn\u2019t let the stone fall in their hands, but she couldn\u2019t let Sumia die either.</span></div></div>",

She tried to run but was still being held in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit leader was starting to lose his patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia hesitated just a second long, before seeming to accept the terrible situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA secret weapon. A magic stone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Cynthia yelled, getting another poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia looked pained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI entrusted it to our Tactician Robin. She\u2019ll know where it is, to get it you\u2019ll have to see her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader looked at her suspiciously, reading her face for any sign of trickery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA magic rock? You expect me to believe that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould I really lie with my daughter\u2019s life on the line?\u201d <i>Though I might stretch the truth\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scrutinized her for a few seconds longer, before seeming to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where is this Tactician of yours?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe should be at the clearing half a mile from Ylisse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know the one. Good, let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave the orders and everyone was teleported there. As the rewarp stave was raised Sumia gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRewarp stave? I thought those were lost to history!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we found them again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light from the staff cleared, they found themselves in the clearing. In front of them was another giant woman. The bandits gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a giant to?! How many do you have?\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir leader cut the silence off with a wave of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough. Get some people on her neck then wake her, If this queen is telling the truth, only she will know where its kept. And if she\u2019s not the crowd will have some food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of his goons nodded and approached, weapon raised, only to be suddenly grabbed. The sleeping Robin awoke, and with just the slightest movement of her hand, so to did Priam and Morgan. Morgan was groggy eyed, but Priam looked ready for battle, immediately drawing Ragnell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit leader was surprised, but seemed amused rather than scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the Tactician awakens!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin grasped her would would be attackers and stood up slowly, allowing the her stature to sink into their minds. She glared down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemove those blades from your queen and Princess or I will crush these men like a handful of grapes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit leader shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do what you like, I\u2019ve got plenty of men, but you\u2019ve only got one queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam pointed Ragnell at him, looking ready to jump off Robin and charge. The effect might unnerve most men but the leader remained calm, meeting Priam\u2019s steely gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny of you move they get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStand down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut these villains they-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said stand down.\u201d She turned to the leader. \u201cWhat are your terms and what are you after?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour queen here told me you have some kind of magic stone that turned you into giants. Give it to me and I might let the queen go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin tried to appear as calm as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. I do not carry it on my person for this very reason but I can retrieve it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, go get it now! But I warn you if you try anything your Princess and Queen are going to get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin barely reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst I will inspect the Queen and Princess.\u201d This was not a request. She placed Morgan and Priam on the ground, while still holding the men she had captured and walked towards Sumia and Cynthia. The bandits cleared out of her path, like a parting sea. Priam and Morgan followed behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir leader flinched for just a second, but tried to keep control of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you try anything they\u2019ll get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sharpened and focused her best glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you do anything to either of them I will wipe you out to the last man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits quivered, even the leader. Though he tried to maintain his poise Robin walked slowly towards the prone royals,. observing the effects each of her steps had on the bandits. She glanced  almost casually at the men on their neck, then looked at Morgan for just a split second. She said nothing, continuing to look around the area and at the royals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? They are alive and if you want to keep them that way you\u2019ll bring me the stone now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin could see the marks on Cynthia\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to Cynthia?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe told her not to scream and she didn\u2019t listen. She still breathes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was silent. She gave Morgan and Priam another quick look then turned to the prone royals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader was losing his patience, and could sense some kind of trickery brewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin took a step towards the castle, then flung the bandits in her at hand at the goons on Cynthia\u2019s neck, knocking them over like bowling pins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on Robin, but she, Priam and even Morgan had been ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriam unleashed a shockwave from his blade while Morgan immediacy chanted something, holding a book he had kept concealed, sending a blast of wind at towards Sumia. Both attacks slammed the goon at Sumia\u2019s neck, knocking them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow!\u201d Robin yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for everyone. Sumia and Cynthia sat up, Cynthia eager to grab her earlier captors, while  Sumia swatted at hers.  Morgan chanted again and Priam gleefully charged into combat. Lacking a weapon, Robin made the best used of her size, stomping her way through the bandits, crushing as many as she could with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious to even the most dim witted that they were outmatched, and their freeze staves could not hold them all at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet us out of here!\u201d The leader yelled, running towards his staff users. Others followed, wishing to escapes the tide of destruction trying to make sure they were in the staves range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their victory, Robin hissed as they got away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsssk\u2026  I wanted to get their leader. If they have any sense they\u2019ll abandon their hideout but this may not be the last we hear of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got some!\u201d Cynthia said, holding up some squirming bandits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia ran to her daughter as fast she could, tripping in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia rubbed the wounds and tried to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine they just they just poked my neck a bit. Nothing some staves can\u2019t fix.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sumia got to her feet, inspecting her daughters wounds. Once the initial worry subsided, Sumia eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose bandits\u2026 were those the ones you told me about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I had no idea this would happen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin bent down to Cynthia,.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is why we do not let bandits flee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I put the fear of Nagi into them! Was I really supposed to stomp them flat? I mean sure there villains, but what about those ones who turn to it cause they can\u2019t find anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the very least you should capture them and bring them to the proper authorities, especially any of their leaders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia placed a hand on Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCynthia dear, I\u2019m not sure these heroics of yours are such a good idea. We both could have been killed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia raised her fists, holding them towards herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s all I have! I just got unlucky I scared away a group of bandits with so many staves! And if I hadn\u2019t helped that village, they\u2019d still be terrorising people!\u201d</span></div></div>",

The bandits Cynthia held stopped squirming, pacified by the fear Cynthia would mash them flat like their comrades, or do even worse to them. After what felt like a long moment of silence, only laced with the sounds of the giant women's feet lightly stamping the ground, Sumia spoke up to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly Cynthia,\" she began, \"What were you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was ambushed!\" Cynthia retorted, feeling a little offended, \"It happens to the best of us! Yell at the guards if you're going to yell at someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not raising my voice at you, nor am I talking about before. I refer more to the cattle incident from this morning.

Well, not totally, but I want to inspire justice!\" Ironically enough, while Cynthia ranted, she shook her caged hand around wildly, causing the captured bandits to fear more for their lives and one of them to hurl out the open end of Cynthia's bars of fingers. \"It's like, do you remember the story of Nohr you used to read to me? Well, future-you and present-baby-me? The princess Elise who got some evil pirates to change their lives? I want to be like her, that's a real hero right there, that she can inspire everyone through kindness of her heart and justice of her actions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Chrom's coming back tomorrow, so I'll let him know that when I talk to him. Keep in mind, he might still punish you, though lightly since we're at this size, for now at least, but we'll be normal soon with the ships back in port.\" Cynthia stopped moving, surprising Sumia as she tried to drag her daughter's hand. \"Cynthia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you still don't get it, I don't want to be normal again, I want to stay like this!\" Sumia shook her head, feeling weary of the repeat talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-uh! Don't you 'Cynthia' me! I can really help people like this! I can do things no other man or woman in the army can do! If I stay like this, I really think that I can make Ylisse a happier &amp; safer place to be - evil will be no match when the monolithic figure of Cynthia stands guard!\" Sumia was a little surprised Cynthia acted more abraisive in this talk, but she was ready to fire back like an overprotective mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what, Cynthia? Say you become a hero to Ylisse and an enemy to evil, then what do you do? Not everyone is nice in the halidom, I'm sorry, but that's just true; there's still prejudice against those who are different, there are those greedy who would seek to be like you, and then there are others like that bandit leader who could easily control you, or worse! It's just, I...\" Sumia tilted her head back and took a deep breath through her nostrils. \"I don't want to lose you! I don't care if you aren't truly my child of this time, you're still family! And it would break my heart to lose you! I just...\" Sumia was stopped by Cynthia's free hand touching her shoulder, stopping the waterworks Sumia almost unleashed. Sumia could see a fire lit in Cynthia's eyes, a bold courage, a look of a woman who made her choice and was going to stick with it - the natural borm eyes of a leader, the bloodline of the Exalted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, I want this. I can do this. Please, believe in me.\" Sumia shook to her very core at these words, it was the same fiery determination and born leadership that made her fall in love with Chrom all those years ago. The air was silent, then broken by a giggle from Sumia's lips. \"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sorry, it's just...That determination is another thing you inherited from Chrom. It's funny how eugenics work sometimes.\" Sumia broke Cynthia's grip and bowed her head. \"Okay, you win, I'll allow you to stay like this, Ylisse's first giantess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Yes! Woo-hoo!\" Cynthia jumped and pumped her fists, putting more fear in the bandits as they screamed at the velocity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all gonna die!\" a lanky one yelled. Cynthia scratched her forehead with her free finger and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, clumsy me, hehe! Sorry about that!\" She turned back to her mother, who continued to address her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want you going at this alone, so I will join with you as a giantess.\" Cynthia looked shocked, and immediately waved her free hand in disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, no no no no no! You have a family at home to raise Mother! A big long life ahead of you! How are you going to tend to the animals and hug your children at this size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I'll have to find a way to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, nuh-uh! Either you're getting small again or I'll, uh...\" Cynthia thought about it for a bit, she couldn't exactly use \"become small again\" as a threat; eventually, she snapped her fingers and pointed at Sumia. \"I'll go on a mad growing spree, making all the women I can huge, and then I'll punt the rock into the ocean!\" Sumia gasped at the devious plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would and I will!\" Sumia looked flabbergasted, but after a while, shook off the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Alright, no big me. I'll see if Robin feels fit to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Robin either! She doesn't want this at all!\" Sumia bowed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident! I swear!\" After realizing Robin wasn't there and she had basically embarassed herself to her daughter, Sumia cleared her throat. \"Yes, well, I still want to assign you a partner, so...\" Sumia thought it over for a bit, Cynthia joining in too, thinking about someone who wouldn't mind being huge. \"I suppose I'll just have to ask a favor from Cordelia, as a friend to a friend.\" Cynthia looked taken back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Cordelia?!\" she cried, \"Are you sure she'd be fine with that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. She's your Captain, right? You look up to her as a mentor just like she sees you as a student and a friend, so I'm sure that she'd be willing to do this for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't that screw up her family life though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cordelia has given birth to Severa quite a while back, she's almost as old as present-Lucina is now, I'm sure that it'll be easier for her to cuddle and play with her child than it would be me to the you of this time.\" Sumia leaned in close to whisper, despite no one around to hear them. \"Between you and me: Cordelia feels sort of a complex about being considered perfect, and she always wished she could've been a little taller, at least to put off her 'perfect stature'. I'm sure she'd sing &amp; dance at the chance to become a giant, call it my intuition.\" The mental image of Cordelia dancing &amp; singing while growing &amp; bursting out of her clothes entered Cynthia's mind, and it caused her to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Captain? No way! I couldn't see her doing something so goofy like that!\" Sumia winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been friends for a long time dear, believe me when I say I know some of her darkest secrets!\" Sumia clutched Cynthia's hand again with both palms, and held it up to her face. \"In any case, I'll let you live the way you wish, I won't stand in your way any longer. Just promise to me that you'll be safe.\" Cynthia shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, now and always! Thanks Mom!\" The touching moment was ruined by the bandits in Cynthia's hand, yelling and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great and all, but could you birds bring us into town already?! Some of us are freezing our knickers off out here!\" Cynthia bought her caged fist to her face and spoke gruff &amp; commanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough out of you, you criminals! You're going right to jail as soon as we get back! Hopefully there, you'll learn something about respect &amp; kindness to your fellow man!\" Cynthia looked fierce for a while, then turned her head to Sumia. \"...How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful, honey.\" Sumia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like a knife on a chalkboard...\" In response to the bandit's comment, Cynthia shook her fist up and down in frustration, like a child throwing a tantrum, causing the bandits to yell and grow sick. Sumia was quick to stop the arm from shaking, lest one of the bandits slip out and fall to their demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, sweetie, let's just get these men &amp; women into a jail cell, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if I got to deal with these guys anymore, I'll just...Well, I dunno what I'll do, but it won't be pretty!\" With that, the two girls continued the walk back into Ylisstol, feeling a breakthrough achieved in Cynthia's ambition.</span></div></div>",

Someone needs to watch over you, and I\u2019m sure when things settle down my life won\u2019t be so different. But I want you to be careful. No matter how big you are, you aren't invincible and there are dangerous people out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia lowered her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I get that now\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were silent for a few seconds, until Sumia giggled expectantly.

Were she not a giant, she would bounce on the spot, but she took more notice of the area around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey do you think sis will want to join us? That would be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not forcing this on anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I didn't say anything about forcing! We'll ask her.

Apart from that, all we can do is wait for Chrom and Lucina to return, though in the meantime I will attend my duty for queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia wrinkled her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Since we can't be sure when Chrom will return and the remaining bandits may search for you again, It's best you stay near the castle for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mommmm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but's. It might even be best if you rest, but you could practice your training drills. I'm sure Robin will be around later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia thought about arguing, but she suddenly realized how tired she was. She had been through a lot, and even after being healed by staves her body still ached. Some rest would do her good . She lay down and relaxed, her eyes growing heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed and gestured for Chrom to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 44 chapters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a summary. Start from the beginning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. Cynthia found a strange rock while training and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was as concise as she could manage, though told them of all the major events, including their run in with the bandits.<br>\r\nLucina straightened herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStones turning people in giants\u2026 staves that can freeze anyone in place, it\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays the time traveller to the mortal host of Grima.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom nodded, seeming to accept the bizarre situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is true we have seen stranger things than this..\u201d Chrom stared up  at his giant wife and daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough we will still need some time to adjust to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been hard for us to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it was tough at first, but now I like it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom turned Cynthia, now acting the stern father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s another thing, Cynthia you have been far too reckless, I don\u2019t know what would have happened to you were it not for Sumia and Robin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia lowered her head. Even though she towered over him, Chrom still had those fierce eyes. His ability to scold was almost on par with Fredrick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.. I just wanted to help but I promise I\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI talked to her about it to, dear. She\u2019ll be careful, and I\u2019ll be here to watch over her, as will Coredlia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCordelia?\u201d Chrom shook his head. \u201cNever mind that. Is there any kind of cure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia looked horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201cI don\u2019t want to be cured!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin spoke just  before Chrom could object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, along with Miriel and Laurent look into but have found nothing.

We\u2019re both adults, we\u2019ve thought about this and we aren\u2019t rushing into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about you\u2019re..\u201d Chrom stumbled, trying to think of the politest way of saying it in front of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia knew exactly what he was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you were going to say! And I\u2019ve been working on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. I have been teaching both Sumia and Cynthia to be aware of their enviroments. They have been practicing and have  both made remarkable progress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh! They  key is to take it slow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom relaxed a little but was still uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd tell me, as our tactician do you think this is a good idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe it is feasible, and I respect Sumia and Cynthia\u2019s choice. I believe they can do this, and we are not even sure a cure is even an option. Plus it will be good for <br>\r\nthe realm\u2019s defence.\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I suppose I\u2019ll have no choice but to accept. I can tell you will not be swayed, and if Robin is involved I trust your judgement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia pumped her fist in the ai and cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen leaned over to Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you wanna join us?\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina blinked, still in a state of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now please, your question?\" Sumia sighed, hoping that she wouldn't offend her friend, despite her true feelings on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know how you have a natural drive to protect others, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Cordelia trailed her words, trying to forsee Sumia's point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how you have that natural urge to teach others as a mentor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, well...How you've always told me you've wanted to be a little taller? Just a teeny bit, to offset your perfect stature?\" Cordelia could see Cynthia behind her mother, trying to stifle a giggle whilst bobbing up &amp; down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia, you're not asking me to turn myself into a giant too, are you?\" Sumia bowed her head in rapid &amp; hard motions, afraid her request had gone wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I know it was selfish to ask! Forget I said anyth-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Woah! Calm down Sumia, I didn't say no!\" Cordelia couldn't help but giggle as her friend halted her apologies. \"If you want me to, I'll  do it, it's no trouble to me! What kind of soldier denies a personal request from her leige? Besides,\" Cordelia shifted her head past Sumia's body, eyeing Cynthia's excited figure, \"I can see my recruit in the back there moving around in excitement, how can I say no to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Cynthia shouted in excitement. \"See Mother, you got nothing to worry about, so you can go get a cure for yourself and Robin, while the Captain &amp; I keep super-protecting Ylisse!\" Sumia felt a warm smile overcome her face at watching her daughter's innocent happiness. Robin however remained stoic, &amp; continued to question Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me if I ruin this moment,\" she began, \"But I want you to realize the severity of this choice. Food &amp; clothing would be scarce, prejudice against your size would come naturally from groups of people, and when we find a cure for this, if there is one, there would potentially no going back for you. Are you still sure about this?\" The weight of Robin's words &amp; truths crashed down upon Cordelia for a moment, but like a true perfect soldier, she showed no backing downin her expression, she stood tall &amp; rigid, unaffected by Robin's claims. Slowly, Cordelia sat upon a log and crossed her legs, cupping her hands over her dominant knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, let me tell you a story.\" Cordelia looked skyward as she tried to recount details of her tale. \"When I was young, my parents told me a lot of stories, the usual lot of tales; of Nohr, of Hoshido, other fairy tales of that nature, but one story stuck out to me as a child. It was a tale of a young child's quest to save a town from the moon crashing upon it; he scoured the four corners of the continent &amp; summoned the giants who guarded the land to push the moon back into the sky. Most children I played with emulated the young boy, always traveling towards another quest, but I always wanted to be like the giants - towering over everyone, danger always in my sights, protecting the one place of my birth from harm.\" Cynthia was clearly going wild over Cordelia's recount of her childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that's my Captain! I knew she got her true heart of a hero from somewhere like me!\" Cordelia giggled a little at Cynthia's commentary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, it's a little selfish-sounding, but I always did want to be bigger than everyone else so I could protect them. And, as you mentioned, Sumia, I am getting a little tired over people saying I'm the 'perfect height' in the Shepherds.\" Robin continued onwards with her facts &amp; inquiries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're fine with the permanent change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prejudice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I welcome it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The scarce resources?\" Cordelia sucked some air through her teeth, making a noise of slight discontent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lack of clothing bugs me a little...\" Cordelia referred to her flat chest, a complex that plagued her for her whole life, but nobody present needed to know about that. \"But I'll cross that bridge when I get there. I'll make sure ample meals are dealt to Cynthia &amp; I that won't starve the kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Robin stopped her inquiries &amp; folded her arms, giving off a slight smile. \"Well then, I guess you're ready to become a giant, forgive me for my nonstop questioning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Cordelia happily replied, giving a wave. Cynthia squealed and snatched up Cordelia, jumping up &amp; down happily with her in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yaaaaay!!</i> This is gonna be so fun! Just me &amp; the Captain - two giant maidens out on a quest to protect their home from evil! This rocks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia! Stop shaking!\" Cordelia cried as Cynthia kept on jumping. Upon these words, Cynthia stopped &amp; uncupped her hands, looking down at a dizzy Cordelia who looked ready to hurl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, whoops! I keep forgetting my own habits!\" Sumia looked over Cynthia's shoulder, down at Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for this, Cordelia. I honestly don't know how to repay you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" the red-haired knight replied, \"You can repay me by continuting to run the kingdom as you do. I'll get used to my new position quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's what I'll do.\" Sumia began to twiddle her thumbs, feeling another sensation of bashfulness overcome her. \"Umm, I don't think this is proper to ask, but that cure isn't coming along fast right now, so...\" Cordelia shook off the feeling of nausea and addressed her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time would work best for me to grow?\" she asked, almost reading Sumia's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Sumia bowed her head again; Cordelia was happy to know the title of royalty never got to her friend's head, but still wished Sumia didn't apologize as much. Cordelia looked her friend in the eyes and spoke her choice.</span></div></div>",

Though Cordelia barely moved at all and appeared as calm as ever, Sumia could feel a slight hint of excitement off her, though also some nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Cordelia spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 I am looking forward to this, but I want to be prepared.\u201d She looked over the giants. It\u2019s clear clothes don\u2019t grow with us, so do you have anything that could cover me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I had that opportunity...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia was flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go again...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.. yeah.. sor- I mean-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia laughed. Robin placed an arm on Sumia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it worked out.\u201d \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia took a deep breath, relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. And I\u2019ll check around the castle for something  to cover you with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia was satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso is there anything else I need to know about being a giant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin seemed prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur bodies possess even greater strength than you would expect from our size, however we are still vulnerable to enemy attacks. And unfortunately we can quite easily cause unintended destruction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia gnashed her teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds terrible! How do you manage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to pay attention to everyone and everything around you. The slightest wrong movement can cause harm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia tensed up. Cynthia panicked, feeling Robin was turning her away from using the stone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut hey! Robin taught us how to be super careful and watch our steps!\u201d Cynthia demonstrated, taking a few careful steps forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled, satisfied to see her lessons in action.,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d She faced Cordellia. \u201cAnd you are naturally very attentive and gracefu, so it will be easy for you to learn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia fidgeted with her hand, more nervous than thankful of the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia bent down to Cordelia, still holder her fists up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, if we managed it you should have a way easier time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia was uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re right...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just need some practice then you should be fine, as long as you keep your mind on what you are doing. Which I know you do very well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you think I can do this\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia soon returned with another Cheesecloth, placing it down in front of Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not perfect but..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will do. Alright, I\u2019m  ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia pumped her fists into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to her and Cynthia looked sheepish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you don\u2019t have to rush into this but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose your eager for more company?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are sure..\u201d Robin said. \"Cynthia, put Cordelia down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia did so and Robin retrieved the stone and placed it by Cordelia. Coredlia. ducked other the cheesecloth and derobed, leaving her clothes and armor just outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes!\" Coredlia said, picking up the stone. She  picturing herself as a towering giant and waited.  She felt a prickle and looked down at herself, expecting to surge upwards, but growing no more than a few centimeters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised the stone again, inspecting it while it lay in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia rubbed the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh heh.... Sorry I forgot to mention it actually took a few hours form to get this big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise for me and Sumia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026. \u201c Cordelia couldn\u2019t hide her disappointment. \u201cSo I\u2019m stuck standing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin\u2019s eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than running naked through Ylise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia crouched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd hey, we get to hang out together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia clutched the stone as she inspected it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anyway to hasten the process?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I know of.  But I don\u2019t fully understand the stone. Its possible keeping it close to you might speed up the process.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia grew a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I can wait this out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoo hoo!

Some are just barely shorter than the 60ft tall woman, but other trees manage to surpass them at 70ft, making them great hiding spots for the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Captain,\" Cynthia said trying to wait out the growth process, \"How's Severa doing so far? Honestly, I was worried when she, Inigo, and Owain headed out to that tree in Valm, only for them to never come back for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's doing well, Cynthia,\" Cordelia responded as she felt another growth spurt, \"She's matured so much the last time I saw her. Maybe a bit TOO much, because...\" She began to tear up, \"They grow up so fast...\" Sumia inched closer to Cordelia, making sure not to cause any noise that will give away their position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're strong enough to tell us, Cordelia,\" she assured her, \"Is there anything about Severa that changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...married, not to mention a mother like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! Severa has a husband?\" Cynthia said. She was surprised by this point, though to be fair, Severa was seclusive when it comes to personal matters. Inigo was bound to have someone accept him eventually, as evident by Peri, but Severa being a mother took her by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot believe it,\" she continued, growing a bit anxious, \"What's her husband's name? Name of her child? When did-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia, honey, this isn't the time for that,\" Sumia interrupted, not knowing Cordelia grew a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, guess I got too excited. Anyways, so how are you feeling Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia looked at the stone, or rather, pebble in her hand. She's currently at the halfway mark, though it's quite hard for the team to measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing well, thank you. I'll be honest, I'm quite eager to get to work at my new height. I hope you and I can protect the people of Ylisse once we find a way to reverse the process for Sumia and Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget about Lucy! She'll be joining us to fight crime once you're done growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina was staggered when Cynthia suddenly pointed her finger at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I made a deal with her that I will grow also after Cordelia's growth-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina was interrupted when something flew over them. Robin quickly looked up to examine it. One glance was all she needed to identify it to be a pegasus, coupled with some faint screaming. The pegasus landed in an area quite close to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's coming,\" Robin informed the group as she stood up, ready to take action, \"Get ready.\" Cynthia crawled her way to the forest opening, waiting for them to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until they heard screaming from that direction. Lucina walked closer to make out who it was, Falchion in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up, slowpoke!\" The voice cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm not as fast as you, right Severa?\" Another voice came out, this time masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I know that, mister perfection, so pick up the pace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina sheathed her sword, knowing who's coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Severa along with another partner.\" Cordelia's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" she realized, \"If she was on that pegasus, then that means-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOTHER,\" Severa greeted wholeheartedly as she ran past Lucina, \"I saw you while I was-ACK!\" She was startled to see Cynthia, Sumia, Robin, and Cordelia all 60ft tall, 40ft for Cordelia, \"W-What's going on?\" Meanwhile, the man that was with her caught up to Severa, panting as he slowed down. He had long, crimson red hair similar to Cordelia, and wore the clothes of a Pegasus Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Severa, you're quick,\" the man stated as he was catching his breath, \"I'm gonna have to train harder if I want to satisfy you.\" Robin grew suspicious and lowered her head towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just who are you?\" Robin questioned him as the others explained to Severa what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, sorry,\" he apologized, somewhat unfazed that the 60ft tall tactician is staring right at him \"I'm Subaki, one of the captains of the pegasus knights along with my mother-in-law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother-in-law?\" Robin questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did Severa not tell you? To be fair, she is a person who doesn't like to let information spread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're husband and wife, to put it short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Robin suddenly yelled, turning towards Severa, \"You never informed us that you're married to Subaki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was going to tell you guys eventually,\" Severa stuttered, \"But anyways, what happened next after you were attacked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group spent the next half-hour explaining to the two what happened. Deep in Severa's mind, however, is another stir of thoughts. She glanced at her 50ft mother. At that height, she'll do more work that she can. They were on par ever since she came back from another adventure, but now that Cordelia is huge, she cannot help but be irritated that she'll be bested by her mother again. A thought crossed her mind suddenly. She smirked as she imagined the possibility. Her expression returned to normal as Sumia rounded up the chain of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's it,\" Sumia concluded, \"We've been through a lot as you can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" Subaki commented, \"I'll get some of our pegasus knights to scout the area for the remaining bandits. Severa, what will you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's only one thing left to do,\" she replied while smiling, \"I'll be joining you guys, huge and all.\" Everyone, especially Cordelia, grew concerned as to what Severa was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa,\" Lucina informed her, \"You do know what will-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my clothes won't fit, I'll have to pay attention to my surroundings, etcetera. If my mother is going to be 60ft tall, then she'll need some competition, which will be me,\" she pointed out, \"I'll be fine, so there's no need to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia couldn't help but smile. Her daughter has been through so much, yet she still hasn't let go of her competitive side. At 60ft tall, she rolls the stone close to Severa for her to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dear,\" she confessed, \"There's no way we can change your mind, so pick the stone up whenever you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get the cheesecloth,\" Robin said as she stood up, \"Make sure to undress yourself as I go retrieve it.\" She left the forest to get the apparel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll be going,\" Subaki said, \"Severa, please be careful.\" She couldn't help but sigh. He's usually focused on his improvement, but never did he stop caring for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be careful. I'll see you soon.\" She approached her husband and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. She blushed as Subaki smiled before he leaves. At the same time, Robin returned and handed Severa the cheesecloth for her to put on. Robin also carried some extra cheesecloth for Lucina, and should they be damaged. Severa undressed herself and picks up the stone, smiling as she watched it glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia shivered slightly as she look at Severa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Lucina can be scary when she gets angry,\" she thought to herself, \"But now that Severa will be huge, I can't imagine how she will be.\"</span></div></div>",

Guard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's a better name than your silly Justice Cabal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't talk about the Justice Cabal that way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia sighed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia hung her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine, take your stupid rock.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw it at Lucina's feet. Cordelia placed an on Severa' shoulder, getting her daughter's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that it really matters, but if it's any consolation, you will probably reach our size before Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs inconsequential as it was, Severa couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina looked at the stone hestitatnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I just derobe and touch the stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh! You've seen Cordelia and Severa do it. Get under the Cheesecloth, touch the stone and wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina slid under and began derobing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's a good thing mother had so many of these.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia's eyes widened as a new thought occured to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have so many of them anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uhh.. I don't know. I suppose there useful to have around the castle. You can never be sure when they'll come in handy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia watched Lucina, waiting for that moment her sister would join her. Lucina picked up the stone, and Cynthia was sure she could see those extra inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could recruit all the Shepards! Her plans could come to fruition, without her needing to force this on anyone! After all with Lucina in this group, who wouldn't want to join?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA though occurred to her, would this make her giant hero status less special? She would  always be the first, but would that lose it's significance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reminded herself that being a hero wasn't about status, it was about protecting others, and who better to assist her with that than her comrades in arms? Besides with some giant warriors those bandits would think twice before messing with her again! Not to mention she'd never have to worry about feeling lonely again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill if Lucina turned out to be a better guard than her, where would that leave her? She tried to banish the thought but no matter she tried it still lurked in the back of her mind, coming back as Lucina continued to rise.</span></div></div>",

The space the group were in became cramp, so some of them had to take down some trees to make some more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmh,\" Severa moaned as she stretched to her full height, \"It feels so good being this tall.\" Lucina stood up to her full height, taking in the height difference between the trees around the entire group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit, it does feel good,\" she said as she she shielded her eyes from the sun, \"But remember, we must use this to protect the kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia looked at her sister. She couldn't help but feel envious as the thought of Lucina being a better guard loomed on her. She shook her head to get the nasty thought out of her mind. Needing a distraction, Cynthia looked at the ground beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" Cynthia thought as she saw something next to Lucina's feet, \"Is that...?\" She reached out towards the object and picked it up by what appears to be the hilt of a blade. She held it up to the sun to get a better view, only for her to be blinded as light poured out of the opening of the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NGH,\" she grunted as she turned her head away from the hole, \"Sis, look at this.\" Lucina turned towards Cynthia to examine what she was holding. Her eyes widened as she realized what Cynthia had in her possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Falchion?\" She questioned as she took the weapon from the hilt, \"It look exactly like it. Well, there's only one way to find out.\" She turned towards the direction where they came from and held Falchion with both hands. Everyone's eyes turned towards Lucina as she got into a battle position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, honey,\" Sumia asked her daughter, \"What do you plan to-\" Her question is silenced when Lucina cleaved the path in front of her. Many of the trees in front of her were sliced in half, surprising the entire group, including Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's definitely Falchion.\" Severa stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange,\" Lucina added, \"Why did it grow along with me?\" She thought about it for a moment until she heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina,\" the voice said, \"Did you do that?\" Robin glanced over to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Morgan?\" Robin stammered as she saw her son standing in the wake of destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, I'm fine. Father taught me to be prepared for anything.\" Robin contained her frustration, knowing that her son was in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she said as she picked him up, bringing him closer to her face, \"I'll take your word for it. But you're coming with me for now on until we get things sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, perfect,\" Morgan added, finding the perfect time to say what's on his mind, \"I came here to deliver a message from Chrom.\" Sumia walked closer to Morgan, hearing her husband's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did Chrom want to tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gave you all, including me, Soleil, Inigo, and Father, a skirmish to do. He said that it would be best if you all would get used to your current height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what's our mission?\" Severa asked the tiny tactician. Morgan skipped a heartbeat when he saw Severa, but quickly regained his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were some reports of some unusual activity in a nearby town, so he assigned us all to check on the place until further notice. Father went on ahead to skim the place.\" Morgan pulled out a map and held it up high so that the entire brigade could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's just down south from where we are,\" Lucina commented as she placed Falchion in its sheath that also grew, \"Well, it's time to get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Cordelia said, \"I'll go on ahead in search of our destination.\" She left as she waved goodbye to Sumia, who also waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Severa yelled, \"Don't leave me behind!\" She chased after her mother, knocking a few trees over in contrast with her mother's careful maneuver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our Severa,\" Cynthia sighed, \"Competitive as always.\" Who knew that the girls' first mission would be to protect a town from any suspicious activity? She was eager to arrive at the town so that she could drive off any villains that come close! But alas, that will have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cynthia,\" Sumia called out to her, \"We're leaving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" she responded, \"Hold on!\" She caught up to her mother as the group embark on their first mission.</span></div></div>",

Even her father would sing her praises when he saw it's battle applications. The war against Grima and the Shepherd's enemies would be a breeze. The only thing left to do now was to see how it reacted to human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew for a fact the hex worked as it was a success on the pebbles near camp. A human test subject would only confirm her hex's application. The only question was who to hit with it? She thought about using it on herself, but her mother forbade her from using herself as a guinea pig after her failed attempt at restoring her memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then thought about her big sister Noire. If she remembered correctly she had a pretty hardy constitution, and she was hexed constantly by their mother in the future and still functioned properly. She would be the perfect test subject. She just had that look about her. Nothing could possibly go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through camp she searched high and low for Noire. So far she hadn't seen heads or tails of her. She couldn't have gone into town as they always went together. So maybe she was out by the shooting range practicing with her bow? Yeah, that seemed the mostly place to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanneling her inner Tharja, she began to sneak through the camp and around the nearby shrubs. Morgan traveled deep into the woods until she came across a small clearing where she spotted the shooting range. Behind a tree she sat as she peaked her head around. There was Noire all by her lonesome shooting targets with her bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was perfect. She was all alone and unsuspecting. This would be as easy as beating Yarne in sparring practice.  Morgan reached into her coat's sleeve and pulled out her makeshift tome. She began whispering a small chant and channeled the power into her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while this was going on, Noire was busy trying to nail another bullseye. She never even knew her sister had just volunteered her to test her latest creation. Right as she pulled back another arrow to take the shot, she felt a bizarre feeling wash over her. She turned her head towards Morgan's position but saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps her mind was playing tricks on her...</span></div></div>",

That would be understandable, but with all the girls around Liliana was getting a little concerned.<br>\r\nHer fears were confirmed (at least to her), when she was wondering round Eurstia and saw Roy talking to Sophia. She didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, but the conversation seemed pretty animate.<br>\r\nLiliana fumed and sinked away. She thought about what she could do.<br>\r\nShe went shopping and found a magic shop. Browsing through the books she found one that caught her eye. It was a tome that could supposdly age her figure or something like that. She had never seen anything like it, but she was thrilled to find something like this. \"Wow with this spell Roy would be bound to pay attention to me!\" She said, picturing herself with a perfect figure.<br>\r\nShe bought the book and ran out of the shop. She hastily went to her room and cast the spell as soon as she could. She read the words several times. Even though Liliana was very skilled with magic, and had a lot of magical power, this spell seemed very diffacult for her. But she closed her eyes and concetrated as hard as she could.

Yeah. Shes resting in her room. Don't disturb her I'll bring some food up to her later\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" Marcus looked suspicious but let the matter pass.<br>\r\nAfter congratulating everyone and chatting, Roy brought some food up to Lilina while everyone else was eating.<br>\r\n\"Here you go\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\nRoy watched as Liliana quickly ate through her meal. She normally had a small apatite and ate slowly, so Roy was pretty surprised.<br>\r\n\"Erm.. can I have some more... I'm still hungry\" her stomach growled \" I think I need a larger portion\".<br>\r\nRoy brought her up another plate which she ate through almost as quickly. Lilina held up the plate and frowned<br>\r\n\"Woah you must be a gr-\" He stopped himself when he saw Lilina frowning more.<br>\r\nIt took several more portions before she was full and Roy was having to sneak food out of the kitchen to avoid raising suspcion.<br>\r\nLater Lilina lay alone in her room.

I hope I can find a way to cure this soon....).<br>\r\nShe lay there, tossing and turning but eventually she drifted off to sleep<br>\r\nShe awoke with a startle.

Lilina realised she must have grown to about twice her normal size.<br>\r\nThe thought struck her like a cold knife. She lay on her bed worrying for a few moments before she called for Roy.<br>\r\n\"Errmm.. ROY!.... ROY!\" She called, surprised at the loudest of her own voice.<br>\r\nIt was about a hour before the soldiers would normally wake up. Lilina hoped she hadn't woken anyone up, between her calling and the crash. Fortunetly Roy's sleeping area was close by, so it didn't take him long to arrive.<br>\r\n\"What ups Lil- WOAH! <br>\r\nRoy recoiled. Lilina gave a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?'<br>\r\n\"Ok keep calm.. lets think\" <br>\r\nThey thought for a moment.<br>\r\n\"I could go back to where..I..uhh this happened\"<br>\r\n\"Or we could go to a chruch. One of the priests of St elimine is ure to be able to help\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Lilina said with entuhisam.<br>\r\n\"Ok let me get my sword in case we meet any trouble.. and were going to have to find a way to sneak you out.\"<br>\r\nLilina frowned a litle but nodded.<br>\r\nRoy got his sword as quickly as he could, and checked to make sure the coast was clear. He got a large overcoat to cover(parlty) Lilina, which would at least draw a bit less attention.<br>\r\n\"Ok the cost is clear\" He passed the coat to Lilina \"Wear this, it will draw less attention\"<br>\r\n\"Ok\".<br>\r\nAs Lilina stood up, Roy couldn't helped but be awed at how large she had got, paritucrly her chest. Roy shook his head and cleaered his mind.<br>\r\nLilina put the cloak on and the 2 snuck out. Liina had to duck to get out of the room.<br>\r\nThey walked together to the church. Lilina felt self concious at the number of looks she was drawing but she tried to ignore it.<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, Lilina waited outside while Roy spoke to a preist. Roy told him that Lilina was under the  effect of a strange spell and asked the priest if he could fix it. The priest said he'd see what he could do and went outside. When Lilina removed her  cloak he was quite shocked. Lilina frowned.<br>\r\nThe preist tried every stave he could and looked fo rinformation in eery book he had, but it was to no avail. In the end Roy and Lilina thanked him for his time and left.<br>\r\nLiliana suggested a magic shop she thoguth might be able to help (the shop she had bought the book from).<br>\r\nThey set off for the shop. On the way Lilina grew agian. Roy now came to her thighs. Lilina looked down awkardly.<br>\r\n\"Come on, we have to get going qucikly!\" Roy said.</span></div></div>",

The sun starts shining down on the dew covered grass and the crickets start chirping less.  The morning becomes quiet and the two reached the magic shop.  Roy stops and looks at Lilina to see if she's okay.  At this time, his height reaches her knee.  Lilina's figure has grown from that of a fifteen year old girl to a fully blossomed woman.  Roy's who face is red as he sees the fully blossomed Lilina standing near him.  She holds her skirt down and blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilina,  You look so...good.\" Roy says as he looks at her figure.  He quickly regains his senses. \"Lilina, I'm going in to the store.  I want you to stay hidden while I request some assistance.\"  She nods and crouches behind the store for in case anyone sees her in public. Roy walks in and hears a small bell ring.  The place is filled with books, staves, and many healing medicines.  \"Hello?  Is anyone home?\"  He walks around a bit and sees a red-haired woman show up behind the counter. \"Welcome, my name is Anna.  I'm to runner of the store.  How many I help you?\"  \"Anna, have you had a girl with long blue hair come in here recently?\"  \"Let's see.  Blue hair you say?  It's been a while since...Oh yes.  I think she said her name was \"Lilina\".\" \"So this is the store.  Could you please step outside for me?  There's a problem that I need you to help me with.\"  Anna looks puzzled but follows Roy out.  Anna sees nothing outside and gives Roy a look of scourn. \"I'm sorry, young man.  But I'm a busy girl.  You can't just bug me with pranks like this this early in the morning.\"  \"But, Anna, Lilina needs you're...\" \"I'm going back inside.  Maybe there'll be a mature costumer to serve.\"  She starts walking back to her shop with her eyes closed.  After a minute of walking she notices that she hasn't touched the door yet.  She opens her eyes and sees a giant beautiful woman in front of her. \"Oh my Goddess!\" Anna yells out, \"What's happened to you?\"</span></div></div>",

Now she was so big, she could have Roy all to herself. And though he had tried to hide it, Lilina couldn't help but notice that Roy liked the way she looked. Normally these thoughts would seem out of place in Lilina's head, but now, somehow, they felt right. e forgot about Anna for a second  and accidentilly let go of her.<br>\r\n Anna screamed and flailed her arms, but ended up landing in Lilina now ample bossom.  Anna landed halfway in Lilina's cleavage.  She squirmed to try and get out.  Lilina laughed at the feeling of the squirms and remembered about Anna. Lilina put her finger on Anna's head and gently started pushing down.  \"Lilina, please don't.  I'll do anything you want.\" Anna begged.  \"Ah, and that's exactly as you're doing, little one.  I like your feeling and want you to be in there longer.\"  Anna screamed as Lilina pushed her fully into her cleavage with one finger.  Roy broke out in a blush as he watched Lilina push Anna fully into the cleavage and out of view.  Lilina could feel the squirms of the fully blossomed adult woman in her breats and fixed her dress front so Anna couldn't escape.  \"Have a nice rest, little one.\"  Anna could feel the large soft boulders around her.  The light was scarce and the room was tight but soft.  There was plenty of air and she had no trouble breathing.  It was like she was in a very soft bed and Anna fell asleep in her fleshy bed.<br>\r\nLillina leaned down, her smile widening to a mischevous grin  <br>\r\nRoy turned, notcing the large shadow over him.<br>\r\n\"H-hey what are you-\" Roy's compalints were interrupted as Lilina slowly lowered herself, then suddenly grabbed him with both her hands.<br>\r\nShe raised him to face level, still grinning.<br>\r\n\"-Doing..\".. Roy shook his head.<br>\r\nRoy was stunned for a moment, as Lilina turn around and started running. He soon spoke agian.<br>\r\n \"What are you doing?!\" He repated<br>\r\nLillna giggled. \"I'm just making hte most of the situation, I'm taking you somewhere private\"<br>\r\nRoy stared in shock. This was kind of frightning and so unlike Lilina.<br>\r\nLilina was stomping through the city, oblivious of the pannicing people below her. People were running and yelling and struggling to get out of her way, but she didnt notice.<br>\r\n\"Lilina this is crazy, you have to stop\" Roy spoke, trying hhis hardest to maintain a stern and serious voice \"And what about A-\"<br>\r\nRoy was interrupted by a violent shake. Lilina had sat down.<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" Lilina joyfully called.<br>\r\nRoy looked around. He could see a  large grove of trees around. Lilina had brought him to some kind of clearing.</span></div></div>",

You never pay any attention to me.\"  \"But, Lilina, I pay attention to you every day.\"  \"LIAR!  I've seen you talk with Sue, Lalum, Cecilia, Thany, and Guinivere.\" \"But Lil, they're part of our group and need my assistance during our campaign\" \"And that Sophia bitch.  She's been talking to you as if she were your bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looks down for a second and sighs.  \"I was asking her about dark magic.  My father told me about it for a long time before he died.  He always used to tell me how he and a handful of people took down a Dark wizard called Nergal.\"  \"Your father spoke of it too?  My father used the legendary Armads to take him out.  What did Sophia tell you?\" Lilina asked curiously as if she were her normal sized self again.  \"She told me that someone with dark magic can be very lonely and if they go uncared for, they get lost in power.  They forget who they are and their loved ones.  The mamkute also are weakened by the magic and Sophia's been sick.\"  \"Oh, I didn't know.  I thought she was trying to steal your heart before... *sob* before...*sob*\" Lilina sets Roy on her shoulder and starts crying.  She's always been shy and gentle.  She may've been a little rough earlier from jealousy or it may be from the effect of the magic that made her grow that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy feels sorry looking at the fully grown Lilina cry and walks up her shoulder and rubs her cheek.  \"Don't worry, Lil.  We'll make things right.\"  \"I just wanted you to notice me.  To remember I existed.  My father's gone and I don't know how to rule a kingdom.\"  \"My father's gone too.  But don't worry.  I'll help you in any way I can.  I'll make sure Pherae, Ostia, and you are safe.\"  Lilina smiles and grabs Roy.  He wants her to move him close to her face and she does so.  With him close to her face he kisses her bottom lip. She looks at him in shock and puckers her lips together and kisses Roy back.  \"Wow, Lilina.  That kiss was like magic.  And your lips tasted pretty good.\" \"Thanks.  Your body tasted good too.\"  Lilina looks away for a moment and looks back at Roy.  \"May I have a taste of you a little more?  I'd like to actually taste you.  I have to have it.\"  Roy looks shocked at her. \"WHAT?  What do you mean?\"  Lilina blushes and looks away.  \"I'd like to put you in my mouth and taste you.  I promise not to chew and swallow you.  When I'm done, I'll spit you back out.  Please, Roy?\"</span></div></div>",

But it's Lilina, so how bad could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Lilina.  But please be careful.\"  \"Careful is my middle name. *giggle*\"  Roy stands up as Lilina brings him to her mouth. She removes his weapons and puts them in her laugh to prevent her tongue from being stabbed.  She starts by licking him with her tongue.  Her large wet muscle rubs against Roy and he coughs on the saliva a bit.  She looks at him coughing and giggles at how cute he looks.  Roy thinks to himself, \"This isn't as bad as I thought.  Her saliva has a nice odor and her tongue feels so good on my body.\"  Her tongue pushes him over and she licks him some more.  After a few licks, she stops again and pulls her face away.  A trail of saliva flows down her cleavage and she hears a small cough from inside.  She looks at Roy with concern.  \"Are you sure you want to put me in your mouth, Lil?\"  \"Yes, I can't help it.  I'll be gentle.  I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that being said, she licks her lips and started tilting Roy into her mouth.  \"You're going to be so tasty, Roy.  Ahhhhhh.\"  \"W-wait.  Lilina.  Can we wait a moment?\"  He starts panicking and tries grabbing on to one of her fingers.  He fails to grab on to her fingers and plummets into her mouth screaming.  He lands on her soft, slimy tongue and tries to get to the lips, but she closes it before he even reaches the end of the mouth and leaves a small bit of her lip open so he can see easier in her mouth.  She starts stroking his back with her tongue and Roy feels comforted by it.  His back has been hurting from wearing his armor, wielding a heavy sword, and running into battle almost every day.  Roy starts feeling calmer and decides to accept his slimy fate.  Her tongue loosens his armor and massages his sore back.  With every caress of her tongue, he feels more comfort.  He thinks about how much better this situation is than he thought it was.  She shifts her tongue and moves Roy to the top of her tongue with his front facing the roof of her mouth.  She slams him into the roof of her mouth and he loses his breath a bit.  She does it a few more times and he starts screaming.  He tries yelling at her to stop, but his cries are drowned out with her saying \"Mmmm.\"  She enjoys the taste of her crush.  The Saliva level grows in her mouth and it covers Roy.  He chokes on it some and drinks some of it by accident.  He noticed that it didn't actually taste bad.  Lilina enjoys her tasty friend so much she begins to drool some more into her cleavage.  A small voice coughs again from her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilina moved Roy to the lip part of the mouth again and swallows the saliva.  She moves him to her cheek and starts sucking on him like hard candy.  Roy feels himself moved and looks up.  He sees teeth above and below him.  The teeth come down and starts pressing against him.  He feels the teeth on his body, but doesn't feel much pain because of his armor.  He thought she said she wouldn't chew and yells for her attention as the teeth come down on his body again and crush his vulnerary. \"Aww, no.  That was my last vulnerary.\"  Lilina moves her tongue around some more and swallows.  Roy watches the remains of his vulnerary go down her throat.  Lilina feels a strange taste in her mouth and pokes her tongue around to make sure Roy is still there.  He feels the tongue rub again against his slightly sore body.   She giggles and hums a tune as she enjoys her \"Sweet treat\".  She continues the methods of rubbing, licking, sucking, and chewing on her friend for about ten minutes.  After words, she lets out a sigh of satisfaction and spits out Roy onto her hand.  Roy coughs on the saliva and licks it off of his lips enjoying the taste of it.  Some saliva drips off the hand and into her cleavage a third time, this time without a cough, but a sound of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot noticing the noises from her cleavage, Lilina looks at Roy.  \"Lilina, that experience was beyond wonderful.\"  \"Thanks, Roy. You tasted so good.\"  \"Your saliva did too.  I thought you said you wouldn't chew on me though.\"  Lilina looks at Roy's armor dented with bite marks and blushes. \"Sorry.  I guess I got carried away.  Can you heal yourself?\" Roy reaches in his satchel, but remembered what happened in Lilina's mouth. \"Oh, I remember.  You ate my vulnerary.\"  \"Oh, sorry.  How about some of mine?\"  She reaches into her satchel and pulls out a huge brown vial.  Apparently, her books and items grew with her as well as her clothes. Roy falls over at the size of it. \"Woah.  Lilina.  It's as big as a fort.\"  \"Maybe a sip will make you all better.\" Roy walks over towards Lilina's other hand and sniffs the vial.  \"Ugh.  But it smells so nasty.  Nastier than the normal medicine.\" \"But it'll be good for you.  Open wide and say \"Ahhh\".\"  \"*sigh* Ahh.\"  Lilina gently tips the vial at Roy's lips and watches the medicine trickle down.  Before it reaches his lips, it stops.  She tilts it a little more and it suddenly pours all over him.  He's covered in medicine and his wounds heal.  She quickly takes it away.  \"I'm sorry, Roy.  I'm so sorry\" \"*Cough* It's okay. *Cough* My wounds are gone. *Cough*\" \"But you're covered in Vulnerary.  Here. Let me clean you off.\" Roy fears as he may be put in Lilina's mouth again and she's about to.  She thinks that the events would just repeat so she reaches in her satchel and takes out a vial of Pure Water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilina, that's Pure Water, isn't it?\"  Don't you need it for magic resistance?\" \"I think I'm immune to magic as is, Roy.  Now stand still.\"  She tips the water onto Roy and he feels comfort as the medicine washes away under his waterfall.  She takes away the vial and smiles at him.  Roy looks up at Lilina's bright and shining smile, but with a dark sky above.  \"Lilina, it's getting to be night time, Should we eat or should we head in?\"</span></div></div>",

I'm pretty hungry.\" She holds her stomach and looks at Roy. \"Oh no...I'm not going to be a meal for you, Lil.  No matter how much you beg.\"  \"I wasn't going to say that.  Even if I did want to eat you, then I wouldn't have anyone to care for.  I was only going to say that you should get some meat for us while I get fruit.\" \"Wait.  Why should I get meat if you can do that easilly?\"  \"Because you're too short to get fruit, Little Roy\"  Lilina lowered Roy to the ground safely and gave him back his weapons.  The two went in opposite directions and agreed to meet up at the same spot.  Lilina marked the spot with one of her magic books.  Lilina was tall enough to easilly pick the fruits from the trees nearby.  She looked for a place to put them and besides her satchel, she saw nothing.  She picked up her skirt a little bit and put the fruit in her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Roy was wandering off on his own.  Roy thinks about the army he left behind.  They must be worried sick.  As he was lost in his thought, he heard a roar.  He hides behind a tree and glances around.  He sees a bear.  With the ammount of meat it had, it would probably be enough to feed someone of Lilina's stature.  Roy waits patiently for the bear to come patiently.  He uses a bird call to lure it closer to the tree.  As he sees the bear coming around the tree, he pulls out his sword and stabs it in the chest.  The bear lets out a death cry and falls easilly.  Roy pulls out his sword, wipes the blade on the sheath and puts it away.  \"Now how am I going to move something this big to the meeting spot?\" Roy thinks.  The only logical way to bring the dead bear to the meeting spot is to carry it on his back.  He picks it up from his behind and lifts it by it's hind legs.  \"Ooh.  I hope Lilina enjoys this.\"  Roy grunts as he carries the bear away.  Luckilly for him, then tongue massage that Lilina gave him really made his back feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy got back to the meeting spot and Saw Lilina sitting there in the moonlight with fruit in her skirt.  Her gaze at the moon was one of beauty.  She looked like a goddess pondering if there's anything greater than her own beauty.  Roy gathers some twigs and puts them in a pile.  He builds a small tray to hold the bear as it will cook on the fire.  \"Lilina, I got the meat.  Are you ready to eat?\"  \"Boy am I ever? Let's say we cook it with a Thunder spell.\"  Lilina picks up a Thunder tome and starts reciting the words. Roy starts panicking and shout at her.  \"Lilina, are you nuts?  That would send this whole forest into a blaze.\"  Lilina quickly drops the book and apologizes. \"Oh, I'm sorry.  How about Elfire?\"  \"No! Lilina, that's even worse.\"  Roy panicks again and Lilina laughs out loud. \"I'm only kidding, Roy.\"  \"That wasn't funny, Lilina.\"  \"Lighten up, Roy.  I'll use a small Ember spell from the Fire tome.  It should be enough to start a normal fire.\"  She chants the words to the smell and some large embers fall onto the stick plantation.  The fire starts in almost no time at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two watch the bear cook and listen to the crackling.  \"Lilina, what kind of magic do you think was in the book you read?\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"It could've been an anima spell that made you like this, a light spell written from the goddess Elimine herself, or a dark spell that would make you lose yourself.\"  \"I know for sure that it wasn't dark.  I think it was a light tome.\"  \"How so?\"  \"Well, I was looking in a shop of tomes that might make me better at...certain things.\"  \"Certain things?\"  \"Yes.  I found a tome with bright white on it.  It's name said \"Beauty\".  I thought it would make me more beautiful.\"  \"I can see it worked.  You look simply beautiful.  Before you grew, you were cute.  But now, you're...stunning.  Your beauty is so divine I could stare at you longer than the moon and the stars.\"  Lilina breaks out in a blush and giggles.  \"Oh, Roy.  That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.\"  \"I think that the spell was written by Elimine to any girl that wished to share the beauty she had.\"  The two sat there quietly for a while after Roy said those words.  \"I think the meat's ready to eat.  May I go first, Lilina?\"  \"Yes.\"  Roy cuts off a leg with his sword and starts eatting the meat. \"Go ahead, Lilina.  I hope it's enough to fill you.\"  She reaches down with her big beautiful fingers and picks the bear up.  She pops it in her mouth and crunches on it happily.  She swallows and savors the juices that remain in her mouth.  \"Wow, Roy.  That bear was delicious.\"  \"I know.  When I went hunting with my dad, we always hunted for bears.  Their meat is delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy finishes his meat and they're both still hungry.  \"So, Lilina.  How did your fruit search go?\"  \"Oh, that.  I got plenty of fruits.\"  She tilted her skirt onto the ground and a mountain of fruit slid down.  \"Wow, Lilina.  You did a good job gathering these.\"  \"Thanks.  Let's eat.\"  Roy grabs some fruit and starts eatting it and Lilina scoops some and pours it in her mouth.  As the fruit falls in her mouth, some of the fruit falls between her boobs.  The sound eatting comes from her boobs, but Lilina pays no attention at all.  The fruit quickly vanishes an the 2 are still hungry.  \"Well, Lilina, that's all we have.\"  Lilina frowns and reaches into her satchel.  \"Well, Roy.  I was saving this for a special snack, but I take it that a situation this special for us calls for it.\"  Lilina pulls out a cake loaf, pinchs a small piece and puts a piece down for Roy.  Roy looks at it and sees that it's big enough to be a normal cake for a wedding.  \"Wow. Lilina.  This cake is so delicious.\" Roy says as he bites into the cake.  Lilina chews on it happily and plenty of crumbs big enough to be cupcakes fall down her cleavage. A voice speaks out \"This cake is better than any I've ever had.  Maybe being down here could be paradise.\"  Lilina looks around thinking she's heard something.  \"Did you say something, Roy?\" \"I just said it was delicious, Lilina.\" The two finish their bread and half a loaf is left.  The two yawn and look at each other.  \"Lilina, that was the best meal I ever had.\" \"Me too.  I think it's time we sleep now.\"  Lilina leans her head back against a tree and back on the ground.  She glances at Roy in the same situation and frowns.  \"Umm...Roy?\"  \"Yes, Lilina?\"  \"You look uncomfortable.  If you'd like, I could let you sleep on my breasts.\"  Roy blushes as she says that. \"What?  Lilina.  Why would you--\" \"Because I care for you, Roy.  I'd do anything to make you happy.\"  She picks up Roy and sets him on to of her bosoms.  He lays face down on her chest and sighs in comfort. \"Wow, Lilina. Your breasts are softer than any bed I've been on.\" Lilina giggles and pats Roy's head with her fingers.  Seeing him comfortable on her boobs makes her feel comfortable against the tree.  \"Goodnight, Royfriend.\"  \"What'd you say, Lil?\" \"Oh, nothing.  Goodnight, Roy.\"  \"Goodnight, Lilina.\"  The two drift off to sleep in comfort.  Even the forgotten passenger Anna is enjoying her her bed of breast flesh.  They all fall asleep as the song of crickets fills the night sky.</span></div></div>",

Wrte on as if tis the way you ike, ill change it)<br>\r\n Meanwhile, in a dark and stormy castle in the country of Bern, An impatient King grows tired of failure after failure.  A soldier's footsteps can be heard through the dark and quiet castle.  Water drips from the walls and the ceiling.  The smell of mold plagues the walls. The fire in of the torches lights the hallways as a woman approaches them.  His footsteps grow louder through the hallway.  The door in front of her creaks open slowly as a bright light shines through the door.  He walks into the room as organ music is played.  The room is well lit and the king sits there with a scowl on his face.  The door shuts hard behind him as the music comes to an abrupt stop.  The organ player stops and King Zephiel takes his head from his fist. \"Sire, The wyvern spies have spotted Roy to the west without most of his army.\"  Zephiel sits up with his usual scowl.  \"Then why do you bother me instead of finishing him, you little insect?  Do you know the punishment for telling me useless news?\" he said with an annoyed voice.  The soldier started shaking as his king already grew annoyed with his prescence plaguing him.  \"But, your Majesty, there is something strange near him.  One of his familiar units is a \"Giant Girl\".<br>\r\n\"What is this? A giant  girl? Surely you jest?\"<br>\r\nThe figure tremblemed while he was kneeling  on the ground.<br>\r\n\"M-ma lord, I do not, Roy was seen with a giant woman, I swear.\"<br>\r\nZephial slwoly walked over the mssneger and raised the messngers head with his hands, staring into his eyes.<br>\r\nHe could see the fear in his eyes. After a moment of silence Zephial spoke<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.... I see that you are telling the turth. Very well, find out whatever caused this and get back to me. That is all.<br>\r\nRoy slept peacefully on his companion. They awoke the next morning.<br>\r\nRoy was the first to wake, he strecthed his arms and sat up, surprised at how pleasant his sleep was. Suddenly the ground beanteah him seem to move and become unstable. He realised what was happening, Lilina was waking up!<br>\r\n\" Wah!\" ROy as Lil rolled a little, Completely tthorwing Roy off balance. He went tumbling and would have fell a lot furhter, save for quickly grabbing a piece of Lilina's clothe He Sturggled to hold on..<br>\r\n\"Hey watch it Lilina!\"<br>\r\nLilinana looked down, dazed from sleep and somewhat sheepish.<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry Roy\" She place her hands ounder where Roy was, and let him fall onto her palm.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Roy landed gently. It actually felt quite nice.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but please be more careful next time\"<br>\r\n\"Ok\"Lilina said looking a bit embarssed.<br>\r\n\"So.. What are we going to do?\"  Roy asked in his usal serious tone<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Lilina answeared lightly<br>\r\n\"Well... your still huge and I dont know what else we can do to fix it. Neither the church nor the magic shop you went to were able to help.<br>\r\nLilina giggled.<br>\r\n\"What so funny?\"<br>\r\n\"Fix it?\" Lilina laughed \"Why would  I want to fix it? Being big is GREAT!\" Liliana bounced, thogh not hard engouh to drop Roy.<br>\r\n\"WHAT? WHat do you mean?\".<br>\r\nLilina raised Roy up to her smiling face.<br>\r\n\"Its fun!\"<br>\r\n\"Bu-\"<br>\r\n\"Persides, think about what I could do at this size! I'd be a hugehelp...no pun intended. Seriously though, look at how large and storng I am, and if my magic ha sincreased with my size, think of how easily we could rout Bern's forces!\"<br>\r\n\"Well.... I dunno...\" Roy though for a moment.<br>\r\n\"Anway!\" Lilina said, putting Roy down, lets go get breakfast!<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, not another another bear...\"<br>\r\nLater, after Roy and Lilina had breakfast.<br>\r\n\"Erm.. I'm feeling rather dirty, so I'm going to bathe, ok? Stay here.\"<br>\r\nRoy nodded.<br>\r\nHe waited. And waited. Quite some time passed and he wondered wether he should go look for Lilina. But on the other hand, he wondered if he would be intruding on her.</span></div></div>",

To make sure she's not being hunted by perved bandits or anything.\" Roy grabs his sword and walks quickly in the direction that Lilina went. He hears the branches cracking under his feet and some humming the farther he walks. The more he walks, the louder the humming becomes. After hearing the humming get even louder, he sees large piles of clothes in front of him. He sees boots, stalkings, a dress, her choker, her cap, and her bra and panties. He looks at her clothes for a while and is surprised how big she's gotten. Every part of her had grown, even as her body matured. Last night she appeared to be 40 feet tall. Now it appears she's grown 10 more feet. He decides to walk past the clothes and a noise catches his attention. He looks over at the clothes again and sees Anna moving around in the clothes. \"ANNA?! Oh my Goddess! Are you alright?\" Anna yawns a bit and sees Roy staring at her. \"Oh, it's the young boy from yesterday. How are you?\" He climbs up the dress to talk to her more directly. As he climbs the dress, he stops for a moment and catches a stench on the clothes. It's the scent of Lilina's skin. He puts his face into her clothes and inhales. The smell to him is sweeter than any perfume he's smelled on any noble woman that's visited his castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped back to his senses and greeted Anna. He gave her a hug and broke out in tears. \"Anna! I'm so sorry we forgot about you. If you need to go, now is the time.\" She hugged back and they stopped. \"Silly boy. I though it was bad at first, but I actually enjoy being in her boobs. I've had plenty of air, food, and water...well kinda...while I was in there. She's matured much more since last week. She's even bigger than me.\" Roy breaks out in a blush and shakes it off. Anna breaks out in laughter at teasing the young lord. Roy blushes and tells her \"We need to get Lilina down to normal size. If we don't get her back to normal size, she'd have quite an appetite, accidentally hurt many people, and become a more open target for danger.\" Anna stopped laughing hadn't thought of that happening. She reaches in her pouch and pulls out a book. \"I see. If that's a case then I need to find a spell in here.\" \"What book is that?\" \"This is a reversal magic tome. It's magics can only be performed by those who are thought of when the original spell was cast.\" \"Cool. Now, how long until I can get her down to normal?\" \"I don't know. This book is pretty old. It's text is in a thick font and the book itself is thick. There's many pages, but I'll try to find you the spell.\" \"Okay. I'll check on Lilina and keep her occupied. But please hurry.\" \"I can only go so fast.\" \"Thanks, Anna.\" He slides down Lilina's clothes pile and walks closer to the humming.  \"Wait!  You don't want to see her.  She might not forgive you for seeing her like that.\"  Roy stops walking and thinks things through.  \"Yeah.  You're right.  She'd probably never forgive me.  Thanks, Anna.\"  \"Wait, young man.  What's your name?\"  \"I'm Roy.  Roy of Pherae.  I'll be the marquess someday.\"  \"Well, Roy.  I think it'd be wise if we went back to the meeting spot.  I'd like to talk to you some more.\"  Anna slides down the dress and they walk back to the meeting spot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this about your dream to being a marquess?\"  \"Well, my father was a marquess and so was my father before him.  I want to be strong enough to protect not only Pherae, but one day protect Ostia too.\"  \"Ostia?  But isn't that where Lilina....Oh! Does little Roy have a crush on big Lilina?\"  Roy blushes as Anna teases him once more.  \"Both of our lands have been hurt badly in this terrible war.  Once I stop Zephiel, I'll make sure that noone ever fights like this again.\"  Anna is surprised at Roy's amibition.  Such dreams for a person as young as him and actually going through with it is something not many people would do.  The two make it back to the meeting spot that's marked by one of Lilina's books.  They both sit down and Anna searches in the book for the growth reversing spell.  After a while of waiting, Lilina finally shows up again carrying her boots and stalkings.  Her clothes seemed tight and smaller on her.  Apparently, her clothes didn't grow when she was bathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilina, did you have a nice bath?\"  \"Yes, Roy.  The cold water was refreshing.  But for some reason, something feels missing.  But I can't seem to remember what.\"  Lilina gets ready to sit down.  Roy looks at Anna and sees she's about to be sat on. \"Anna, Move out of the way.\" Anna lowers her book too see Lilina's butt coming down towards her. \"Eek! Lilina!  Stop!  It's me. Anna.\"  She tries to get out of the way, but it's too late. Lilina's cushioned rear lands on Anna face first.  Anna feels the flesh wrap around her and she tries to get out.  Luckilly, just like the cleavage, she had plenty of air and was in no harm.  \"This spot feels unusually comfy.\"  Lilina shakes her butt into the ground and relaxes a bit.  Anna squirms and mumbles under her butt.  Lilina feels ticklish down there and begins to laugh as she presses her rear into Anna more.  \"Lilina.  Get up.  You're sitting on Anna.\"  Lilina quickly gets up and apologized to Anna.  \"Ah! I'm so sorry.  Are you okay?\"  Anna gets up and pats the dirt off of herself. \"Yes, I'm fine.\"  Lilina glance at Anna and tries to remember if she's seen her somewhere.  \"I remember you.  You're Anna the shoppkeaper.  How'd you get here?\"  \"Don't you remember?  You stuffed her in your breasts.\"  \"Oh, yeah.  I remember.  That's what was missing.\"  Lilina started reaching for Anna and suddenly felt a sharp pain.  \"Oww.\"  \"Lilina, Are you alright?\"  \"Yes, I think so, Roy.  But my feet hurt.  I've been walking a lot yesterday and they hurt like mad.  Could you and Anna please massage my feet?\"</span></div></div>",

We'll massage your feet.  I sure hope you're not ticklish.\"  Lilina lays back against a tree and stretches her legs out a bit towards the 2 and they reach Anna and Roy.  They cover their noses from the stench but they don't smell as rancid as they should.  \"Roy, do we really have to rub her feet, Roy?\"  \"Yes.  She needs all the help she can get right now.  And besides, I'm sure we can enjoy this as much as she is.  So let's help out.\"  \"You're right.  She needs our help and it can't really be all too bad.  Can it?\"  Roy takes Lilina's right foot as Anna takes the left.  They start rubbing Lilina's feet and Lilina lets out a loud shriek.  She starts laughing as the 2 people rub their hands up and down her feet.  Her feet have always been sensitive and to her right now, this is more like they're tickling her rather than massaging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna suddenly feels her walled surface coming down towards her.  She screams as the giant foot comes down onto her and presses Anna to the ground.  Anna feels her boobs being pressed closer to her body by Lilina's foot gently compressing her body.  Anna struggles as the big toe plays with Annas face some.  Roy rubs slower as he sees Anna being compressed by Lilina's big beautiful foot.  \"Lilina, stop!  You're pressing Anna.\"  Lilina looks over at Roy and presses him to the ground too.  \"I'm sorry, guys.  But this is feeling so good on my sore feet.  Please keep rubbing.\"  She lessens the pressure on the 2 and lets them continue rubbing.  Roy can't help but smell Lilina's foot as it's right on top of his body.  It reminded him of the same smell of Lilina's clothes from earlier.  Roy pushes the foot up some and massages it harder.  Lilina breaks out laughing again from the ticklish feeling from it.  Lilina still has Anna pinned to the ground but lessens the pressure more as Roy massages the foot harder.  Anna continues her best to try and massage the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilina puts both of her feet pointing back up again and lets Anna massage her foot better.  Lilina continues laughing from the ticklish feeling and the 2 people constantly lose their grips and slam their bodies into Lilina's feet.  This causes Lilina's feet to feel better, but Anna and Roy to be covered in Lilina's scent.  After a while of Lilina's foot massage, Lilina pushes the 2 back with her feet and stands up.  \"Tee hee.  That feels much better.  Thanks, guys.  For that, I think I'll give you both a little reward.\"  She leans down towards Anna and picks her up by her shirt.  She flails around as Lilina brings her up towards her face.  Lilina stares at the struggling little woman and smiles.  She opens her mouth and starts licking Anna's body.  Anna screams and chokes on the saliva of Anna's mouth.  She swallows Lilina's saliva and smiles. Lilina drops Anna into her cleavage and reaches down towards Roy.  She picks him up by his armor and brings him to her face.  \"No thanks, Lilina.  I don't feel thirsty, nor do I need a massage.\"  \"Tee hee.  Alright Roy.  How about this?\"  Roy's eyes open wide as he fears what would happen to him.           She brings him closer to her face and gives him a kiss.  Roy's surprised at this reward and kisses her lips back.  She drops him into the cleavage like Anna and she tightens  her dress.  Her boobs squeeze together with the 2 people inside.  There's plenty of air and plenty of light.  The massive mammaries feel soft on the 2, albiet tight.  Anna and Roy don't have too much room and are forced to hug each other in their confined flesh prison.  Lilina looks down at the 2 in her breasts and giggles. \"I'm going for a walk.  Enjoy the ride, you two.\"  She starts to walk and feels the 2 people in her chest.  Anna and Roy try to remain calm as Lilina's boobs shake and swing around.  \"Anna, while we still have time, continue looking for that spell.  We can't risk anyone else seeing Lilina like this.\"  \"I'm on it.\"  Anna starts skimming through the books.  Lilina skips as she hums a tune down the now smaller road.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> As Lilina walked down the small road, she was completly oblivious to the fact that there may actually be people who take this road. And some of these people may not handle a giant girl(well now a giant woman thanks to the slight aging affects), it could even include a old friend of Roy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A bow and arrow was pointed at Lilina's head from the point where the road divided down two paths. It was a good 800ft. away. But would quickly be passed by the giant humming Lilina within a minute. \"This beautiful giant creature must be a weapon of Bern.\" Walt, Roy's friend and a archer of Pherae. How could he know that this older, blue haired girl was Lilina? He readied his bow to strike at her forehead. Her heart was protected by the giant dress. And he wasn't sure how thick it was. 'It could be thick enough to stop a swarm of bows. So the best option is to strike the skull.' He concluded in his mind as he fired a single shot at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The arrow moved at lightning speed, striking its intended target as she walked unkowingly closer to it. \"Ow!\" Lilina called out as the bow slamed into her head. But instead of piercing the soft skin, the arrow instead shattered into a thousand pieces. The impact too great for the arrow, but not for the giantess. And so she fell down, the impact of falling sent the entire land through a massive earthquake. Trees nearby fell over and animals fled, with birds flying off in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whoa!\" Walt cried out as he felt from his hiding spot and slammed face first into the dirt. He rose up, frustrated and shocked. \"My arrow didn't work! But that's impossible! It's strong enough to pierce four generals in a row!\" The young archer said in awe as he saw the giantess rub her head. \"How am I going to stop her? And why does she seem so familiar?\" He had nothing but a gut feeling that was telling him that she was someone he knew. 'But I don't know any giant women.' He thought as he watched her. She was less than 300ft away. And she could easily spot him from there. Quickly the young archer hid himself between the trees. He wanted to see how she reacted before he did anything to determine her allegiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both Roy and Anna felt the impact as they shaked between their mammary prison. \"What do you think just happen?\" Roy asked Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No idea.\" She told him as she layed much more comfortable inbetween the breast flesh. Lilina was still growing. So that gave them more room as she grew bigger. But still, she was more worried about what was happening outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lilina finished rubbing her head, the sting of a mosquito bite still causing a little bit of pain. \"Dang! And here I thought nothing bad would happen.\" Lilina thought as she stood up to her full height. Her towering form overshadowed the land, and Walt couldn't help but be amaze by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lilina looked around, hoping to see her attacker. With no one along the roads, she knew what she must do. \"Whoever did that must come out or suffer the consequences!\" Lilina commanded as she slammed her foot into the ground. A monstrous earthquake could be felt by Walk as he fell over again from the sheer impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'No other choice.' He thought as he watched her. So stepped out from behind the trees and stood in front of the giantess, his miniscule form looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lilina looked down at him. And then she spoke like some mighty war goddess. \"...</span></div></div>",

Some of them expressed surprise at Lilian\u2019s size, but they greeted her and apologized for not saying anything.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s arlight, my appearance is pretty shocking!\u201d She said with a wink and a smile.<br>\r\nLiliana stood up.<br>\r\n\u201cAttention Lycian alliance! With my new size and strength I will lead us to victory! No Bern Soldier cans tand against me!\u201d <br>\r\nTheir was a cheer then people started walking away or talking. Lillina raise Roy to her face. Her face alone was about as big as Roy.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for sticking up for me Roy.\u201d Lilina said with a tender smile. Roy blushed a little<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, I know your still the same sweet girl I know.. even though I fit on our palm..\u201d<br>\r\nLiliana kissed him, covering his entire body, and with such intensity that she nearly swalloed him by mistake. Roy flushed.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Roy<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You'll be such a large target for them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I can take it!

Roy rolled over until he found a good spot and shut his eyes. Lilina looked down at him, and smilled. She fell asleep soon after, leading to a good night's sleep for both of them.  The morning light hit Lilina, so she woke first. She sat up  and streched , inadveritingly shaking him awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, is it morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! We have a big day ahead of us\" She giggled \"Pun not intended\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do for breakfast?\" Roy said, trying to fight his sleepiness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll just do what we did yesterday. We should get going while everyone else is having their breakfast\".  Roy yawned \"Alright..\" He was somewhat dreading having to do this again, but he knew it was neccesary.  Lilina went to the food storage to gather herself and Roy some food. It didn't take long to finish their meal, but there wasn't much food left in the storage. Lilina stretched after the meal. \"Ok lets check back on the others!\" Lilina said enthusitcally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to do this? You could expose yourself to a lot of danger out there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm sure, we can win the war much faster this way.. don't worry I'll be careful.\"  She scooped Roy up and walked over to the HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok is everyone ready?\" Roy asked to the troops.  The troops were prepared but confused as to what their plan would be. \"What are we going to do?\" One soldier asked out.  Roy was about to answer but was cut off by Lilina.  \"With my size, we can easily make a strong attack on the forces at the north! They don't know this has happened to me so we should be able to strike when they aren't expecting it! I've been talking with Roy, and don't worry, I won't do anything rash, are you ready?\" She spoke out.  The army was moved by her words and marched to the north.</span></div></div>",

They outnumbered the Lyicans slightly, but at odds the Lyican Alliance had been to win at before.   \"Roy, enemy forces up ahead!\" Lilina said, picking Roy up so he could see.   \"Ok there aren't too many of them, this might be a good test battle, but don't do anything reckless\" Roy looked down at the rest of his troops \"Ok everyone, we have a secret weapon on our side, but don't be careless. Is everyone ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillina kept close until she was near the enemy, then she charged. <br>\r\nAs she emerged through the clearing the enemy soldiers stared up at her with shock and disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the name of the the Goddess....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the soldiers were stunned, Lilina cast a Thunder spell into the clearing, not sure how powerful it would be. <br>\r\nA huge thunderbolt struck the clearing, releasing a massive surge of light. The bolt was more than 10 times its normal size. When it cleared, their was a large smoking crater and a large portion of the enemy were dead. The remainder stared in awe and fear before.... \"RETREAT!\" They ran away.  The power of the spell surprised Lilina herself.   \"Wow that was pretty easy..\" Lilina said \"I didn't know the book granted so much magical power....\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You should be careful\" Roy cautioned \" If any of our allies were in there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess a lot of power means a lot of responsibility...\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Lyican army caught up.  \"Wow Lilina you were great!\" Wolt cheered.  Lilina smiled \"Thanks! Let's go and deal with the forces up ahead!\".  <br>\r\nLillina easily routed more of the Bern forces, thunder spell would either wipe them our or force them to retreat, so Lilina targeted her spells where it would kill the least amount of soldiers, but scare away the most. Things were going well until some archers shot her on sight. The arrows didn't hit her vitals but the pain made her yell out and staggered back and fell over. Fortunately no one was directly behind her. Roy felt the impact as her body shook when it hit the ground. <br>\r\n\"LILINA!\" Roy yelled as he climbed up \"LILINA ARE YOU OK?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, I was  just thrown off by the pain\" Lilina said, not sounding too hurt, but a little embarrassed \"Don't worry\".  She cast a Thunder in the direction of the archers.  \"Could someone heal me please?\".  Saul and Ellen ran to her and used their staves, while the rest of the army protected them. Saul couldn't help stare at Lilina for a few moments.  \"Thanks\" Lilina said, getting on her feet.  Once they were sure no other enemies were around, Lilina dusted her clothes off. <br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.. I guess despite my size, I'm not used to taking hits on the battlefield....\" <br>\r\n\"Don't worry Lilina,  we can win if we all work together.. but please remember your not invincible\" Roy said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess I learned that the hard way.. and now Bern might know it to, but we can still clear them away!\" </span></div></div>",

The army halted.  \"What is it?\" Lilina asked.  \"I think I should fight on the ground in front of you. You were lucky before that no other enemies came near you after you had been shot, but if your caught off gaurd and there's no one to protect you, the results could be disatrous\".  Lilina thought about it for a moment, and realized Roy's logic was sound.  \"Ok\" Lilina placed Roy on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll ride on your boot, since it will allow me to keep pace with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilina nodded, and they journeyed on.  Over the course of the day, Lilina scattered regiments with her magic, Roy guarded Lilina's front, the clerics attended to Lilina when was wounded, and the rest of the Lycian army covered the area around them.  After along and successful day, they had routed more troops, and captured more territory than they would otherwise have done in several weeks of campaigning. But now everyone was getting tired from all the walking and fighting.  \"Ok, today has been a great day\" Roy said to everyone \"Lets setup camp for tonight\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the army had brought provisons with them, but Roy and Lilina had to go hunting and foraging in the forest again. While they eating and talking, they heard a muffled voice. They were unable to figure out the location at the first, until Lilina looked down to her breasts, reached in and pulled out Anna.  \"Anna?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you forgot about me! I yelled and yelled last night and you didnt hear me! I fell asleep and found you were off to war the next day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops sorry about that..\" Lilina said sheepishly \"We leave you here if you want..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is goodness knows how many miles from my shop! Well I suppose you are working to free us from Bern. Maybe I could help you with some spells and you drop me home afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, what do you think Roy?\" Lilina replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for the incovenience, but you could be a great help to us. Are you sure you don't mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I was annoyed at first, but I can see what your fighing for is worthwhile... you better buy a whole lot of stuff when we get back..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilina laughed, Roy extended a handshake \"Sure, and welcome aboard.. have you been ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked more before going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere. A messenger of King Zephial was reporting.  \"So you found the book that was used.. this news pleases me. Now deliver it to Brunya\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrunya scanned the book quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I better go outside for this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrunya stuided the book carefully, then started casting. Because of her experince, she had an easier time than <br>\r\nLilina. The spell took some effort and focus to cast, but she was able to manage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir was a flash of light, and she felt a surge of power going into her, then she felt her self rising up, as though ascending into the sky. The ground seemed to move to move away from her, her hair lengthed, her limbs <br>\r\nextened. Her breasts swelled, pushing against her robe, and part of her skirt tore from the speed of her growing legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This should be complete soon, then I will be able to stop the Lycnaian alliance)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roy, Lilina and Anna slept well once more.  Morning came. Roy and Lilina did their usual foraging, then met up with the others.  Again the Lycian alliance had an easy time clearing out enemy troops.  All was going well, until she saw another figure in the distance.. the same size as her.  \"So the alliance is here at last..\" Brunya said, stepping towards Lilina.  \"Another giant mage?! How is this possible?\" Lilina exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Brunya, one of the three Dragon Lords.. the tome you found was not unique and I was also able to draw out its power. As Zephiel's prized magician it is up to me to stop you.\" Brunya assumed a combat stance. \"Everyone get back!\" Lillina gestured, and everyone drew back, Roy reluctantly so. The 2 Sages faced each and  near simultaously cast Thunder at each other. Their was an  incredible flash of light as the 2 massive bolts struck the area, cindering much of the land.  They were both thrown back, though Lilina seem more singed and considerbly more hurt. \"Ahhh!\" She cried out in pain. Brunya barely winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite skilled.. but you lack the years experience and training I have. Surrender to Bern and Zephial may spare you\"<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"N-Never!\" Lilina said through the pain. She realized Brunya was the better mage, so she rushed at her, hoping to overwhelm her physically.  Brunya grabbed her arms calmly, and the two titans wrestled. They pushed against each other and spun around, trying to gain an advantage. They struggled for a few moments but Brunya gained the edge and pushed Lilina down to the ground.  Lilina struggled against her, trying to get back up but it was to no avail.  \"Goodbye, mage\" Brunya said, tyring to keep Lilina while about to cast another spell.  \"LILINA!\" Roy screamed, running towards Brunya as fast as he could \"Anna! ANYONE! DO SOMETHING!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna frantically flicked through her book, Saul and Ellen tried a sleep stave, and Wolt fired an arrow that lodged into her arm. She  gnashed her teeth in pain, but quickly regained her composure.  Lilina use the short distraction to get to her feet and the 2 wrestled again. Wolt couldn't fire another shot without the possiblity of hitting Lilina.  Lilina was getting pushed back again, and soon thrown to the floor. Brunya put a foot on top of Lilina so she wouldn't break free. She started chanting when Roy slashed her other leg.  Brunya cried out in pain and her concentration was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy! Get back! Its too dangerous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let anything happen to you, Lilina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrunya quickly raised her foot over Roy. Roy struggled to get out of the way in the time, he dodged as fast he could, but it was such a wide area he was still crushed by the side. He had avoided the worst of it but was injured.  \"ROY!\" Lilina screamed in a mix of concern and rage.  With a burst of adrenaline, she siezed the moment and tackled Brunya. The two rolled around until Brunya was on top. She held her down with one hand.  \"Now to finally end this..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna! Someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was still searchin as fast as she could.  Some of Roy's bones were broken but he forced himself forward, and took a desperate slash, striking Brunya's arm. She snarled at him, and back handed him, knocking him back.  Brunya was chanting.. but so was Anna.  She readied an Elfire over Lilina but was distracted by a strange sensation.. the ground was moving closer and she felt like energy was being drained out of her.. both Lilina and Brunya were rapidly shrinking! Wolt fired an arrow at her, and this one hurt a lot more.  The rest of the Lycian army ran forward and surronded Brunya as the 2 mages shrank down to human size.  Roy clutched his side \"Its over Brunya.. surrender or we'll be forced to act\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I guess I have no choice.. at least your giant mage is no more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilina got to her feet and raced to Roy.  \"Roy! Are you ok?\" She said, hugging him. She was still a head and a half taller than him, so she smothered him slightly.. though it wasn't completely unpleasant.  \"Mmf!\" Roy said.  Lilina loosened her hug enough for him to speak.  \"I'm ok.. though I could use a little healing\"  The 2 clerics healed Roy and Lilina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was fun being a giant but I guess Anna did what she needed to do..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm just glad your ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Anna.. sorry about before!\" Lilina waved at her sheepishly.  Roy thank Anna profusly and the allaince celebrated another victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Roy and Lilina were by a fire, still talking about what happened.  \"All's well that ends well.. You have given us a huge advantage....no pun intended.  Because of you, we captured several portions of terroity and we routed several of Bern's key forces and captured one of their elite generals. We still have some battles left, but I think we're on our way to peace\"<br>\r\nLilina smiled \"And I may not be huge anymore, but I'm still more powerful than I was before! I think im definately on par with a Sage!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 settled off to sleep soon after. As Roy lay against Lilina, Lilina wondered if she would ever tower over the trees or hold Roy in her palm again. She smiled, and drifted off into a dreamy sleep.. </span></div></div>",

Although the first few months have been rough, its king and queen, Alm and Celica-once Anthiese-, have plowed the way for humans to take their first steps in a land without the need of gods, with the Brotherhood of Knights aiding the commoners and nobles alike. No matter where the duo goes, people always see them with their personal weapons, Alm with the divine sword Falchion, and Celica with the Beloved Zofia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what journey do these two face now? After sealing away an alchemist's creation in Archanea, deep within the Thabes Labyrinth, it seems like there's nothing left for them to do. After all, there's nothing that can top the gods of old and man's greatest creation...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica rises from bed, clearing her vision from the strands of red hair covering her face. She looks on the other side of the bed to see her husband still sound asleep. All she could do was smile as she got out of bed and walked over to the bathroom to change her clothes. As she removes her nightshirt to reveal her red bra and undressed herself, Celica began thinking back to when the whole team returned to Furia Harbor after exploring the labyrinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss,\" an old man politely asks her, apologizing for interrupting her travels, \"I'm sorry for interrupting you, but by any chance you are heading to Valentia?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" Celica responds without giving any hints of her royal lineage, \"Is there anything you wish to share with me?\"<br>\r\n\"Consider this only a rumor, but I heard of a spell that grants women like you immense power,\" he shares, \"I have heard it from sailors, but I do not believe them one bit. Besides, if such a spell existed, would we not have learned of its existence already?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I suppose so,\" she agrees, \"But they are only rumors. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.\" With those words, Celica ran off to catch up with the others, swearing she could hear Alm calling to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why is Celica thinking of that event two years ago? Maybe curiosity got to her. As she stepped out of the bathroom in her titular outfit, she decides to visit the nearby city and see what the market has in store as she waits for Alm to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the street, she waves to the folks, both commoners and nobles, with grace and dignity. People have always thought she was a reincarnation of the past goddess Mila, but such comments have always made her blush. As she takes her time looking at what the market has in store, she decides to visit a library to see if they have anything new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library is small, yet it still proves to be an effective studying spot for both scholars and mages. Either way, Celica decides to read into the spells she has learned to pass the time as she waits for Alm to wake up. As she was looking through the books, she came across a peculiar book that the Brand reacted to. She takes out to book to examine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" Celica told herself as she examined the cover, \"No author, no cover, bot even a title. I'll have to check this out myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica walks out of the library and sits on a bench close to the entrance. She was allowed to keep the book for herself, as even the librarians did not know of the book's existence. As she got seated, she opened the book to examine further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Text is in this,\" she thought as she went through the pages, \"What is this book...ah! There's a spell in here. Let's see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Celica begins chanting the text, the Brand on her palm begins to glow brightly. Once the light died down, Celica stared at the book.<br>\r\n\"What just happen-\" Celica questioned until a light headache descended upon her.

Surely some nation would have utilised such a spell were it possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flinched. For a second the brand on her hand felt like it was burning, and even as that passed it seemed to throb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica instinctively took a step back and looked around, even as she rose. It was fortunate she had not yet reached the castle and that no one was around her she gasped. Was there anyway to stop this magic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, the growing seem to have stopped. Was this a coincidence or was it through her action? Celica concentrated trying to shrink herself down but nothing happened. She dared not cast the spell  again, lest she grow even larger. She wondered how the people of the castle would react. She could hear shouts and clamouring now. She hoped her friends would recognise her, but what of everyone else? Would they still see their queen Anthiese ? Would they see a monster? Or perhaps even a reflection of the goddess Millia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing was first, she had to get Alm. She stepped closer and called for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alm!

Meanwhile, soldiers were scrambling for their weapons, captains were gathering their squads, and yet none of them know that the one outside is their very own Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at this point, one thing was clear for Anthiese: her husband was elsewhere. Not wanting to cause any further panic, she walked away from the castle in search for him. Each step she took shook the ground, leaving a fine footprint in the soft earth. Feeling something was off, Celica turned around to see the footprints she was making. All she could do was cover her mouth and gasp at the amount of destruction she caused from just a few steps. Nevertheless, she pressed onward for the safety of the people in the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica thought to herself on where Alm could be, being careful where she walked to minimize any further damage. Maybe he went to train as he waited for her to come back? Could he be on a skirmish? Or maybe he went towards the city in search for HER? After all, he still needs to know how to properly rule a unified country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts stopped when her right palm containing the Brand began to glow. Celica's eyes widened as she felt her palm throbbing.<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" She desperately thought to herself as she looked at the brightenes Brand, \"Please, I don't want to grow again! This height causes enough damage as it is!\" However, the throbbing seemed to point her in a certain direction. Celica's eyes widened: could the Brand possibly lead her to Alm? She didn't have much of a choice, she needs to confront with Alm about this and the book as soon as possible. She allowed the throbbing to guide her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed to be a few minutes, the throbbing subsided.

Make way for your king and queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a parting of the sea, people stepped aside, allowing her to pass.

As she was walking, she could swear she heard some people murmuring about her, leaving her a bit uncomfortable. A young girl did offer Celica a bouquet of flowers to cheer her up, to which she accepted. Maybe she was being too hard on herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here,\" Celica told Alm as she lowered him down towards the entrance, \"I want you to look for a book with no cover, author and title. The librarian should have it.\"<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Alm responded, \"I'll make sure to let her know.\" He opened the doors and entered the building in search of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica stood back up and took the time to examine her surroundings. If she were to be honest, it felt kinda cramp being in the city. Most of the building barely even reach up to her knees, and the top of the library she was standing next to was only at the 3/4 mark up to her waist. She was lucky that the balcony back at the castle reached her crotch, yet the highest tower could only barely reach her navel.<br>\r\n\"I'm so tall,\" Celica thought to herself, \"It's making me nervous even thinking about it. All these innocent people have to interrupt their daily lives just so that I could get a path to the library. I'm taller than my home for crying out loud! I don't even want to think about combat-\" Her eyes widened as she though of that word; she began quivering and was forced to sit down and bring her knees close in, minding her surroundings, of course. Combat. Now there's something she wish she hadn't thought about. Even her shoes are big enough to crush a person or two, now Celica imagined the chaos if she used the Beloved Zofia or her spells at her height.<br>\r\n\"Celica!\" The familiar voice rang. Celica turned her attention to Alm who just got out of the entrance with the book in hand. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Celica had to recollect herself after the mini panic attack. \"I-I'm fine, Alm. Just some self-reflection.\"<br>\r\n\"You sure? It looked like you saw a ghost.\"<br>\r\n\"I said I'm fine! Just...get on my hand.\" She extended her hand towards him, to which he promptly jumped on to. As Celica stood back up, she reviewed her surroundings once again. She could see all of the people waving at her, giving her all of their trust. She couldn't help but smile back and waved at them with her free hand. Maybe she was overreacting, and besides, there are some pros for being 100ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we heading?\" Celica asked her husband as they made their way out of the city.<br>\r\n\"We're heading back to the castle. I want to check on something before we make any further plans.\"<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, the librarian told me that before she found the book on the seat you were at, she saw a bright red glow.\"<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that my height is connected to my relation to Mila?\" Celica concluded as she looked at him. All he could do was nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Celica,\" Alm asked as he spotted something peculiar on the ground, \"Those footprint that are leading towards the city: are they yours?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, say Alm, how was your morning today? What made you decide to go to the city?\" Celica nervously laughed as she tried to changed the subject, only for Alm to sigh at her attempts. Nevertheless, he decided to ignore the \"mysterious\" indents in the ground, as the two made their way to Zofia Castle.</span></div></div>",

Celica did rack her brains thinking of something but drew a blank. Millia was gone, there was no one else she could think of that could help and she had no choice but to wait for Alm. She thought back on her journey. If she was facing Terrors or pirates her size could prove a boon to her and her allies, a single spell from her could wipe out a fleet of ships or clear a graveyard but here her size would cause nothing but trouble. She wished there was something she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, Milla, Alm, Saber, Conrad. She might have lead her group but she was always depending on someone else. She had always relied on others. Maybe this is why she took Jedah's words at face value? She nearly lost her life, her soul for words and could have killed Alm were it not for Millia's intervention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over her shoulder, waiting for any sign of him. How long would she have to wait? For all she knew it could take hours and that was assuming they had an answer to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On second thoughts did her size have to be a curse? Maybe it could be another gift from Millia. Although Duma and his faithful had been stopped and the lands had been united, the people were still being ravaged by bandits and pirates, although the knights did their best they couldn\u2019t stop them all, but with her new found power maybe she could, or at least put the fear of Millia into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose to her feet and strode south, her steps filled with new purpose.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Perhaps the most scariest part about Celica is that she has the strength to protect herself. Even before she was struck with the spell, she was know to be as strong as Alm. Now that she's 100ft tall, Celica could only imagine how strong she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't remember how long she was walking, but eventually, she found something that caught her eye: a large group, probably no more than 15, were stalking a trader. The team was quite balanced, consisting of some mercenaries, archers, and brigands.<br>\r\n\"Bandits,\" she thought to herself, \"Most likely up to no good. Let's see how my size affects their decision.\" She began by raising her foot and quietly planting it on the ground. While it still left an imprint on the ground, it made little tremors so that the bandits are not alarmed. She repeated this process for every step she made. If she were to be honest, this felt kinda fun. It always reminded her of the times when she was young in the castle, playing games with Conrad. But right now, this isn't a game. This is a serious problem that she needs to resolve. As she got closer to the group, she drew the Beloved Zofia carefully from its sheath. She's in top condition, all her spells are ready to go, and her blade is well-sharpened. She can see her shadow covering the entire group; she's on top of them. They'll HAVE to listen to her; she's Anthiese, the Queen of Valentia, now 100ft tall. There's no way they'll deny her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits see the trader stop to count for his supplies. Everyone was ready to ambush him. That is, until something got their attention<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Celica told them as she stood up straight. To her, it was like telling someone to stop what they're doing; to the bandits, it felt like an explosion. The rogues turned around to see what who interrupted them. To say they were surprised to see a 100ft girl looming over them is an understatement. Even the trader stopped and looked at the queen in awe.<br>\r\n\"I am Anthiese, the Queen of Valentia. If you know better, I suggest you cease your plans at once.\" Just to the point, short and sweet. Hopefully her intimidating size helped in getting the point across...<br>\r\n\"Sorry, girl, but you shouldn't be snooping into other people's business.\" One of the bandits retorted.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what makes you think we were going to commit a crime?\" Another one followed up. This got the crowd rallied, ready to retaliate should she make any sudden movement.<br>\r\n\"I know you're up to no good,\" Celica responded by pointing her massive blade towards the group, \"If you let down your arms and leave the trader alone, then I'll let you live for now.\" The bandits began looking at each other and began conversing, making gestures and what not. Celica began to smile a bit. Maybe she can negotiate peacefully at her height...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until a sharp sting struck her right cheek. Celica quickly turned her head towards the source of the pain, only to find an archer with a Steel Bow in hand. Instantly, her hands began to clench as she turned back towards the bandits, this time armed with Silver weapons and Devil Axes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you refuse to make peace...\" Celica murmured as she sheathed her weapon and began stretching her gloves, \"Very well. Then fall.\" She raised her right hand high and began reciting the incantation for a spell. At the very moment, the army of 15 began to disperse. The magic circles began surrounding her, and with a wave of her hand, the circles began to disperse. The first spell she casted? A great bolt of lightning struck where the bandits once were. The electricity managed to get some of them, but it wasn't as effective as a direct hit. Still, the current hurt, and it got a few of them debilitated.<br>\r\n\"Run!\" Celica ordered the trader as she casted another Thunder spell. The trader nodded and packed his thing before moving towards a safe spot to watch the action unfold. She smiled as she watched him move away from the action, now she can use her more dangerous spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith him out of the way, Celica can now focus on taking down the bandits with no qualms. Every spell she fired this time either glazed them, or directly struck them. Celica charged a Fire spell and shot it towards a pair of bandits. The fireball to the bandits looked like a meteor coming from a sky, and unfortunately, they couldn't dodge it in time and were incinerated. Her first kill at her height. She justified that it was necessary for peace, nevertheless, she continued her assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe it death by the force of Excalibur, or the electricity of Thunder, the bandit's numbers were dwindling; they forces were now only four strong. An archer drew his bow and aimed directly at Celica. Warding Shot was prepped and it struck Celica directly at her chest.<br>\r\n\"AAUUGGH,\" she wailed as she took some steps back, \"THAT HURT!\" She could feel all of her energy fading as the fight continued on. She barely has any energy left to cast her strongest spell, but even then, she was silenced. She took a few steps back as she avoided the volley of arrows aimed at her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she froze in place as she was greeted with a snap and burst underneath her shoe. She looked underneath her sole to see what she stepped on, only to be greeted by the sight of blood. She was horrified, but at the same time, it felt...satisfying. She began thinking of a different strategy to finish off the last three bandits. She unsheathed her weapon and began walking towards the archer pestering her. She raised her weapon and slammed it down on the ground, knocking the archer off his feet. He could only watch as the titanic queen approached him with an emotionless expression, raised her foot above him, and planted it directly on him, ending his life at that moment. Celica turned around towards the last two bandits. She knew what she had to do, and it was simple. She can feel the rush of magical energy flowing through her and settling at the palms of her hands. She planted the Beloved Zofia into the ground and began to concentrate. She raised her palms and moved her arms in a circular motion. At that moment, her palms were sent ablazed, and the Brand on her right hand began to glow. She opened her eyes are glared at the remaining survivors of her skirmish.<br>\r\n\"It's over.\" Celica said as she raised her hands towards the sky and casted her ultimate spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at Zofia Castle, Alm was studying the book Celica used to make her huge in the castle's library. The text was very complicated. Even with the basic reading Celica taught her, the text was archaic and beyond his skill level.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this is tough.\" He muttered as he exited the library.<br>\r\n\"Have you reached a breakthrough, Sir Alm?\" A soldier asked him. Alm turned around and shook his head in denial.<br>\r\n\"No, unfortunately. I'll have to write a letter to them to let them know that we're coming.\"<br>\r\n\"'Them', sir?\"<br>\r\n\"Luthier and Delthea-\"<br>\r\nHis thought were interrupted when an earthquake shook the castle, followed by a massive sound burst that sounded like an explosion.<br>\r\n\"What the-?\" Alm screamed as the sound blast waves through the castle. Much of the glass windows were shattered by the blast, and some of the fragile object inside fell and cracked, though luckily, nothing of value was damaged.<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty!\" Another soldier cried as he rushed towards the king. \"The balcony! Come quickly.\" Alm nodded and the three rushed towards the balcony where Celica dropped him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods...\" Alm muttered as he saw the massive fireball and smoke coming from the distant south. There was only one person who was capable of making an explosion of that caliber...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, Alm was traveling towards the sight of the explosion just down south of the castle with his squad. Those minutes felt like a few hours to him, and during those moments, he was cursing himself for leaving Celica out of his sights. Those thoughts would stop when he runs into a trader, who looks like he's in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Alm paused and asked him, \"Have you seen a girl with red hair around 100ft tall?\"<br>\r\n\"You mean Queen Anthiese? Yes, she's just back there; in fact, I came here looking for help!\" He pointed in the direction where he was running from.<br>\r\n\"No...\" Alm was beginning to dread even further, \"Is she safe?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I ran the moment she casted an enormous explosion on some bandits. It looked like she was in bad shape.<br>\r\n\"I see...thank you.\" Those words were the only thing that could come out of Alm's mouth before departing. His face was consumed in fear. If what the trader said was true, then Celica was in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be safe, Celica...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more minutes later, they have arrived at the destination. The result of Celica's \"skirmish\" was a sight to behold. Burnt marks of lightning and fire were scattered all over the field, arrows were everywhere, blood stains were marked in a peculiar shape, and most importantly, the amount of corpses on the battlefield. In the center was the main attraction: Celica...</span></div></div>",

Alm raised his sword, in case any danger was nearby, though the battlefield appeared empty of anyone living and ran to Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelica what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica looked serious, though a part of her suppressed a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Alm. I knew our land was still ravaged by bandits and pirates, and I thought with my size I might do something to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Why would you run off on your own like that?! You could have been killed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica lowered her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to help our land, to save our knights time and lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlm relaxed,  the tension leaving his body, though he was still confused by Celica\u2019s actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why did you run off by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Alm, you\u2019ve done so much for the land. You led the Deliverance, pushed back Emperor Rudolf\u2019s armies and slew Duma. All I did was run for Millia, and even in that you needed to save me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelica...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlm would have held her hand, but she was much too high for him to reach. He settled for placing an arm on our leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were with me to when we fought Duma I don\u2019t know if we could have won without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that to make make me feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it\u2019s true. I couldn\u2019t have done it without you, nor could I have doe it without everyone from the village or the Deliverances or the people who with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn\u2019t make Celica feel any better<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was always so dependent on them, especially Saber and Catria.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re giving yourself enough credit Celica. I\u2019m sure they were drawn to you, as I was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica rose to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to rid these lands of bandits. I want to make use of what I\u2019ve been given. Would you join me help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelica hold on. Just because you\u2019re a giant it doesn\u2019t mean your invincible! We should get those injuries treated!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleica flinched but tried to appear strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She winced in pain, feeling an arrow in her side. \u201cOn second thought I was careless. Maybe I\u2019ll accept some healing. After that would you join me Alm?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was something about Celica that just seemed to intimidate Alm. She seemed determined on stopping the pirates and bring them to justice. He wish he could say no, but between Celica's massive size and her selflessness, Alm couldn't bear to see Celica get severely hurt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll help you,\" Alm agreed to Celica's offer, \"But promise me to not run off again on your own...\" Celica smiled brightly as she held her wounds tightly.<br>\r\n\"I promise. I won't be as reckless like I was today.\" Celica got down on her knees once again and reached down towards Alm with her other hand; she perched him on her shoulder as Alm looked at her wife's glimmering face, although it was a bit bloody from her wounds. Speaking of her wounds, many of the clerics began treating them, although due to her size, it required multiple spot treatments. Still, it didn't void the fact that Celica was as beautiful as Alm remembered as the sun began to set...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden growl came out of nowhere. It wasn't too loud per se, but it got the rest of Alm's squad into a fighting position. However, there was one person who knew where the sound came from.<br>\r\n\"U-umm...\" Celica stuttered as her face turned bright red, \"That...was my stomach. Sorry, everyone, I haven't eaten anything since this morning.\" A sigh of relief echoed the barren battlefield, but some of them grew worried for her. To Alm, it didn't feel too long since Celica first arrived to find him, but it has been an eventful day. Now that Celica is hungry, he and Celica can go back to the castle and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Alm realized as she stared at her massive wife, \"Celica, what do you plan on eating today?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't we-ohhhh...\" Celica realized the problem everyone was worried about: how is she going to eat at her height?<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Celica, we'll find a way.\" Alm assured her in an attempt to cheer her up.<br>\r\n\"We'll help you, Lady Anthiese!\" A soldier yelled towards her.<br>\r\n\"We'll do anything to make sure you're safe and happy!\" Another one pitched in. The entire squad was rallied, lifting Celica's mood a bit. To her surprise, she felt a warm touch on her cheeks. She turned her head to see Alm's hand stretched out towards her. Tears began to build up in her eyes. To think that she had to rely on others once again so that they can make her happy again.<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" Celica said as she sniffed from the build-up of tears, \"Thank you, all. I hope my new strength will find happiness and bring peace to Valentia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours has passed ever since Celica's first skirmish at her height. When the squad arrived at the castle, the first thing Alm did other than calming the people was to arrange a feast for everyone outside. It had been a long and eventful day for both Alm and Celica, so the feast was much needed. Nobles, soldiers, even some of the locals were invited for this rare occasion to dine with not only the king, but also the massive queen. Much of the food served was enough for double the amount of people that arrived, but it was prepared for a certain someone. But still, everyone had a good time, and some even got to speak with the 100ft tall queen, although they were a bit nervous at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the feast was over. Everyone was stuffed and felt satisfied with their bellies filled. Some stayed inside the castle and were given guest rooms due to the amount of ale or wine they have consumed, especially since Alm requested some of the finest wine from Ram Village. Celica laid her titanic figure down on the ground. She looked at the moon in the sky. If she was honest, she couldn't believe the events that have transpired today. From visiting a town, to annihilating a band of pirates, Celica grew accustomed to her new size. She couldn't ignore the cons, however, as evident by today's dinner. A plentiful amount of meat was present, but Celica ate what was pretty a whole Dagon in order for her stomach to be satisfied! Still, she couldn't deny that the fillet was delicious, and she was grateful for the meal. In the corner of her eye, she saw Alm walking towards her, tired from probably the meeting he had after dinner.<br>\r\n\"How was the meeting?\" Celica curiously asked him.<br>\r\n\"Tiring,\" he responded with little emotion, \"I just got to finishing the letter for the Forest Village, but before that, I had to discuss our plans for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n\"You must be exhausted, huh?\" Celica asked him while turning her whole body towards him. She could barely make out a nod from him as he yawned. She smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, good.\" Celica giggled.</span></div></div>",

Shrugging, she returned the book to its place in the library before making her way towards the royal bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlm?\u201d Celica called out for her husband. No response came...it wasn\u2019t like her husband to simply ignore her like this. As she searched the bedroom for any trace of Alm, the red-haired royal had a look of concern on her face. With a disappointed sigh, Celica exited the room, quickly discovering an unusual emptiness throughout the castle. Every hall and room appeared empty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did everyone go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlm slowly awoke, groggy from a rough night. The green-haired king of Valentia reached over to left the bed\u2019s covers...only to find that they were much larger than they should be! In fact, everything seemed bigger than usual.

It was strange for everyone to simply disappear into thin air. Just as she was about to abandon her search, the red-haired queen happened upon the castle\u2019s dining hall. One more look here couldn\u2019t hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the shrunken denizens of Valentia, reaching the dining hall was a long, exhausting trial. However, standing around and doing nothing would get them nowhere, so they pressed on towards one of the table\u2019s monolithic legs, where Clive could make out an exhausted, green-haired figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlm..? Your majesty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClive rushed over to comfort the equally-tiny king, checking his body for injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies...\u201d the knight said through a caring hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClive...thank you...\u201d Alm replied, returning the embrace. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see the townspeople are okay. Well, other than being mysteriously reduced in size...\u201d Just then, the miniaturized king\u2019s eyes widened as a thought occurred to him. \u201cCelica! Where is she? Is she small as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of booming footsteps approaching the table gave Alm his answer. Then came another loud noise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Grrrrrrrrrrgle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica\u2019s cheeks turned a bright red as she put a hand to her stomach. \u201cI guess I should prepare myself a meal, before I get back to finding them...\u201d The giantess exited the room for a while, her steps rattling the tiny people under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least Celica wasn\u2019t shrunken...\u201d Alm mused. \u201cMaybe she can help us return to normal size!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough uncertain at first, the crowd quickly warmed up to Alm\u2019s suggestion and began to scale the table\u2019s legs...though not without a bit of difficulty. Eventually, the downsized king led his subjects onto the tablecloth and towards the nearest plate, just as the familiar queen made her way back to the table, holding a salad plate in her hands. Celica set her plate and utensils down, sat herself in the nearby seat, and started to enjoy her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his better judgement, Alm leapt into his wife\u2019s salad and waved his arms, yelling her name. Unfortunately, his tiny voice failed to reach Celica\u2019s ears from down upon the plate. The massive woman scooped up another forkful of veggies, unknowingly taking Alm with said forkful!

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">APRIL 4, 2020 MAJOR UPDATE<br>\r\nAs of today, ownership of this interactive has been transferred to me, Doreedo. This was done with the blessing of the original owner, and I hope they choose to add to this interactive from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDOREEDO'S NEW NOTES<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The rating for this fic has been increased to 18+, because I much prefer to write that way. I feel constrained attempting to write within a 13+ boundary, and so this interactive will remain with its new 18+ desigation for the forseeable future. <br>\r\n                   1a) This means that fetishes that were not allowed previously due to the 13+ rating ARE NOW ALLOWED. I will, however, be keeping the original owner's desire to have everone written in character. If you want to write about people getting mangled, tortured, or whatever, just remember that their are plenty of female villains in the series to work with. It doesn't have to be the good guys suddenly going nuts.<br>\r\n                   1b) Graphic content (blood, gore, violent death) IS ALLOWED. But if people start posting this kind of stuff I'll have to bump up the rating of the story to GC. There isn't anything like that right now, so I'll keep it at 18+ for the time being.<br>\r\n                   1c) Under my rules, the giant ladies of Fire Emblem are not immortal. If you can write it well or make it progress the story, you may kill your GTS. Just keep in mind that death is final under most circumstances in the Fire Emblem universe and ALWAYS a tragedy when it happens to a playable character or allied npc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that, ONLY FEMALE GIANTS. Men can shrink, but not grow bigger than the height they started at. I generally only write about people getting shrunk, so I probably won't add to much to storylines about Girls growing. Go nuts on these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. As with the original owner, the only additions that will be deleted/edited are one line additions. If it is to a storyline I already have an outline to, I may edit it and write over it entirely.<br>\r\n                  2a) I will also delete and/or heavily edit chapters that contain excessive bad grammar. There's too many stories up here featuring chapters that read out like someone was heavily intoxicated while writing them. If English isn't your first language, just do your best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Because this is now an 18+ interactive, people will have significantly greater freedom to write about fetishes. On that note, there are a list of banned fetishes (which will be deleted if I find them present in the interactive. <br>\r\n                3a) Right now, only one fetish is banned; anything toilet related. If its vore, digestion is allowed (and you are allowed to get graphic, if that is your wish.) The aftermath is taboo. It can be referenced but I won't allow chapters featuring anything heavy with toilet-related content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. I like a lot of different fetishes, most of them not related at all. When I write, I usually end up merging them into something bizarre and disturbing to other people. You have been warned.<br>\r\n                4a) Feel free to add to any chapters I personally create. Seeing other people's writing ESPECIALLY in the context of bizarre fetish~y stuff ironically helps me write better. Really gets the ol' creative juices flowing. Just as long as it keeps in line with the short list of banned fetishes, all are welcome here</td>",
