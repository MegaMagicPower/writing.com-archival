They will be assigned the same class schedule as you, and you can help them with America, our school system and way of life.

You then remember that there used to be more houses next to and behind your aunts house, just like in any subdivision, but they seem to be gone.  Now it looks kinda like a farm, with an acre or two of open land, and a large, barn-like building in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a loud thumping sound coming up from behind you.  You whirl around, coming face to face with five toes that come up to your knees.  You look up and see the smiling face of a red-headed boy, who looks to be about twelve years old, except for one small fact:  he was over fifty feet tall!   He was wearing just a pair of cutoff jeans with no shirt. \"Hi, Byan!\"  the boy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger back, falling on your ass.  \"What the hell?!\" you cry out.  \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your cousin, Tyler!\"  the boy said.  \"Don't you remember me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back and remember the last time you were here, about three years ago, and then recall the face.  You remember Tyler being about a foot shorter than you, and being an energetic, mischievous kid, if a little annoying due to him constantly wanting to hang out with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, Tyler,\" you respond.  \"But, uh... you've changed a little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" Tyler responds as he sits down.  The force of him sitting shakes the ground, and you struggle to stay sitting up straight.  \"Right after the last time we saw each other, I just woke up one day and started growing.  In one week, I went from four feet seven to six feet tall.  My mom took me to doctors all over the state, but no one could figure out why.  Luckily, my mom works for a clothing company, so she was able to get them to provide me free clothes in exchange for me appearing in some commercials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say, \"so you've just kept growing for the past three years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\"  Tyler responds.  \"Though it seems to have leveled off; I've been right around 65 feet tall for the past few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you hear your aunt's voice call from the house: \"Byan!  Tyler!  Time to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Tyler jumps up and takes a few steps closer to the house.  The force of his feet whooshing by you feels like a wind machine.  After he sits down again, you carefully get up and run over to the patio where the food is laid out.  Tyler motions for you to sit next to him, which you timidly do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the meal, Tyler grabs as much food as he can gets his hands on.  There are eight turkeys, six of which he eats whole, only removing the bones after he rips all the meat off with his teeth.  Tubs full of potato salad, baked beans, and macaroni and cheese,  along with jugs of fruit punch, disappear quicker than you can blink.  Tyler seems to be ravenous; the amount of food he's eating seems to be enormous even for someone of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's always hungry,\" your aunt tells your mom.  \"Luckily, the community donates money to buy food for him, and we give back by helping out with people moving, constructing, and things like that.  It's actually helped us get a lot closer to our neighbors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler leans back and lets out a large BURP, shaking the ground.  \"Tyler!\" your aunt scolds.  \"Cover your mouth when you do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler blushes sheepishly.  \"Sorry, mom,\" he says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meal, the adults go inside, and you sit next to Tyler awkwardly, trying to think of something to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, that was a good meal,\" he says.  \"So what do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" you say.  \"What is there to do around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" he says, \"well... we could go explore my part of the house.\"  He motions over to the barn across the property.  \"Or I could give you a tour around town.  Or we could play a game\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second, and then decide</span></div></div>",

Shops, school, church, playground, lake and many houses. Each of them has a story.<br>\r\n\"This house was built last year. I unloaded everything from the trucks and I was the crane.\" He is proud to tell. \"Although I was only 41 feet tall at the time.<br>\r\nAnd a family moved into that apartment on the second floor a month ago. I put their furniture in the apartment through the windows.\"<br>\r\nTaylor is talking all the way. Many times he no longer talks about the town. Back to his house, he stops by the lake. He slowly sits down on a rock cliff and hangs his feet in the water.<br>\r\n\"Is it a problem to stop for a while? I'm cooling my feet a little because it's very warm today. \"Tyler says as he tries his feet.<br>\r\nThen he goes on to tell about everything that comes to his mind.

I ... you know.\" The boy stared.<br>\r\n\"You must have a lot of friends.\" You keep talking. \"If not for anything else just to they be able to travel up here.\"<br>\r\n\"I've never had many friends or just friends.\" He admitted it. \"Especially since I started growing up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were already wearing your bikini and lying on your towel, trying to get a tan on the beach. You were finally resting, after that long, long boat trip. It felt great finally being far away from your parents. People always believed you were parent-dependant, so you decided to make this trip all by yourself to prove them wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It had been difficult for you to get through all the accomodation \"rituals\". No one could believe you were alone. For that, you had only to blame your \"peculiar\" height. At 4'10'', most people (specially women), stopped by to ask \"Oh, hi darling. Looking for your mommy?\". That pissed you off, but it was even worse when the hotel staff tried to take you to the \"Kids Area\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But now, you had nothing to worry about anymore. You were lying down, almost falling asleep, while your pale skin tanned a little. You thought it was about time to darken it a little, as your pale white skin, along with your red chicks and pitch-black hair had gotten you the annoying nickname of \"Snow White\". You hated that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You fell asleep quickly, trying to keep your mind blank. After some hours, you woke up. You were a little surprised as the sun was still high an bright. You still felt somewhat tired, so you decided to go to sleep again. Soon, you noticed that would be impossible, as most tourists were still around (swimming, chatting, playing sports, laughing, snoring, etc.). You tried in vain to ignore it, until you gave up and got up, taking your towel with you while looking for some place far from the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you walked through the beach, you noticed a couple playing volleyball. The guy, notably taller than the girl, was easily winning. A particularly fast ball from the guy went flying right towards you, landing just by your feet. Immediatley, the guy shouted at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ball, please!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You picked the ball up, but as you prepared to throw it back, you realized you would never be able to send it back from that distance (you were never a sports girl, and definitly not a strong one). Instead, you walked towards the girl, holding the ball with both hands. As you approached her, you heard her say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girl! Wanna come and play? Maybe if you pair with me, we can beat this bully!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She giggled with this, but you just continued to walk without saying a word. When you finally reached her, you both stared at each other surprised. She was 5'10''! A full foot taller than you. Likewise, she stared down at you, bent down a little and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... it's OK if you don't want to play. Sorry if I bothered you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She sounded a little embarrassed. You felt offended by that, but as you turned around to see the guy she had been playing with, you knew she was right. There was no chance both of you could beat him. He was 6'6''. You felt like a little girl looking at his dad. This intimidated you a little. You gave the ball to the girl and swiftly walked away, continuing your search for a resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After walking for a while, you found an isolated, quiet place. While preparing to rest again, a particulary strong gust of wind sent your towel flying. You could see it landed on a palm tree. It wasn't too high, but you would never be able to get it down alone. You looked around for someone, but there wasn't anyone around. Finally, you spotted a person swimming in the sea. You hated asking for help, but this time you had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\", you shouted to the person, who turned around to look at you. That was the moment you noticed this person was a...</span></div></div>",

The bus stop bench now feels like a rubber band nearly flinging Bruce headfirst into the canopy. He lands on the same way, but now his seat and ankles ache from the landing. A strange shape stands in the corner of his eye, something big enough to bend the light pole in an awkward angle.

He looks fairly dressed for the cold, but unusual to Bruce's sense. He has a long-sleeved shirt beneath a fur-lined vest as well as something like jeans. However the fabric of the shirt and pants look lighter than the jacket Bruce is wearing, and the sleeves tend to bunch up around the elbow. This giant guy must be pretty strong. He has long thick hair that seems to extend to ear-length, though at Bruce's visual angle he can see something covering his ears - perhaps earmuffs or headphones. The giant shows no interest in him or the bus stop canopy at the moment but instead focuses on the skyscraper. Maybe he's watching the little humans in their offices, following them with his finger.</span></div></div>",

He looks up at the canopy. After the tremor, the top seems to buckle in on himself. He falls to the ground as the metal supports groan and starts to crawl beneath the bench. Sure this may be the last place he wants to be waiting for the bus, but he has no other idea how to escape this. Clutching his head, he watches in horror as the supports groan to a breaking point and snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange though, the canopy hasn't fully collapsed. There's very little debris from the glassy top or from the supports. He slides like a slug for a better look. The canopy lies as if it was turned over, like a tree after an encounter with a lumberjack. A few more inches along his belly and he could see the giant's eyes. There he stands, one knee resting on the concrete as he leans on the other to look down at Bruce. Bruce attempts to recoil as the giant brushes aside the ripped bus stop canopy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe keeps his eyes locked on Bruce, smiling. What is the nature behind that smile?</span></div></div>",

The giant obviously had the chance to just smash the canopy and bench into a single sheet of metal on the pavement, but has not done it. And besides, the smile does give an impression that he means no harm. He returns to his feet before brushing off whatever junk he crawled through in his previous hiding place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant makes the first move. \"Hi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrenched in sweat and shivering in terror, Bruce responds. \"H...hhh...hi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant points towards him, resting his wrist on the pavement. \"Are you cold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...aa...a little,\" he catches his breath. \"More scared actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared?\" He bends his head to the side as if confused. \"Why are you scared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...because you're so big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so tiny...\" He seems almost to shrug off the idea of being so huge. He puts his fingertip on Bruce's body, petting it like a harmless animal. He knocks off his hat so he can stroke his hair too. \"I like you tiny people. You're so fun to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you were looking in the offices over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant nods. \"They closed their shades. They were scared too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem so scary anymore I think...\" Bruce compliments as he picks up his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so? You're not scared of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lil, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant laughs. \"Little like you? You're a funny tiny guy. You want to be my tiny friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce nods. He's not sure what it entails. He hasn't been smashed like a bug and who knows. Maybe things will get interesting in his boring work life. \"Sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant smiles. He unfolds his palm. \"Come, you won't be so cold with me.\" Bruce obliges but regrets when the giant folds up his hand.

After all, the heat from his body warms it so much so that Bruce breaks a sweat. The downside is the ride itself. Each of his steps rattle the pocket and its contents back and forth. A forward step pushes everything outwards, sending a wave of strage things at Bruce before retreating. The little man grows curious about the biggest structure with him. It looks and feels like leather. He reaches around an enlarged leather gate and slowly pulls it apart. It doesn't seem to be locked like an enormous gate. Must be a wallet, he thinks. Not much light reaches the bottom, but a slight glare exposes an image behind the leather walls for the tiny man to see. It looks plastic and from the parts not reflecting the precious little light, he can see a face - the same face of the giant he encountered on a wall of plastic. A license perhaps, maybe an ID card? Why would a giant need that? There must be more to this guy than just his size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pocket goes dark, sending Bruce on the cloth floor. The giant's hand descends down the fabric ravine, fingers wrapping around the tiny man. His grip seems stronger than before, maybe to make sure Bruce doesn't fall. The fingers release and palm goes flat, letting the tiny man lie on its surface. The giant's gleaming eyes fill his view, capped with a harmless smile. \"Welcome to my home, little guy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce gets back on his feet for a good look. The main room looks no different from any lounge or living room he has seen before - just the size is to fit another scale. At a far wall leading to a hallway, he can see two enormous glass tanks, one filled to the top with water. What kinda fish does he keep in there, he wonders. From a giant's eye view, his house looks moderately clean - very little out of place or dirty. The giant sets Bruce on a large cork coaster on a coffee table neighboring a sofa of phenomenal size. After setting him down there, he slips off his shoes and vest before jumping onto the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to ask,\" Bruce tries to open up to him a little. After all, he's a guest to this giant's house. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Gregory,\" he says, holding out his hand like he was about to shake with someone his size. \"What about yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bruce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory smiles. \"Nice to meet you, Bruce. You're most welcome here. If there's anything you want; don't be afraid to ask, my tiny friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce contemplates his request...</span></div></div>",

Two kids played tug-o-war with an inner tube next to a lady floating on a blow up mattress. Teenagers intertwined  rose and fell in the undulating water. His eyes were drawn to a single swimmer out past the safety zone. Swimmers who rode the waves out too far would often get pulled out to sea before they realized where they were and could get caught in an undertow. Something seemed wrong with this swimmer something he just couldn't put his finger on but from this distance he just couldn't tell what it was. He grabbed his safety can and put the velcro strap around his ankle. His tan body was trim from hours spent in the water and his red trunks sported the white cross that identified him as a lifeguard. Sand flew behind him as he raced across the  beach and into the surf. He dove into the first wave and with powerful strokes cut through the water. He swam past the startled tug-o-war kids closing the distance to the lone swimmer.

Why do you want to swallow me?\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n\"Not exactly you, I just saw something moving between the trees and I wanted to eat it. I didn't watch what it was.\" The boy simply replied.<br>\r\n\"Do you eat everything you see?\" She was surprised.<br>\r\n\"Sure. I eat anything smaller than me. And everything smaller than me. I just went to the lake to drink. That's when I saw you and I always eat whenever I can because I don't know when I can next.\" Alice was educated by the giant.<br>\r\n\"And will you eat me too?\" She shivered.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.
