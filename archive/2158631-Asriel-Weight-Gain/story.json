            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>          As Asriel slowly lumbered toward his breakfast, Toriel couldn't help but reflect on how astonishingly effective her hubby's new ordinance had been doing. Ever since the war, the underground had been trying to recuperate, but nothing seemed to work until Dr. Gaster had formed a very special magical farming technique that made plants produce more than four times their natural production rate giving us more food than we could ever need. This amazing gift that Dr. Gaster gave the kingdom gave Asgore the best idea to raise the people's spirits. A never-ending feast, a festival celebrated by the entire underground where they could let loose and enjoy themselves. Oh, and enjoy themselves they did, feasting upon our now neverending resource. But the most important thing this new magic food gave us was that it had two very accidental but very appreciated side effects. One was exponential fat growth, but the other was that it altered our minds that it no longer mattered. It fed us thoughts like, \"Who needs the surface I have everything I need here,\" or \"All this extra weight feels so good. I need more of it.\" And so it goes ever since then, exercise and health foods have been outlawed, and the entire underground ballooned on deserts and meats, but none have grown quicker than the Dreemurr Family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          This was self-evident just by looking at the three. Asgore, who feasted the most at the festivals in Snowdin, grew immobile in only a few short days. Being forced to live at the table 24/7 not that he minds at all. He gets to be the center of attention at the neverending party. He has even been getting fed while asleep by some very enthusiastic townsfolk. Toriel, however, was a lot smaller than Asgore, but if you compared her to a picture taken only a month ago you would hardly believe it to be the same person. Gone was her svelte figure, her stomach hung down halfway of her meaty legs creating a table whenever she sat. As well as flabby arms that somehow defied gravity while cooking. Because despite her slow labored movement the rest of the days, whenever she cooked she gained the reflexes of a ninja, being able to focus on preparing twelve dishes at a time. While still cooking every last one to perfection for her son. And this brings us to Asriel, who like his father grew a lot faster than his mother. But unlike his father who developed a love of fat for the sake of his subjects and their happiness. Toriel seemed to have trained him from birth in preparation for Gaster's breakthrough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          This rumor was ridiculous of course because Toriel had no knowledge of Gaster's testing until he gained the results he needed, but many wondered why Toriel spoiled him so much even before every child was given the opportunity to drop school and glut on nothing but deserts. But despite what many rumors or theories would suggest the reason why Toriel spoiled him so much was quite simple. It was because she never wanted her son to feel want, unhappiness, or pain. He wanted to eat nothing but sweets, done. He didn't want to go to school anymore, done. He wanted to just be a lazy lump eating and playing video games, done. He was given anything and everything he could ever wish for. And with Gaster's invention, the spoiling increased 10-fold now that the royal family didn't have to retain any modicum of appearances. And now he stands before his mother. Just one short month after Gaster's revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          His sweater stretched thin over his body looking more like a bra than a shirt with his large gut hanging down to his knees. His pants beaking at the seems barely covering his bubble butt, with his underwear being similarly stretched thin exposing just how gargantuan he became with his comparatively small stature. He could still waddle, but just barely, it was quite obvious that immobility was only a few short days of feasting, and gaining away. He would lucky to still have a week of walking left. His eyes shone out pure joy at the world, a disposition of a truly innocent child, who has seen no sorrow in his life and can only be happy. He struggled to walk to his seat at the table where he asked the question, \"So what's for breakfast today?\"</span></div></div>",

She slowly lumbered up to the door pretty tired from all the cooking she had to do. She opened the door to see three rather portly figures outside their home in New Home, the figures were Jackson, Andrew, and Kid. Jackson and Andrew were two Bunnyman native to Snowdin who got married and adopted Kid as their son (they both had pure white fur, and matching plaid button-up shirts. Red for Jackson and Blue for Andrew. They also wore blue jeans that looked skin tight and would break at any moment.) Kid, however, was a small lizard child without arms who was native to Hotland, but now lives with his two dads in Snowdin, he also became fast friends with Asriel back when Asriel still went to school. The three were rather chubby, but the fattest of the three was definitely Kid (at least when you compared his heft to his short stature. He wore a striped sweater that rode up to above his naval but stayed below his prominent chest. He also wore brown pants that were already torn in several places and stayed unbuttoned to let his jiggly gut muffin-top in complete comfort.) This was most likely due to Azzy rubbing off on him rather than any gluttonous tendencies, not that Kid minded the extra weight, but he was nowhere near Azzy's heft. \"Thanks for taking care of Kid for the weekend, we really need some alone time after all the paperwork of taking Kid out of School and quitting our jobs,\" Andrew said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh yes, with the new breakthrough money, and education became obsolete. After all, no one needed to work to put food on the table, and housing has never needed to be paid for, due to the benevolence of the Dreemurrs, so many are leaving work, or school to live lives of gluttony and hedonism. So most shops have closed down, and gold is only useful to the dragons that survived the war, but hey no one needs to sustain commerce anymore so why worry about it. Though some remain steadfast in not joining the festivities, but those cases are mostly just due to worry of what comes when new houses need to be built, or worry of what happens when the core isn't maintained. However, in a few short months, Gaster will have the entire underground fully automated, All heavy labor going to robots while the monsters live carefree days. Growing fat and lazy without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back to the situation at hand, \"Oh it is no issue, but I bet you would have taken me up on my offer sooner if you knew what was going to happen,\" Toriel replied to Andrew's statement. The offer she was talking about was when Asriel left school to live his spoilt life, he said he would miss being able to be by Kid's side all day, so Toriel offered to let the family live with them at the castle. Where kid could quit school without worry of the future, but the couple was hesitant to just up and leave Snowdin, but just a few short years later, and now the life offered by Tori to them became the life given to everyone, and they were eager to embrace it. \"Yeah, but we would miss Snowdin to much to move here to New Home, and Azzy and Kid could still hang out on the weekends so I don't regret our decision,\" Jackson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we have to go we are going to go drinking at Grillby's with a friend group, and will be feasting all day. Be good Kid don't cause to much trouble for the queen,\" Andrew said. \"Oh, you needn't worry about his behavior, my husband has caused far more mischief than your son ever will,\" Tori replied. \"Bye Dad, Bye Dad see you guys later,\" said Kid at his parents. They waved at him from the porch and started heading toward the Riverperson (one of the few who hasn't gained a single pound, but no one knows if they eat so no one questions it.) So Tori and Kid head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid ran as fast as he could under the circumstances, but when he reached the dining room, he found that stopping while being so front heavy was nearly impossible, and with his lack of arms he tumbled to the ground. \"Kid are you okay!?\" exclaimed Tori. \"I'm just fine your majesty my belly cushioned the blow, now where is Azzy. The two looked over at the table and found him asleep in his chair. \"He must've stayed up late playing video games again,\" Tori said while helping the beached Kid back to his feet. \"You know if we didn't have Gaster making his developments I would actually worry about how I'm raising him,\" Tori said while helping Kid up to a chair. \"You wake him up, while I go get the food,\" Tori said. \"You got it, your majesty,\" Kid replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azzy, yo Azzy wake up,\" Kid said in order to goad him from sleep. \"Huh...\" Asriel said as he slowly awakened until he realized who was in front of him that forced his mind to full awareness. \"Kid, oh it's great to see you, I have the entire weekend planned out for us!\" Asriel said excitedly. \"Does that plan involve staying up all night playing video games, constant binging on fatty foods, and just being the incredibly lay lumps that we are,\" Kid replied. \"Correct on three accounts, but there is more don't you worry about that, but its a surprise for now,\" Azzy said, \"First time I'm hearing of this surprise,\" Tori said as she wheeled out the first course of breakfast. \"Well, it wouldn't be a surprise if anyone new,  but I promise it isn't anything dangerous, I have to keep my figure burning calories is a no-go,\" Azzy joked while playing with his fat. \"Well, I won't question any further, just remember to tell me if you need me to get you out of trouble.\" She said as she prepared the plates. Another benefit to having Tori as a Mom, she never punished any misbehaving, just dealt with the aftermath, and letting Azzy get away with it. If he wasn't a good-natured kid this could have resulted in some serious issues, but mostly it was only minor accidents caused by over-ambitious schemes. As Tori placed down the first plate it was...</span></div></div>",

Neither of them minded that he weighed more than he should, seeing as weight wasn't much of a problem for Goat Boss Monsters such as them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as young as he was, it's difficult for Asriel to move around very quickly, due to the heft that he always carried around. However, he managed it, no matter how difficult his life was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining the contents of the kitchen, he thought of a meal he could make instead of eating something premade.

He put a group of ten toaster tarts on the bottom, he lathered them in some butter, and poured some of the brown sugar on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a slice half finished in his mouth already, as well as having put another aside, Asriel begins crumbling the rest of the pie, dropping the bits all over the sticky toaster tart base, which stuck. Using honey, he glued some toaster tarts on the sides, making a box-like pastry of his own invention, it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping a few spoonfuls of cinnamon into the concoction, he throws the remaining three sticks of butter, the rest of the honey, and the entire bag of brown sugar along with it. To top it all off, he seals the top with the last of the toaster tarts, already having eaten some of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he carefully puts his creation in the microwave, setting it for three minutes and ten seconds. While he's waiting, he scarfs down the pie he set aside, not making a single dent on his hunger. He then pours himself a glass of milk, drinking all of it before the timer ran out, and poured himself another. As the timer reaches nine, Asriel stops it before it beeps, preventing his parents from waking up and punishing him for eating at this hour. His gut rumbled for more food, the noise being muffled from all the fat on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he takes out what he made, he's already eating a toaster tart from the top. Grabbing a fork and knife, he cuts into what he made, finding a mixed layer of melted butter, honey, cinnamon, melted brown sugar, and small pie parts beginning to leak out from the openings. Nevertheless, he cut it into decently sized squares, and began eating quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStabbing a piece with the fork, he carefully put it into his mouth, trying to get every morsel from the square. Savoring the flavor from it, he swallows it all at once, a small bulge appearing on his throat, slowly headed towards his belly. He then sticks his fork in the next square, going with the first. The flavor wasn\u2019t the only thing he was enjoying from his recipe. The rough from the sugar, the smooth of the honey, the solid from the toaster tart, and a unique one, that no description could do justice to his mother's pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce swallowing, his belly gave off a growl, indicating that he wasn\u2019t sated yet, much less full. He turned his attention back towards the remaining squares, counting twenty three left. Smiling to himself, he stuck gave his belly a scratch, which was rumbling for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the last few pieces, his paunch was sticking out more than it already was, already having reached his fullness point. If someone were to poke it, they\u2019d find the firmness of food inside after a few inches of squishy fat. Despite his fullness, he was resolved to finishing the whole plate of food. When the last piece was inside of him, he desired some more of the filling. Eyeing the plate, he used a spoon to put the bits that fell off into a single pile. Scooping up as much as he could, Asriel stuffed it into his mouth. Drinking another entire glass of milk, he was surprised when nothing came from the bottle. He drunk it\u2019s entire contents unknowingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel got up, his girth having grown quite a bit. He guessed that he had five pounds of food and milk in his stomach, digesting into more fat. Walking back up, a feat considering the amount of food he consumed, he laid in bed, letting the tiredness from digestion win, sleeping to the churning and sloshing of his paunch.</span></div></div>",

When he got into the Dining Room, he saw two large slices of pie, along with a large glass of Chocolate Milk. The two flavors were the traditional Apple and Key Lime Pie. \"Wow this smells so good,\" Azzy said, trying to hurry to the recliner placed at the table. \"Anything for my growing boy,\" Tori said, ruffling his hair. This was the main reason for his weight, it was Tori's cooking habits. She had a pension of never buying anything healthy, and since she does the grocery shopping the entire family's figures have tanked. All three of them were quite portly, Asgore's unexercised physique, while making it quite hard to get around, did give any room a large calmness to it. Tori also was quite large, but her cooking, skills seem to trump movement and gravity. And of course Azzy, who when sitting in his recliner (everyone at the table had their own eating recliner) has his gut almost reach his knees, over his chunky thighs. \"So Azzy what's on your agenda today?\" Asgore asked. Another contributor to his weight was that his parents never forced him to do anything, and listen to his every request. In fact, Asriel chooses how a lot of children's lives go. He told his mother how he thinks schools should be about enjoyment rather than learning, things that are boring. So now school is basically only a large conglomerate of disorganized clubs. He has also been abolishing taxing sports and replacing them with more sedentary alternatives. Instead of football, there are now large gaming teams. Instead of soccer, there are eating competitions. As well, as cooking become a national sport. This has been encouraging the entire underground to start bulking up. Especially since junk food is much easier than farming, when in a large cave system.

Wanting something to drink, Asriel told Chara to get some milk, and they obliged, going downstairs and back to the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking out a half gallon of milk, they set it on the table, about to get a cup, when they realized it would make way too much noise even opening the cupboard. Desperate to bring the milk to Asriel, they took the whole bottle to him. Upon receiving it, he asked no questions, just taking off the cap and drinking his fill. As he was putting it down, his eyes began to droop, though he was still wide awake. Chara thought that he was passing out from lack of sleep, and held the bottle in place, the rest of the milk flowing down his throat and into his belly, which was growing with each second that the bottle was on his lips. It wasn\u2019t like Asriel resisted either, so perhaps he was planning on downing it all in the first place. Or maybe he really needed a long, cool drink. Either way, he chugged it all until it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the entire bottle finished, much to Chara\u2019s surprise, they let it drop, the bottle bouncing off the floor. Asriel\u2019s gut had swollen to twice the size it was before, almost his entire belly showing, his sleep attire no longer covering it. It began to rumble for a few seconds, then Asriel put his hands to his mouth, the sound of a loud belch being smothered by his fur. Cradling his uncomfortable belly, he began nodding off, before falling backwards onto his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like he just suffered his first food coma, the sounds of churning and sloshing heard from his large paunch, getting louder from the fall onto bed. Chara moved him into his usual sleeping position, more sloshing from the milk every time his belly was involved. Once he was in place, Chara curiously moved his belly around, enjoying the feeling and noises coming from Asriel\u2019s gut. Eventually though, their tiredness was beginning to win. They covered Asriel in his sheets, before going back to their bed and sleeping, the sounds of Asriel digesting the cake and milk soothing them to unconsciousness. </span></div></div>",

Perhaps if it ended up working, they would try it too. But now wasn't the time to think about it. Asriel had to be done first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Asriel, he woke up suddenly, sitting up and stretching. Chara looked at him as his small pudgy belly appeared from his shirt as it lifted up. As he stayed in that position for a second or two, Chara poked at it playfully, causing a yelp of laughter to escape from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between laughing and breathing, Asriel exclaimed \u201cYou want me to do it to you too?\u201d Chara purposely tickled him with both hands, prompting him to retaliate with his own barrage of tickles, his soft fur like a feather. After a few minutes into the tickle war, Asgore checked on them through the door to see what the ruckus was about. Noting that it was just a playful fight, he left the two to their war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the excitement died down, they each sat on the edge of their respective beds, Asriel taking heavier breaths than Chara. Lifting his shirt up, he examined his flabby tummy, grabbing it and shaking it a bit, small waves bouncing up and down. Poking it resulted in a similar situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing honest with himself, Asriel actually liked having fat. It was different from his originally flat figure. But a difference no less. And he loved it. As matter of fact, he wouldn't care if he didn't get strong from this, it would just mean more fat for him to play around with. Of course, it would come with a price, but he'll deal with it if it comes. </span></div></div>",

He still has to eat enough to get bigger, and by extension, stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis night, Chara seemed confident that they'd made the plan balance both factors. The second night, they stopped when Asriel told them he was full, leading to no gain in the morning. Third night resulted in another food coma for Asriel, his gut mainly stuffed with a dense maple syrup and heavy cream mixture. Chara made the mistake of shaking his huge belly that night, the heavy cream mixing and then separating into maple syrup imbued buttermilk and extremely sugary butter. The noise that night almost didn't let Chara sleep. The gurgling and churning echoes bounced against the walls, leading Chara to close the door, else they risked getting caught in the act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth night followed a similar level as the second, only this time, it gave Asriel a soft layer of squishiness all over his body, underneath his fur. Fifth night, his third food coma, this one caused by an excessive amount of pie and chocolate milk inside his belly. Sixth night lead to another morning without any notable gain. Asriel was almost ready to give up on getting stronger and fully dedicating himself towards getting his whole body chubby. As of that day, he'd only gained at most fifteen pounds since the beginning, his nightshirt always showing off a large bump on his figure, the lower part of his gut leaning over his pants\u2019 waistline. Luckily for the two, it was only visible from Chara and Asriel's heights, practically invisible from Toriel and Asgore's sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the night arrived, Asriel was half expecting to experience his fourth food coma. It was Chara's turn to go for the food this night. Opening the fridge, they took out an entire butterscotch and cinnamon pie, intending to bring half of it for Asriel to gorge on in his room. As Chara finished up putting the pie on a paper plate, they heard the unmistakable sound of foot rapping, which Asriel was doing from the room. The warning sign they agreed on for when Asriel's parents woke up and was going downstairs. A second later, they heard the telltale sound of one of the adult goat monster's footsteps on the stairs, too heavy to be Asriel's. Would Chara get caught, or would they successfully hide away? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not knowing what to do, Chara dove under the table, bringing the pie with them, their pants sleeve getting caught on one of the legs. Thankfully, they were able to avoid being seen or heard. However, because of their hasty hiding, they were very uncomfortable in their current position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara saw the goat monster walk straight in front of them. When the footsteps stopped, the goat monster stayed there for a few minutes, Chara assuming that the monster was looking out the window. As they were thinking of ways to get up silently, it was then that the monster turned back around and began walking up the stairs. Chara took that as their cue to move again. Unfortunately, it would lead to their being captured in the act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pant leg that was snagged caused them to move the table, the noise breaking the night's silence. The goat monster went back down as quickly as possible. Chara knew they were busted, big time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking under the table, Toriel spotted Chara hiding underneath, half an entire pie on a plate right next to them. Looking very disappointed at the child, she told them to get up and hand over the pie. They followed the orders without question. Just as they were about to explain themselves, Toriel didn't let them speak assuming that they were trying to steal the pie for themselves, thinking that they wanted to steal Asriel's pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs punishment, they told Chara that every slice of pie they asked for would be given to Asriel instead, thinking it would be fair for attempting to steal pie at night. She was fully unaware that it wouldn't be a punishment at all. Having no pie for a week was something they could handle. Instead, it would make it easier for the plan to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding the grin on their face rather well, Chara silently nodded in \u201cshame\u201d, following Toriel upstairs and into the bedroom. Looking at Asriel's bed, Chara noted that he feigned sleeping very well, unless he was actually sleeping. After going into bed, Toriel went back to hers, Asriel opened his eyes fully, the two kids staring at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting about fifteen minutes to pass before talking, Asriel asked what happened, and Chara replied with enthusiasm, explaining what the punishment meant for the two. His eyes widened at the news, excited at the thought of more pie whenever he wanted it, as long as he told Chara. Plus, it would give him an explanation for the extra weight he's gained recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment however, his belly rumbled for a full second, and in agreement, Asriel went downstairs this time, quickly and quietly grabbing himself a whole cheesecake for the night, thinking it would be sufficient for the plan and stay in a certain comfort zone for him. Going back upstairs, Asriel began stuffing himself with slices, to the point where the cheesecake began lifting his shirt up more with each piece. When he was three quarters done, about forty minutes after he began, he gave the dessert over to Chara, allowing them to feed the rest to him, as he felt a little too full to eat on his own at the moment. Still, couldn't go wrong with consuming the rest of it, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara gave Asriel time to swallow each bite before giving him the next, going through one slice every five minutes. As he was swallowing more than he was comfortable eating, Asriel rubbed his churning belly, trying to decrease the pressure inside. The last one that he ate took almost eight minutes for Asriel to go through, the dense cake being a lot for someone his age and size. As the final bite was swallowed, his gut gave of a huge rumble, clearly in the middle of heavy digestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel's eyes began drooping, but he stayed awake. Telling Chara he was going to sleep, he covered himself in his sheets, back turned towards Chara. Being left no option, they went to bed as well, unable to mess with Asriel's paunch this night. As both children slowly drifted off to dreams, they each thought about if today was successful or not. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chara quickly hid in one of two closets in the kitchen, bringing the plate with them. They closed the door just in time, just as they heard footsteps around the corner. After waiting for fifteen minutes, the footsteps went back upstairs. Waiting five more, just in case, Chara got out of the closet, closing the door behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closing it, something heavy fell from off the shelf and hit the closet floor. Curious, Chara opened the door again and turned on the light, discovering that the closet they hid in was actually the pantry. Looking at the floor, they spotted the object in question. Lifting it up, they read the label. As it turned out, it seemed to be some sort of weight gain powder. Reading more into it, the description on it implied that it made the consumer stronger. Instantly buying the advertising, they looked around the pantry, curious to see if there were more bottles of the stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, they eventually looked up, spotting at least two more on the top shelf. Remembering that Asriel still needed to eat, they grabbed a box of sweet cereal, a half empty bottle of milk, and the powder they found. Bringing a large plastic bowl and a spoon, they silently brought it all up to the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling Asriel to help them, they opened up the bottle, taking a plastic scoop out. The label said two scoops equalled 1250 calories per serving, whatever that meant. They dumped six overflowing scoops into the milk bottle, gently shaking it around, the powder mixing in. Hiding the powder away in their closet, they went back with Asriel. Once that was finished, they poured half the cereal box into the bowl, then followed by milk, enough to wet the cereal but not enough to make it soggy. It was perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel downed the bowl's contents in ten minutes, barely showing on his pudgy belly. Chara refilled the bowl, the rest of the box being put inside. Pouring the same amount of milk in, they guessed that there was a little less than a quarter of the bottle left. Once Asriel finished the second bowl, he was feeling exceptionally full, his entire furry belly almost exposed, leaving a fourth covered. He knew a third of that belly was just accumulated fat, but knowing that the current amount of food wouldn't amount to actual growth in the morning, he held his hand out for the bottle of milk, putting it to his mouth, chugging the rest of the it, his stomach slowly growing with each gulp he took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished it, he held the now empty bottle at his side, his grip slowly slipping. Chara took it from his fluffy hand and put it on the nightstand. Asriel clutched his stuffed paunch as it digested his cereal, rubbing it attempting to ease the pressure. It suddenly rumbled, and he held a fluffy hand to his mouth as a few belches erupted from it, heavily muffled from his hands. It didn't look like he was going to pass out this time. After a few more rumbles and some uncomfortable looks from Asriel, Chara helped him rub his furry gut, shaking it around a bit for fun. <br>\r\nAfter another series of burps, he told Chara he was ready to sleep, and he did so, getting comfortable in bed with a large belly for once. Once he fell asleep, Chara played around with it, enjoying the gurgling noises and constant rumbles. After a while, they themselves were ready to sleep. Instead of going to their own bed, however, they slept with Asriel, the movements and sounds easing them to unconsciousness. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On morning\u2019s arrival, Asriel woke up first, and lifted his sheets to see the progress, expecting some muscles, as the powder from last night advertised, or at least some more weight. To his slight disappointment, there weren\u2019t any visible changes worth celebrating, with the exception of one thing. And that one thing made the disappointment disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shirt couldn\u2019t hide it anymore. His chubby frame had expanded a bunch over the past few days, but that was nothing compared to <i>this</i>. His belly wasn't the only thing affected from the sudden gain, his arms and legs a little thicker than last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, he grabbed one of the rolls and jiggled it, enjoying the shaking. He got out of bed slowly, but struggled standing up due to the weight he gained. He simply wasn\u2019t used to it, and was surprised that he gained it all in a week. I'd he had to guess, he gained about the same amount from the last six days, except it all happened in a single night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara began stirring, starting to wake up. Asriel slowly walked over to their bed, almost falling off balance with his newfound heft. He sat down next to the bed, not wanting to stand up. His shirt, no matter how hard he tried, couldn't lower enough to hide his gut, the bottom exposed for all the world to see, including his parents. He\u2019d have to deal with them when they see him, he supposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon waking up, the human child didn't think much of this morning, and opened their eyes. To their surprise, Asriel was already up waiting right next to them, curiously looking down, probably at his belly, they thought. As they got up, it was apparent why he wasn\u2019t standing up. He was poking at his exposed belly, which jiggled in response, his shirt clearly at it\u2019s limit, yet barely covering the bottom half of his paunch. Something went terribly wrong. Was the powder bad? Did they do something wrong? <b>What should they do to fix it???</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping out of bed, their foot got caught in one of their sheets and they fell face first towards the floor. Good news is that they didn\u2019t hit the floor. What they did hit was something soft and pillowy, it cushioned their fall. It was so soft, like a mountain of fluffy. Wanting to figure out what it was, they got off the bed completely before taking their face out, only to have their blush turn the rest of their face tomato red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel looked at Chara weirdly, oblivious to the fact that they actually enjoyed his belly pillow. Embarrassed, they tried to explain, to Asriel\u2019s confusion. He tried to stand up, using the bed as a handle, and managed to pull himself up. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t last standing for too long. He sat himself down on the bed, still trying in vain to pull down his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara tried explaining again, saying that something must\u2019ve been wrong with the powder, that they\u2019ll try to find a way to fix it and his extreme weight gain. It was then that he understood, and then told Chara that he actually didn\u2019t mind the extra heft he had, grabbing his flab from the side and shaking it around. There was still the problem of somehow explaining it to his parents. The two children racked their brains, but ended up having nothing that made sense. Eventually, Toriel called the two down for breakfast, and they immediately knew the jig was up. Grudgingly going down stairs, both of them made it to the table with little attention, though Asriel was almost caught. Wondering what was for breakfast, he asked his mom, to which she replied that she made a special something. As she turned around with said something, Asriel\u2019s gut gave off an audible growl, which wasn\u2019t too loud, but enough for Toriel to put the tin into the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was none other that a stack of double layer cereal bars, almost overflowing with marshmallow fluff from the inside. Chara felt their face heat up a little, reminding them a little too much of what happened upstairs. Asriel honestly didn\u2019t mind how it looked, as long as he ate enough to sate his appetite. Once the three boss monsters and human child were sitting down, they began eating, and Asriel blazed through his portion. However, upon finishing, he still felt hungry, and asked for more. Toriel gave him a confused look, but gave him more cereal bars nonetheless. Once finishing those, he stopped to consider whether or not to continue eating. On one hand, he was hungry, but on the other, he might not be able to hide his gain if he continued. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite his gut feeling saying he should\u2019ve just gone upstairs and tried to hide his sudden gain, Asriel\u2019s actual gut was protesting for more food, and he couldn\u2019t deny it that simple plea. His mother\u2019s cooking was so amazing, he didn\u2019t have to argue over the pros and cons of eating more. He was eating more than usual, almost reaching his limit. But of course, he hadn\u2019t had this big of a belly before, and it was just asking for more. So he obliged, stuffing it full of more and more cereal bars and milk, slowly filling up his paunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara looked at him, surprised that he was still going. Lifting up his ear and whispering into it, they told him to stop eating so much, or they\u2019d get caught red handed. He whispered back that if he didn\u2019t his gut would make noises for food all day. Chara grudgingly allowed him to continue, if it weren\u2019t for that Asriel made a good argument they\u2019d be trying to drag him upstairs without grabbing his parent\u2019s attention. They really wanted to feel his belly again, it was like he was a living plushie. They might even consider sleeping with him tonight if they weren\u2019t caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parent\u2019s looked on in concern, particularly Toriel, who knew he treats could make other go crazy for them, but never had she seen someone practically inhaling their food, much less her very loved son. Having finished her oatmeal, she got up and brought her bowl to the sink, and then walked over to Asriel. To her immediate surprise, Asriel\u2019s belly was hanging out over his waistline, an alarming amount of fatty fur accumulated on her son\u2019s abdomen. Trying not to startle him, she carried on her usual routine, although she made sure passing by Asgore not to bother the kids about it. He nodded in agreement, astonished that his child was eating that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel tried to hide his belly as his mother did her daily routine, sneakily passing behind her and putting his plate into the sink and then waddling upstairs as quickly as possible, Chara behind him and helping him up to their room. Closing the door, they immediately asked if he thought either one of his parents noticed. Thinking they didn\u2019t, he let himself fall onto his bed, bouncing a bit on the mattress. Lifting up what little of his shirt covered of his massive paunch, he began playing around with it, enjoying the feel of his fatty fur. Slowly but surely, Chara went over to him, examining the squishy prince\u2019s fluffy fat reserve. They began prodding it, curiously, as if unsure whether it was, gently pushing it from one leg onto the other, and then, began playfully squishing it, their blush indiscernible from their face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he decided enough was enough, and tried getting up, standing up from his bed, only to fall back onto his bed. He still wasn\u2019t used to the heft he was now carrying around, and Chara immediately got to his side, holding him up by his shoulders, although they were notably struggling to keep him up. He began taking a few steps around the room, the occasional glorp of digestion emitting from his gut. After about an hour, he started getting the hang of it, beginning to jog around the room without help from Chara. They stayed at his side, just in case he fell or something else bad happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the entire day, the children stayed mostly in their room while their parents were dealing with the kingdom\u2019s daily issues. Occasionally, Chara went downstairs to the pantry and grabbed a box of cookies, a half gallon of milk, and some other thing to sate Asriel\u2019s gut while they played. Of course, Chara hid some extra packs in the closet, near the powder, in case Asriel wanted a quick midnight snack after a binge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the afternoon, when the royal family had dinner, no one brought up Asriel\u2019s gut, although everyone knew about it. Thankfully, neither Chara nor Asriel suspected a thing when they were eating their steak dinner, although Asriel ate an entire steak on his own, an astonishing feat considering Asgore ate that much. Finishing dinner, Toriel asked Chara to go upstairs, saying that they wouldn\u2019t like to see what was about to happen. They politely refused. Grudgingly, she allowed them to stay. Not to the children\u2019s surprise, Asgore escorted them to the bathroom and brought out a scale, putting it on the floor. Meanwhile, Toriel looked through stacks of paper, and upon finding the one she needed, she brought it to the bathroom, where Asriel was busy taking off his somewhat tight pants and sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking through the paper, she found the number she wanted. A 76 lbs, the paper dating to six months ago. Asriel then stood on the scale, which read a whopping 133 lbs, which was an extremely excessive amount for someone who only stood at 4\u2019 7\u201d. He was clearly overweight. And yet, there was a small smile of compassion from his parents. Asriel was confused. Chara looked at both of them, struggling to see why they weren\u2019t angry or upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon asking, Asriel got his answers. His parents explained that when they were young, a couple of years older than him, they each had an unexpected weight gain, causing their parents to make more food for them to accommodate their new appetites. Considering Asriel was the child of two early bloomers, it was almost expected for this to happen. They just didn\u2019t know when, and now, it happened. They promised Asriel to supply him with all the food he needed, new clothes to replace all the tight ones he had, and to start teaching him how to cook, or at least bake. </span></div></div>",

What they didn't know was that Toriel had been to the store the previous night and got enough food to last the family for weeks. Chara found a treasure load of food in the fridge, cabinets and more. They both ran (Waddle for Asriel) back to their bedroom.  Chara had brought a chest load of food to the bedroom. \"Chara are you sure I can eat all this?\" Asriel asked. \"This is about triple the amount I normally eat!\"<br>\r\n\"C'mon! I know you can eat it all!\" Chara replied. \"A-Are you sure? I want to get bigger, yeah. But not this <b>quickly</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay! I believe in you!\" Chara said.

Still more food to go.<br>\r\nAsriel's belly was very slowly expanding, his 133 lbs belly gaining more pounds by the second.<br>\r\n\"Come one Asriel! Eat more!\" Chara asked. Asriel had eaten half of the pile of food. His stomach was gurgling for more, while aching at the same time. \"I... I can't eat anymore... I'm sorry it's just my belly's aching...\" Asriel said. \"Don't be silly, you can finish the food! I know you can! If you can't do it, I'll do it for you.\" Chara replied.<br>\r\n\"What do you m- MRPH!\" Asriel was cut off again. Two pies being stuffed into his mouth. \"Come on! I know you're hungry!\" Asriel's gut spilling over his legs and hanging off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel had finished eating the food. (Or you could say getting fed) <br>\r\nChara and Asriel went to sleep.

Asriel had second thoughts at first but Chara said if he ate quicker, he could maybe stop eating sooner.<br>\r\nAsriel looked down and saw (just like yesterday) a pile of food waiting to be eaten.<br>\r\n\"Go on, Asriel! You need to get bigger!\" Chara said. Asriel smiled as he fed himself the delicious cakes.<br>\r\n\"Mrph...Got any more...?\" Asriel asked, chewing down the last remaining pieces of the cake as another one went through his mouth. Asriel's belly was growing again.<br>\r\nLarger and larger. His belly wasn't the only thing growing though. His buttcheeks had slowly been growing too, almost triple the size of golfs balls. Same goes for his newly-grown boobs which lay on top of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel kept eating and eating, growing and growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the food was gone, Asriel himself was about the size of a shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asriel! Look how big you've gotten!\" Chara said as she squeezed a fraction of his fluffy belly. \"Chara... This is a little worrying...\" Asriel replied.<br>\r\n\"Oh, looks like we ran out of food. I'll go to the Kitchen to grab more!\" Chara said as she crept to the Kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Asriel had no care for how big he was getting. He only knew he wanted more! But sometimes those thoughts kept bugging him.<br>\r\nAt the beginning he only wanted to get big to be stronger than his dad. But now was different. He wanted to break the world record for the world's biggest goat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara returned with more food, not even being able to speak before Asriel devoured half of it in 10 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Asriel! You seem very hungry!\" Chara said. \"I'm <b>REALLY</b> hungry Chara... In fact, I don't know how hungry I am. I just know that I'm<i> staaaaaarving</i>!\"<br>\r\nAsriel said, mouth full of cake, pie and chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very visible now. You could see Asriel growing by the scond just by looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound was heard from underneath Asriel. *creeeeak*... Asriel was too focused on eating to hear it but Chara heard it. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CREEEAK*  then *SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed broke in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel was so embarrassed on what he just done but Chara on the other hand was proud.<br>\r\nThe food was piling up inside Asriel, expanding him by the second.<br>\r\nUntil they both realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Toriel think?

If they did that, Mom and Dad would be angrier. Chara knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara understood that the only thing they could do was confess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning came, Chara had to sleep on a quarter of Asriel's belly because he destroyed their bed. Chara got up and before they could get out the room they saw their parents (Toriel and Asgore) standing there and staring at their now morbidly obese son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara jumped down and explained the whole situation, the plans, and what they were going to do before they realized they would find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel kneeled on the ground, level height with Chara. \"Chara, my dear....\" Toriel began. She then hugged Chara tightly.<br>\r\nChara was totally confused. on why Mom had hugged them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My child, we already knew you were getting Asriel bigger.\" Toriel said. Chara looked up at Toriel. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"You see, child, I heard you sneaking into the kitchen at night and getting snacks. I was kind of proud of how stealthy you were. But Asriel, couldn't even walk without me hearing from a mile away, haha! \" Toriel said. \"So me and your father decided that we will help you fatten up Asriel!\"<br>\r\nChara was so shocked. \"Really, Mom? Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the fattening truly began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel made the pies and went to the store to get more food while Asgore delivered them to Chara which fed the food to Asriel. It seemed that plan worked very well, because within half an hour Asriel had filled up his and Chara's bedroom. His body pressed up against the walls causing actual strain against Toriel's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel's head poked out the doorway to the bedroom as the room was filled with Asriel's fluffy blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gulp...this is so good...Gulp...chara...Gulp...here did...Gulp...mom get this stuff...Gulp\" Asriel asked gulping down food every second.<br>\r\n\"Oh, well since our mom's the queen, the store managers made a section just for you! Filled with pies, cakes and chocolate bars!\" Chara replied.<br>\r\nAsriel smiled as his body grew further through the house, soon filling up the three bedrooms, the basement, the living room, and the kitchen. Asriel's head was poking out the basement door heading into Snowdin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel's buttcheeks were filling up the RUINS while his body filled up his old home.<br>\r\nAsriel was probably about 24000 lbs swelling further as more food came into his mouth.<br>\r\nThe RUINS were now completely filled up with buttcheek blubber and Snowdin was almost covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel was eating very quickly. Too quickly. He remembered the prmoise from earlier Chara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you eat really quickly then you can stop eating earlier.\" He was eating three times quicker than Chara wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was still eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do?</span></div></div>",

If they were going to help Asriel get strong, new tactics were needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, Asriel sat up in bed, stretching, his shirt lifting a up to reveal a small amount of pudge on his stomach. When it went back down, a little bit stayed in view. He stared at it for a few seconds, before Chara got his attention. He pulled his shirt down, and listened to Chara. They told him of a new plan, and unsure if it would work, he rose some counter points. Chara brushed those off, telling him to stick to the new plan no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were called down for breakfast, the two went down, wondering what Toriel had made. Arriving to the table, they smelled the food before seeing what it was. When Toriel uncovered the lid keeping it warm, there lay a stacked pile of large pancakes. She gave them each a plate, letting them pick out how many they wanted. While Chara put two on theirs, Asriel took three. Taking turns with the maple syrup, both poured enough on their plate to soak through the food. Toriel sat down opposite of Asgore, serving herself, and then they all began to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chara finished their share of pancakes, they were almost shocked to see Asriel grabbing three more. They thought he'd stop at four, but he ate all six pancakes that he grabbed, and a reminder that they were large, almost ten inches in diameter. Even he looked surprised when he swallowed his last bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up with Asriel, the child noticed his shirt was riding up again, the lower half of his navel exposed. Passing by the pantry, it occurred to them that maybe they should get some snacks for Asriel, make his growth go quicker. Chara made sure they were out of sight and earshot from Asriel's parents. It was either now or risk getting caught. What do they do?</span></div></div>",

After ten seconds of searching, they decided to grab a jumbo jar of marshmallow fluff and another of peanut butter, taking a pre cut loaf of bread with then, and racing up the stairs to catch up with Asriel while carrying all of it. Silently opening one of the jars, they're about to offer some marshmallow and peanut butter sandwiches to Asriel when it occurred to them that maybe he shouldn't have his entire belly stuffed to the brim, visible where his parents would most definitely ask about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the jar, they hide away the food inside the room closet, making sure that they wouldn't be easily spotted, and then went to play with Asriel in the living room. He asked them what the jars and long package were for, not having seen the contents, and Chara said that they were for later. Trusting them, he looked around for more toys so that both of them could play together as his large breakfast slowly digested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours, the two were getting bored, and seeing that his gut had grown smaller, Chara told Asriel to wait there as they got something. Knowing that Asgore and Toriel would be busy with the kingdom for at least another hour, they returned to the pantry. Searching the place for more food, they settled on a box of double chocolate cookies, their personal favorite, as well as a box of snickerdoodle cookies, Asriel's favorite. Grabbing a napkin as well, Chara brought both of the boxes to the living room, opening the boxes and handing the snickerdoodle one to Asriel, both of them sitting down to eat the cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thirty minutes, Asriel had demolished the box of cookies he had, his gut groaning as it took on more and more. Still wanting more sweets, held out his hand for the chocolate cookies. As Chara was finishing up their snack, they allowed Asriel to take the box. He stopped after ten minutes. Giving the half full box to Chara, he looked at his paunch as it churned away at the remnants of the pancakes and the multitude of cookies he just ate, his sweater just barely hiding his navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempting to pull it down, Asriel lowered it by an inch on his own. Getting up to play some more, his sweater folded upwards, maintaining the same level. He pulled it down again, this time Chara assisting him. Their combined effort lead to the sweater almost completely covering his chubby gut, leaving a bit of his fatty fur exposed, but that part did hang over his pants, so it was fine. It did look very strained trying to keep everything covered, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a few minutes later, the King and Queen arrived, and as Toriel prepared lunch, Asgore went to clean up a few things in the castle, making sure everything was in order. That left the children to play on their own for a while until Toriel served. In that time, Asriel's belly had grown small enough that he was beginning to get hungry again. Just in time too, as his stomach began growling for food. </span></div></div>",

Nothing serious, he supposed, but it had been over a century since he last had a body. There were a lot of things he\u2019d forgotten about being an actual, living Boss Monster. His first thoughts were that perhaps the human, Chara, had done something. A small amount of fear struck him, before he calmed down. He thought rationally, if they really could do something to harm or injure him, it would\u2019ve happened on the outside, not the inside. This was more so of a emptiness, a missing component that was vital to his survival. And what was worse is that he didn\u2019t know what it was, but it felt like it was moving inside him. Shuddering at the thought of what it could be, he spotted the human messing around with a\u2026 What even was that? A metal container? A weapon? Increasingly curious, he went over, hiding himself in the void. Looking from over the human\u2019s shoulder, it looked like\u2026 a bunch of weird white strings floating around in weirdly colored water. He was about to go away disappointed, but\u2026 The smell that the inside of the metal thing was emitting\u2026 It was irresistible. The smell flooded his nose, making him think of something essential. Yes. He needed this. And he had to take it without the human noticing. Unfortunately for him and his plan, his abdomen started making the strange noises again, this time louder than the first. Chara noticed almost immediately, and turned their head towards Asriel, staring right at his abdomen. The noises continued. Wondering what it was, they looked at the empty throne, then back at Asriel's hidden form. They had figured out his trick. Turning back towards the metal container, they turned a switch from underneath, and flames Asriel hadn't noticed earlier disappeared. Preparing their weapon, Asriel thought. Revealing himself, Chara wasn't surprised. Grabbing the handle of the metal container, they lifted it and began moving it towards Asriel. Immediately he began preparing an attack, bracing himself for whatever the human threw at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk was confused. They heard Asriel's stomach rumble, why was he going to attack them? They did plan to eat the noodles themselves, but hearing Asriel nearby, they were friendly enough to have him eat them instead to sate his hunger. They stared at his face curiously, wondering if he was going to attack them or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that the human wasn't attacking, he put his hands down, wanting to know what they were doing with the container\u2019s contents. They handed him a metal partially-flat stick. Well, stick wasn\u2019t the most accurate term to describe it. It was curved at the handle, splitting into a four pronged trident. It was very small, it couldn\u2019t even be considered a weapon. They pulled one of their own out, and set the metal container down. Poking through the contents, the human pulled a bunch of the strings out, the colored water dripping off of it, the steam billowing from the strings and water alike, making their way to Asriel\u2019s nose and causing his abdomen to make more strange noises. The human blew on the strings, before bringing them to their mouth. Confused and fascinated by what they were doing, Asriel did the same, putting the strings into his mouth, only to find himself biting down on the strings, a marvelous flavor spreading through it, and then he swallowed. He was speechless. He hadn\u2019t remembered what eating was like, and yet, there was an entire container almost full of food. Asriel decided to take it, and disappeared to his throne with it, downing the entire thing at once. Unfortunately, his fun didn\u2019t last long, seeing as his container was empty.</span></div></div>",

Of course, that sort of had to do with him getting a Soul a while ago, just as the barrier broke. He could remember it like yesterday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Barrier was broken, Frisk was sad to see Asriel go. Unable to see him suffer, they took out their Soul, and before Asriel could even react, it was forced into him. A smile formed on their face as their consciousness began to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn\u2019t be happening. NO! He had just gotten to know their name, Frisk couldn\u2019t just die! In a burst of grief, a large amount of magic launched itself out of Asriel\u2019s new Soul, latching itself upon Frisk\u2019s body. Asriel felt unchanged, but he knew something was off about his new Soul, and that had nothing to do with the fact that it was human. As if a half of him was somewhere else. He glanced over to their body, and froze once he saw what had happened to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk began stirring, confused as to how they were still alive. They had given up their Soul, had they not? Their Determination had been inherited by Asriel, causing them to lose all control over the timeline. Is it possible that they were alive without any Soul to keep them anchored? Were they some sort of zombie? There wasn\u2019t any way of knowing for sure while lying on the ground, so they attempted to get up. However, they were too weak to even do that, just barely able to twitch their fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel stepped away from their now moving body, shocked as to what had happened to it. He didn\u2019t know what surprised him more, the fact that they were alive, or the changes that had happened to their body. Despite that, he eventually came to his senses, going to Frisk\u2019s side slowly and helping them up, anxiously wondering what their reaction would be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Asriel helping them up, Frisk could only weakly smile in return, hoping it would convey the message of thanks. Although, they did wonder why Asriel looked scared and worried. The answer came to them soon enough when they tried to take a few steps, wobbling under their feet. Even in their weakened state, they didn\u2019t know why it was so hard to just place one foot in front of the other. It felt impossible, but with their hair in the way, they couldn\u2019t see what was going on. Making a few attempts to move it out of the way, they finally managed to do so, and their first thought was that they were sharing Asriel\u2019s body. But if that was the case, why was his fur brown, and how was he carrying them at the same time? The answer came to them slowly, but Frisk pieced it together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bleat of fear escaped Asriel\u2019s not so human friend. Setting them down, they stared at themselves in shock, not knowing how this happened or why. They shouldn\u2019t even be alive at this point, how were they transformed to look like a brown furred boss monster? They attempted to take their Soul out, but they couldn\u2019t. Asriel, wondering what they were doing, asked, to which they explained about trying to take out their Soul, like they did when they were\u2026 still\u2026 human\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explains it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel was confused for a few seconds, before coming to the same conclusion that Frisk had. Frisk had somehow transformed into a fully fledged Boss Monster. Either that or they were a zombie, though that didn\u2019t explain the transformation. Still, both were happy that they were together, alive at least, and looked forwards to facing the next challenge that life threw at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Year Later...  </span></div></div>",

Today seemed very exciting for the Dreemurr family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready though his fifth pie, Asriel was only one away from catching up to Frisk, who was already starting on their seventh. Despite his belly protesting that he was full, Asriel pushed onward, shoveling slice after slice into his maw and swallowing just as fast. Frisk, however, was able to keep up the pace, maintaining a relatively safe lead in the competition. Toriel and Asgore looked on in anticipation, wondering who would win, Toriel applauding Frisk on, while Asgore was rooting for Asriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk had reached their ninth pie, while Asriel was stuck on his eighth. Once finishing it, Frisk had moved on to the last pie on their side of the table, victory in reach, just needing to stuff themself with one last pie to win this battle. Asriel had just finished his, victory far from the clutches of his claws. Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate times called for desperate measures, and Asriel took them. He had this planned for a while now, but he had never attempted it before. Of course, neither has anyone else, he would be the first to do so. Grabbing an entire pie tin, he tilted his head back and held the pie above it. Then, he dropped it, bracing himself for the taste of metal and snails. The pie was trapped in his maw, and after a few gags, Asriel finally steeled himself to push it to the back of their mouth using his hand and swallowed. A large bulge traveled down his throat, through his chest, and settled into his belly. Even Frisk paused to see what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of rubbing his throat, the metal having scratched the insides of his mouth and throat, Asriel was too determined to let a small amount of pain stop him from winning. He held up the last pie, tilting his head back again. Frisk looked on in understanding as the competition resumed. Asriel dropped the pie in, ready to swallow it. This time, he didn\u2019t gag, although he did have some trouble swallowing the pie itself. Frisk took this opportunity to catch up, leaving one last slice. They quickly grabbed it and gobbled it up, just as Asriel had swallowed his tenth pie. It was too close to see with the naked eye. Thankfully, there was video evidence to see who had swallowed before the other. The only question that remained was, who was first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four goats were examining the footage, and although it was very close, the slow mo studied by the judges, Asgore and Toriel (who had promised to be impartial), a winner was decided. The two competitors were called to the table, sitting down next to each other, guts hard at work on digesting the ten consumed snail pies. Asgore then stood in between them, holding one of their hands at his side, while Toriel made a big show of announcing who won this battle \u201cAnd the winner of the Snail Pie Eating Competition is....\u201d She made a makeshift drumroll on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsriel!\u201d Asgore lifted his son\u2019s hand as high up as it could go while Asriel was seated, a clear smile of victory on his face. Once their hand was let go, Frisk offered theirs to Asriel, and both shook, a good sign of sportsmanship on their behalf. They weren\u2019t upset at their defeat, for they would have plenty more chances to win in the end. This was only day one of the food competition they had set up. There were still six more opportunities to crush Asriel this week, and the last one would be on the date that they became a boss monster, celebrating one whole year of monsterkind freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel had gotten off the seat and begun waddling over to his room, and closed the door behind him, laying on his bed as a food coma began to overtake him, dozing off to the thoughts of a pie belly to play with afterwards, as well as wondering what the next six competitions were. Whatever would happen, he sure would enjoy it.</span></div></div>",

Sunlight, changing weather, fields and lakes to play with others, different foods from other cultures, even other hidden monster civilizations already having integrated into human society, discovered thanks to Frisk and Asriel. Despite everything, some things just never change for some. Frisk was a perfect example of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk never liked having tacos, at least not as a monster. And even before that, they always saw them as too greasy. They never bothered to say anything about it though, as to not hurt Toriel\u2019s feelings. Besides, it wasn\u2019t all too bad. The shell and toppings usually absorbed it, although Toriel was known to go a little overboard with the meat occasionally. There wasn\u2019t much to do at that point except eat it all, being a boss monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small fact about boss monsters. They had a naturally large appetite for food, a little more than double a human\u2019s average capacity. And Frisk, not wanting to miss out on any growth spurts the future might have, had to adjust to eating more over the last year. They succeeded, although they had to find out the hard way that some of their previously favorite foods had changed in flavor and texture. Like how cinnamon was more notable in flavor, and how chewy candy seemed to stick to their teeth more often than not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey knew they had to eat most of the tacos to maintain a health weight, but\u2026 Leaving one or two to the side wouldn\u2019t hurt, right? Where to put it though as to not attract suspicion..? An idea occurred to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen none of the other goats were looking, Frisk quickly put one of their tacos onto Asriel\u2019s plate. They put one more, and then ate the rest, hoping they wouldn\u2019t be caught. Being the heavy eating boss monster that he is, Asriel either didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t care. Either way, once dinner was finished, not a single morsel was left on anyone\u2019s plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrisk was curious however. Asriel had eaten all of his tacos, plus the two extra Frisk had placed in front of him. Something told them that wasn\u2019t his limit. In the nearly one year of being a boss monster themself, they had never considered using their own body as a test subject. But yet, there it was, the unknowingly perfect subject to try it on. Sure, it would take a lot of planning and covering up their tracks, but if done well, they\u2019d figure out what a boss monster\u2019s limit is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days of planning later, and Frisk was ready to start testing out Asriel\u2019s full capacity. First, came breakfast. They had considered a lot of things, and hopefully, nothing could decimate their plan. If it did flop, or even backfire, they\u2019d just improvise the best they can and go from there. As three of the goats sat down, Toriel brought over a platter full of freshly baked biscuits, setting it in the middle of the table. Once all of them were sitting down, they began stacking biscuit after biscuit on their plates, Frisk making sure to grab five extra. It was time to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Frisk\u2019s plan unfold? </span></div></div>",

Or what if there was already a large amount of food served? They had solutions to that, albeit a little weird, but solutions nonetheless. For now, they\u2019d have to focus on phase one. Secretly placing extra food on his plate, especially without anyone\u2019s knowledge. The minutes ticked by as the family ate their meal, Frisk placing the biscuits onto Asriel\u2019s plate. Upon finishing their breakfast, they looked towards Asriel. His plate had three remaining, and he ate the last few biscuits without another thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process repeated itself for the next few meals, all throughout the week. It worked, although it was fairly obvious Asriel had yet to reach his limit, seeing as there wasn\u2019t any sort of sign pointing to that. It appeared that Phase Two would have to be put into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, when both kids were playing, Frisk called for snacks to be sent to them, and of course, they made sure they were Asriel\u2019s favorites. Once the platter was emptied, mostly thanks to Asriel, they\u2019d continue playing while the Toriel and Asgore were dealing with kingdom issues. This process repeated itself three times a day, until on Thursday, something incredible happened. Asriel himself asked for a second platter of snacks to be brought with the first. This excited Frisk, as it meant that Asriel did indeed have a lot of room, but about how much was the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next week, the average amount of platters brought to them in a day increased to 5, with some days reaching 6 total platters. And snacks weren't the only thing that changed. During mealtimes Asriel would ask for a little more each day, as if he wasn\u2019t satisfied by the portions served to him, and that was including the extra food sneaked onto his plate. His appetite wasn\u2019t the only thing to change either, as his thin figure had a small bump poking out from it. Asriel had begun to put on weight, but thankfully, it wasn\u2019t noticeable in the slightest. It took Frisk watching Asriel change into his night clothes to recognize that he had a small belly from the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, Frisk still didn\u2019t think that it was enough. Sure, it was working for the time being, but Asriel was putting on weight. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to perhaps it was time to start Phase 3 and quickly reach his limit before either parent suspected?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once weighing about 100 pounds Asriel now sported a decent sized gut and weighed 180 pounds. He had gone up a few shirt sizes even the XL he was wearing seemed a little tight. Asriel was starting to look like his dad but still was only a forth of his weight. Asgore put on a few pounds as well making most anybody look small in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel woke up to the sound of his gut groaning for food. He got up and went to the kitchen to see if there was anything to eat. It was still very early in the morning. He browsed the fridge for a minute, grabbed some leftover pizza, and ate it. He ate 4 slices before he felt satisfied. After he finished eating he went back to his room and went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel woke to the smell of bacon and eggs. His mom, Toriel, makes the most delicious food anybody has ever tasted. Asriel walked into the kitchen ready to eat some breakfast when he saw both his parents in the kitchen. It\u2019s taken a while but his parents are actually starting to get along better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning\u201d Toriel said.

Well look at yourself, I\u2019m not the only one that\u2019s gotten bigger\u201d Asgore said. Both Asriel and Asgore looked down at their fat guts and laughed. Asgores body jiggled with every laugh and Asriel had a little bit of a bounce in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel made his plate and started eating. He couldn\u2019t help but admire his dads massive gut, how big and soft it was. He wanted one just like it.

He pulls his shirt off to reveal his big fluffy man boobs. They were somehow still quite perky for male breasts but were stuffed with blobby fat. His tummy was massive, allowing for a rest for his already big moobs and was now near to dragging against the floor. Most of his gain went to his butt, however. Asriel was quite embarrassed by this. He turned around to see the reflection of the rounded tubby mass of ass as it jiggles from side to side. His cheeks were bright red remembering that he no longer had any shorts that fit it; he now was forced to wear Toriel\u2019s already massive panties that now hung on his booty snuggly. At this pint his booty was the biggest in the family even past Toriel\u2019s. When she passed by him, Toriel gave Asriel a playful smack on what she called his \u201cbaby cakes.\u201d <br>\r\nIn spare time, Asriel explored how to move with his body. He shook his booty around in his mother\u2019s panties and began to laugh as he did so. At this point he was secretly turned on by the sight of not only his own butt cheeks quivering and jiggling, but also his own mother\u2019s. Asriel had never had a crush on his mom in that way before he got rather obese. <br>\r\nOne day Toriel came bursting into his room; she was completely naked and had smirk across her face. \u201cMy sweet Asriel, I hope you know I\u2019ve known you\u2019ve been viewing me as more than your mother but also as a crush. Well now that Asgore has gone to find himself in spirit, I think it\u2019s the right time to tell you I also love you as a romantic partner even over being my son. You are the most beautifully blobby thing in my whole life... I know you want my toshie woshie, my baby boy! Why don\u2019t get you a little excited now that we\u2019re so honest with each other?\u201d Toriel had plumped up to attempt to match her son and new lover\u2019s obese stature and now their ass sizes were about the same. She began to shake her ass in his face; Asriel was turned on by Toriel, he could no longer deny it. Soon they rubbed their fat asses against each other and attempted to slap each other\u2019s asses as they did it. A new generation of goat love was brewing as they cuddled next to each other, smushing their fat bellies and soon once more pressed their fat asses into one another, cuddled for a while and embraced in a kiss, then turned around, kissed each other on the butt cheeks with Asriel leaving hickeys on Toriel\u2019s ass while Toriel left her lipstick kisses on Asriel\u2019s, even using her new lipstick to write baby cakes on Asriel\u2019s left booty cheek, and they soon fell asleep lying next to each other.

He got out of his room, \u201cI\u2019m going for a walk\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk just be back before 8\u201d Asgore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel went outside and started walking towards the library, he knew that it had a few magical books that he could use. He got to the library and it was quite, never a lot of people here just the occasional guy or 2. The more magical books were stored in the back of the library. After a few minutes of looking he found what he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is, Magic Of The Body\u201d Asriel said. He brought the book to the librarian ready to check out his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you find everything you\u2019re looking for\u201d the librarian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d Asriel said, handing her the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh one of the magic ones. What do you plan on doing with this one?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I. Uh...\u201d Asriel didn\u2019t really know what to say if someone asked what he was doing, but he didn\u2019t want to admit that he wanted to get fatter. \u201cUh well you see...\u201d he tried to say something, but he came short of words so he just looked down at his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh looking to take off a few pounds?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah\u201d Asriel said, it was a complete lie but he didn\u2019t want her to think he was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Ok. The book is due in a month\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d Asriel said. He rushed home with the book. He couldn\u2019t wait to use it. Asriel finally got home, said hi to his parents, and went into his room. He sat at his desk and opened the heavy book. There were so many different spells, from being an inch taller to completely changing how your body looked, the book had everything. He finally found what he was looking for, a chapter of spells that make people gain weight. He skimmed through the pages and found a few spells that caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll use...\u201d he said.</span></div></div>",

On the third day since his parents left on vacation his gut has grown too much for his sweatpants, thankfully his dad had some larger clothes in his room. His whole body filled out with fat, and each day he weighed himself, 227, 238, 259, 296. Asriel ended up thinking that this was way to fast for his liking so he looked for another spell that was more linear gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly he found one that fit what he wanted. The spell would make the person who it is cast on gain some weight set by the caster and would stack every day. The book gave some examples like, 1, 2, 3 and, 2, 4, 6. Asriel cast the spell on himself and set the starting weight at 3. Asriel watched the numbers slowly climb, 299, 305, 314...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday the book was finally due and Asriel weighed a hefty 494 pounds. It was a miracle that he could easily move around and even more of a miracle is that the sweatpants haven\u2019t even ripped. Asriel went into town that day and bought some essential things like much bigger clothes, he also brought the book with him to see if he could renew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsriel got to the library and renewed the book. As he was leaving there was a shelf that had a sign in front of it that said FREE BOOKS. Asriel asked if he could take some books home and the librarian assured him that he could take as many as he liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked through the books and was surprised to see that there were quite a few magical books on the shelf.
