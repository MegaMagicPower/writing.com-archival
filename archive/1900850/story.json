            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For currently unknown reasons, powerful energies gathered together, and in a great burst, completely altered reality. It did so by merging four distinct and different time periods into one new time period that had elements of each of the four. The four time periods that had been combined were none other than four important times for Duel Monsters, and they were the era of Yugi Muto, the era of Jaden Yuki, the era of Yusei Fudo, the era of Yuma Tsukumo, and the era Yuya Sakaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this new reality, the city was called New Domino Heartland City, and it took elements from Domino City, New Domino City, Heartland City, and Maiami City from Yugi, Yusei, Yuma, and Yuya's cities. It also had some of the elements of Duel Academy Island surrounding it like the forests and the the volcano, and connected by bridge was Satellite. The city was a popular destination for Duelists from around the world due to its Pro dueling arenas, and its highways for Turbo Dueling. Notable foreign duelists included Rebecca Hawkins from America, Sherry Leblanc from France, Vivian Wong from China, Greiger from Peru, Team Unicorn from Spain, and Team Ragnarok. Occasionally, a Duel Monster from the Spirit world might even visit from their world. One notable monster was the Dark Magician Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi still attended Domino High School with his friends like Tea, Joey, and the others. Yugi still had the Millenium Puzzle, and the spirit within it still had yet to regain its memories. Kaiba also attended like in the original time period, and was still the head of KaibaCorp. Mai lived here on her own. Ishizu also worked at the museum. And Kisara from ancient Egypt had been reincarnated in this new time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike in Yuya's time, their were many Duel schools in the city, including Jaden's Duel Academy. The grounds of the Academy was on the edge of town, and it had all the dorms of the other, and now it also had the new Junior dorm. Jaden and friends were in their first year but Jaden still had Yubel, Blair and Hassleberry were students with them, and Jesse, Aster, Axel, Jim, Adrian, Reggie MacKenzie, and David Rabb were visiting transfer students from different Academies. Zane, Atticus, and Seika were each in the final year. Along with the original, the Duel Academy that Akiza, the twins, and their friends attended was also present, as well as Yuya's You Show Duel School and thte Leo Duel School, and many others<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei, Jack, and Crow had their garage. But Rex was also still head of Sector Security, and Kalin, Carly, and Misty weren't Dark Signers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma and his friends all attended their Middle School. Yuma still had Astral, and still working on collecting the Numbers. Dr. Faker was also the head and founder of Heartland, his deal with Barian not in effect anymore in this new time either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for corporations, Reiji's Leo Corporation rivaled that of Kaiba Corp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden's Duel Academy, Yugi's High School, Akiza's Duel Academy Yuma's Middle School, and Yuya's You Show Duel School were all close to one another. And of course, Yugi, Jaden, Yusei, Yuma, Yuya, and their friends knew each other, and were friends themselves. Yugi, Jaden, Yusei, Yuma, and Yuya were all close, each having won tournaments like Duelist Kingdom, the Fortune Cup, and the WDC. Astral and the spirit of the Puzzle had a bit of a friendship, being able to relate to one another's situation. Tea was close friends with Alexis and her friends, Akiza, Tori, and some of the other girls. Yugi could also see spirits like Jaden, Jesse, Chazz, and Luna, and his Kuriboh was friends with Jaden's Winged Kuriboh and Luna's Kuribon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no one knew that this new, fused time period was any different. As far as everyone knew, things had always been like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the power that had caused this wasn't finished, and it was going to cause something else to happen. Now, what will happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Mysterious Spell Card \"Gender Swap\"</b>: A strange card is found, and it can cause male and female characters to change into the opposite gender. Can happen instantly or gradually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Mischief of the Swap Frog</b>: Inspired by the Journey of the Swap Frog by Stardust. A Swap Frog card with a spirit obtains the power to swap things, and uses it to have some fun with the characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Mysterious Spell Card \"Life Swap\"</b>: Through strange cards found, various different characters swap lives with each other. People find the card, and are life swapped with someone else who found the card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Duelist Monsters</b>: A mysterious energy energizes certain cards important to people for unknown reasons, causing the owners of the cards and/or those close to them to gain traits of those cards. Examples include Yugi and Tea gaining the powers and clothes of the Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl, and the Signers gain powers and clothes related to their dragons.<br>\r\nOr it could be a bit scrambled and make it so that people get other cards based on the opposite gender<br>\r\n*Note 1:One or the other happens based on the first for it to happen to, for example, if Yugi and Tea find  gain the Dark Magicians of their gender, then everyone gets their own or close to it, so Jaden would get Neos, . But if Yugi ended up as Dark Magician Girl, everyone gets opposite gender based, like Jaden gets Alexis's Cyber Prima, and Yusei as Akiza's Black Rose Dragon.<br>\r\n**Note 2: Also, for the first time, you can leave an option for physical changes like gender to take place or not. After that, all following choices follow that option.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today had been a rather boring day to say the least.  Jaden had woken late to a note from Cyrus reminding him of the weekend holiday and how he was now on his way home to be with family.  Jaden was rather fine staying at Duel Academy over the long weekend, maybe now he could get some sleep.  After the Shadow Duels and all the stuff he'd been through, maybe all he really wanted was a good nap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this did not seem to be the case as even after Jaden had tried to fall back to sleep he found himself unable to force himself back to sleep.  He had fallen asleep rather early last night so it was understandable.  No matter how much Jaden pined for the warmth of his bed, he did eventually realize he had to get up and get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressing himself in his usual school attire of black shirt, white slacks, black socks, red boxers, red jacket, and boots, Jaden stepped out his dorm and started the walk to the cafeteria.  After arriving at the cafeteria, Jaden loaded his plate with all the fixings and food he could handle then slowly made his way over to a table.  However, just before Jaden began to swallow his food whole, he heard someone call him.  Looking up it was Alexis one of his close friends sitting with a few of her friends named Mindy and Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden, why don't you come sit with us?\" asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on Jaden.  We don't bite,\" said Mindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes you do,\" mocked Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it was one time,\" rebutted Mindy before the two girls descended into playful bickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiring company, Jaden quickly shifted over to the girl's table and began to eat chiming in only when he could part himself from his food or whenever he was specifically called on.  However, as Jaden finished up his meal he noticed something about the girls that had not clicked till just then, they were not wearing their uniforms.  Jasmine, the brown-haired girl Jaden saved from an escaped monkey, was dressed rather nicely in pink T-shirt top and blue jeans and a pair of low heels that at present she was currently playing with slipping her feet in and out of repeatedly.  Mindy, the shoulder-length black-haired girl, was wearing a yellow T-shirt that happily showed her mid-drift with a pair of shorts and sneakers, though much like Jasmine, Mindy was also slipping her feet in and out of her shoes repeatedly revealing her mis matched ankle socks, one lime green and the other orange and yellow striped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis was also not wearing her uniform.  Instead she was wearing a rather lovely white dress top that came down to a little above her hips.  Under that she wore a pair of jean shorts that ended just below her knees revealing her knee high pink socks.  However, unlike Mindy and Jasmine, Alexis's shoes, simple black mary janes with a slight heel, were completely off, no doubt a sign that she preferred her socks to any other footwear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter scanning Alexis and the girls over for a moment, he found himself not just admiring their beauty, but rather strangely he found himself wonder what it must be like being a girl.  Obviously not one to hide his thoughts, Alexis soon asked, \"Jaden, you look like you have something on your mind.  What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Alexis.  I don't know why,\" answered Jaden, \"But I was looking at you girls in your cool outfits talking about stuff and laughing, and I just started wondering what it would be like to be a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" thought Alexis, rather shocked that Jaden was thinking rather deeply on something, \"I would guess it's probably not too much different from being a boy.  Though... there would be some differences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\" asked Jaden.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy chimed in, \"Well, boys don't usually care about looking nice.  We girls really do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys can look nice and handsome too,\" answered Jaden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy just smirked.  \"Jaden, how much effort did you put into your outfit this morning?\"  Jaden was going to retort but as he thought about it he eventually conceded the thought.  \"Thought so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis agreed and offered, \"There's of course the general difference in certain parts.  Wider hips, breasts, genitals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then offered, \"Plus there's the types of clothes.  I mean you don't see a lot of boy walking around in skirts or some length of heel.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden pondered these thoughts for a few moments.  This idea of what it must be like to be a girl would just not leave him alone or even back down for a moment.  He needed to know.  Turning to Alexis, Jaden asked, \"Alexis, do you mind if we switch shoes for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis was a little taken aback by this sudden question.  \"Why do you want to try on my shoes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see what it's like to walk like a girl.\"  Alexis was a little perplexed by this, but the thought of seeing Jaden in heels did intrigue her a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure why not.  It's not like the teachers can hound us for this.  I mean it is vacation weekend.\"  Alexis then slid her shoes over to Jaden who was already untying his boots.  With several yanks, Jaden's boots came off, a reminder that he should visit the school's store and try to get a larger pair.  Taking Alexis's shoes, Jaden wondered if his black socked feet would even fit.  However, he wanted to try so why not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping his feet into Alexis's shoes, Jaden was surprised that his foot did indeed fit.  Granted the fit was snug, but as time passed Jaden was surprised how comfortable they become.  \"Alexis these feel awesome.  I can see why you like them said Jaden as he wiggled his toes inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Jaden,\" said Alexis as she pondered trying on Jaden's boots.  They were rather large on her, but it might be fun.  Besides what would she wear to get back to the dorm room?  However, before Alexis could continue with her thought, she heard the cry of someone stumbling then a horrendous crash.  Looking, she saw Jaden sprawled out on the floor.  Alexis went over and helped the boy up.  \"Jaden are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine, but walking in heels is pretty difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis chuckled a little before answering.  \"Welcome to taking your first few steps as a girl.\"  Little did the two know they were quickly journeying down the path that would change them forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Upon their arrival, they snuck Jaden up to their room, and pulled off his jacket, hanging it up on a coatrack in the corner. Alexis pushed Jaden onto her bed, before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jaden, let's get going on dolling you up\" Alexis smiled \"Where would you like for us to start?\"</span></div></div>",

Usually, it liked to swap peoples bodies, clothes, personalities, ect. This time however, it had a brand new idea. One it deemed to be very amusing for it to watch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it leaped out of its card, completely invisible to even Jaden's ability to see card spirits thanks to its power, and then leaped through him and Alexis. As soon as it returned to its card, there was a bright and blinding flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bright light died down, Jaden looked around in confusion to see what had just happened. He found out as soon as he looked at Alexis...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaah!!!\" exclaimed Jaden. \"Why are you suddenly wearing my clothes, Alexis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly confused because of the flash, Alexis looked down at herself. She was wearing her usual outfit; a blue skirt combined with a belt colored in a light blue hue; royal blue high-heeled boots; a sleeveless jacket made of white colored fabric with some blue marks around the collar and on the front side in chest level, and a pair of fingerless gloves which reached from her wrists up to her elbows. However, something shifted inside her head and it suddenly seemed to her that this actually was Jaden's outfit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, Alexis blushed bright red as she grabbed the skirt and brought her legs close together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?! Why am I in a skirt?!\" she shouted, blushing brighter as Jaden giggled slightly, \"Oh shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, you just look ridiculous like that,\" Jaden said, still laughing. The fact that Alexis was a girl, and therefore there was nothing wrong with her being in a skirt, was apparently lost on both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you start laughing too much, you might want to take a gander at what YOU are wearing,\" retorted Yubel, with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jaden asked, looking down at himself. He too, was wearing his usual outfit; a red jacket that extended to his waist, with a band matching the color of the jacket at the cuffs of the arms, a white band around the shoulders with a button to keep the jacket closed and another matching band wrapped around the bottom of the jacket which also served the purpose of keeping the jacket closed (although Jaden liked to keep his open), a white decorative shape with a darker red border on the chest of the jacket; a black shirt uderneath the jaket; dark jeans and a pair of red and black sneakers. However, also like Alexis, it now seemed to him that he was wearing his friend's clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! I'm wearing your clothes, Alexis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, duh!\" said Alexis. \"But I'd like to have my own clothes back now, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't change clothes in the middle of the hallway,\" said Jaden. He looked around for someplace where they wouldn't be seen, or disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of place does he find?</span></div></div>",

She accepted the call, followed by the video call from a distressed Yuma panicking, \"Anna!\" he yelled, \"What's doing on, People keep calling me Mr. Kaboom!?\".<br>\r\n\"Just come home, and I'll explain.\" She said calmly and hung up before Yuma could say (or shout) anything else.<br>\r\nShe laid back again, thinking about what she could say to Yuma when he gets back.<br>\r\nSoon she heard the door open and close, followed by Kari saying \"Hey doofus.\"<br>\r\nShe then heard heavy footsteps coming up the stairs into the room.<br>\r\n\"Anna!\" He bellowed, \"What is going on!?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, honey,\" she said calmly with a slightly smug tone, Yuma seemed confused why he was being called 'honey'.<br>\r\n\"Somehow, we are now married,\" Anna showed Yuma her ring, and pointed out his plain golden one, \"Also, those trophies over there,\" she said pointing at a cupboard \"Tell me we are in the tag team pro-league as a pair.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it was weird that Mayday was praising me as a league winner, but of course I would have won if they had let me in,\" Yuma said in his normal tone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, the frog quickly leaped out of its card and through its eight targets. When it returned to its card, there was a bright flash of light as its new change took effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bright flash of light died down, Yuma and the girls were now elsewhere. Instead of being outside, they were now indoors. Their new location was a familiar garage, the one belonging to Yusei and Team 5D's. However, like before, no one seemed to notice that anything was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, how are things with my Duel Runner?\" Yuma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is fine. Its running great.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me. You're the best, Anna.\" he replied s he looked over the Duel Runner that belonged to Akiza. \"I'll have to take it out for a ride later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Swap Frog had done a special swap between the two groups, swapping roles between them. Now, Yuma and the girls were the members of Team 5D's instead of Yusei and the others. Of course, the swap had done more than just that. Though he had swapped with Akiza, Yuma was the team leader, since he was the best duelist on the team. He still had his own deck, of course. But the role swap had swapped more than just team affiliation. Yuma was now a student at Duel Academy instead of Akiza, who now attended Heartland Academy in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the girls, Anna was number 2 on the team. She had swapped with Yusei, and thus was the team's mechanic. She was also the best rider in the group, and the second best duelisr. Cathy was next, and she didn't really do much seeing as how Jack had no job. As for Tori, she was at the bottom, as the swap hadn't really affected her skills; she was still a novice duelist and thus merely their alternate. Although she did now have Crow's job doing deliveries. None of the girls attended school now, and Yusei, Jack, and Crow instead had taken their places in class. They, along with Akiza, were first years at Heartland Academy. And since he had swapped with Akiza, he wore a girls uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the swap was more in-depth than that. The frog had made sure to swap their roles in a way. Their new roles affected how people perceived them. For example, with Akiza's role now his own, even though Yuma was a boy, he was also viewed like a young woman of Akiza's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this new reality, Yuma, Anna, Cathy, and Tori were a Turbo Duel Team, though they were instead called Team ZEXAL. Yuma attended Duel Academy while the girls had no school. Even though he had taken Akiza's role, who was at the top of her class, he was still a lazy student and didn't pay attention much. The girls would often hang around their garage, with Anna working on their Duel Runners, Tori working on deliveries, and Cathy not doing much. All three girls also still possessed their crush on Yuma, however Yuma also possessed a bit of a crush on Anna now due to Akiza's role and Anna getting Yusei's role.</span></div></div>",

She had on his red vest over his purple shirt with the green D decal on the front, and his white pants with the orange patterns on the bottom on the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four were first year students at Heartland Academy in place of their respective swap partner, meaning the boys wore the girls uniform while Akiza wore the boys uniform. Akiza still had her old study habits, and she and Yusei were at the top of the class. Jack was a poor student who didn't pay much attention. Crow was somewhere in the middle as a student. The four were also the creators of the unofficial \"Signer Club\" in place of the group Yuma's friends had founded, the \"Numbers Club\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for other changes, while being unchanged, they were also partly viewed like the kind of person they had swapped with. While Yusei, Jack, Crow, and Akiza were young adults, the male three were also viewed and treated as if they were younger girls, and Akiza similarly like a younger boy. Yusei now possessed Anna's flying cannon, and while he wasn't as quick to use it as her, he would often use it for transportation. Jack meanwhile, was now an avid cat lover, though he definitely wasn't as quiet as Cathy had been. Crow was as supportive and cheerful as Tori, though he was still as good a duelist as he had been. And as for Akiza, she seemed to get a bit more exitable, though not as much as Yuma himself. Similarly to their swap partners, they had each gained a crush on Akiza since the girls each like Yuma, while Akiza kept her own feelings for Yusei, though had gained a bit of obliviousness from him.</span></div></div>",

To his right, ever-gleaming, lay the Millenium Puzzle just beside his duel deck on the countertop, both having contributed equally to the exciting but usually dangerous events constantly surrounding his life. Not that he regretted the adventures they brought for a moment, he smiled as he got up and plopped into his desk chair. The Puzzle, especially, and the spirit within had changed his life and always pushed him to bring out his best, though he sometimes allowed himself an anxious flicker of doubt over if his other half was also his better half. Pushing the notion aside he reached out to grab its chain, only to notice a tint of green caught underneath the gold weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spell card? Did it fall out?\" Muttering to himself, he inspected the lone card that he assumed had slid out from his seemingly untouched deck, only to discover that not only was it not from his deck, but that he hadn't seen it before. \"Life Swap...spell card....instant activation. 'One card of two. Effect will not activate until both cards have been played. If only one is active on the field, it cannot be removed from play until the other Life Swap card is activated by the opposing player.' What the...I don't think monsters can swap lives.\" Chuckling at the oddity of it all, Yugi lightly flicked the card aside and tumbled back into bed with the Puzzle in his palms, failing to see that the card landed face up, as if its back were magnatized to the table, and slowly beginning to glow around the rim as it waited for its sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, what's happening with it?</span></div></div>",

He looked around, and saw that he was now on some kind of boat, and from the looks of it, was out at sea. And he wasn't alone, as nearby he saw Tea, Mai, Joey, Kaiba, Rebecca, Duke, Kisara, Ishizu, Vivian Wong, and even the other him, the spirit of the pharaoh, who currenly had a body of his own. And all of them were dressed strangely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi himself was wearing a very low-cut red top, and a red sarong that covered one leg and exposed the other. He also had gold earing that were shaped like snakes, and red high-heeled pumps. Tea meanwhile wore an open red button-up shirt, blue shorts with a yellow sash around her waist, and a straw hat on her head. Mai was dressed in a long, open green coat with three swords at her side. Joey was dressed in a bikini top and jeans, and high-heeled sandals on his feet. Kisara wore simple yellow pants with suspenders that conveniently cover her nipples, goggles around her neck, and a hat. Vivian was wearing a black suit with a tie. Rebecca wore a white and orange sleeveless shirt, orange shorts, a large blue hat with holes on the side, and no shoes. Kaiba was wearing sunglasses, a blue, v-neck vest that exposed his nevel area, a long, pink sar-like skirt, and pink high-heeled pumps. Duke was wearing an open hawaian shirt and a red speedo, and had on large robotic appendages over his arms. Ishizu had on a black suit top, an orange boa, red pants with sunflowers print, and a hat with a crown. And Yami Yugi was wearing a simple dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on? How did we get here?\" Yugi questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why on earth am I dressed in this ridiculous get-up?\" Kaiba asked irately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats what I'd like to know!\" Joey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, lets just try to stay calm.\" Tea said, trying to keep everyone from freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last thing I remember, I found a weird card, and then there was a flash, and then I was here.\" Mai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same thing happened to us.\" Tristan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mirror, they saw that instead of themselves, their reflections were of strange people. Instead of Yugi's short reflection was that of a tall and sexy woman with long black hair. Tea's was of a young man with messy black hair. Mai's was a man with green hair. Joey's was of a busty young woman with long orange hair. Kisara was of a young man with a long nose. Rebecca's wasn't even human, as she could see hers had fur, hooves, and antlers; it was of a strange looking reindeer. Kaiba's was of a woman with black hair. Duke's was of a large man with blue hair and robotic parts like his nose. Ishizu's was of a skeleton. And Yami Yugi's was of a young woman with blue hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on here? What is wrong with our reflections?\" Yugi said, averting his gaze from his own new reflection, even more embarrassed by what he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has got to be some kind of trick.\" Kaiba said, though the woman in the mirror mirrored his actions perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is mine a man?\" Vivian questioned. \"In fact, why are the only women in this thing the reflections of males?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Duke's, Rebecca's, and my own are just as strange.\" Ishizu said, finding the skeleton in the mirror in her place very strange.</span></div></div>",

Looking around, he saw that he was in some kind of an office. And with him was only Anna and Astral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma was wearing a red and brown ensemble with which exposed his navel, detached white sleeves, and red thigh-high stockings, and a red headband on his forehead. As for Anna, she wore a dark outfit that even had a cape, and for some reason had a mask in her hand. And as for Astral, who currently had a physical body, he was wearing a white outfit that looked to be used for restraint and had white high-heeled shoes on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, just what the heck is going on here?\" Yuma questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I know?\" Anna replied. \"I just found this weird card and then I was here, dressed like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, us too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a most perculiar situation.\" Astral said as he inspected his new attire. He then looked around and noticed something odd. \"You two, look in the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" the two let out in confusion, but did as he said. And when they did, they were met with surprise. Instead of Yuma's reflection was a red-head girl who looked a bit like Akiza, wearing the same clothes he now wore. Anna's reflection was that of a boy with raven hair. And Astral's reflection was that of a young woman with long green hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on? Whats wrong with my reflection?\" Yuma asked, the red haired girl mimicking his movements and words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about mine? Its a boy.\" Anna said, looking at the young man that was her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All our reflections appear to be of our opposite gender. But who are these people in the mirror? And why are they our reflections?\" Astral questioned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the flash of light died down, the card had finished its work, and a great shift had taken place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi Muto walked into the a classroom of Duel Academy. Why was he there? Well, thats because he was now a student there. But he wasn't just any student, but a student, but a student in the girls dorm.  He currently wore a white sleeveless blazer with a blue sailor-style collar, blue fingerless gloves, a blue miniskirt, and a pair of blue high heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Yugi wasn't the only male in the girls uniform. Many others that you readers might recognize were also in that dorm. Students in this class included many more males in the girls uniform besides Yugi, but many others such as Joey, Tristan, Duke, Kaiba, Jaden, Chazz, Syrus, Hassleberry, Jesse, Aster, Yusei, Jack, Crow, Leo, Kalin, Dexter, Yuma, Shark, Kite, Bronk, Caswell, Flip, and Nistro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't just males in girls uniforms. Tea entered into the classroom, and she was wearing the Slifer Red Boys uniform. Others in the Red boys uniform were Serenity, Blair, Mindy, Carly, Tori, and Anna. There were also girls in the Ra Yellow boys uniform, such as Rebecca, Ishizu, Jasmine, Patty, Misty, Cathy. And of course, there were girls in the Obelisk Blue Boys uniform, such as Mai, Kisara, Alexis, Akiza, Luna, Sherry, Rio, the other Luna, and Dextra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, while there were many in uniforms of the opposite gender, not everyone was dressed as such. There were still plenty of people in uniforms of their proper gender. However, reality had been altered and their roles had been changed. And they were even <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, not only had their roles changed, but they had been given new personalities. Yugi, Jaden, Yusei, and Yuma were quite different. With their new roles, they were all room mates in the girls dorm. Yugi was now more outspoke and exciteable with a bit of a temper, Jaden was more serious about his studies, Yusei was bubbly and could be a bit of a ditz, and Yuma was more mature and was in a way \"the leader\" of the group, with the other three looking up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for others, Tea was a pretty good duelist but a slacker when it came to her studies which is why she was in the red dorm. Alexis and Akiza were in Blue, and were riommates. Tori and Anna were in Red with Tea, and were her room mates, and the two were rivals for many things, especially Yuma's affection. The five were very close friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey, Syrus, Crow, and Shark were friends and room mates. Joey was more of a shy and quiet person. Syrus meanwhile, was more confident. Crow had a very ladylike demeanor and was very polite. And Shark was very friendly and outgoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not everyone had completely different personalities. Kaiba, Chazz, Jack, and Kite were still rivals to their . Kaiba was still quite the same, being quiet and often coming off as stuck-up. Chazz was still mostly the same, loud, and still infatuated with Alexis. Jack essentially acted exactly like a female version of himself, likening himself as a queen. And Kite still cared about his young brother, and was quite stoic about most other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisara was a student who often hung around Kaiba, who tolerated her because she reminded him of his Blue-Eyes card for some reason. Carly was a reporter for the school paper, and the number one fan of \"Queen\" Jack. Dextra and Nistro were partners, with Droite being quiet and reserved(and still in love with Kite) while Nistro was still loud and passionate, and the two were a trio with Kite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins, Leo and Luna, and their friends Dexter and Patty were a group together. Even though they were actually younger than everyone else, they had been given roles of older students. Leo was quite a bit more mature, and was viewed as one of the most attractive girls in the accademy. Luna on the other hand, was quiet and seemed stoic most of the time. The four were seniors, and Leo and Luna were at the top of their class. Luna wore the white Obelisk Blue uniform that students like Zane and Atticus had worn before this change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Mindy, still friends with eachother and Alexis, were in different dorms. But the three were still friends. Duke and Tristan were room mates, and were essentially just like Jasmine and Mindy had been. Blair was still in Slifer Red, and was friends with her fellow Slifer, Serenity. Rebecca was still quite intelligent, and was in yellow, along with others like Ishizu, Misty, and Cathy. Misty sat next to Kalin. Aster was nearby, who was now a bit more concerned with his looks. Jesse was relatively the same personality-wise. And in Blue were Mai, Sherry, Rio, and the other Luna, with the four Blues hanging around Joey's group often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmusingly, Bronk, despite his overweight appearance, was viewed as the most attractive girls in the whole accademy. He had many male admirerers, and amusingly, especially Rio. He often hung around with Caswell and Flip. Hassleberry sat with Blair, and amusingly, despite appearances, the two were view as if theu had the other's build, with the large Hassleberry being viewed as if he was a small, petite, and cute girl, while the small Blair was viewed as big, and tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the above were friends with each other. Of course, these weren't the only ones changed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of the academy, the classes for younger students was also arriving. While the twins and their friends Dexter and Patty used to be in them, now were a few new students instead. Zane sat at a desk, wearing a red blazer and black pleated skirt, talking with Atticus who was dressed the same. Also there were Seika Kohinata, Reggie, Kari, and Brianna in blue blazers with ties. Even though they were much older than the others in the class, their roles had been altered so that they were treated as if they were the same age as their classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZane was pretty cheerful, and looked up to his \"Big sister\" Syrus, and Atticus was a bit more quiet. Kari and Brianna were also close friends, . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudents weren't the only ones affected. It had also affected the faculty of the school. In the chancellor's office, Ms Dorothy sat at the desk, and was dressed like Sheppard, as she was now the head of school, and speaking of Sheppard, he was now her secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the teacher's lounge, several<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowler now wore a more feminine version of his clothes, and was now the head of the Obelisk Blue Girls dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFonda Fontaine now wore a customized Obelisk Blue boys uniform, and was now the head of the Obelisk Blue Boys dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidori Hibiki was still in red, only now viewed as a male teacher, and was the head of the Slifer Red dorm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of what had been Team Ragnarok all sat a table chatting. The three now had the roles of a trio of female teachers Haldor wore a white skirt suit, with a bit of his chest exposed. He was a friendly and popular teacher with many male admirerers, both students and teacher. Dragan wore a black skirt suit, and had glasses on his face. He was a soft spoken and quiet teacher. As for Broder, he wore a he was a very strict and stern but fair teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina and Trudge entered in together talking. Mina wore a blue suit, while Trudge wore a dark blue skirt suit.  Trudge gave her a peck on the cheek, as the two were also now teachers, and were dating in their new roles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria Bartlet meanwhile took a sip of her coffee before head to her young class, now with the role of a male teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in class, everyone was talking as they waited for class to start<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(AN: If you would like to add anyone not mentioned above into a new role, go ahead!)</span></div></div>",

Anything can happen, from gender swapping, body swapping, life swapping, mental changes, clothing changes, and many, many more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to be creative, and don't make every path come to the same conclusion. Not every path needs to lead to physical changes. And some of my favorite ideas involve no physical changes.<br>\r\nAs for how things happen, it all depends on the storyline you pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomance is allowed, and even encouraged. You can have anything between anyone, but there are a few specific ones that I particularly endorse, most notably Yugi/Tea, Jaden/Alexis/Yubel(All three together), Yusei/Akiza, and Yuma/Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters can be used from any of the four anime, as well as the mangas.<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh!<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! GX<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! 5D's<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! Vrains<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! R manga<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! GX manga<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! 5D's manga<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL manga<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V manga<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one not allowed is the TOEI anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse the english names if available. More people are familiar with them, so we'll use them for convenience.<br>\r\nSex is allowed, but just don't make every path solely about sex<br>\r\nNo killing off characters<br>\r\nNo ending the story<br>\r\nPlease try to have good grammar and such<br>\r\nAlways use all available option spots, and don't try to force a specific path.</td>",
