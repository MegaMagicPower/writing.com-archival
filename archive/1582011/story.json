In this state, she dreamed of what brought her to this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been invited by her boyfriend to join him and several other guys and girls on a sort of personal cruise. Naturally she accepted. Shortly after the boat they were on got into open waters a storm came out of nowhere. The ship was tossed by the gigantic waves and Tanya was washed overboard. She managed to stay afloat with a personal flotation device, but before she could be rescued the boat was struck by lightning. The impact of the boat\u2019s destruction knocked her out cold. Eventually the storm faded and Tanya drifted away from the wreckage to who knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Tanya started making the slow climb back to consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she wake up?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Using one hand to wipe the tears from her face, her feelings of despair and isolation melted away for the moment. Sounds could mean many things, but one of the most hopeful causes for it would be other people, jsut like her. This was why she had hushed to hear, because whoever it was evidently was unwilling to come out just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, she heard it again. A noise very similar to what one's body makes when passing through tall grass. A sort of sifting, grass-like one. But even as she peered even deeper into the fauna, she didn't see anything of note. Not even animals were in view, although Tanya suspected they would dweel deeper in the jungle than this. Well, whatever it was, it couldn't be invisible, she thought, taking another step forward to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this time she heard a very different sound. This one was crunch, like when a insect or a leaf was stepped on. And not only that, Tanya soon realized, it had come from something at her feet! Looking down in surprise, she couldn't even believe her eyes. Surely this had to be some kind of island mirage... not what it appeared to be. At her feet were a large group of tiny humans, just like her, only they seemed more of a tribal people at first glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had just come to put the pieces together and saw this, Tanya recognized that she had stepped on one of the frontmost natives, killing him insantly from the sheer weight of her foot on his body! Stepping back in anguish, she watched the scene unfold. Well, she was no longer alone, that was for sure; but this was a company she would rather not face at the moment. Even an inadverdent murder like this was would be sure to enrage the natives, she figured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the tinies at her feet, this was all but confirmed. From what she could make out, and judging by the tantrum they were throwing by this point, the weren't ahppy about the giantess who has interrupted their hunt. Already she could feel the almost unfeelable pinpricks of spears being tossed at her feet, most of them snapping due to their ineffectiveness. Already they were beginning to close in, as if her foot was a creature itself, apart from the whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These \"people\" were far from anything she'd ever seen or even heard about before, and her natural reaction was fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to find an escape route, and get away from her attackers before common sense finally dawned on her. Whatever these things were, they were only about 4 or 5 inches tall... just like an oversized insect. She looked a little closer at them, they certainly did have a very human like appearance, and characteristics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she mused over them, her eyes fell onto the crushed body of the man she had accidentally stepped on. She briefly recalled the crunch she felt through the sole of her sandal, and then... and then... he was dead. She paused that line of thought for a moment, trying to work out why that didn't upset her. She had killed what seemed to be a person; just a much smaller person, like a bug. No, rather than remorse, she actually felt... good. It felt good. The mini men on the ground below her seemed to be ferocious warriors, yet she, a girl, had killed one merely by standing on him, without any effort at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to feel that sensation beneath her again, she raised her left foot and hovered it above one of the mini warriors standing slightly away from the rest of the group, who were still busy in a vain attempt to attack her right foot. Hovering her foot above him for a second, thinking over any issues doing this might cause her (nothing came to her mind), she lowered her foot on top of him, knocking him to the floor, with his head and torso sticking out from beneath the front of her sandal. Smiling to herself at his expression of anguish, she firmly pressed her toes down onto his lower half. The agony she caused him as his legs were crushed was immediately apparent. His upper body seemed to jot upwards, slamming into the toes that were causing him this pain. Tanya giggled as she felt this, and used her big toe to flick him back, so that he lay flat on the ground. Before he had chance to recover, she lifted her foot slightly, and moved it forward a couple of inches so that her foot now completely covered his body, his crushed legs positioned beneath the arch of her foot, torso and head beneath the ball of her foot and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tanya (slowly this time) transferred her weight onto her victim, his body cracked distinctly several times, sending vibrations up through the thin sole of the sandal to Tanya's bare foot. Laughing at the concept of a seemingly defenseless girl completely \"crushing\" a ferocious fighter, literally beneath her, she leaned all of her weight on to that foot, to make sure he was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her foot resting on his body for a few seconds, she looked around at the other warriors...</span></div></div>",

Tanya selected a group of the hunters who were clustered together, and smahed her colossal foot down on top of them, giggling and relishing the squelches their bodies made as they collapsed beneath the pressure of her weight. Then, she took a few steps back pretending to leave. Tanya suddenly launched herself into the air, flying backwards, her titantic ass coming down on some more of the hunters. Tanya moaned with delight and dragged her butt back and forth, catching some of the slower tinies beneath it. Eventually, Tanya grew tired of this entertainment and plucked an unlucky guy off the ground.<br>\r\n     \"Tell me where your home is, and I may allow you to live as my slave!\" Tanya said gleefully, flashing her teeth at the terrified man. All he could do was nod, and point vaugely North. Tanya stuck him in her massive clevage, and announced \"Point the way little man!\"<br>\r\n     About ten minutes later, they arrived in a small clearing deep in the jungle. Inside was a miniature castle and village, with lots of tiny people scurrying about.

By 20 feet tall Tanya was completely naked as all of her clothes had finally fallen off. Finally at 26 feet tall, Tanya became aware that the watermelon like fruit was roughly the size of what a watermelon would look like relative to her size. At that realization, she looked around and saw her naked body and noticed how her surroundings looked smaller. \"Oh my god, did I get bigger?\" She asked herself as she dropped the piece of fruit she was holding. \"Woah, this is awesome, it must be this fruit that made me grow so much.\" And with that said, Tanya picked up the fruit that she dropped and ate it in one bite. She had only eaten two of the fruits as they were much bigger to her before she was her current size and she looked around the cave to see how many were left. She saw at least 10 more of the fruits lined up next to the caves wall and as she began thinking about the growth they caused her to undergo, her stomach growled. Tanya cut up another of the fruit and ate. Then as she began to grow again she cut up another fruit and continued to eat and grow until she had no more or the strange magic fruit left. Feeling full and tingly, she laid down in the cave and moaned. As the feeling of growth took over her whole body, she fell asleep, her body slowly swelling to 80 feet tall.</span></div></div>",

But while as her already gigantic form rose higher into the air; Tanya felt a luscious smile brightening her angelic face more and more. It felt so good, so incredibly good! The fires of arousal burning a thousand times hotter than the lava ever could, while sky-high fresh wav- well more like tidal waves - of pleasure smashed into her. The giant woman gasped and moaned in approval as she came within inches of cumming again, but this time managed to resist the urge, building up the pleasure for an even more intense climax.<br>\r\nBy now, she was 6000 feet tall at least, but she kept growing. Her growth was even All this from my stimulant...it was amazing. And nowhere near done yet. The island continued to shrink away, crowds of natives were starting to file out of their small villages, terrified to witness what was happening. With a big, luscious smile on her face and her hands gently spreading the moisture of her juices around the folds of her womanhood, Tanya watched how the small groups began to point toward her gigantic form, she almost imagined she could hear them scream and yell in either horror or shock. For a moment, some part of her wondered if she should be worried about them. Maybe she should assure them that she was harmless, maybe she should move to avoid accidently crushing them or their houses, while the growth continued. But those thoughts were pushed away as a very familiar feeling began to take hold. Tanya gasped in exhalation, as she climaxed again, and her steady growth was replaced by exponential spurts. Spurts that felt sooooooooooooo gooooood! Spurt after spurt blasted through Tanya, each drawing a thunderous cry of pleasure. She orgasmed half-way through them, but was brought back to the edge seconds after. She ascended higher and higher into the sky, as the people began to panic as we rose into the air: But they didn't matter anymore. They were insignificant, powerless, while Tanya was getting more and more powerful and divine with every spurt. Whatever was the cause for her continued, empowered growth, the fruits, the magma or the combination of both: The effect was\u2026 exhilarating. She wasn\u2019t just \u2018growing\u2019, she noticed as she watched her arms. Both were pumping up as her abs began to tone into noticeable muscles. Her breasts were growing so large that the space between them was quickly narrowing. Tanya was losing to the insane pleasure of her growth. There was no turning back, she was getting huge!<br>\r\nGroaning with enjoyment, she felt felt her arms swelling, her breasts enlarging, and her entire body swelling still higher. She couldn\u2019t allow this process to end too fast. She stamped her foot down as the shuddering made her leg muscles grow, drilling it deep into the ocean floor, hoping to find more of the precious, warming magma. Her abs toned and tightened as her breasts took up more and more of her view. And while her breasts were noticeably growing faster than the rest of her titanic body, she wasn\u2019t done with growing in height. Yet still she rose higher and higher into the air.<br>\r\nWhile her foot dug easily in the ground, she didn\u2019t feel the warm embrace of new magma, and even in the grasp of pleasure and lust, Tanya found the thought of a premature end of this sensation highly disconcerting. Trembling and squirming in pleasure she moved her gigantic body into a crawl. On all fours, she was using her breasts like giant battering rams to smash apart the volcanoes she had used for her ascension, as she crawled over them and enjoyed the warmth of their magma spreading between her swelling breasts. She, slowly, and seductively, wiggled her giant torso as she lowered it, her perfect ass swinging to and finally was smashing her one of her hands down overly forcefully, creating an impact crater and digging deep into the earth. Her giant body still trembling and squirming from pleasure, immediately reacted, the sensations became even more intense.  She moaned before swelling larger again and again.<br>\r\nNatives on other isles prayed as each climax caused Tanya's shaped rear to expand outward towards the sky. Her colossal breasts moved further and further forward, outgrowing the isle on which her ascension had started, by now each of them times bigger than the volcano she had used as a sex toy only minutes before. Tanya, whose growth had speed up noticeably, felt her feet digging deep trenches into the ocean floor, <br>\r\nShe slid one hand down her elongating body, into the soaking wet folds of her womanhood, while the other still dug deep into the ground, washed round by precious warm magma.  Tanya moaned and laughed as the island groups before her started to vanish. Soon she was almost staring right down at them and her mountain-sized breasts were fast approaching. The natives stared at the mountains of flesh, racing towards their isles. Some trying to escape this growing mountains with ships, but they simply couldn't thanks to their sheer size. One by one, Tanya's humongous breasts caught them, boats and isles alike and buried them under her still growing body. Each second of her growth was a new superlative of pleasure and every time she came, her body was brought immediately to the edge once again, and she certainly wasn\u2019t running out of steam. Her growth spurt surged to even greater heights as the colossal beauty\u2019s screams were heard all over the world. Tanya opened her half-closed eyes to watch clouds drift past them and watched the clouds fall further and further below her towering form, even crawling. Tanya's massive form expanded further and further, covering whole island groups and wiping out everyone and everything on them. And still she grew.<br>\r\nTanya fingered herself vigorously and she groaned and moaned in approval. She smiled as her body spread further and further out, crushing more islands and ships. And still she grew. Tanya passed 60,000 feet, 70,000 feet, 80,000 feet\u2026<br>\r\nFinally, at staggering 120,000 feet tall, her massive spurt came to an end. With a lusty sigh, she her fingers out of her pussy and grunted  satisfied as her hips and breasts expanded yet again and her back toned and hardened. She didn't bother to stand as she rolled over to face the sky. Her back flattened the coast of a large isle, like it was nothing. By and by the splendour of ecstasy began to wane, and Tanya just lay there, recuperating.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

Besides there aren\u2019t any laws here and there\u2019s nothing a little thing a few inches high can do to me.\u201d Tanya thought. She crept silently through the bushes to a position closer to her prey, and out of view of the hut\u2019s tiny windows. Tanya readied herself, and with speed of a striking snake she grabbed the tiny man and drew him back into the bushes. Without pause she tossed the man into her mouth and swallowed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya stayed there for a moment, feeling the man struggle inside her. \u201cThe appetizer was good. Now let\u2019s see about the main course.\u201d Tanya whispered to herself before approaching the hut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya sat down, using her legs to surround the tiny dwelling and prevent any escape from the occupants. She reached down to pull the leafy roof from the hut, but instead she lifted the whole hut from the earth. \u201cAh well, either way.\u201d Tanya thought as she tossed the hut aside and gazed down at her captives. Both were female, probably the man\u2019s wife and daughter. Tanya grabbed the one she assumed was the wife and swallowed her. She took her time playing with the daughter; letting her run away for a bit from her hand, licking her, slowly slurping her into her mouth, before finally swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm. Those were good.\u201d Tanya moaned happily as she rubbed her now full belly. She stood up and crushed the hut beneath her foot before heading out to seek shelter.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I need to find somewhere to live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya gathered up her clothes, just in case, before continuing her search for shelter. Eventually she found a cave large enough for her to live in. \u201cThis should do nicely. I can make some kind of tent flap from leaves and branches to block the heat and rain.\u201d Tanya said as she surveyed her new homestead. She was looking around, deciding on where she would make a bed for her to sleep on when she heard another tiny voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked toward the back of the cave and saw another tiny islander. She watched in amusement as he dashed toward the mouth of the cave. As he passed her she stomped her foot in his path. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Tanya asked playfully. Obviously the tiny islander didn\u2019t understand her words, but the meaning behind them was clear. Before the tiny man could try to run again Tanya brought her foot down on her victim. She didn\u2019t do more than that at first, listening to the tiny man, probably pleading for his life, in his native language. But Tanya felt no pity for him, and started putting pressure down on her foot and the tiny man beneath it. Tanya smiled evilly as she felt a rush of power and heard the tiny man scream in agony. Soon enough there was a sickening crunch and a miniature puddle of blood came out from under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fun.\u201d Tanya thought as she used a leaf to wipe the blood and remains from her sole. \u201cYou know I could get used to being an island goddess.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tanya didn't want to be out alone at night, even if she was the scariest thing on the island. With the small man still kicking fitfully in her stomach Tanya started home. Every moment she spent looking at the island she was struck by how beautiful it was. This was somewhere she could spend the rest of her life, she thought idly. As she marched on, the sand warm between her toes, she hummed quietly to herself. Tiny things made odd noises, and the dense jungle a few yards to her side rustled with life. Tanya wanted to go in and feel more things squish under her feet and claw at her throat as they slid into her belly. In fact, she felt a thrilling rush in her stomach at the prospect and a heat between her legs. She walked a little faster towards her cave. Before she went to sleep tonight, she'd do something to relax first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanya!\" A voice called. Tanya skidded to a halt, looking around anxiously. She realized she was naked and sprang to cover herself, hunching down on the sand and blushing profusely. But looking around, everything was clear. There was nothing but sand and trees in her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be going crazy,\" she thought. Maybe she would need at least one person who wasn't food if she wanted to live here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanya, down here!\" She heard again. Glancing down, she spotted a group of four people huddled beneath her. They were about the same size as the natives, and the top of their heads was only a short distance from the folds of her vagina. The thrill she felt earlier returned, but also an immense feeling of guilt. These people were her friends, even if she couldn't make out faces in the low light. But she'd eaten people like them. Her stomach rumbled its thoughts on the subject, making three of the four crouch nervously. The fourth stepped back and tried to look up at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Mark! We made it off the boat! What happened to you?\" He asked innocently. From her vantage, it looked like he was pointedly avoiding looking at her slit or acknowledging she was naked. The other two men in the group had eyes the size of dinner plates though, which gave her twinges of annoyance and satisfaction. Her embarrassment at being naked had gone, these four were too pathetic to be worth her shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm glad you guys made it!\" Tanya exclaimed, beaming down at them. They staggered backwards, and she quickly apologized, \"I'll try and speak softer,\" she whispered. \"I have a cave, would you need shelter for the night?\" Tanya asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please! We've been out in the open since the wreck, and it's been pretty freaky. But with you around, I don't think we'll be bothered,\" Mark laughed. The others chuckled nervously too. Tanya laughed as well, but for much different reason than the four humans in front of her.</span></div></div>",

Mark readily stepped on and the rest followed him. From what she remembered of Mark, he had trouble adding one and one without using his fingers. But even for someone that dense, he seemed blissfully unaware of how dangerous someone her size could be to him. In her kind, the others had a far better idea of her. She wondered how Mark had somehow ended up their leader, and even more how he had kept them alive for a full day. But that didn't matter anymore, she would keep them alive until she needed a distraction. It wasn't like they could outrun her or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girl finally clambered onto her palm, Tanya brought it up to about face level, maybe lingering a moment too long at breast height. Her passengers seemed too sick to notice, and even Mark was quiet as he took in for the first time just how much bigger than him she was. Tanya strode towards home, keeping an eye out for natives and examining her catch. She had no idea who the woman and the man standing closest to her were, but had the vague impression the other guy was named Stu. A friend of the boat's owner, he didn't know many people on board. Tanya's brief conversation with him made her think he was a stuck-up asshole, but she hadn't been interested in whatever he had been talking about anyways. After the initial shock of breasts larger than a human body, he was the one who had recovered the most. While Mark looked out of place and uncomfortable, he never stopped examining Tanya's face. She was glad none of them tried to initiate a conversation, she was reluctant to give Stu any hints she might accidentally betray about her intentions. After an uncomfortable fifteen minute walk, Tanya entered the confines of her cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home! Afraid there's not many amenities for guys your size, and I wasn't expecting visitors anyway,\" Tanya said lightly. She remembered the native she'd crushed earlier, and couldn't remember what she had done with the body. Barely holding back panic, she scanned the cave floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to inconvenience you Tanya, but we appreciate the kindness. At least here we're out of the wind,\" Mark returned equally flippantly. Tanya hoped she'd portrayed herself as an empty headed buffoon. Her riders staggered as she kicked her crumpled clothes onto the area she thought her previous visitor was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably pretty hungry, but there's something edible on this island. These, apple-like things I guess, are pretty good. Maybe a little big for you, but you won't need many. Tanya picked one she'd grabbed earlier and set it down in the back of the cave. She lowered her hand, allowing the four to drop onto the sandy floor. They looked up expectantly at her kneeling figure. \"Um, I'm sleeping in the hammock. You guys can arrange whatever you'd like, just try to stay against the back wall until I'm awake. Wouldn't want to accidentally squish any of you!\" Tanya said, laughing. Mark laughed too loudly and the others tried to sound sincere. They were obviously terrified at this prospect, and it delighted her. As she got up and walked back to her bed, she stepped down a little harder than normal and made the tiny people stagger just a little. Smirking, she laid down against the reeds. She listened to their eager munching. 'They must not have eaten all this time,' she thought, recalling the family she'd devoured. Instantly a wave of guilt rolled over her. Now that she wasn't really hungry herself, cannibalism seemed awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But really, is it that bad? I mean I am a predator. They're smaller and a pretty good source of food. Just because I know who they are, does that make a difference?' Tanya wondered silently. She lay awake for a long time staring at the ceiling of the cave and listening in on the whispered conversations between the four people across the room. She blamed the noise and the hammock digging into her skin, but it was a long time before she started to drift off.</span></div></div>",

Tired she started searched for good resting place and finally found a spot covered with moss, next to a small pound in the cave. She felt so alone and scared, but she was exhausted, so decided to take a nap. Surprisingly she falls asleep fast. In her dreams shadows haunted her, chased her through a jungle. Still asleep the young woman bit her own lip, because the feeling of being helpless was nearly bone-crushing. Her tall and slender frame was covered in the rags of her clothes. Roots and branches slowed her often she stumbled and hastily got up again. Running... Running... Shades were hunting her. She was able to avoid them at first, but could not shake off her pursuers. Finally she was trapped in a cave, the sounds the hunting shadows growing louder and louder. Afraid Tanya leaned against the wall, when she suddenly felt a warm tingling sensation. The beautiful redhead starred down her body, when the world around her seemed to shrink. <br>\r\n\"No, I'm growing!\", she realized, still overwhelmed by the pleasure caused by this process. <br>\r\nHer body expanded faster and faster, the sensation growing stronger with each inch she gained. To her own astonishment the lust even overshadowed her fear. Her already ample bust tore the remains of her clothes. Moaning she grabbed her left breast and cupped it gently. Almost instantly she came, but she kept on and lovingly caressed her stiff nipple. She laid back against the cave wall, her right hand vanishing between her wet thighs. Tanya went on to pleasure herself, her left hand still fondling with breasts, their expanding warm flesh pushing against her fingers. <br>\r\n\"I feel my own breasts growing in my hands!\", she realized. <br>\r\nIn this moment her head bumped against the ceiling. It didn't hurt hear, she barely noticed it. Several orgasms followed while her body filled more and more of the cave. Her perspective switched, she saw the cliff and the cave entrance from the outside. Shapeless, large and dark creatures approached the cave, there were hundreds of them: A dark army preparing to strike. With a deafening rumble two perfect shaped, gigantic and seemingly endless long female legs crashed through the wall left and right from the entrance. Two large feet ploughed merciless through the lines of the shades, forest and rocks with enormous speed. At the same time the top of the cliff exploded, when the largest torso Tanya has ever seen grew out of his stone-prison. Large boulders and rocks were ejected effortless like pebbles. The eyes of this naked goddess were closed, her beautiful features serene, but the cheeks of her heart-shaped face, which were blushed and betrayed her enormous pleasure. Two strains of her long red hair framed her face, while the rest flew down her back Tanya couldn't believe that she saw herself. Not only she was titanic, she had changed in several other ways, too. She was fit before, but the growth had improved her musculature, under her silk like skin she saw defined abs at her belly. But her breasts had received the largest boost. Tanya has always had a large bust - a natural DD-Cup - but now she had something like a large GG-Cup... compared to her new size. Slowly she rose, landslides of crushed rock sliding from her skin, leaving not the slightest scratches on her skin. The shadows, former confident backed away, some crushed under the rocks. <br>\r\n\"Who is the prey now?\", Tanya heard her own voice booming. <br>\r\nIncredible fast she moved and started to hunt the shadows, crushing them merciless but playful. She felt great. No one would ever scare or threaten her again, she was in charge now. Tanya went on her knees, sending downs shades tumbling from the force of impact. Slowly she bend over, blotting out the sun above them. <br>\r\n\"Now you will be real shadows\u2026 vanishing dark memories\", she giggled and crushed them under her enormous breasts.<br>\r\nThe spectres started to flee in terror. With a swift movement Tanya squished several of them under her right foot, while she rose from her crouched position. Everything was so tiny compared to her. She would never have to fear something again. Slowly she followed the shades, she would punish them all\u2026 she reached down\u2026 and awoke\u2026<br>\r\nGasping she lay in the cave. She felt so hot and warm. Tanya reached out blindly, her hand coming to rest within her nether regions. Her gasp of pleasure came out forceful and sensual. She was hot inside, and gooey like maple syrup. Slowly Tanya strokes herself for a moment, her juices splashing, flowing thickly down her trunk-like legs\u2026. Tree-trunk like? Now she noticed that her clothes felt uncomfortable tight. With her other hand she explored her body. The last of the buttons had left her shirt, and the garment stopped well above her belly-button. The stressed material still barely concealed the business end of her breasts, but otherwise left nothing to the imagination. Curious she made her way to the cave entrance to examine herself in the moonlight. The cave entrance was the first indicator for changes. It appeared low. Tanya stepped in the moonlight and gasped. She was amazon. She stood at least 8 foot tall, her clothes tattered remains. Tanya moaned in satisfaction and lifted her arms high above her head, stretching her muscles even as she stretched taller. She mustered every inch of her enormous body in all its glory: her beautiful, long and shapely legs; the ample swell of her bosom with its tiny, rose-coloured nipples - those gigantic tear-drop-formed globes; pink folds of her pussy glistening in the silvery moonlight.<br>\r\nPleasure overwhelmed her and she started to please herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She gained nearly a foot of height in the first instant. She moaned \u201cMore, please more!\u201d Above all she felt the all-consuming need to be touched.<br>\r\nHer eyes flashed, her mouth formed a surprised 'o' shape. And then, like a woman possessed, Tanya continued to stroke herself with wild abandon. Her fingers sank deep into her sopping wet pussy, one hand fiercely groping at her massive bosom. Tanya howled at the top of her lungs in exaltation. All the while she was still getting bigger. And with every inch of height she gained, her arousal seemed to grow in stride. An unbelievable wave of pleasure hit her, when she came and jolted through her enormous body, filling every fibre of it with molten pleasure. Moaning and twitching Tanya fall asleep exhausted, not even moving back into the cave.<br>\r\nDaylight. When Tanya awoke the sun sent a warm tingling down her skin. Had it all been a dream? Immediately she looked around. Resting on her knees as she was, she dwarfed her surroundings. The boulders in front of the cave, formerly impressive and seemingly immovable, were smaller than her, even kneeling. Last night the entrance of the cave had seemed like giant portal, now it looks small and cramped to her.  Donning her brightest smile she gradually stood up to her full tremendous height, like a monster rising out of the ocean. She was easily twenty-five feet tall, her torso thicker than a tree trunk, her perfect tear-drop-shaped breasts as big as her head. A gentle stroke with the finger-tips of her right hand revealed that her belly had gained an athletic shape. Clearly she felt the contours of a decent but incisive female six-pack. Gently she stroked again, picturing its outlines in her head, unable to inspect it visually, because her enormous rack obscured the view. Effortlessly she grabbed one of the boulders with one hand and lifted it. She was so strong, even for a being of her size and \u2018athletic-shape\u2019. Closing her eyes she strode forwards, absently throwing the boulder upwards and catching it with her palm, like a small toy. Under her soles she felt the tremors her enormous body caused when she moved. Forceful, indomitable, yet gracious \u2013 she would describe her own movements. She moved incredibly fast and nimble for a behemoth of her size and mass. In private she had expected to be slower and bulkier. Quickly Tanya realized that not only her body had received an unbelievable boost, her senses were also enhanced. With ease she smelt and distinguished the bright flowers and plants in her surroundings, further she had no problems to see things on the ground in detail, despite her high point of view. Even her sense of hearing had been boosted. Easily she located a waterfall and a river, by hearing the soft currents of water and the thundering noise of the waterfall in quite some distance. Slowly she strode through the water, the river was deep, but reaching only the lower half of her thighs. The current proved to be no problem, she barely felt its resistance when she walked against it. Humming she started to clean her perfect body and smiled. Yesterday she had been prey \u2013 stranded, alone and helpless \u2013 but the night of Ascension had changed everything. She was no longer prey. She was the apex predator, nothing could threaten her and nothing was able to mess with her. Beautiful and powerful \u2013 like in her wild dreams and fantasies. Cold water ran down her enormous bust and sent a chill down her spine. The unexpected could was countered by the warmth emanating from the velvet folds of her womanhood. Tanya smiled softly\u2026 Maybe should add horny to describe her new form, not only beautiful and powerful\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their prey often presented little to no threat, anyway, and that was what Tanya had been trying to convince him of anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers instantly dropped to the sheath of Oric's machete-like blade, which hung from his waist. Yes, this was the right decision. They had no right to keep her here on any account, and she had virtually promised not to harm him after he did this. Wait, what would the others do if they learned he had set the giantess free? Imprison him for treason, or worse.

Rolling over slightly and brushing off of the sand accumulated by her immobility on the ground, he was forced to step back.

Still, none of this he deemed as malevolent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting his doubts aside, Oric observed as the titanic girl moved to a crouch position, stared at him for a few seconds, and the reached out.

Tanya nodded her head, listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for why I'm \"different\", I'm really not. the others were reasonably not sure what to do with you, because for all they knew you had in mind to destroy us like some of the others monsters that roam this island.

They shouldn't judge a person by how they look, or even how big they are. Well... I'll show them how big I am, Oric.

She raised her foot and planted it down gently, \" I'm so big and you guys are hardly the size of my thumb, I could easily crush you.\" said Tanya. </span></div></div>",

The messanger seemed to stop abruptly when he saw Tanya but he realised since everyone was still alive , she probably wasn't dangerous to them. Tanya saw as he seemed to be talking in a very paniced way, she couldn't tell if it was because of her but then the guy who was talking to her turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Giant, our city is under attack. If you help us repel our invaders, perhaps we can work out a deal and feed you whilst you protect us.\" said the man. Tanya nodded and there seemed to be a cheer from below. She laid out her hand, ' You'll need to get on, I don't exactly know the way to your city.' she said to him and he immediately hopped on, Tanya realised he seemed to weigh almost nothing, it was like air! \" My, you are light.\" she said, slowly rising to full height. \" Now, point me to the city.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  By the time Tanya got to the city, she could see smoke rising up and what seemed to be the invasion force in the city itself. It was a large populous city on the scale of ancient Rome and the streets seemed large enough for her to plant her foot without destroying nearby houses but it could lead her to lose her blance and crush the buildings, \" This will be hard to navigate, perhaps there is another way?\" she thought, she soon spotted the edge of the city and she could walk around it without and she began her walk, quite an obivous move against her enemy but nevertheless, nothing they had seemed to be capable of hurting her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the world, there are some mysteries that have no answers. Tanya always believed in fairy tales, even the childish ones. She did believe in leprechauns, in fairies, unicorns and all those. Even at the age of 19 years old, she liked to read stories like Cinderella or white-snow. Of course, when you come from a wealthy family, you have the luxury of spending much time believing in such tales. When her boyfriend asked her for a trip in the Caribbeans sea, she accepted immediately, and even offered to pay for the trip. Being rich didn't mean to be spoiled, in her case. To add to her perfection, Tanya had a more than desirable body. She measured about 5'4, had blond hairs, and brown eyes. She did workout about 3 to 4 times a week, wich meant that she was in shape, and made her C Cup breasts firm, and round. She was everything a boy could have asked. Kind, rich, beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Tanya was flat on her back, on a beautiful exotic island. The sand under her and the proximity of an endless sea indicated that she was on a beach. The untouched state of the natural wildlife did seem to indicate that it was still untouched by the civilization as we know it. The top part of her bikini was removed, wich might have indicated that she was tanning herself, if it wasn't from the fact that it was being taken away by men that were a little bigger than ants. It was now out of reach, and Tanya couldn't even try to get it back, since there were about a thousand of ropes holding her body on the beach. What she felt right now was exposed, and vulnerable. Right now, she was blushing. Not because of the sun, but because she didn't like to show these intimate parts to anyone but her boyfriends. She did like nude sunbathing, but only in private. Not in the presence of a whole tribe of tiny men (and women). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also two emotions conflicting inside of her. She felt nervous, and a little joyful. She was a little happy because to her, it was a confirmation that fairy tales did exist. She was nervous, though, because she couldn't help but wonder what was going to happen to her. It was clear, by now, that she wasn't the one in control. The tribe undressed her even though she asked them not to. She was at least relieved that they were trying to remove the bottom part anymore. They seem to be very curious about her. There wasn't a single centimeter of her exposed body that they didn't explore. There were people all over her body. Her feet, her legs, her flat stomach, her breasts, her neck, her head (some people even took a quick view of her mouth, and her nostrils). She was captive. There was little she could do to stop them, wich is why she agreed to open her mouth when some about 5 people tried to put her lips aside. She was grateful they didn't actualy enter her mouth, but took plenty of time to look inside it from every angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she going to be enslaved by people the size of her feet? Was she going to be a member of the tribe? Or saved by a rescue boat? Would the tiny people get bored of her, and leave her on the beach? She had no idea. But right now, the enslavement, as unlikely as it is, seemed the most likely solution. The fact that they speaked english but didn't listen to her begs seemed to indicate that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 minutes since she opened her mouth, a tiny man dressed like royalty climber on her stomach, then on her breast, and looked at Tanya in the eyes. \"We have decided what we'll do with you. You will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nWriter note: I like the slave option, since it's a good revenge for all the tiny people abused on writing.com.

What would keep her from running away once they untied her? She was more than four times bigger than them, stronger, and faster. She looked at the royal man, still standing on her left breast. He was confident and calm, like he knew exactly what he was doing, and didn't even doubt she would eventually give up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya's mind was racing. On the first hand, she wanted to go home. Go back to her boyfriend, her house, her parents, her comfortable and luxurious life. On the other hand, she thought these little men were fascinating. Even at their size, they didn't seem to be afraid of her. They even held, for the moment, power over her. And there was still the royal man. Maybe he was the leader of the tribe. He stood on her like she was a prize, a trophy. There was something oddly powerful about him. Even Tanya wouldn't deny that. But being a slave to them? No way. She could probably squish them if they abused too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted, though, when a growl, resembling a large cat, was heard from the forest close to the beach.  <br>\r\n\"We are under attack, fall back\" yelled one of the tiny man.  Hearing this, the whole tribe scattered, and ran away, leaving Tanya defenseless, tied on the beach. The ropes all round her made sure that she couldn't even roll to escape to incoming predator. Unless some kind of miracle happened, she was going to be cat-food. As the growls got closer to her, she could now see to predator. In any other normal situation, it would have been an inoffensive kitten. But right now, it was a real threat. The cat in question wasn't all that big, barely bigger than a regular domesticated cat. As it got closer, Tanya started to yell \"Someone save me, please. I want to get off this crazy island. This isn't a fairy tale.\" at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished yelling, hundred of tiny arrows appeared from nowhere, most of them hitting the cat, and some of them hitting the side of her foot. She couldn't help but hiss a bit, as the arrows stung more than they should have. Seconds after, she realized what was going on. Tiny men were charging it with their swords. The cat, already weakened by the arrows, didn't last long and quickly died from the over abundance of wounds. <br>\r\nThe demonstration of power was incredible. They managed to kill, in a few seconds, a ferocious animal 10 times bigger than them. She really had to escape. In her current situation, she felt threaten by them. The arrows she received on her foot still stung, like their was 3 or 4 bees that stung her simultaneously It would be much harder to harm her, but she knew they could manage to do it, if they really wanted. She began to squirm in her bounds, but to no avail. She was at their mercy. They could be dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, she saw the royal man coming back. We can untie you, if you want. But you will not leave without our permission. Am I clear?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wouldn't get out of this on her own. The tiny people had made sure she wouldn't move even an inch. Since the attack, the tribe seemed to be more aggressive than before. Some of them were ready to attack in case she refused the Leader's conditions. <br>\r\n\"Do you want my men to attack you? You are big, but we could easily harm you. You can't move. We can do anything we want with you. And if you take too long to give up, we'll leave you here as a bait for hunt, and you will still be used as a playground for the tribe. We can cut your only remaining cloth, if you want. My men would be most excited about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya took a few second to think. She could run away the second they would untie her. <br>\r\n\"O.k. I got it. I will play along. If you untie me, I will not run away\" She lied. \"I will remain here, and do whatever you wish me to do. You intrigue me. Would it too much to ask, though, to ask your tribe to stop running all over my body? It's tickling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal man looked at her right in the eyes and said : \"Yes, it is too much to ask. You are our toy, our tool, our slave. You have nothing to ask us.\"<br>\r\nhe then turned around and said: \"Men: surround her. I want half the tribe to keep a close eye on her movement, and the second she moves too quickly for her, riddle her with arrows. Aim for the breasts, and the eyes, they are the most sensitive part we have access too so far.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Once you are untied, you will lay down on this cart, and wait for us to bring you back to our village, deep in the forest. I can't wait to show you to the rest of the tribe. You will be our tribes most prized possession.

She then took a look around her. There was arrows aimed at her from every sides. She couldn't avoid being hit. One or two arrows by themselves weren't really threatening... but a hundred of them could hurt her, especially  if they did aim for the eyes. There would probably be a better time to escape. Right now, she was a prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took a few step in the direction of the cart, and laid on it.

Their lands had proven more than sufficient to feed the kingdom, and provide safe enough from their natural predators and other tribes. They were warriors in their bloods, which might be justified by the fact that there was several other tribes waiting to get a grip on their lands. The local wildlife only proved to be a training for them. They were so good at blacksmith and crafting that their weapons could kill something much bigger than them. Their ropes were a proof of this. Even Tanya couldn't break them. Their new prisoner was much bigger than their usual prey, but they trusted in their taming abilities. The giantess wasn't a beast, but she was going to be tamed nonetheless. She was an unusal prey, but a prey nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that they had managed to take such a prize back to their kingdom was both a blessing and a curse. It was a blessing, since her size would allow her to have much uses. It would prove difficult, as she could squish a few of them if she got too angry, but she wouldn't get the chance to. It was a curse, too, because she would bring much jealousy to the surrounding tribes. The relations in between the tiny men wasn't very cordial, but it would only get worse now that they had a slave the size of a goddess. Not only that, but it was the beautiful. The giantess had the same physionomy as them, so the men found her attractive, of only much, much too big. She would be put to much uses, the royal family would make sure of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey royal men lived in a mansion, in the middle of the biggest city. As any medieval-like city, it was surrounded by a wall. It was so tall that even Tanya would have to jump to cross it. Luckily, their was enough place in the public park to tie her down again. Her arms were separated, each tied on a different tree, while both her legs were tied on the same post. On this position, she monopolised most of the available space in the public space, but it wasn't a bother. People were excited about the tribe owning her. Her smooth skin and long blond hair proved that she probably descended from a rich family in her world, wich added to her value. Their was so many people around her that one would have believe the whole kingdom had went there. So far, the guards had managed to keep the ordinary citizens from climbing her. This was reserved for the royal family, and a few other important people. They were walking all around her. The King himself was focusing on the head, while the princes were having fun taking sneak peak under the bottom part of the bikini. The Queen was admiring, maybe in jealousy, the size of her breasts. Never had she seen such ample, yet firm ,breasts. The other various nobles were having fun over the other parts, imagining what it could be used for. <br>\r\nHer flat abdomen could be a wonderful playground for the children, her arms could be used to cary much goods to the city, etc. There was so much uses for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fun was going full well, until... </span></div></div>",

For a second time, she couldn't move a muscle. The only difference between now and then is that now she knew what was going on. She had been captured by some natives that intended to use her as a slave. Where was she? Her vision was still blurry, so she couldn't see anything past her immediate environment. The sun was much weaker than before, so she concluded she wasn't on the beach anymore. She remembered earlier events. The beach, the attack, the carts. Everything seemed to unreal, yet it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she managed to hear a low voice close to her. Although she couldn't see the owner of the voice, she knew he was on her forehead.<br>\r\nThe voice was majestic, like it belonged to some king. \"Look at her\" the voice said. \"Isn't she a blessing for us? Isn't this a sign of great prosperity? This giantess has become our property. It was her destiny to serve us. The great gods has sent her to secure our power over the island. And as a proof of this, she will dance for us. \"Wait, what?\" said Tanya in a low voice. To this, the King turned around and said \"A, I see that you are awake, slave. As soon as we will set your arms and legs free, you are to stand up and do a sensual dance for us. Show to us how much you want to be our slave by showing how beautiful you are.\"<br>\r\nTanya could hardly understand the present situation. She didn't want to be a slave at all. Why would she surrender her dignity so easily? Tanya was a pretty good dancer, though. She liked social dancing. it had nothing to do with having to dance, topless, in front of a large crowd. Her plan was to escape as soon as she was free. She was interrupted by the voice on her forehead: By the way, I wouldn't try to escape if I was you. I have sent scouts all over the place, so no matter where you try to run, they will shoot you. And this time around, the arrows have been induced by sleeping poison. You've seen how effective it is. And if we have to catch you again, we'll remove your bottom bikini, and make you dance again.\" At this, she could hear much laughter in the crowd. Since she didn't want to be completely exposed, it seemed like escaping was out of the option... So the only choices were...</span></div></div>",

They must be bugsized to Loretta. \"Why don't they like you? You seem nice\" \"Well\", Loretta started with a smile, \"I have made some political mistakes as I arrived three years ago. I didn't knew how to survive and was scared so I was glad to find people even at this size. They where completly terrorised as they saw me the first time and fled into the woods. I must be about 700 ft to them or soso I took their supplies because I was starving. Their little city got damaged as I entered. Believe me that my feet didn't even nearly fit into their streets. I continued to do so for some days until I explored the Island enough to survive on my own. Now they are acting like vermin, trying to steal my supplies and I just treat them like I did to vermin at home.\" With a little wink she continued, \"I never sat an insect or a mice out if I found one in my house\" Tanya knew what she ment and was a little bit shocked. Did this giant women just sayed that she simply killed these people if she found them. Loretta seemed to have noticed the shocked expression in her face and shrugged her shoulders. \"Thats the way it is. The bigger one dominates the smaller ones and If I won't kill them, they will do it to me. As simple as that but it takes them a lot to do so. You can believe me that the only reason you are alive is that I am able to talk to you. The others are the size of insects. I am simply unable to interact and don't think I havn't tried. They shot first so I stomped back. I don't really care anymore. You must be thirsty\" She quickly changed the topic as she noticed how uncomfortable Tanya got. She didn't wanted to frighten her new friend or was she just a toy? A pet? She didn't knew yet but all of this things came into her mind.

Just some little dots of grey where left. Blood mixed with dirt. \"Awful creatures\", Loretta sayed. \"They are just here to harm me or to steal. You don't have to feel sorry for them\" Before the giant foot settled upon them Tanya could make out a few details. They had olive skin and really where small.

One of them was wearing a hat and all of them was wearing T-Shirts and trousers. The clothes she and her own kind would wear. She stated this to Loretta. \"Yes they where\", she sayed. \"The first few days here where very hard. The airstrikes and napalm. Tanks, rockets. They had shot everything they had on me. Look here\" Loretta pulled aside one of the leaves on her behind and revealed a scar. The skin looked burned and badly treated. \"This was one of the napalms I could not dodge. They attacked me in the night while I was sleeping. That was the time that I really started to freak out. It was me or them, so I thought better them than me. I searched the cities of these pests and destroyed a lot of them. I trampled the planes on the ground and took out almost all of their tanks in one day.\" She smiled a little. \"I even managed to completly ground their capitol and most plants and factories with it. I destroyed every harbor and sunk hundreds of ships. Since then the attacks where nothing to mention. Their handguns just sting a little. Nothing more or less.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya was still in shock but thoughtful. Loretta was proud of the mass murder she commited but did she had a choice? She could have talked to them but they where speaking different languages and she sayed that they denied communication with her. If it was possible at that size. \"I literally stomped them back to the stoneage\", Loretta laughed. \"But come now, you must be thirsty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first impression of the island was awesome. It was a true paradise. Lorettas hut was located in a dense Jungle. She had build it from the hight trees which barely reached her breasts. For tanya everything was normal sized. The giantess had cleared a wide area around her hut probably the material she had build it from and there where trails in different directions. \"I have not build a well yet and I don't think that that would be a good idea\", Loretta sayed. The little fellas would just poisen it. I keep it safe and go to the big Lake. The best way to get fresh water. As long as the tinies supply themselves there it is safe.\" The giantess really was careful towards the small people. \"Why havn't you killed them all?\" She didn't knew why but Tanya had to ask. The casual way the giantess talked about her murders made her look like an cruel women. Loretta looked down with a soft smile. \"I am no Hitler, you know? There is no reason to kill them. I am just defending myself. In the couple of years after I have mostly destroyed the biggest treats to me I just see them as a species of the island. I have to admit that they are not human to me anymore. Maybe because of their size or the way they treat me. They are pests. Insects, vermin. If I see them invade my house I kill them. If they attack me, I kill them. If they leave me alone I leave them alone.\" This sounded hard but that was the way of nature. Tanya understood that point. Loretta just tried to stay alive. \"You sayed that the tinies also get water from the lake?\", Tanya asked \"So we will see some of them?\" \"I am sure about it. There are some small villages on the shore and they are also fishing there.\" Tanya took another look around. In the distance where some mountains and she could see monkeys jump from tree to tree. By now she got used to the presence of the immense women and beeing in her grasp wasn't as uncomfortable anymore. She looked around a bit more and took in the panorama. Then finaly she saw:</span></div></div>",

There where some cars and carts pulled by beetles. A couple of dozen men, women and children where running in panik. They must have seen the giantess long ago and tried to get out of the way. A car had been left behind. Most of them tried to get into the dense jungle but the undergrowth was thick and even with their small machetes it took them a while to enter. \"They use my path often because it is easier than traveling through the jungle. They definatly know it is dangerous but the jungle is filled with giant creatures to them and most animals stay off my path. I guess the animals are smarter\", she sayed with a little giggle. Tanya knew that she had seen the small people in front of her but she also knew that she would not care. With an barely audible crunch the abandonned car beneath her foot but Tanya could not even say if Loretta had noticed it. She neither broke her stride nor looked down to check. It didn't matter to her. The crowd of people where slowly going aside as Loretta was using the middle of the small trail. \"You will see more than enough\", she sayed her eyes set on the girl in her hand. \"They are simply everywhere\" Tanya held her breath. They where extremly slow. As big as a bug but as slow as a earthworm. As Loretta was talking she just stared at the people beneath only a few steps ahead and some of them where right in the way of the giantess feet. Within two seconds Loretta caught up with them. She looked down at them but more with interst as with care as she stepped over some of them. Her next step caught two or three - Tanya could not tell properly because of their size. The giantess looked up again. \"We are almost there.\" and barely missed a whole group of them with her next step, then they where behind her. \"You killed them!\", Tanya screamed. Loretta looked at the girl a little bit puzzled but also slightly angered. \"Did I?\" She asked casually. \"I bet you have also stepped on ants and bugs in your way or do you walk around everything in your path. Do you acutally really look down all the time? I keep my head up.\" Tanya got the point. She was a little bit sad and angry but she knew what the women meant. Of course had she stepped on ants scurrying on the sidewalk although she had seen them. She stepped on thrown away bags or plastik. Why should she care. Why should Loretta care. She was living here a couple of years now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So please little girl, if you want to be my friend, stop lecturing me how I have to treat these bugs. I tell you again: I don't care and you can decide now if you want to be on there or on my side.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya was willing to help the tinies but to anger a giantess was simply no good idea. They where so cute. Too cute to be simply troden on or killed any other way. They where humans for christ sake. </span></div></div>",

I am glad that you at least agreed with me in this matter and you are on my side. I can now consider you as my friend.\" Loretta said with a smile. \"Yay!\" Tanya said with her hugging Loretta's index finger. \"But remember since they know that we are now together, they also see you as a threat. I may not be harmed by their weapons but I can assure you that with your size their guns can hurt you. So strolling along this jungle is not safe. Don't be on your own or even venture too far without me. if you're in trouble, just scream for help.

Let's stick to each other like glue.\" Tanya said with a nod. \"How about we go get something to eat?\" \"Yeah I am hungry.\" \"Wait hold on\" Loretta said as she look down on the remaining group of people who were still running but only managed to make little to no progress from escaping from the enormous giantess. Tanya noticed there were a 20-30 people under Loretta's foot when she is hovering it above those ants. She then finished them off by stepping on them effortlessly. Tanya just watched with astonishment that with just a single of a giantess that amount of people could be flattened. Then Loretta interrupted with a smile \"Let's go best friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the beach, Loretta knelt down to her knees and carefully brought Tanya down on the sand.  \"Now you stay right there. I will be looking for food.\" Loretta said as she checks the surrounding area. Tanya taps her massive foot to get her attention. \"Yes?\" \"Please don't leave me here.\" Tanya pleads. \"Don't worry sis. It will be quick.\" After saying this, Loretta made her stroll back into the jungle with each step shaking the ground leaving behind a trail of massive footprints. Tanya was all alone now. She couldn't help but imagine the worse kind of danger that could come. She tried to remove the nervousness by just stretching her body on the beach releasing all of the stress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes have passed and there are no signs of Loretta coming back. Tanya's stomach grumbles. \"Uhh I'm hungry.\" she groaned. Feeling bored but most of all hungry, she ventured into the nearby jungle hoping she might find some food. After walking a few meters, she saw some tinies riding cart pulled by a huge beetle escorted by men carrying guns.  </span></div></div>",

The trail leads to some villages of them and to water. Come near my house again and you are dead. You may be bigger but I will not give you an extra treatment.\" with these words she got up and Tanya, still lying on the ground had to cover as the housesized women rose to her full height. She was lying in front of her between her carsized feet. Reflexivly she threw her arms up as Loretta started to move and one foot swung over her, letting soft dirt rain down on the women. \"Good luck\", she called without looking back and in just a few strides she was far away, stopped only short to stomp onto the ground in the distance before she continued her way. This was really fucked up. Tanya had lost the best chance to survive in this game and had gained an enemy as prize. She surely hoped that the tinies would not immediatly shot her.

A couple of minutes later she saw some of them running into the opposite direction. She wasn't as huge as her former friend but still way bigger than them. In a motion of peacefullness and to show that she wasn't armed she raised her hands into the air but after a second thought she didn't needed to be armed to be a threat to the barely 5 inch tall people. She moved slowly to not terrorize them even more but they simply didn't stopped. Some of them tried again to enter the dense jungle with little success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way they where clothed they where hunters or farmers she guessed. Some of them had rifles with them but they seemed to have lost their carriage as Lorretta approached. \"Please, I don't want to hurt you\", she called but was not sure if the tinies understood.

A wet stream was coming from underneath her foot moistering the dry ground. \"Yuck\", Loretta sayed on her way back, scraping away the stuck remains while she walked leaving the crushed corpse of Tanya behind. She will miss her but that is what she wanted. Maybe she will take her anger out on some village but it is more likely that she will continue living like she did the last years.

After a while what felt like an eternity, the towering woman turned around and stomped back into the forest. You realised, you had held your breath and exhaled deeply, when the colossus suddenly stopped. She couldn\u2019t possibly had heard you, you immediately appeased yourself. After all, her towering body had caused quite a noise, when she had waltzed down the trees with contemptuous ease. You heard a deep Moan escaping Mina\u2019s mouth. Something was odd about her\u2026 Even more odd than her gigantic size.  You gasped in shock, when you figured it out: Mina was swelling larger, slowly first, but with steadily increasing speed and intensity. Oblivious to your presence your gargantuan rival clearly welcomed the changes. Sensual moans and gasps accompanied the increasingly intense self-exploration of her growing body.  Awe-struck you watched the already gigantic beauty enjoying her growth process. Mina\u2019s growth spurts sent her higher and higher into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of reason in your head told you to run; there was no way to know how titanic she would become. Maybe she would turn around, spotting you from her new, higher vantage point, but you were actually too stunned to run. All you did was gazing at Mina. She was rubbing her swelling body with wanton lust and everything her hand brushed across seemed to expand at her touch. Her breasts were swelling like mad and firm, toned muscles expanded over her arms and legs. Whatever had caused the growth of her bikini, was no longer able to keep up, out-matched the black swimwear ripped apart under her expanding form and all her naked majesty was revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She might be a bitch, but Mina is pretty hot, the growth even enhancing her beauty</i>, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Mina giggled in joy as she crossed her arms under her breasts and watched herself, and them, swell even larger. Her own rear expanded and twitched larger as clear signs of muscles began to spread over her. She had always been quite athletic, as captain of the swim-team, it actually been a necessary step for her to gain more muscles to compensate her large Cup-Size, which had slowed her down, but her muscles definitely bulged even larger. But her improved muscles were not as spectacular as her growing bust. Mina had sported impressive double D\u2019s at normal height, which had clearly enlarged even further, when she had grown to a giantess, but right now you were able to watch those already enormous orbs growing even faster than the rest of her body, each of them perfectly shaped and already as big as Mina\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mina gave out a loud groan of pleasure as her growth spurt came to an end. Dismissively, she glanced down on the trees beneath her. The giantess had at least doubled her size. Mina had grown to an astonishing 120 feet or even more. <br>\r\nThe towering beauty smirked, before letting out a soft giggle. Her eyes shifted downward as she leaned forward to see past her large breasts, watching the looming shadow of her colossal form, which engulfed the uprooted trees next to her feet. <br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

She couldn't help it, her new size was the perfect size for the trees to tickle 2nd most sensitive parts of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina also felt a different sensation on her feet. The ferns and small plants that used to reach up her ankles now barely reach her ankles. The sensation when her sole touched the ground feels different to her, it felt like stepping on a bunch of tiny sticks and moss to her now. The feeling of the crackling sticks and the moss' soft caress on her sole was so satisfying to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya stands in awe of the sight of the giantess and her new figure in front of her now. Tanya always had the one thing that made her stood out more than Mina, and it's her breasts. Now, Tanya's F cups can't even compare to the new sheer size of Mina's newly attained assets. Those tits can easily destroy a house, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mina caress her smooth skin all over her body, she slid her hand from her hips, up to her chest as she cups her breasts from below. These puppies are as big as my head, she thought as she bit her bottom lip. She continued to circle her fingers around her reddish-brown areoles and pinched her nipples. The towering beauty closed her eyelids and softly let out a moan like an asmr video. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't know you're such a tease\" boomed from a voice from another towering figure that stood behind Mina, deeper in the jungle. Mina opened her eyes and smiled as she turned her head to greet the figure. \"Oh my, I guess I'm not the only that grew\" she said seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya, now shocked, realising the fact that she's stranded on an island with 2 titans, and anxiety hit her as wondered about the fact that there could be more than 2...Tanya quickly sprinted from the beach and into the jungle but closer to Mina, to avoid being seen as the coconut trees hid her like an ant in the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina's guest walked closer to her and booming steps haunt Tanya's eardrums as they get louder with each step. Tanya now stood behind a tree about 20m away from Mina's ankles, opposite of Mina. Tanya gaze upward, staring at Mina's facial features only to be partially blocked by the leaves and the immense size of her mounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the booming steps get louder, more and more details of the other towering titan revealed and Mina stared in awe realising that the titan is actually.... </span></div></div>",

They must have stayed together during the shipwreck, so whatever made one grow obviously had the same effect on the other one. The other giant woman broke through the lining of the forest, demolishing any tree's in her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Lei. She was Asian, and like Mina, she also had a terrific body. She stomped out into the wide open beach with her enormous bare feet thudding into the sand with a terrifying oomph. She wore a yellow bikini, showing off her skin and body. Her long black hair blew in the wind high in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants really did look like models now, and not only that, they looked terrifying. You genuinly didn't know where would be safest to go... Stay here? Back to the sea? Run past them to the cover of the woods? Your heart sank when you saw Lei point toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, isn't that the bitch from the ship?\" she says to her giant companion.<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, I think it is!\" Mina shouted excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there in the sand as the two behemoths strided toward you. Their impossibly large feet landed next to you, and you frantically panicked to avoid them for fear of getting squashed, however to them, it was merely footsteps. Now four humongous feet surrounded you on each side. You didn't even reach half way up to their knee's as they stood high above you, grinning deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, would you look at that!\" Mina says. \"Looks like we have a bug on our beach\".<br>\r\n\"Yuk!\" Lei comments. \"An icky Tanya bug. Should we crush it?\" she continues, wiggling her toes, creating huge craters for her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're terrified at hearing this. You had your disagreements, but would they really do something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe we should throw it back into the sea?\" Mina answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to speak but the words just wont come out, you're that scared. You don't know what you'd say anyway... What could you say to two 60 foot women who are threatening to torture you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" says Mina. She lowers herself to a squat and leans over you. You look up at her and can't think of anything other than what a terrifying site she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, you little maggot.

The suns heat was beating down upon her, which was fairly pleasant at the moment as her clothes were drying quickly. She started to walk slowly towards the forest at the end of the beach. As she did so, she stumbled over some hard jagged rocks, and thought how lucky she was that her sandals were securely strapped to her feet so she didn't lose them while in the water, otherwise she could end up getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, she halted suddenly, sure that she'd heard a rustle behind her. She turned around quickly, yet she could see nothing that might have caused that noise. She stood silently for a few seconds, but upon not hearing a repeat of the noise, started walking in the direction of the forest again. On her first footstep however, she heard a slight crunch, following by what she was sure was a scream, but it was too quiet to tell. The strangest thing was that she was sure the noise had come from beneath her. Looking down, she noticed she'd half stepped on some sort of funny bug that was sticking out from under her sandal. Unconcerned, she removed her foot from it, and took a closer look out of curiosity. However, as she got closer to it, she took a double take: \"Jason, is that really you?\" she blurted out, not entirely sure if she was dreaming or not. She picked up the little thing that looked like Jason, one of her boyfriends mates from the boat, to take a closer look. As she held him in her hand to her eyes, there was no mistaking it; this was jason, the only difference being he was now 3 inches tall. \"How on earth did she happen\", she shouted, a mixture of shock and anger in her voice. \"I don't know what happened, I passed out, and found myself like this... please, you've got to help me, you've broken my leg\", he cried in agony.

The logical and scientific side of her said that she didn't need to kill him in order to get rid of him, she could just walk away.

Jason, sensing danger, started to back away, limping. Surely was wasn't contemplating doing... that? He didn't want to even consider she'd do that. He watched her foot, her slender toes moving up and down, revealing the soft pink underside of them to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of her voice bought him back to his senses. \"Well Jason, as you're of no use to me here, you're as good as dead anyway. You're a cripple, and you'll just slow my progress here. I broke your leg simply by standing on it, I can break the rest of your body by standing on it - see it as me putting you out of your misery... a bit like a bug. She giggled slightly at her comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason started to hobble away as fast as his broken leg could carry him, but Tanya wasted no time. She used the toe of her sandal to knock the crippled boy over, and them covered him with it. She rested her foot gently on top of him for a bit, and she could feel his squirming under the sandal, tickling the bare sole of her foot resting on the other side of the sandal just above him - she quite enjoyed the sensation of being on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Jason's perspective beneath, it was not quite so amusing. His broken leg was contorted in an awkward position by the bottom of her sandal, causing him to convulse in agony (this was the squirming she could feel under her foot). He couldn't believe that a girl several years younger than him, and smaller than him normally, would now be ending his life painfully, for her amusement beneath her as she stood happily on top of him. The bottom of her sandal was also still very wet and causing even more discomfort, as the sun hadn't been able to reach here. As this thought entered his head, the small space he had under her sandal started to lessen. \"Oh God\", he thought, \"she's doing it\". The rough wet bottom of her sandal pressed painfully onto his chest, and the pain in his leg causing him to spasm even more. He could no longer breath due to the pressure of Tanya's body weight. He felt her foot above him adjust slightly in the sandal, and he realised at this point how worn and thin the sole of her sandal actually was. If he could feel her foot, she could feel him - and was most likely enjoying it, while he suffered. Before he even had change to feel even more angry about this, he felt her foot adjust again with his pain, and his chest caved in. Still alive, he felt the wet gritty sole of her sandal pressing and contorting his face beneath her toes. Even with the almost unbearable pain in was now in, the pain surged to unimaginable levels, every second or so for a millisecond - like his body was being pumped. He didn't realise this was due to Tanya raising and lowering her toes just above his head causing her sandals sole to effectively pump on his broken body slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew it out as long as possible, but Tania got bored quickly. The enjoyable tickling sensation his convulsing body had caused the sole of her foot to feel had now stopped. She finally transferred all her body weight onto his fragile body and felt a final crack beneath the ball of her foot which caused a giggle to escape her lips. As she lifted her foot, she had to shake it slightly to dislodged his body from the bottom of her sandal.</span></div></div>",

The palm trees stretched up as big as sky scrapers and the waves from the ocean were pretty much tidal waves constantly, which forced her to run further up the beach to avoid being swept away by the powerful currents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was a safe distance away from the waves, she looked around, hoping to find at least some part of the wreckage but there was nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Boom! Boom! Boom!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ground shook and a thunderous boom accompanied in a rhythmic pattern. Tanya turned around and her eyes widened as she saw a gigantic, towering figure! It was a giantess over eighty feet tall! She had tanned skin from no doubt being out in the sun but she looked like she was in her twenties. She only had a green leaf covering her front and back side private areas attached with a vine and nothing covering her rather large breasts. She carried a spear in her hand as she stood still, looking at the ocean with her brown hair flowing in the breeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya figures that the storm must have transported her to an island that has natural stealth from satellites or it may have taken her to another dimension and now she is stuck on an island filled with a tribe of giant women that have never encountered tiny humans.

Tanya wonders if she should approach the giantess, follow her to see how her tribe acts or just run away and hide until hopefully other people float onto the island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decides to...</span></div></div>",

She would hallucinate, seeing strange people looking down at her, and fly around her.  Then she would come out of consciousness, and hear the natives speaking, in a language she couldn't understand.  She would, little by little, hear more and more of them talking, and randomly, words in english would appear.  She tried to see who was speaking english, but couldn't find anyone.  The natives began to talk more and more, as they brought Tanya to their temple, and Tanya heard more and more english.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya awoke, finally, fully sober, the effects of hte drink completely worn off.  Before her stood about 20 natives, all adults, as she sat on some sort of alter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome.\"  Said the man closest to her, who, based on his clothes, was the chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...I....you know english?\"  Tany asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  We have blessed you with our spirits.

She looked to be Tanya's age, and  Tanya actually envied her.  She was fit, and strong, her long black hair was waving and thick.  Her breasts were full and perky, matching description with her hips, butt, and lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief looked back angrily.  \"The spirits have chose her, now keep quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should've chose me...\"  The women said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize.\"  The chief said.  \"That is my daughter, Izlu.  She has had the favor of most of the spirits on this island since she was a child, and we always thought she was destined for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm still confused.\"  Tanya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This island is full of spirits. It is the waypoint between here and the world of the gods.\"  The chief explained.  \"Our prophecies tell of a time, soon to pass, where a number of people on this island will become gods, these people will be chosen by the spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they choose me?\"  Tanya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do not know.\"  The chief said.  \"But we must now nurture you.  You will become a goddess...\"  The chief put his hand up, and one of the people walked up to Tanya with a plate of some fruits.  \"Now eat, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya was starving actually.  It had been a few days since she actually had food because of the whole shipwreck.  She devoured the fruit quickly.  She remained seated, and looked up at the people, and suddenly felt odd.  \"Why is everyone staring at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief just smiled.  Tanya began to feel something pushing out on her body, and as she looked down, she saw something that shocked her.  Her breasts began to fill out in front of her eyes.  Her already tattered shirt began to shift around her body, as her breasts pushed outward, and more of her cleavage began to show.  She felt a tightness in her behind, as her butt and hips slowly swelled outward.  She watched, sitting on her butt with her legs off to the side, as her knees slowly moved away from her, as her legs lengthened.  Her perspective slowly changed, as her torso rose her head higher and higher, inch by inch.  Just as she reached the point of too much discomfort, her growth stopped.  \"Oh...my...God...\"  She said.</span></div></div>",

She ran her hands over her growing body, exploring every inch; revelling in the feeling of herself expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger!\" she moaned. \"BIGGER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling intensified in her breasts. Eagerly she cupped them in her hands and massaged her proudly erected rose-coloured nipples with index- and middle-fingers. Tanja was rewarded with jolt of pleasure, amplifying the intense sensation. Gasping loudly she suddenly realized that her breasts were growing faster than the rest of her body. Their already ample swell increased, yet they remained firm and perky. Unable to \u2018restrain\u2019 herself any longer, Tanya reached for her dripping womanhood, gently massaging the clefts first, before she finally started to masturbate. She came, her juices coating her inner thighs, but she needed more. Slowly she rose, still fondling her own body. Ignoring the tribal people around her, she approached a columnar altar in the middle of the cave. Paying no attention to the chief\u2019s shouted warnings or commands she moved over the altar. <br>\r\n Suddenly, she spread her legs and sat on it. It was a perfect fit and solid enough to survive her still increasing titanic form. With rhythmical movements Tanya stimulated herself, feeling an incredible head building up inside her.  She could feel herself growing even more, this last spurt, with her final orgasm even more intense than the ones before. The brunette beauty couldn\u2019t help but crying out, it felt so incredibly pleasurable. Finally her growth stopped. The former large cave now seemed significantly more confined to her. Slowly she rose from her new stone sex-toy. Admiring her new body. Tanya has always been beautiful, her best features \u2013 apart from her angelic, angular face and dark brown eyes- her perfect-shaped long legs and her ample bosom. The growth had slightly elongated her legs in proportion and her breasts had grown even bigger. Gently she caressed the succulent orbs, admiring their perfect tear-drop shape. At normal size they would have been a large GG-Cup, at Tanya\u2019s towering size no letter would do them credit. The chief and several tribal warriors stared at her in shock and awe, well some in barely contained rage. Some even raised their weapons, but the chief ordered them to lower them with a harsh gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever a goddess grew lager! She is the Ini-Tan-On!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these words he dropped on all fours, pressing his forehead on the ground. The others followed his example. Out of the corner of her eye Tanya could see a frenzy of movement from the other side of the cave. She turned subtly, trying to get a better look. There sat Izulu, her dark hair askew, her face flushed. Tanya grinned broadly when she spotted the olive skinned beauty; one of the hands of the chieftain\u2019s daughter had slipped into the folds of her skirt, the other still rested on one of her exposed breasts. Her dark eyes were locked on Tanya\u2019s naked titanic body, and her arm was moving frantically. Quickly Izulu tried to hide what she'd been doing and while she couldn\u2019t deceive Tanya, no other tribal saw her predicament. Blushing she stared at Tanya.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being the kind person she always was, she walked in the direction the cries were coming from, watching the ground to make sure she didn\u2019t step on anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few yards, to her at least, Tanya found who was crying. Sitting on a fallen tree in a small clearing, with her face in her hands, was Izlu the chief\u2019s daughter. \u201cIzlu, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tanya asked stepping into the clearing and kneeling beside the crying girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzlu looked up. \u201cWhat do you want?!\u201d She demanded angrily. \u201cI mean: what do you want, Goddess?\u201d She amended, speaking as though choking on each word, particularly goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became clear to Tanya now why Izlu was crying. She was upset that she had been pushed aside and been forced to take a backseat by an outsider for a chance at being a goddess. \u201cIzlu, I\u2019m sorry the spirits choose me instead of you. Before my\u2026 transformation, I was jealous of you. Your body is naturally so beautiful and alluring; you already have the build of a goddess. Many girls on the mainland would kill to have a body like yours.\u201d Tanya said trying to comfort Izlu.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026 it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Izlu sniffed, \u201cthe spirits just saw something in you I didn\u2019t have\u2026 Like my father always does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tanya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzlu took a deep breath to steady herself before staring, \u201cI\u2019m actually the fourth daughter my father had, and I was the only one he never noticed or acknowledged. Sula, my oldest sister, was a fierce and powerful warrior and now is the queen of another nearby island. Liil was the second oldest, she could communicate with the spirits and is the priestess of the Great Temple, the point where our world connects with the world of the gods. And then there was Awlu, so gifted with herbs and medicines she cured the island of a plague that threatened to wipe us out. And finally there was me, sweet little Izlu, whose only purpose was to marry some prince of another tribe to increase my father\u2019s influence on the island. My father showered praise on my sisters throughout their lives, but there was never enough left for me. It was only a year ago, when the spirits seemed to choose me to become a goddess did he even acknowledge that I was his daughter.\u201d Izlu burst into tears again. It was several minutes before she could speak again, \u201cBut when you came and the spirits chose you\u2026 *sniff* the spirits choose a woman to become a goddess once every thousand years. And since they choose you, I\u2019ll be my father\u2019s pawn again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for the crying girl; she too had been overlooked by her father back home.
