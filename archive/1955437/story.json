All my clothes get wet and dirty in this stupid forest.\" said an angry Sarah \"And all because the tank is empty and we have taken the wrong road.\"<br>\r\n\"Calm down Sis... we are all in the same situation.\"<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n\"Who said I should take this road because it is an shortcut...\"<br>\r\n\"To make each other allegations will not help us now sweetheart.\" Kat cuts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they walk through the forest and find an old, abandoned house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow is this house huge. Hopefully someone is inside and can help us.\" Sandra and Phil said more or less in unison.<br>\r\nJordan goes to the door and wants to knock when she opens with the first knock.<br>\r\n\"Scary but let\u00b4s go inside.\" and the six go into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...somebody here? We need some help or at least a telephone. Hello...\" they shouted but don't get an answer.<br>\r\n The six standing in the hallway, on the right side is a staircase leading to the second floor and to there left side seems to be the living room.<br>\r\n\"Let us search the house separated by something useful. Dave, Sarah and me go upstairs and start searching. Jordan, you, Kat and Sandra are looking on this floor.\"<br>\r\n\"Allright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they split and looking for some helpful. After 15 minutes they were comming back together.<br>\r\n\"Anybody found something?\" Kat asked the others.<br>\r\n\"No...\" Jordan, Dave, Phil and Sandra shake their heads.<br>\r\n\"I found at least a washer\" Sarah told the others \"so we can get out of these dirty and wet clothes\" she pointed at herself.<br>\r\n\"And what should we wear in the time?\" Phil has a point \"I want to get out of the clothes too but...\"<br>\r\n\"There were some bathrobes in the room I was\" Dave said \"I go get them.\" and within a second he was back and handed each a bathrobe.<br>\r\n\"So Sarah, show us the room with the washer\" Sandra said and all of them follow Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room was the washer, a cabinet with slippers and two separate cases with doors and mirrors inside to dress and undress.<br>\r\n\"How convenient that there are slippers\" Jordan pointed them \"I take a pair and undress.\"<br>\r\nOne after another strip down in the cases, put on the bathrobe and slippers and put there pile of clothes inside the washer.<br>\r\n\"And now?\" Dave asked.<br>\r\n\"Push start\" and Sarah pushed the button.<br>\r\n\"One of us has to wait\" Kat said \"let's play rock, paper, scissors.\"<br>\r\n\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" all of them waving there hands and Jordan loses.<br>\r\n\"Allright I'll wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later the washer was done and Jordan take the pile of clothes to place them on the floor. The first article he touched by taking the pile was the dress of his girlfriend. He liked how stunning she looked in it.<br>\r\n<i>Before I get the others, I'm going to dress in my clothes again.</i> When he tries to take his clothes he suddenly stops an inch before them. <i>What the...</i><br>\r\nSo he tries it again but again he stopped. <i>Maybe I should try another piece of clothes.</i> and so he tries every other article only to realize that he can take the clothes of his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<i>Great, I can't take my own clothes. I go to the others and tell them. I take the bathrobe</i> and again as he tries to take the bathrobe he stopped. <i>Even the bathrobe...but naked...I'll have to bite the sour apple</i> and so he put on the clothes of his girlfried.<br>\r\nAt first the black lace panties and to his suprise they fit. Next the bra <i>Why I should...</i> but within a moment he wears it. The tights and dress were no problem too and there he stood. Looking into the mirror he thoughts <i>Kat looks great in it but me?</i><br>\r\nHe steps outside the case and wants to put on the slippers and again his feet stops before he can slips in <i>Even the shoes?</i> and so he takes the boots of his girlfriend and put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaves the room and walks downstairs to the living room where his friends waiting and then started to laugh except Kat.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Why are you wearing my clothes?\" she screamed.<br>\r\n\"Calm down I'm gonna tell you. At first the clothes are done as you can see. The second thing is the reason I'm wearing your clothes. I could't take my or any other clothes or do you thing I'm doing this for fun?\" Jordan pointed himself from head to toe.<br>\r\n\"This story I should believe?\"<br>\r\n\"Go upstairs, take my clothes, bring them down and I'm gonna show you.\"<br>\r\nKat runs to the room, take every article from Jordans clothes and placed them direcly in front of him. He tries to take his trousers but again he stopped an inch before them even Kat and the others push him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\"</span></div></div>",

Sandra could you come with me to the room with our clothes to prove that they making fun of us.\" and so Phil and Sandra go upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they enter the room they saw the clothes on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Here, I found your pants.\" both say and try to give them eachother but stop an inch before they could reach the clothes.<br>\r\n\"That can't be true. They don't lie.\" Phil starts to panic. \"But, But...\".<br>\r\n\"Calm down and be happy that you can wear trousers. That's better than Jordans clothes.\" Sandra has a point and both start to laugh.<br>\r\n\"Let us put on the clothes and tell them that we believe them.\" and both take the rest of eachothers clothes what was no problem because they couldn't take any other article and walk into the cases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later both came out and looking at eachother.<br>\r\n\"Looking good.\" Sandra said now wearing the white tennissocks and boxershorts, grey jeans and the pullover once belonged to Phil.<br>\r\n\"Nice try.\" he said wearing yellow, boycut panties with matching sportsbra and socks, the hippie jeans and the white tank-top. \"But you were right, better than Jordan.\" and again they laugh.<br>\r\nThe last thing to put were the shoes but that wasn't a problem because both was wearing tennis shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs waiting the others only to see the same situation as they saw on Jordan.<br>\r\n\"You see, we don't lie. You can't take any other clothes once you've touched them.\" Jordan shows happy that he was right.<br>\r\n\"Wait...what did you say?\" Kat started to get angry again. \"Did that mean I have to wear your clothes now?\"<br>\r\n\"I think so but didn't I say that it start right after I touched your dress?\" Jordan has now a puzzled look.<br>\r\n\"NOOOOO...\" the others scream but calm down very fast.<br>\r\n\"I still don't believe you.\" Sarah said. \"This is the first time I'm with you and I still think you play a prank on me. Dave, come on. We will check it again.\"<br>\r\n\"But... I believe them. Why should they do that?\" he ask his sister.<br>\r\n\"Like I said, you play a prank on me. And now come on or do you want to wear your sisters clothes?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\" Dave gulped and follows Sarah to the room with the washer and clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they say the truth I shouldn't touch any of your clothes right brother?\"<br>\r\n\"They say so sis and I still hope you will not do anything like that.\" Dave said and get a little nervous because he knew his sister.<br>\r\n\"OK but don't you believe that that would suits me?\" and she shows Dave his striped t-shirt in her hand.<br>\r\n\"Oh great, now I have to wear my sisters clothes\" he said angry.<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a fool. I know you want to make fun of me and to show you I take my underwear.\" and she reach to her thong but... \"What the...you don't prank me?\" couldn't take it in her hands.<br>\r\n\"Do you now believe it...\" Dave screamed, and is on the verge of crying. \"Wearing my sisters clothes...a dream come true.\" he added in a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n\"Now you have the chance. Be happy you have clothes after all.\" she shoots back and has a point. \"Let us get dressed.\"<br>\r\nAnd under the protest of Dave they walk into the cases because he knew his sister was right. What else he should wear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Sandra and Phil before Sarah steps out the locker room after 5 minutes.<br>\r\n\"Come on bro. Don't let me wait to see my new sister.\" she said and starts to smile.<br>\r\nSarah now wears the dark grey pants, the striped shirt and cotton jacket. The rest of the clothes were the black boxershorts and socks.<br>\r\n\"Don't laugh...\" a meekly Dave whispered and leaving the case.<br>\r\nHe wore the sparkling black dress, a black thong and a matching bra minutes before belonged to his sister.<br>\r\n\"Suits you bro. You should wear that more often.\" Sarah joked. \"Take my shoes and you look gorgeous.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean \"my\" shoes\" he jokes back and put the 2 inch heeled sandals on. \"How you can stand or even walk with these shoes? Not to mention the thong.\"<br>\r\n\"Just relax and like it how all girls who want to impress the guys.\"<br>\r\n\"Ha, Ha, Ha...very funny sis.\"<br>\r\n\"Just kidding.\" and the two walking down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest somehow managed to live with the situation for now and don't make a noise as Dave and Sarah enter the living room.<br>\r\nKat in the meantime had put on the clothing of her boyfriend and walks up to the room with the washer to get the shoes of her boyfriend and put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Phil asked. \"We can't walked out like this.\"</span></div></div>",

Oh, there they are\" she said going in the direction of the washer. When she knelt to pick them, she saw a note under  the machine.<br>\r\n\"The cursed washer. The cursed washer cleans everything, even things that you can't see, like the clothes ownership. Once washed, the clothes will belong to the first person who touches it. Be aware, you may use the washer anytime you want, but you won't be able to clean the ownership twice, you'll need to wait at least a week to clean it again. Until then, you won't be able to wear anything else but the the clothes of the original owner of the clothes you first touched after the wash. Don't worry, the clothes always change to fit the new owner.<br>\r\nFor example, person 1 and person2 washed their clothes on the cursed washer and person 2 touched the person 1 clothes first. Person 2 will only be able to wear person 1 clothes, but they will change to fit him. Person 2 may have his clothes again, but he will have to wait for a week, washes his new clothes with his old clothes and then touch his old clothes first instead of his new ones.\"<br>\r\n\"What the ..!?\" Kat thought to herself while reading. \"Cursed washer... Cleaning ownership... Wait a WEEK!? Oh my god!\". Kat work her boyfriend shoes and went downstairs to show the note to the group.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
