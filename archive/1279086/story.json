Got you.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey can you two come in?\" Blooms mother asked.<br>\r\nBlooms mother couldn't see the elf but Bloom told her enough to know that there was a elf. Even if she was invisible.<br>\r\n\"We have some lunch.\"<br>\r\n\"Coming mom.\"<br>\r\nAnd the two of them walked in.<br>\r\n\"Because this is your last day we have some pancakes for lunch. And for dinner... that's a surprise.\"<br>\r\n\"I love pancakes. special with syrup and sugar.\"<br>\r\nLocket landed on table. <br>\r\n\"I also like pancakes.\"<br>\r\nBloom took one pancake for herself and one for Locket.<br>\r\nBloom's father looked confused at the for him disappearing pancake.<br>\r\n\"Dad. It's Locket.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah right. Listen Bloom. We can't see those elf. Would't it be easier to take a pet we could see?'<br>\r\n\"Come on Mike. That little elf never give us any trouble. And she is popular by the children in the shop.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah dad. You know kids can see elf's.\" And she took a second pancake.<br>\r\n\"I wish i could see her.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry dad you can't. But i could make a drawing of her. Then you know how she looks.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do today?\"<br>\r\n\"Ride on my bike.\"<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea. It's good to do some exercise.\" Locket said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch Bloom took her bike. <br>\r\n\"So where did you want to go?\"<br>\r\n\"To the park.\"<br>\r\nA little later Bloom locked her bike to the fence of the park <br>\r\n\"It's really nice weather.\"<br>\r\nThere were't many people in the park. Bloom went to a place in the grass and let herself fall down.<br>\r\n\"Ah! Nice in the sun.\"<br>\r\n Locket landed on her belly and started to giggle.<br>\r\n\"What is it Locket?\"<br>\r\n\"Your Belly. It's a lot softer and bigger then before the vacation. It feels nice.\"<br>\r\nBloom looked at her with a worried face.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Bloom.\"<br>\r\n\"Locket i gained six pounds this vacation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

She though that this was because of the eating, but it was actually magic flowing out of her in massive amounts, changing reality itself to match her dream. Finally Bloom fell asleep in her dream, stuffed past the limit, and in a small food induced coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her eyes snapped open, and she looked at the sun streaming through her window. Bloom got out of bed, noticing that it was a lot harder than usual. she went into her bathroom looked into a mirror to check her hair, and saw her new size. Her large fattened breasts were resting on top of her gigantic belly. Her rear was the size of a whole couch, and her thighs were as thick as trees to support her. Her torso was quite wide and was covered in love handles. Strangely, Bloom found none of this unusual, and stepped into her shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later, as Bloom was drying off her now 550lb body, her cell phone rang. When Bloom picked up the phone, she heard Stella's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Bloom,\" Stella said, \"hope your all packed up cause I'm coming to pick you up at noon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm packed Stella,\" Bloom said, \"I wouldn't want us to be late and let the other girls get all the really fattening food. I just have to go hug mom good-bye, and eat my breakfast, then I'll get to the pick-up spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, see you soon,\" Stella said while hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloom put on her XXXL t-shirt, and her XXXL jeans and headed down stairs for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning mom,\" Bloom said as she sat down on the two chairs she needed to support her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Bloom,\" said her 700lb mother, who except for her hair and face, was a larger version of Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta go to school today,\" Bloom said while begining to wolf down the breakfast that covered the whole table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father and I will miss you as usual, but your big enough to take care of yourself,\" Bloom's mom said while patting Bloom's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw mom, you know I'll call,\" Bloom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Bloom let out a loud belch, having finished her send off breakfast, and probably adding another 3 pounds to her frame. Then she grabbed her suitcase and walked out of the house. Due to her size it took her an hour to get to the pick up site. Bloom arrived just in time to see the spaceship she and the rest of the Winx club used to get to Alfea. Stella stepped out the door, in the 500lb body from Bloom's dream and helped her up  the stairs to the entryway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Bloom, it's time to go get the others,\" Stella said while munching on a large burger she had brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, let's go,\" Bloom said as she strapped into the pilots seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTella always let Bloom fly the pickup route because the distance from Solaria to Earth was greater than the rest of the entire trip. Plus Stella knew Bloom loved flying in both spaceships, and with her own wings.</span></div></div>",

Tecna had a pile of burgers in one hand, and sat down to finish those. Once she was done, Tecna gave a loud belch of satisfaction, and then walked up to her friends. Tecna started to grope Bloom's fat breasts, then moved on to her belly, then her ass. Bloom plafully groped Tecna back, and then the process was repeated with Stella. This kind of groping wasn't unusual between the three friends or the other three who were absent. It wasn't very sexual in nature, it was just friendly teasing in between the six faeries, and a way of appreciating each other's gaining, and a way to encourage each other to gain more weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the space of another hour and a half, Bloom picked her other three friends, each pick-up including a round of hugs and friendly groping. Then Bloom plugged in the coordinates for the group's favorite restaurant. The name of that restaurant was \"The Fattened Cow\". Although not the best name for a restaurant, the group cared more for what the restraurant did. The specialty of the place was to create massive quantaties of fast food that was specially modified to make females fatten up at an extrordinary rate. Any girl who went in, came out at least 25lbs heavier, but most came out even bigger. The current record for weight gained in a single sitting was 500lbs, and that had left the setter immobile since she wasn't a faerie. The Winx Club's goal was for each of them to gain 100lbs that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they landed at the spacedock provided by the restaurant, they went in and had the man at the welcoming desk look up their reservation. Soon they were seated at their table. When the 350lb waitress came up to take their order, Bloom spoke for all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have two \"Clothes Buster\" meals for each of us, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away ma'am,\" the waitress responded, and left to take their orders to the chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the group's first time ordering that meal, and they couldn't wait to have it. The \"Clothes Buster\" was so named because it contained enough calories to make a girl gain so much weight that they would burst through their clothes, and be left naked in their booths.

Oh that's right first day of school!\"<br>\r\nLocket also woke up.<br>\r\n\"You better hurry Bloom. Stella comes to pick you up in a few minutes. If she is't late.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's see. Clothing bag. Check! School supplies. Check. Personal stuff. Check.<br>\r\nAnd the only two things i need are a rabbit with the name Kiko and a cute little pixie named Locket.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly the door of her room opened.<br>\r\n\"You were't planning on going without saying goodbye were you?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I love you mom and i love you dad.\"<br>\r\nAnd she hugged and kissed her parents goodbye.<br>\r\n\"Hello Bloom! Your ride is here.\" Stella said.<br>\r\nStella was still the same. with her long blond hair, brown eyes small waist and she still looked fantastic. <br>\r\nAmore was sitting on her shoulder. She waved happy.\"<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Bloom. Be careful.\"<br>\r\n\"Have a great time. And stay out of trouble!\"<br>\r\n\"I will mom. Don't worry!\"<br>\r\nAnd together they went to Magix. Back to Alfea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of trouble Bloom? Every year we are until our neck in trouble.\"<br>\r\n\"But that's not really our fault.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe not but i don't think you stay out of trouble.\"<br>\r\nBloom and Stella walked to Alfea. It felt good to see the old pink building again. <br>\r\nShe and Stella walked through the halls to their room they shared with Flora, Musa, Techna and Lyala.\" <br>\r\n\"Hello you girls!\" Techna said. <br>\r\n\"Good to see you again.\" Flora said happy.<br>\r\n\"Oh it's great to see you two again. I missed you so much.\"<br>\r\n\"Were are Musa and Layla?\" Stella asked.<br>\r\n\"Right behind you Stella.\" <br>\r\nMusa was holding a stereo and Layla some CD's. <br>\r\nMusa looked a bit stronger. After she put her stereo down Bloom shook her hand. It was a bit stronger. <br>\r\n\"Well i still need to unpack some stuff.\"  Bloom said. <br>\r\nAnd she walked to her room she shared with Flora. Flora was already inside unpacking her stuff.<br>\r\nKiko looked curious at some of Flora's plants But he did't eat them. The last time he tried the plant fought back. He only would eat a plant if Bloom or Flora said that it was all right.<br>\r\n\"Did you gain some weight?\" Flora asked.<br>\r\n\"You noticed?\" <br>\r\n\"I shared two years a room with you. Don't you think i know your size?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah i gained a few pounds but now school started again i will work it of.\"<br>\r\n\"Be careful or you going to become a fat fairy!\" Chetta said.<br>\r\nLocket got up and tried to catch Chetta who fast flew away followed by Locket.<br>\r\n\"Watch out for my plants!\" <br>\r\n\"And all the other stuff!\"<br>\r\nChetta flew right at the bed but changed from direction at the last moment. Locket was having to much speed and flew right at the bed and got up a little dizzy.<br>\r\nFlora picked her up and started to giggle.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Bloom asked.<br>\r\n\"Looks like your not the only one who gained.\"<br>\r\nBloom looked and noticed Lockets belly was a little rounder.<br>\r\n\"Locket you didn't tell me.\"<br>\r\n\"Be careful or you will look like a melon!\" Chetta said.<br>\r\n\"That's it now i really gonna catch you!\" <br>\r\nAnd Locket tried again to catch Chetta. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Why not.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly a box of fries appeared in her hand (Hey it's a dream so a box of fries can appear okay).<br>\r\nLocket opened her mouth wide.

Feed me more fries!\"<br>\r\nBloom kept feeding her until the whole pack of fries was gone.

The ribbon of her dress seemed at the point of snapping.<br>\r\n\"Come on Bloom. I'm still a hungry pixie. I want more food.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly there appeared a lot of fatty food. <br>\r\nHamburgers, milkshakes, chicken nuggets, mashed potatoes with greasy gravy, backed bacon an much more.<br>\r\n\"Come on Bloom. Feed the hungry pixie.\"<br>\r\nLocket again opened her mouth.

Also Locket's arms an legs got a layer of fat on them. and her belly was getting rounder and bigger turning into some nice fat rolls.<br>\r\nAfter about half of all the food disappeared in Lockets belly that seemed to have become bottomless Her dress ripped let her now huge gut spill out. She smiled<br>\r\n\"Oops. Well i'm still hungry. Please Bloom feed me more.\"<br>\r\nAnd she pulled what remained of her dress of her fat frame and opened her mouth wide again while bloom shoved a spoon full of mashed potatoes with greasy gravy in Locket's hungry mouth. </span></div></div>",

Gluttony.\"<br>\r\n\"No! It's who i am! Come on. I know you're smart. You know the seven sins right?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course.

Well today you released me by eating those hamburgers. But i did't want to be locked up again. There was only one way to escape. Get out of you body.\"<br>\r\n\"But how did you do that?\"<br>\r\nWhen you're female friend put her hand on your belly i pulled some of her magic energy out of her body to create this body. I think it's really nice. Do you remembered yo heard a plop? That was me escaping your body.\"<br>\r\n\"So that's what happened to Bloom and why and how you came here.\"<br>\r\n\"Well.\" The gluttony said with an evil grin. \"There is one more reason why i came here.\"<br>\r\n\"And that is...\"<br>\r\n\"For you. Poor thing. Just look at yourself. Your just skin and bones. I came out to help you. To fatten you up. After all i am gluttony. By the way, you're the only one who can see and hear me. And you can talk to me with your mind.\"<br>\r\nThe  gluttony looked with a evil smile at Flora who was starting to get scared.<br>\r\n\"Time to life a new life. My life. The fat live.

But since i'm out of your body i can do my stuff any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened one of Bloom's drawers and found two chocolate bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flora... eat them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora could't control her body. Her hands grabbed the chocolate and stuffed it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaa! That's it! Eat it! Just eat it! Eat it! Just eat it! Get used to it Flora. You're going to do this a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be stopped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be stopped? I? Don't think so. How or who is going to stop me?<br>\r\nA. Your female friends. They can't see me<br>\r\nB. Your boyfriend. Can't see me either.<br>\r\nC. You. No. or<br>\r\nD. None of the above.<br>\r\nThe answer is D my<br>\r\ndear Flora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora angry went out of her room and gluttony followed her. Musa was still sitting on the couch. Bloom was sitting next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Girls ho does it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Flora. I really gonna pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella ran out her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta help me! With dress will look better at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stell why do you ask me?\" Bloom asked. I knew just as much about mode if you know from... from.. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...School.\" Musa said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really the word where i was looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGluttony flew around for Musa's face. After that she flew over to Stella and waved her hand for Stella's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking forward to tonight. The guys are gonna be there and there is a big buffet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really! Now that's sounds interesting.\" Gluttony said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The witches are also coming right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after the battle against the Trix and lord Darkar the schools have helped each other. The witches from cloud tower are however also fighting evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But the weren't really helpful when when needed to protect the codex from Darkar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can become better friends in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wich dress? The red on. Or the blue one? I just don't know. Where is Amore? She is always good in these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is in the garden. Playing with the other pixies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora walked back to her room and let herself fall on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great my friends can't see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep the can't see your... your how do you want to call me? good spirit, best friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about inner demon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better can starting to like me. We have an entire buffet to devour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. Do you think i can devour an entire buffet for three school's?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can try. I have some tricks up my sleeve.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd she walked over Flora's belly to her chest.  Her thighs were rubbing to each other when he walked. She stopped when she was between Flora's boobs. and placed a hand on each of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these two are also to become so much bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora grabbed the little thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you are a part of me don't touch my boobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well you're boobs have fat in them. So how fatter you become how bigger they become. When you're about a ton the must be the size of water melons. Don't that sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bad Flora. You gonna be fat! Really extremely fat! Obese! And finally immobile. So fat you can't move. And after that you're still gonna be fatter. you're gonna be the fattest fairy ever.\"  <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

She looked down at the pile of confections, wondering why there was so much, she doubted she could lift it: let alone carry it. Noticing that most of the snacks were desserts like cookies, she reaches out, grabs a brownie, and stuffs it in her mouth.  Smiling as her eyes light up, she again reaches forward, completely ignoring her newly added paunch squishing against her thighs, grabs a brownie which felt heavy in each hand. Taking a bite; her belly pushed a little more against her shirt, breasts growing plumper, and thighs filling her stockings she moans in pleasure as she gorged on the delicious sweets. Cornelia laid back on the couch: huffing from her meal, she sits up and struggles to reach forward for more helpings, but her belly is weighing her back. She shuffles a little bit towards the basket and heaves it up onto the couch. Panting from the effort, she immediately starts stuffing cookies into her mouth. With the easy availability, her body once again expands. Her great belly flowing towards her knees, its heavy weight began to push her legs apart. Straining against her stockings, her fat thighs began stretching them and popping seams as they only grew rounder. Biting half off of a particularly large brownie: its other half fell into her cleavage. Her pair was close to becoming as big as watermelons as they grew and eventually hid the brownie out of sight. *DING DONG* Getting her attention from her dessert stuffing Cornelia wondered who was at the door. She attempted to rise, but quickly fell back down on the couch 'there's something pressing down on me' she figured out. Not bothering to think any further, she plants both hands onto the couch and rises: though with great difficulty. After standing up, she stumbles a little, unused to this new weight 'ok' she thought 'how did I get so fat?!' Looking down, she is met with the sight of two massive breasts, she cups one and is surprised at their weight. Bending her head to the right, she sees her stomach falling past her knees. She trys to reach her belly button with both hands, but only came slightly close. Deciding to shake her belly, it causes her to moan at the sensitivity of her flesh and makes her whole body bounce. Feeling her butt wobble, she feels a jolt of fright, and peers behind her. Her ass was HUGE! Taking her hand as far behind her as she could, she pushes it against her ass flesh and feels it sink completely in her butt. She groaned in dissatisfaction; she didn't want to be fat! Especially being this huge! Each cheek could cover a couch cushion under its mass. Hearing her doorbell ring, she maneuvers each thigh past each other as she walked towards the door. The feeling of her ass, belly, and breast bouncing was embarrassing for her.</span></div></div>",

She looked like she was the cool girl. The leader of the group. On her bell was a red star shaped gem.<br>\r\nAfter her was a girl with blue hair in a ponytail. She wore glasses but only to read because she placed them on her forehead and didn't to seem have any trouble to see were she was going. She seemed smart an nice but maybe a little shy. There was a nice blue flower shaped gem on her belly.<br>\r\nAfter her walked a girl with a big pile of pink hair on her head. She seemed a real cute girlie girl. With a heart shaped hair clip and also a heart shaped pink gem on her belly.<br>\r\nAfter her walked a Gothic girl. Purple hair in two round balls on her head. Because of her dark make up, clothing and the fact that she wasn't smiling she seemed in a bad mood. She was wearing a purple half moon shaped gem on her belly.<br>\r\nThe last girl didn't seem to bright. With her orange eyes and blond hair. But she seemed nice with her diamond shaped yellow gem.<br>\r\n(i don't have to tell the names of the girls right?) <br>\r\n\"Finally we haven't been in ages to the mall.\"<br>\r\n\"Only a weak ago.\"<br>\r\n\"That's seven times twenty-four hours.\"<br>\r\n \"Well Onyx, a day is't twenty-four hours but twenty-three hours fivty-nine minutes and vifty-six seconds.\"<br>\r\n\"Does it matter?

I need to buy a birthday present for my little brother.\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't you give him something what explodes or is deadly like a snake?\"<br>\r\n\"I would love to. Really. But my mother said if i would do something like that i need to wear a pink dress till my ankles with hearts and flowers.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm off to buy some books.\" Sapphire said.<br>\r\n\"Well Am. I'm off to do my hair. Wanna come?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure why not.\"<br>\r\n\"It is so great. To do my hair and spot nice guys.\"            <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours they were at there table eating a snack and drinking a milkshake.<br>\r\n\"And Topaz, did you found some nice clothes?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep. And i still have money left.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's go to Obsedian.\" Amhytist said.<br>\r\n\"Good idea but first let me eat my cheeseburger with extra union.\" Onyx answered.<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm still hungry.\" Ruby said.<br>\r\n\"You just had two hamburgers and a milkshake.\"<br>\r\n\"So? I take another two hamburgers and a milkshake. Shake it not stirred.\"<br>\r\nWhile Ruby walked away for to order some more food Amhytist bent for over to her friends.<br>\r\n\"You know, every year around this time Ruby get's hungry all of a sudden. Don't worry. after a few day's it's over.\"<br>\r\n\"I hope so for her because so much burgers are going to ruin her figure.\"<br>\r\nRuby came back and started to eat her two burgers.

I remember that some trollz had that. But it was very rare. It happens in puberty.\"<br>\r\n\"But i already have this from... well since i was four. And maybe even before that but i can't remember.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Strange indeed. Listen i will look in some old books maybe i find some answers. I will also call m.r Trollhimer. He has a lot of books with maybe a answer. Until then just watch what you eat. Only eat healthy. You would't want that nice and flat belly of you to turn in a pot belly.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not. However... I would like to have some bigger boobs.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You get everything when your ready for it.\" <br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the girls paid for their spells and went home.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm still strange that hunger of Ruby.

NOW!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune looked and saw an entire horde of creatures made of candy. The part Ray Ray was concerned about, though, was that everyone in the city could see them.

So, we gonna eat them or what?\" Ray Ray was waiting for the call to action, but June replied, \"I think we need to see Ah-Mah first, bro.

Now if you guys don't mind, I'd like to save the city in real clothes, please.\" June wasn't dressed yet.

I got this.\" Dennis was ready to help out on the home front (His role-playing expertise was actually what got him onto the team in the first place; according to Monroe, much of the magical knowledge Dennis gained from his games was actual magical knowledge in the show's world.) \"You sure you're up for this?\" Ah-Mah asked. \"As far as field work goes, you're still a rookie.\" \"Relax, I'm all over this.\" June rolled her eyes and said, \"That's Dennis for you.

June drank it and instantly, her stomach started to settle, then rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, thanks, Ah-Mah. I think I can take it from here.\" As June left, Ray Ray tried the potion. \"I'll need this, too. I bet I could eat more than June.\"<br>\r\nRay Ray wouldn't get the chance, however.

We've got bigger problems, though. We have to get rid of these creatures. At least with Ray Ray's fire, we actually have a better chance. This fire is the only thing other than eating those creatures that'll take them down.\" Dennis then shouted, \"Then why didn't we try this before?!\" Monroe responded, \"If this potion isn't prepared correctly, anything can happen to anyone. We got lucky with Ray Ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, URP!, but what about June?\" Ray Ray asked. As it turns out, June's hunger dramatically increases, but her metabolism remains the same.</span></div></div>",

I feel like a pig for eating so much, but it goes away when I remember I need this.\" What June didn't realize, however, was that while she wasn't getting fuller, she was still getting fatter.

I can tell because the candy's getting harder. Look at all the peppermint on this guy.\" June was holding a demon clad in armor made of hard peppermint.

It's pinching me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, oh yeah, hang on.\" Ashley reached for her baton, but her new girth made her have to stretch for it; it was stuck in the back of her skirt.

June took one look at the lab and said, \"I don't like the looks of this place.\" Ashley responded, \"Not one bit.\" They looked around for an exit, but heard a loud voice say, \"Current weight of object: 175 pounds.\" They yelped and looked up; June had stepped on a giant scale and activated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"175 pounds? Are these really demons that fattening?\" June looked at herself in a nearby mirror and saw how big she really was. Her belly jutted out about ten inches from where it used to be and jiggled a bit when she moved. Her face was plumped up to incredible proportions and developed a second chin; it was even nearing a third. June's arms and legs pretty much turned into sausages, as did her fingers. Ashley looked and basically saw the same thing, she even weighed the same. It was as if they were both pumped full of cream by hoses. Ashley, however, liked the feel of her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee! I feel like a marshmallow!\" Ashley poked her blubber to feel how soft she had gotten and slapped her belly to watch it jiggle. June, meanwhile, had started to enjoy eating constantly. She felt that it was best to just stay fat rather than try to lose the weight. The first potion wore off, so she took a second potion she found in the lab to give her a bigger appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, I feel like there's a pit in my belly!\" June felt like her stomach was going to collapse upon itself. \"I've got to get something to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"June, are you okay?\" Ashley asked. \"You seem a little... weird.\" June said, \"I think it's this potion. I'm so hungry, uh, where are those demons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, several advanced demons with peppermint armor burst into the room, ready to fight, but June rushed in and quickly devoured some of them. Ashley then looked at the potion June had drank, then drank it herself and ate the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, June, let's get the leader!\" she yelled. \"I'm starving!\" They rushed through the hole the demons made, ate several more, and on the other side was the leader, a terrifying mix of every candy imaginable. His lemon yellow eyes glared at the girls, who looked at him as if they hit the jackpot of sweets. (His name is Maltose, by the way. Imagine his voice actor being Diedrich Bader.) He then snapped his fingers, causing a cage of candy canes to fall on the girls and trap them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good meal is so hard to find these days,\" he said.</span></div></div>",

If they like eating so much, why not keep them going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were then bound by licorice and had chocolate stuffed down their throats. They felt their bodies grow and their bellies bloat considerably. Their skirts and shirts were ready to tear, but they had a plan. Their bodies grew all over, especially where they were bound, eventually snapping the ropes. The girls then ate like never before, chomping as many demons as possible. Maltose looked on with horror, then said with a disgusted look on his face, \"I guess I didn't think this through.\" He tried to attack, but was quickly eaten. As it turned out, Ashley was at least half right; the other demons did stop attacking, but that was because Maltose was a hive leader. The demons lived and acted as one; when Maltose was eaten, the other demons disintegrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it was found that The Veil fell due to natural failure and that it was iffy that it would be repaired. There was a bright side, however; the Lees found a way to set up several different methods to keep the people from discovering the truth, such as exposed movie lots and holograms, though the latter was less convincing.

I used it yesterday when i was busy with my homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she saw her math book on the kitchen table next to the cookie. She grabbed her math book and pushed it in her backpack and also grabbed the cookie and eat it and after that ran out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go to school. Bye aunt Zelda. Bye uncle Quickly. Bye Salem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye honey. Do your best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda walked downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is Sabrina already gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just missed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange. I can't remember i liked school so much when i was a teenager. Well that was a few century's ago of course but still... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the kitchen and screamed. She ran back and turned to Salem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salem why did you eat that cookie?\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"I did't eat a cookie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think i would believe you? Lie is one of the things you do best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit you're right. I'm really good in telling lies. But this time i'm telling the truth. I have an alibi. I was the whole time in the room with uncle Quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i must admit that Salem is telling the truth. This time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda did you eat that cookie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i did't. I try to watch my figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you did't do it then it must have been... Sabrina. Oh no! She was't supposed to eat that cookie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you leave it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well on the kitchen table. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why do leave a magic cookie in a place like the kitchen? If i would have seen a cookie in a kitchen i would also have thought that it would be a normal cookie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. So maybe it was't my best idea ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"What does the cookie to the one who eat it?\" Salem asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the person who eats the cookie will gain a lot of weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should anyone made such a stupid magic cookie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was't for Sabrina. It was for an old classmate. One that stole my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you was over that guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was. But not over her. I thought about a spell to make her fat. My revenge is sweet.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need to wait with you revenge. Because now Sabina has eaten your cookie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you need to work on a spell to reverse this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh that could be a problem. I think i worked on a spell that can' be reversed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we alway's teach Sabrina? Don't use a spell you can't reverse. And now you did thi... oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do we do with Sabrina?\" Salem asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tell her when she comes back from school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will we still know her when she comes back?\" </span></div></div>",
