It's known to be a variation of both the Dermal Armor ability and Bio-Metal Physiology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCapabilities<br>\r\nAccording to the information at hand, the user has a body with an organic metal skin that can resist almost any attack, giving the user with this ability to have enhanced durability, along with possible hints of superhuman strength. Because of their living organic metal substance for body tissue, it is possible that the user can obtain immortality. However, the user may not always possess an organic metallic form, but are capable of transforming into such a form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplications<br>\r\n*Elasticity<br>\r\n*Natural Weaponry<br>\r\n*Organic Constructs<br>\r\n*Organic Metal Transmutation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssociations<br>\r\n*Bio-Metal Physiology<br>\r\n*Biological Manipulation<br>\r\n*Dermal Armor<br>\r\n*Metal Manipulation<br>\r\n*Metal Mimicry<br>\r\n*Trace Metal Manipulation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnown Users<br>\r\nAlthough not as popular or as common like other superpowers such as Flight, Superhuman Strength, or Regeneration, there are a few noteworthy users of the Organic Metal  Skin ability, such as:<br>\r\n*Terminus (Marvel Comics)<br>\r\n*Ironclad (Marvel Comics)<br>\r\n*Predator X (Marvel Comics)<br>\r\n*Colossus (Marvel Comics)<br>\r\n*Senator Steven Armstrong (Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen: Organic Metal Skin!
