This was Saga. It is a place of unlimited potential and can bring many changes to people be they from here or from some place far far away. There are five ways to interact with Saga as a whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Being a King or Queen: Playing as the ruler of a kingdom has its perks such as free reign to explore your chosen kingdom and to attend certain royal gatherings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Being Prince or Princess: Not quite as much power as a king or queen but have more of a chance to interact with those their own age in a school setting or royal event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Whisked Away Visitors: People from the normal human world who were whisked away from their homes and families and brought to Saga for some unknown reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Random Residents: Normal, well Saga Normal, people who live their day to day lives trying to make a living and supporting themselves or their families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Sage: Become Saga's ruler itself and change things anyway you see fit. You can become a benevolent ruler...or a power fueled dictator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow...pick your poison.</span></div></div>",

It took Jane nearly 5 days to return to her home kingdom. As she walked, she realized something: despite all of the walking she was doing, she wasn't losing any weight. She knew that her weight wasn't permanent, since she had heard that previous prisoners who were released had managed to slim back down, but she was still a bit confused. Maybe she just lost weight much slower. At least, she hoped.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nFinally, she arrived at the Puzzle Kingdom. She was beyond tired, and just wanted to find a place to sleep. However, she remembered that mearly entering the Puzzle Kingdom requiered solving a complex puzzle. And she was far too tired to even try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to waddle off when she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Miss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, she saw a beautiful woman run up to her. The woman was tall and shapely, with black hair, green eyes, and olive colored skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jane could say anything, the woman started walking around her, inspecting every inch of Jane's immense body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can I help you?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just from a glance, I can tell you're almost 900 pounds.\" The woman said. \"You seemed to have walked all the way here, so I guess you just got released from one of the punishment kingdoms, and based on your body, you just got freed from the Gluttony Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane nodded, very confused right now. At that, the woman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're absolutely perfect!\" The woman said. \"My name is Nia, and I've been looking for someone like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Girls who weigh 800 pounds or more are all the rage right now!\" Nia said. \"I can be of help to you. You work with me, and I can get your criminal record cleared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane lit up at that. She couldn't believe it. She'd actually be able to be a normal person again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Jane replied. \"What kingdom are you from that's got this \"rage\" right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia smiled. \"Miss, you're looking at one of the best agents in the...\"</span></div></div>",

She had no time to be confused before the caravan<br>\r\ncompletely tipped over on it's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women all were thrown from the caravan and landed on the ground, thankfully unhurt due to their incredible weight. Slowly, Jane did her best to try and stand, when she noticed that the force of the throw broke the chain on her ankle.

The dance training she had gotten before actually did help her move further, but she still had almost no stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting me into a lot of trouble.\" She said to her monstrous gut. \"And now I'm taling to my own stomach.
