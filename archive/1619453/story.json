She was turning 100 and you could tell if you saw her trying to figure out how to change the channel, or use a cell phone, or a computer. So I thought I'd help her reconnect with a more familiar time a little. Problem was I had yet to find one thing I could afford, who knew such irrelevant things could be so expensive. I was just about to give up when the shopkeeper approached me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid. is there anything I can help you with?\" The shopkeeper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just looking for a present to give my grandma, she's turning 100 in a few days.\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fooling?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper got a big grin on his face. Then dashed into a room in the back of the store and quickly returned with an iron lockbox in hand. He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a key. Afterward he opened the box, reveling a small clunky disposable camera. I carefully took the camera in my hands and inspected it. It had a wheel to spin so it must use film. But still, a disposable camera. Sure it looked pretty old, I still doubted that it qualified as an antique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" I said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your wondering whether this is an antique, trust me it's older than it looks. And this particular camera has seen quite a bit of history if what what I've heard about it is true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have much money\" I admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what kid, I'll give you the camera free of charge if you agree to do a favor for me in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would have preferred to look around more for something affordable, but there was something unsettling about this man and I didn't want to risk offending him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of favor?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time well tell.\" The Shopkeeper replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat choice did I have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The woman is wearing an elegant gown looking to be from the early 1900's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike in most old black and white photos, the subjects are staring blank into the camera.

You find yourself starting to examine yourself but you then shake yourself out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it wasn't just that photo album,\" you halfheartedly suggest. You aren't convinced at all but since that photo album is no longer available to you you feel that you have to try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda perks up. She looks at you hopefully. \"Let's go find another one.\" She anxiously suggests. You both get up and go poking through some of the things that you can find. Unfortunately you don't have much luck at all. Everything is already boxed up. People are packing their purchases up. After ten minutes of searching you don't find any photo albums at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you look up and see a photograph on the wall. It is the only photograph left that you can see. This particular photo has a young woman in her twenties on it. This one looks to be much newer though still at least forty years old. The woman has a hairstyle and hat that scream of the 70's. You wonder if you can do it again. In desperation you focus on the picture and concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the previous two times you are suddenly transported to another location. You are still in the house but in a different room. You recognize the room from the estate sale but it looks totally different. You barely have time to register what happened before you hear a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK babe,\" a guy says to you, \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in his direction and see a young man with a goofy mustache looking at you. He has a big bulky camera in his hand. It looks like he just took that picture that you saw on the wall. From his attire and the rest of the house you presume that it is somewhere in the 70's. You look down at yourself. You find that you are wearing a baggy sweater and some jeans that flare out at the bottom. You can clearly see that you are female but you already suspected as much from the face in the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Let's go,\" the guy says again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to him. \"Where?\" you ask.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you head to the mall, Amanda asks you about how you are going to pass yourself off as her sister.  \"I haven't thought about that yet, I suppose I just thought no one would call me out.\"  You both get to the mall without incident and walk in.  Surprisingly, not a lot of people were there, and you both start walking around the mall searching for stores.  Amanda dragged you into store after store until she got tired.  You and Amanda went towards the Food Court and got some fast food to sit down and eat.  While eating, Amanda saw some people eyeing you as they pass by and giving weird looks.  Amanda immediately snapped her fingers in front of you to get your attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Can you stop eating like a pig?\" said Amanda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, your sister was hungry before we left and we went to so many stores.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has nothing to do with you making Kelly look like a crazed lunatic.\" She retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah...\" You said, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, go on and finish and let's go.\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, I'm going to try something real fast.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? What are you doing?\" asked Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to concentrate Amanda, can you bear with me for a moment\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you focus more, your mind gets immediately flooded with another set of thoughts and memories, Kelly's to be exact.  You can recall how she was part of the choir in high school, how she graduated from college as a Art major, and everything up to what she was going to do when you swapped.  Amanda and you then turned towards where you had walked in and started to head out.  Along the way, Amanda noticed the changes in your behavior right away.  Amanda then asked you if you were aware you were acting just like her sister.  Amanda noted the way you were walking, to the way you had just reacted when someone calls her sister out on something.   She started to ask you about stuff relating to her sister.  Amanda was stunned at how you were able to answer most of what she asked correctly.  You then asked her if she wanted to go back to her house.  Amanda was about to reply, as her phone started ringing. \"That should be Natalie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute Amanda turns to you and says \"Well she wants to hang out with me since I told her my parents were gone. So why did you suddenly want to go back to the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, by any chance do you have a picture of you and your sister from today?\" You ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\" Amanda wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I mean that if we use the return photo, I have a theory I want to test.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Amanda get back to the house and Amanda rushes upstairs to go and get the return photo.  You head upstairs as well, going into Kelly's room.  The 'Kelly' part of you was wanting to go towards the desk and start listening to music and draw.  You decided it wasn't a bad idea and headed over to Kelly's desk and started to write a note for her.  You wondered if writing it would even matter, but you decided to give it a shot.  You start writing that she should write or record a memo of what happens to her this week, reasoning that this should be a vacation she would want to remember.  You then end the note with the fact that she should meet up with you and Amanda at her parent's house, making sure to give you and Amanda enough time to get ready for her arrival.  As you are getting up from the desk you hear the door open and Amanda comes in with the photo.  You hear the doorbell ring, and you both quickly use the return photo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision returns as you are back in the present.  You are back in your body and Amanda is in her own.  Acting fast, you ask Amanda if she could find the picture of her sister from today lying around.  She ran around the house when she finally grabbed a photo of her sister she hadn't seen before from the kitchen.  As Amanda was going out of the kitchen, she noticed some of her sister's stuff on the counter.  You both were in luck as the picture was indeed timestamped as earlier in the morning.  Amanda guessed that her sister might have stopped by her parent's house to get something.  As Amanda handed you the picture, you take her towards the living room window to watch the front door.  You check the time on your phone and realize it is a couple minutes after the time you had wrote on the note.  You start turning away from the window when Amanda spots her sister pulling up to the house.  Amanda saw Kelly get out of her car and started walking up to the door.  Amanda turns to you and watches, as you concentrate on the photo of Kelly and focus on the current time.  You are surprised to open your eyes and find yourself outside with your right hand about to ring the doorbell, when Amanda opens the door for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what now?\" Amanda asked</span></div></div>",

As I turned a corner a patch of ice awaited me flinging my car off the road, through the barricade and into the air. As I fell the last thing I remember was falling then seeing a picture of my cousin, Jenny who was now 16 and beautiful as her short brown hair was to the side of her flawless face and her smile to die for. And as I closed my eyes for what I thought was the last time I found myself in a bed. My legs were covered and warm with a pink nightie. I realized  a few bouncy objects on my chest and some short brown hair which I had to brush out of my eyes a few times. I soon remembered my immanent death and seeing Jenny for what I thought was the last time. I quickly went to the restroom which was not hard to find seeing I slept there when not visiting relatives. And I flipped on the light and gasped and realized that I was Jenny. I sat and thought of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

It was saying she had gained a bunch of weight since she got pregnant including a picture of her pregnant. You pick up the magazine and pay for it since you had nothing better to do. You stared at that picture of kim kardashian until you suddenly blacked out and fell unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly wake up. You hear the sound of like pool water. You open your eyes and see a pool in front of you and you are now laying on a beach chair. Long black strands of hair fall in front of your eyes. You pish the strands of hair out of your wyes and notice your now smaller, tan, more feminine hand. \"What the fuck! Where am I?\" You think to yourself. You try and get up but cant due to a weird shift in your weight all to the front of your body. You finally look down and are shocked at what you find. You see two swollen, milk filled, tan, EE cup boobs barely contained in a grey snakeskin looking bikini top. Under those giant melons was a ginormous tan pregnant belly. You look behind you at your now huge backside. You recognize that backside from the magazine cover \"This cant be. No I am not her.\" You think to yourself. You finally get up and feel somewhat balanced due to your huge ass in the back and huge boobs and belly in the front. You waddle over to a nearby mirror and the reflection confirms your terrible assumptions. You were now Kim Kardashian when she was pregnant.

No wonder they have made fun of the weight gain. This belly is enormous.\" You think to yourself as you rub across the tan belly and Kim's memories slowly rush inside your head. Kim's mother shows up along with her sisters Khloe and Kourtney. They all sit down on the chairs next to you. \"So how are you feeling Kim\" Kris, Kim's mother asks you. \"Well I hate being this fat. I mean I look like an elephant. I also ache due to the swelling.\" You say to them as you feel weird speaking in Kim's voice. \"Well Kim, it will all be worth it in the end. You are just gonna have to deal with the weight gain right now.\" Her mother says to you. \"And I cant stand to even go outside right now because of all the paparazzi making lies, saying that I gained 100+ pounds when I have not gained near that much weight.\" You again say as the rest of Kim's memories fill in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Have you found out what you are having?\" Khloe asks as she puts a hand on your new pregnant belly. It feels weird to you that somebody wants to touch your pregnant belly and feel it. \"We found out we are having a girl and are going to name her North.\" You say to them as you watch her touch and occasionaly rub your now pregnant belly, wanting her to stop. Your now mother joins in as she feels the belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You remember that Kanye isnt here this weekend because he is out working on a new album. To you, it seems kinda nice to escape your dull life for the life of a real celebrity even if it is a pregnant one. You try to escape Kims family for a few moments since they keep trying to touch your belly. Having to waddle everywhere because of the belly, not having a male extremity, and the constant kicks are just some of the weird feelings you are having to get used to pretty quick to completley act like kim and not your normal self. You waddle back out to the pool area after finishing going to the bathroom as Kim Kardashian for the first time. Kims family is still out there waiting to ask more pregnancy questions. \"So Kim, how has it been in bed with kanye now with the pregnancy?\" Kourtney asks you as you start to remember how to respond due to your new found memories. \"Well it has been pretty rough. Since I have gained all of this weight, I just dont have any energy to anything. The belly also seems to get in the way as well.\" You say as you remember the experiences. \"So how have the cravings been?\" Kris asks you. \"Well, look at me, I am huge! I can not stop eating. I have started eating a lot of junk food and have blown up like a blimp.\" You agitatingly say to them. \"Let's talk about something other than my pregnant body.\" You finally say. They all quiet about your pregnancy and eventually head home after getting a few touches to your belly. You get another look at your new pregnant body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[URL=http://s1175.photobucket.com/user/bfine2525/media/Pregnant/CC397B02-C75 3-4EEC-8E91-B0E66AFD03A9_zpsaegwh6eb.jpg.html][IMG]<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625/bfine2525/Pregnant/CC397B02-C753-4EEC-8E91-B0E66AFD03A9_zpsaegwh6eb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625...</a>[/IMG][/URL]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",
