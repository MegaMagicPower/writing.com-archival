Is it No-Heart again?\" She said to herself as she doubted it there weren't any of the evil wizard's shadowy minions flying around causing misery or sorrow anywhere or Beastly for that matter so what was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheer Bear received the answer when she came to a lone warehouse at the end of one intersection and upon entering without permission she saw a lone creepy looking man standing beside a odd looking machine that looked like it came from the 50s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm hello there sir. I was walking around this town and noticed everyone is in a sadden state do you know what is going on here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be one of those Care Bear creatures I have been hearing about.\" He said in the typical evil tone of voice with  a sinister grin. \"And you happened to stumble upon my plan have you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Y-you mean you did all this why?\" Cheer Bear blurted out in alarm as the apparent villain of this story laughed evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I,the soon to be great Mr Unkind am tired of all these happy,annoying people I'm surrounded by all the time! It's unfair that I had a cold,miserable childhood and am still living the life of a miser while everyone else is happy and lives carefree lives with their friends and families so to settle the score I created my Emotion-Eraser machine to show people all the sorrow and misery I felt over the years!\" He cried evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not fair! You can't cause misery and sadness to people just because you yourself had a unhappy childhood experience.....\" The pink bear said but he again laughed evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh spare me the usual friendship is might speeches bear. It's not going to work on me, Neither will your little Care Bear Stare trick as I'm immune to happy emotions bear.\" The villain said as he got behind his machine and pressed a button on the control panel and two metal hands grabbed the little pink bear who was utterly helpless as she was strapped to a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what are you going to do?\" She asked fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You annoying little bears have been nothing but trouble always with your constant speeches and friendly,kind nature..it's sickening! So here have a taste of my Evil-Side Beam!\" As he pressed a another button as the little pink bear gasped as instead of turning her into a big meanie,she actually began growing slowly in size as the man's eyes were raised in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what the...ohhh silly me that was the wrong button,there was the Matter Expander ray I was saving that for another possible evil scheme.\" He said to himself but Cheer Bear was panicking like crazy as she continued to slowly grow breaking through her restraints with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO! PLEASE STOP THIS!!\" She cried out as her furry self began filling up the already small warehouse and the evil villain was suddenly having second thoughts about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.....I didn't expect this to happen that bear is growing out of control....I better get out of here.\" As he made a quick dash for the door just as Cheer Bear's head slowly burst through the wooden cottage as it exploded as she finally stopped growing at 50 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no this is completely horrible! I-I'm a monster.\" The bear cried out as she stared around her now tiny surroundings everything from the houses,trees,cars and especially people all looked like children' toys to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhh,this is so scary. What am I to do?\" She thought just as the pink Care Bear iconically called Cheer Bear wasn't feeling so cheerful as she only hoped none of the other Care Bears could see her gigantic height from Care-A-Lot she was faced with a much bigger problem which was.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
