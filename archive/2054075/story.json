I'm a slightly chubby, glasses-wearing straight-A student who is a mix of Caucasian and African-American. See, my mom's black while my dad's white. I also have an older sister who I love so much. In addition to my lovely family, I am also dating someone: my basketball-playing boyfriend Daryl Reyab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough about me, let me tell you something that has happened to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, one day I was walking home from school, when I spotted a strange shop. I walked in, and a kindly old lady greeted me. \"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" I said. I let out my hands, as I assumed that she was going to read my palms. She put her hands into mine, then she began saying words in some language that even I, who knows 10 different languages, could not understand. All I know that it definitely was not Latin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she stopped speaking what I assumed was gibberish, she then told me to place my hands on both my and her heads. I reluctantly did, and all of a sudden a flash blinding me. When it died, I saw exactly what happened. The old lady and I swapped heads! I look down and saw her bony body attached to my head. I then looked back at the lady, and she had my body from the neck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU DO?!\" I understandably yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady chuckled. \"What <b>you</b> did, dear,\" she said, \"was swap our heads. I have given you this power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just place your hands back on our heads again to get your body back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did so, and another flash appeared. When that died, I saw that the lady and I had our respective bodies back. I looked at my own hands, amazed at my ability. \"Wow,\" I said. \"So I can swap heads with anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, but you can swap two other people's heads without you being involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun, dear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left the shop, thinking of the fun that I was going to have with my new power. I headed...</span></div></div>",

I kept quiet, not wanting to make it look like she had remained normal-looking but gained the power to speak. Had I done so, it would made him suspect something. Our voices, both my natural voice and her acquired voice, sounded very similar, which I thought was a product of the swap. This made it easier for her to masquerade as me, and vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was school today,\u201d father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was fine,\u201d Brianna said.

She yawned in the bed and, as she got up, I wanted to say something quickly to her before she went to have breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was the bed?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was very comfortable,\u201d Brianna answered. \u201cI think it\u2019s great to experience life as a human. These pajamas too, the ones I\u2019m wearing and which I once ruined, they\u2019re good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see what she meant. Those were originally my pajamas, ones she had ripped many months ago after I had brought them home from town. Fran had had to sew them back together through our family\u2019s Singer. And now she was wearing them. Oh, the memories that never leave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were out of the room, it was time to play the masquerade again. My parents and sister were still fully human and still unaware of what was going on. Brianna was still getting accustomed to eating human food and made it look like I was a slow eater. She secretly fed me breakfast cereal because she was unsure if I would like dog food. One breakfast was finished, Brianna grabbed her former dog chain, and held it out to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, Brianna,\u201d she said to me, still acting like I was her and she was me in front of the rest of the family. I acted like the hyper-excited dog to maintain the illusion. Once the chain was attached, Fran called \u2018me\u2019 (actually Brianna) outside, then we started walking towards the center of town. As we walked, Fran suddenly noticed something:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Brianna hasn\u2019t barked much in last while, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna did not want to drop the illusion now, so she said...</span></div></div>",

Cute, but curvaceous, her body type was <i>perfect</i>...if you were a girl who wanted nothing more than to be a boys fantasy. It was exciting and terrifying to be controlling the small body that I had once been jealous of not having, because now I had it. <i>Literally</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as I gazed up at the dolls original head, painted plastic lips sitting atop a body of flesh and blood that used to be <i>mine</i>, I decided that I should probably get my original body back before something bad happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a knock on my door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear took over completely as I imagined a giant entering the room, catching me in my diminutive state. With much difficulty (damn these awkward joints) I scrambled to hide under my own bed as my door opened, the giant entering the room. \"Oh shit, my body!\" My original body sat on the floor, comatose with a fake head. At this point I didn't know that nobody else was aware of the swaps, so I couldn't help but panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie? Are you in here?\" the giant called out, and I recognized her as my mom. I felt a wave of relief, but not enough to convince me to come out of hiding. \"I <i>hate it</i> when she hides, she knows it's hard enough to see her as is.\" That confused me. Was my body considered... normal? It made sense, in a way, for the magic to normalize things, but it was still strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have time to dwell on that thought for very long, though, as mom began to move towards my old body. \"Does she really need this old thing?\" she said, grabbing one of my old bodies limp arms. \"She doesn't need a doll like this anymore, she's a big girl now. I should put this in the attic or something.\" And with that, she hoisted my lifeless body over her shoulder, and walked out of the room. \"Wait, Mom!\" I yelled, having gained my nerve, but it was too late. She carried my body off and closed my door behind her, leaving it cracked so I'd be able to open it if I needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped out into the open space of my room in disbelief. She treated my old body like it was the doll. The doll that I was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not supposed to happen.</span></div></div>",

I shouldn't even be alive yet soon as you swapped our heads, that's how I'm brought to life?\"<br>\r\n\"Seems that way\" I told her \"I don't really know the magic or science behind it but if I had to guess, we're probably both alive because of my head in my case and my ORIGINAL body in your case, that's the source of life for both of us. I switch us back, of course I'll still be alive, but you would've lost your source of life and just go back to being a plain old doll.\"<br>\r\n\"And only you have the power to switch heads?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure think so, but you're welcome to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then placed her gigantic (and what used to be mine anyways) hand on my head, and the other hand on her head.

Anna, Bianca, and Carla.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now remember, even though you're meeting them for the first time, you gotta act like you're all old buddies.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know Katie, keeping up with this act on meeting new people but pretending I know them, I don't think I can keep up.\"<br>\r\n\"And what? You just want me to take over? I mean I'll do that, but I know you'll come to regret it. You're my friend too Naomi. I want you to enjoy today just as much as I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there, thinking, I saw Naomi agree to keep up the charade. I knew that girl wouldn't miss this for anything, and I didn't want her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when all the guests left, Naomi took us back to my room, and first thing she did was do a little twirl when she closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Easy there, don't try to throw me off!\"<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, sorry! But today was just so awesome. I loved everything about it! The cake, the presents, meeting your friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took off her sandals, plopped down on the bed on her stomach, let me go and I just sat down facing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I just wanted to say.... thank you.\" She said<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n\"For just... everything. For taking this huge gamble with letting me borrow your body. For allowing me to live a life, even if for just a few days. Like I said... for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then noticed a little tear come from Naomi's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, come here you silly little goof.\" I then walked up to her cheek, and we just hugged each other from there. I was really beginning to warm up to this girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She then said \"But I have to wonder. Today was YOUR birthday, yet I have YOUR body. Don't you think that technically makes it my birthday too?\" <br>\r\n\"Know something?\" I told her, \"You make a perfect point. I got just the idea!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then put my hand to my head and the other to her cheek, and after a bright flash, Naomi was just a little doll again, and I had my giant, or I guess I should say, NORMAL sized body again. Before leaving the room, I held Naomi in my hands, and just had to smile and appreciate what a kind soul she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen looking down at my own body, \"Man. I totally forgot what it felt like being human, heh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran downstairs, brought something back up, placed me and Naomi in the same position back right before before we switched, then I put my hand to my head, and the other to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the bright flash, I was back to being doll-sized again, and Naomi woke back up surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA. What happened? I blacked out for a moment.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that! Had to borrow my body for a bit. But I got you this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd between me and Naomi was one of the red velvet cupcakes, but with a birthday candle added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I would blow it out quick, don't wanna risk starting a fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly blew out the cupcake, then grabbed me and kissed me on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streaming out her eyes, \"Thank you Katie. You're the bestest friend I could ever ask for. I love you.\"<br>\r\nHugging each other, I told her, \"Love you too... sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the ironic size differences between us, Naomi was the little sister I never knew I had but always wanted. I'm grateful for her showing up in my life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was confused for a moment, until I realized... the drag queen must be wearing a wig. Duh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I tried again. This time, I waited for the bus to stop, so it would seem like I just got jolted, and I reached out and touched the drag queen\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash, and the next thing I knew, everything was farther down. No, wait... I was farther up. I was taller. Easily 6\u20194, probably 6\u20198 in the ridiculous platform heels I was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drag queen, now with my body below his/her heavily made up face, gave me a snooty look. \u201cDon\u2019t touch, honey. I don\u2019t know you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry...\u201d I said quietly, not really paying attention. I was busy checking out my new body. The body was caucasian. Fit, but not muscular. Tall, as mentioned before. And the clothes... I mean, wow! White platform pumps adorned my new feet, and skin tone nylons ran up my shaved legs. In the panty area, I could feel padding, probably to make the hips and butt look feminine, and to hide a certain male body part. I could also feel a corset tightened around the waist, as well as a bra, filled out nicely with a pair of fake boobs. All of this was covered by a stunning pink and white patterned bodycon dress, which showed a good deal of my false cleavage, and went down to just above the knee. My new wrists were adorned with expensive looking white, pink, and silver bracelets, and to top it all off, my obviously fake inch long fingernails sparkled with silver glitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gonna get off miss?\u201d The bus driver asked. I looked up, and saw that he was obviously talking to me. \u201cThis is your stop. Last chance.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, sorry,\u201d I said, taking a step to get a feel for the heels.

Come on,\u201d Missy said, grabbing my hand and leading me through the crowd and down a hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were in a dressing room, Missy closed the door behind us. There were two more drag queens in here, both in the process of getting ready. I also spotted a pamphlet on one of the vanities. It read \u201cMissy Mann presents: Kathleen Kandy, Libby DeLuxxxe, and Friday Knight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFriday, help Kathleen with her makeup,\u201d Missy said, staying in character. \u201cAnd a wig if she wants one, but she doesn\u2019t need it.

After eyeshadow came some false lashes, some earrings, and finally, bright pink lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my best work, but it\u2019s the best I can do on such short notice.

I reached out to touch \u201cher\u201d head with my left hand, and touched my own with my right, and in a flash, I had switched positions with the other drag queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now on the body of Friday Knight, who was dressed very differently than Kathleen, at least on the outer layer. Friday\u2019s dress was more like a prom dress, and it was a hideous orange. The gogo boots were a matching orange. All the orange was complimented by black fishnets on the legs and arms, and long black fingernails. Underneath the dress were the same kind of hip pads and fake boobs that Kathleen wore, but the boobs were bigger, to match the fact that Friday was on the chubbier side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday, who now believed \u201cshe\u201d was Kathleen Kandy, looked about as normal as before. The blonde wig, heavy black eyeshadow and mascara, and black lipstick all went well enough with the pink and white ensemble on Kathleen\u2019s body. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve done all I can with your makeup, Friday,\u201d the real Friday said to me. \u201cIf you want more, Libby will have to help you.

In fact, if you told me Libby was a real woman, I would probably believe you. At least I would if I hadn\u2019t worn \u201cher\u201d body below my neck. Definitely a guy. I could feel it. Like Kathleen, Libby\u2019s manhood was carefully concealed beneath padding that also served to feminize the hips. Curiously though, unlike Kathleen and Friday, Libby wasn\u2019t wearing fake boobs. Instead, a simple makeup trick made it appear as though \u201cshe\u201d had cleavage. On Libby\u2019s body was a purple woman\u2019s suit, though no shirt under the jacket. The jacket was unbuttoned, displaying Libby\u2019s toned stomach. A black B-cup bra covered the nipples, and helped add to the cleavage illusion. The pants matched the jacket, and on Libby\u2019s feet were a pair of tan heels. They weren\u2019t very high. Probably two inches. But the heel was incredibly thin. It was like trying to balance on needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI now stood next to Friday, watching Libby with Kathleen\u2019s body open the door and strut out. I then watched Friday walk over, close the door, sit back down, and look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen minutes, then you\u2019re up,\u201d Friday said to me. \u201cYou want me to keep doing your makeup?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure,\u201d I answered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Cameron gets dressed at home now. Weird, right?\u201d Friday said to me quietly, while continuing to work on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... Cameron?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I know you don\u2019t like to use stage names unless we\u2019re performing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was intrigued. I hadn\u2019t really wondered before what their real names were, but after a chat with Friday, I learned that Kathleen was Cameron, Libby was Will, Friday was Freddy, and Missy was Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got so caught up in talking to my new friend Freddy, that those ten minutes went by like they were nothing. Before I knew it, Cameron/Kathleen had finished, and Missy/Robert was pushing me to the stage. I had to get out of this. Without thinking, I put one hand on my head, and reached out with the other, hoping to switch back with Kathleen.</span></div></div>",

He opened it and greeted me. \"Hi, Katie,\" he said. \"What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in the neighborhood, babe,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then rubbed my belly, to which I just chuckled at. Truth be told, he adored my slightly chubby stomach. We then went into his house, so that no one would see us two kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the front door, Daryl and I kissed on the lips. I opened my eyes and carefully placed my hands on both his and my heads, causing a flash. When that bright light died, Daryl and I swapped heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe then stopped kissing, and Daryl was completely unaware that we had each other's bodies from the neck down, even when he looked up to me and placed my hands on my boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daryl, please,\" I said, laughing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, force of habit,\" Daryl said, as if he has had breasts before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I have to use the ladies' room,\" I lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where it is, Kate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to Daryl's bathroom to examine his body that my head was now attached to. To say that this was odd is an understatement. I took off Daryl's shirt to take a look at his male, chiseled chest. I gotta tell you, it felt comfortable not having two heavy breasts connected to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then pulled down Daryl's pants to view his junk. Since I was taking anthropology classes at the time, I was not shocked at seeing Daryl's penis - or any penis, for that matter - for the first time. I playfully jiggled it around, seeing that I was eventually going to do this after getting married... unless I decided to become a Lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that I was completely naked, I took a look at myself in the mirror.

He still wore the Latina woman\u2019s shoes, and he carefully strutted around me, moving one hand up and down his shapely body, and placing his other hand on my neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t resist. I grabbed him by the waist and pulled him in for a passionate kiss. He then looked up at me with a devilish grin. I watched to see what his next move would be.</span></div></div>",

He placed his lady hands in my manly hands, and we stumbled into the dressing room together, being sure to lock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen our lips touched, it was like nothing I had ever felt before. I was clearly fueled by my new body\u2019s libido, but I didn\u2019t care. We made out for several seconds before I reached around to unzip Daryl\u2019s dress. Our faces were never more than an inch apart as the purple cloth fell down to his high heeled feet. Now I could see his new body for real! His D-cup breasts were accentuated by a pushup bra decorated with little pink flowers. He had a perfectly toned stomach that likely took daily exercise to maintain, and his belly button was pierced with a small diamond. Moving down even farther, he wore panties that matched his bra. These were the next to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe skillfully unhooked his bra with one hand, then made a show of practically dancing out of the panties. He then reached for the zipper on my jeans.</span></div></div>",

Sighing, I zipped my jeans back up and did as I had been told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the door to see Grace, the employee from earlier. She was clearly not happy. I didn\u2019t know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Daryl spoke up. \u201cMa\u2019am, we are so sorry. We just got carried away.
