            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no denying that Eddie was your best mate. Sure, you had only known him for just over 3 years, but in that time you'd grown so close, forming a brotherly bond. Nothing could get between you two. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie had said that his mum was taking his little sister away on a girls weekend shopping trip and was allowed someone to stay over. He joked that she said he 'couldn't be trusted in the house alone'. He was a typical guy. The same age as you, 18, the age of having fun whilst learning to be responsible. You were the same height only he was physically fitter sporting a lean muscled body, keeping him looking slim rather than bulky. His hair was longer too, flicking to the side in a cool skater fashion. You couldn't help but feel attracted to the guy most of the time, but as best friends nothing crossed over the 'casual flirting' line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at his, knocking on the front door and greeted by that charming smile and wave of hair. You hugged on the door before entering. The house wasn't massive, and there was clutter everywhere but as his mother wasn't there it was only expected to get messy with 3 guys in the house. You walked through the living room giving a quick greeting to Shaun, Eddie's stepdad. He'd been married to Eddie's mum for over a year now, meeting her at roughly the same time you did. He was a nice enough guy but had quite the temper when upset. He was a big guy, not height-wise but in the sense of both fat and muscle. Even when play-fighting the guy could do damage. You smiled politely, answered his questions and left when he said dinner would be ready soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed Eddie upstairs, the first floor containing his brothers bedroom, the bathroom and his bedroom being at the furthest end. The second floor being the converted loft space now held his mum and Shaun's room as well as his little sisters bedroom. You pass the bathroom and continue past Eddie's brothers room. Kingsley was Eddie's older brother but much preferred to be known as King, simply because he ran the house. A 24 year old builder who sponged everything he could off his doting mother. He wasn't the nicest of people, spending his time either at work, in his room or out at the pub. An ass heavy waste of space really, who couldn't help but wind you and Eddie with stupid wresting moves and stinking you out; his massive ass being the one thing he loved to use against you both. You shudder a bit thinking of it. With any luck he'd be at work this weekend so hopefully you wouldn't have to face it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to Eddie's room and you're both on the bed, the Xbox is on and you're gaming. Various gun games, the latest Batman game, back to the guns again. You were set for hours. Dinner was eaten quickly so you could continue. Throughout the evening you both got texts and calls from your other two mates Cal and Rob. There were planning on stopping round the next day so the four of you could have some quality bro time. Rob was similar to Eddie in height and hair style except Rob was blonder and was a lot skinnier. He was a skater guy through and through; ripped jeans, old shoes and a hat always on his head. Cal was the tallest of the lot of you but also the youngest. Another skinny lad with bad acne all over his body but the most sensible of the group, when not being influenced by Eddie. The four of you were known to wind each other up and get into trouble. Tomorrow should be no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carried on gaming way into the night, slowly drifting to sleep around 4 in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n  You woke with a jump, a strange feeling you were overcome by. The covers were right over you almost like a wave that you couldn't get out of. It took a good few minutes for you to get out...then it hit you. When you surfaced you were stood on the pillow, merely a few inches tall. What the hell had happened? You could see your clothes poking out from under the covers, making you realise you were stood naked on your best mates bed. Sure, you'd seen each other naked before but this was a little different. Hang on...where even was Eddie? You look around frantically, still thrown by your new size, and find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You breathe out the biggest sigh of relief. Eddie was still there, still asleep. Thank god. You couldn't begin to imagine what you would have to do if he hadn't have been there. Getting off the bed would be the first problem. At least with him next to you there was no worry of contacting him. You looked over at your giant best mate, his lightly tanned body tangled in the sheets, the thin material hugging him tightly, defining all his body's features. You made your way towards his face. Had he been awake he'd be looking right at you, his hair swept perfectly across his boyish yet defined face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped across the pillow, almost at the edge when Eddie shuffled about. He flipped his body round, the movements knocking you over. Lucky you were on the bed. The landing was soft. You looked up, you were stood by the back of his neck. His hair was resting on the bed in front of you. It was soothing being stood there, his breathing making the bed move in a gentle, almost wave-like motion. This was all still so surreal. You looked your best friend up and down slowly. He was less tangled in the covers now, the side he was lying on being partially shown due to the positioning of the covers. You followed the lines of his back with your eyes, down to his boxer shorts containing his well shaped buttocks and further down towards his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, snapping yourself out of your train of thought. Focus. You have to get his attention, wake him up, get him to help you out. You bite your lip in thought, wondering how you should go about this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Great. Just great. It would have been easier if he had been lying next to you, but he wasn't. He was stood boxer-clad over by his wardrobe, looking through for clothes to wear for the day. Music was blaring out of his speakers. You shouted as loud as you could but he couldn't hear your tiny voice over the sound of his tunes. You sighed. This was going to be difficult. Had he even noticed you'd gone? Did he think you'd gone home? Did he think you were showering? Did he think you'd just gone out? Did he even care?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and faced you, not noticing your tiny body perched on the edge of his bed. He shook his head to the side, his hair swooping to the side. His lightly tanned body was fully exposed, slim with clear muscle definition on his arms, the subtle hint of a nice ab set on his stomach. There was a light trail of hair leading down into his black boxer shorts. Nothing in there you hadn't seen before though. Him stood there in front of you...you couldn't help but stare in admiration. Each detail seemingly magnified at your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit yes, your size. You needed to sort that out and fast. He was pacing the room and you waved your hands every time he turned to face your direction. No luck. Right, you needed a new plan. You needed to get to him. Great. You grab onto the material and slowly begin your journey to the floor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your mind was still spinning from the situation you were in. Surely it had to be some kind of dream...a horrible dream brought on by the stupidly late night and intense video gaming session. Yet it felt real, more so than any dream sequence you'd even been in. The pillow you were stood on seemed a lot softer and plumper at this size. There were little specks of fluff about the size of your foot dotted along the material as well as the occasional hair, either yours or Eddie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie! You spun around, looking up and down the bed. He wasn't there. You made your way over to his side of the bed, sliding down the pillow onto the mattress. There was a warmth radiating from the bedding where his body temperature had imprinted during the night. You could feel it...and there was a certain scent that remained. He couldn't have been gone long. You had to find him. And quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shout, but it hadn't come from you. You recognised the voice and gulped. You knew who it belonged to, and you weren't best pleased. Stood topless in the door way was the one guy you'd rather not run into at normal size, let alone the size you were now. The big brother Kingsley. The King. He stepped into the room as if he owned it, but you knew full well he didn't. Eddie was dead set against King coming in at any time, especially when he himself wasn't present. But King didn't care. As far as he was concerned he could do what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing was taller than you by a good few inches at normal height, but now he looked so much bigger. And that scared you. A typical tough looking guy. A constantly angry look on his face, blonde, almost white hair cut incredibly short. He had defined muscles all over his pale body with the exception of his stomach which bulged out ever so slightly. The beginnings of a beer belly forming there. He was tattooed; a standard ring of barbed wire around his bicep, a fancy looking 'Mum' written above his collar bone, some kind of tribal pattern on his calf and a marijuana leaf on one of his ass cheeks. If anything, his ass was the one thing that terrified you most about King, especially now you were this small. For a guy his size it was unusually large and he'd use it against you and Eddie all the time, pinning you under it for a laugh or farting whenever close by to you. With tight boxer shorts that hardly ever fit properly, it was a part of him you hoped to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way over to the bed and lifted up the sheets, seeing your clothes sprawled out. He picked up your t-shirt and threw it on the floor laughing. \"Fucking faggots...\" Clearly King was under the impression you and Eddie had been 'up to something' last night and was obviously unaware of your presence. That relieved you somewhat. With any hope he'd leave. He turned away from the bed and you held your breath in hope.</span></div></div>",
