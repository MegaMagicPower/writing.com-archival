            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You realize that there is an obvious plan here; switch with John Branson, blackmail him into helping you get reinstated by holding his body hostage, switch back. With any luck he won't betray you when he gets his body back, and either way you should be able to sneak out more of your research before they can fire you again. They took away your job for being 'unethical' and 'dangerous'? HAH! Who is unethical and dangerous now!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around the room you realize it was probably really fucking stupid to kidnap them all at once. Also, you probably shouldn't have picked people with involved lives that you don't know enough about to impersonate. At least you know Branson well enough to act like him, and you could probably do his job better than he could. What does a Psych degree teach people that couldn't be figured out with an advanced Bio-genetics degree? You bet it is nothing important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are pretty sure John could overpower you in hand to hand, but just to be sure you put on a pair of handcuff and toss the key under the couch. Then you grab the potion and go over to John, setting a knife by him so he can cut himself free. You know that giving a full dose of potion to one person and having them kiss the other will leave the old body in a coma, and allow the transferred mind to dominate the victim mind while letting them use the victim's memories and knowledge. But you also know that in testing the minds began to merge and couldn't be separated, and you sure as taxes don't want to be merged with Branson, he's a total asshole. Giving each of you a dose should make you switch bodies, that should keep him out of the way and stop him from talking to the cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pour half the potion down his throat and the other half down yours. You begin the kiss and realize that the transfer might not wake \"him\" up. Oh well.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nYou wake up in Branson's body with an uncomfortably hard erection, and you realize his dick is huge. Either he is some kind of mutant or he had some work done. You reach behind yourself and use the knife to cut the zip cuffs around your hands, and around your feet. Then you get up and check on your body. \"Roger James\" seems fine, but oddly he is still asleep. You need to talk to him so you go to the kitchen, which you realize is perfectly clean except for all the dust, and retrieve some smelling salts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whiff of them wakes \"Roger James\" up, and you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Dr. Branson. It's me, Dr. James. The man who you got fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck? Oh! You used your fucking mind transferal potion to switch our bodies, and now you want to use my position to get your job back.\" Branson says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly worried at how fast he figured it out, you say \"Yes. I just need the access code to your terminal, and then I will put a few good words in for Doctor James.\" You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't fucking work, you fucktard. You don't know me, you don't know what I do, you don't know shit. You'll get found out, and then they will...who the fuck are those?\" Branson notices the bound girls sitting against the walls. You are unpleasantly aware that he has an erection, using your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of my other options. I had contemplated stealing a life, even yours, but then I decided to get my old life back instead.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that fucking Terra Janson? The one from the fucking 'All you new fag nigger' music video?\" Branson asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the fucking cops will be looking for fucking all of them right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You say with a smile \"That is why you'll help me. If you don't tell me your access code and cooperate, then you will be stuck in my body when it gets arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Branson says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You shake your head, \"Just tell me the fucking password.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no fucking password, just hit enter on the fucking login and it fucking starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the fucking truth fucktard.\" He says vehemently. \"But you fucking better spend the fucking night at my fucking house, my fucking wife is expecting me to fucking be there in a fucking hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" You say. \"There are bars on the windows, the walls are sound dampening, and the door will be locked from the outside with a key that only I have. Fucking stay put.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you know where I live?\" Branson asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, where do you think I caught you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave and lock the door behind you. Of course, you actually caught him in the parking lot, but you do know where he lives. You had learned the homes and work places of everyone you kidnapped. Now the question was, should you get an early start or should you spend the night at his home to avoid suspicion?</span></div></div>",

You seriously hope that Rina has some other footwork than these. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you enter the street Rina was staying on you notice how dangerous it looks. You were in your car when you picked her up, but now you were here as a young girl walking through. It was already night and only the lampposts show off light. You can see the lamppost where you picked Rina under is already being taken by someone else. Someone from Latina origin, long black hair, wearing a strapless dress showing off her impressive cleavage, wearing a pair of heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside of you just burns of anger and before you know what you're doing you walk over to the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You shout to the girl. The girl looks up from her phone irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my spot.\" You tell her coming closer to her.

Now go away.\" She says turning around showing off her mighty fine ass to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her ass like that you find yourself being drawn to it. It's been ages you've seen one like this. You take a step closer when the girl turns around again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you an idiot, now go away!\" She says coming closer to push you.
