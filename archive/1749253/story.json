Look what I got from the mail Yesterday morning?<br>\r\nRebeeca: Leo! That's just snakes &amp; ladder, We already played that for about couple of times.<br>\r\nCameron: Yeah: Is there anything why you showed us a game that we played before?<br>\r\nLeo: No I didn't mean the normal game.

Right here it goes then!....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules that how to play the growing snakes &amp; ladders:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are 55 squares containing 9 ladders &amp; 9 snakes. You are all gonna start at the outside of the sqaure by using 1 dice only to start with as the player each gets the coloured counters as their choice. If any player lands on the ladder spot, then not only you climb up top of the ladder, but your counters starting to go bright as the player begin to grew taller at least 1 foot tall in each turn. And If any player lands on the snakes spot, then not only it goes down to the end of the snake, but again the counter goes at it again, but this time the player begin to grew fatter at least 10 pounds at each turn. The game contines until all players made it to the 55th square of the finishing line &amp; all of them keeps the size were they at &amp; start again with the size they on. The player's size continues until the beginning of our sixth game when all the players backs down to normal size &amp; start again. Good Luck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron: Wow! Sounds great! let's play it right now!<br>\r\nAll: Yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as the four of them sets the game up on the floor as each of them put their coloured counter at the starting line.<br>\r\nLeo is the green counter, Cameron aka Camie is on the red, Rebeeca is on the yellow &amp; Alec is on the blue counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: So as you know that I bought the game right? But I let you go first at the moment. So...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since while we gone let's have a look how the player's size stands now in this half way point:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting in last place still at square 3 is still Cameron who still in his normal height at 5'1ft but now weighs at 123lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn third is Rebecca at square 11. Again still in her normal height at 6'2ft but weighs at 126lbs. Both Cameron &amp; Rebecca gained 10lbs since we last left them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn second place is Alec at square 20 who stands 6'2ft tall &amp; weighs at 96lbs but no effects happened to him since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it means that in first place is Leo at square 33. He still weigh at 129lbs but he finally got the height going at 6'2ft tall &amp; that was the last turn before we came back for action. And now let's get back to the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Rebecca's turn when her dice rolled &amp; it was number 6. So she moved her counter to square 17 &amp; for the third time, she's got a S square. Her counter dropped down to the 1st square of the board &amp; now weighs at 136lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec's next to get in line &amp; it's number 2 is on the dice. \" 2 squares he moved that's square 22 but no effects there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur party host Leo's go as he's got number 2 on the dot. He moved to the 35th square but no effects for him as well. Shame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron's turn now as he rolled the dice &amp; the number he got is 4. He moved to the 7th square but like 2 of them, no effects comes for him to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Rebecca's lucky though because she gained another 10 pounds from the last round but it's her turn now. Her dice rolled &amp; it is number 6. She moved the counter to square 7 but I think I'll let Cameron to tell her what does that square mean anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Alec is next as he rolled the dice &amp; number 1 is the only dot you can find there. from 22 to 23 square but no effects there indeed. Oh deer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo's up &amp; the dice showed number 1 again! Have you copied what Alec's doing? Nope he says as he move his counter to square 36 &amp; got the S square for the first time. He dropped down to square 20 in second place when he now weighs at 139lbs &amp; Leo's becoming the first player of the game to be landed on the L &amp; S square. Well Done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we got to Cameron's turn as his lucky number is 5. His counter moved to square 12 but no effects for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's the end of this chapter. And before you choose the path, let's see the standings there currently on right now:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   Rebecca                              Alec                               Leo                            Cameron<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight:           5'2ft                                 6'2ft                                6'3ft                               5'1ft<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeight:          136lbs                             96lbs                              139lbs                           123lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquare:            7                                     23                                  20                                 12<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's the standings!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since while we gone let's have a look how the player's size stands now:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's currently at the rear of the pack as she stands at square 12. Her size is now 7'2ft &amp; 136lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec lands at square 51 which puts him in the lead as his current size is 7'2ft &amp; 126lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo's in third place at the moment as he currently lands at square 35. His height stays the same at 5'3ft but he finally puts the weight on as he now weighs at 139lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich means Cameron (Camie) is in second place at square 47 as his size now at 6'1ft &amp; 113lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the latest move was Alec as he moved blue counter to square 51 with clear square ahead &amp; it's Leo turn to make a move. He rolled the dice &amp; number 3 was on his view. He moved his green counter to square 38 &amp; he got the ladder square. That's the first time Leo gets to change his height to 6'3ft tall. And for the counter, he moved along the ladder &amp; lands on square 52 which puts him into the lead &amp; just 3 more moves to go to get the finishing square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Cameron's turn as he rolled as it is number 4. He moved his red counter to square 51 &amp; he's on the same place as Alec is right now. But no effects on him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Rebecca needs to climb up quicker as she's in last place. So her dice rolled &amp;  number 6 was on the card. So she moved her yellow counter to square 18 but no effects there I'm afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was back to Alec as number 4 was on the dice &amp; won the first snakes &amp; ladders game. Well Done Alec!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec: YES! I won the game! Now that game is awesome thanks to you Leo.<br>\r\nLeo: Thanks Alec &amp; well done on your first win. Say while you waiting, Why don't you go to my backyard swimming pool &amp; we're be there once we finish off this game.<br>\r\nAlec: Alright! Will do buddy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec then gets on his feet when head got bumped on the ceiling so he put his head down &amp; goes towards Leo's swimming pool. But for the rest of them, they still have to finish off the game as Leo takes his turn the number of the number is 54. Sadly it was the snakes square as he moved along the snake to square 39 plus he now weighs at 149lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Camie's turn. He rolled his dice &amp; it is number 3. Unfortunately he move to the same square as Leo did in his last turn. So he moved down along the snake to 39 &amp; weighs at 123lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's turn now as her diced rolled &amp; it was number 5. So she moved her counter to square 23 but no effects on her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo before we move on to the next chapter, let's have a look at the standings they are right now:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready Alec has won the game by the size at 7'2ft &amp; 126lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo who is in second place in square 39 by the size at 6'3ft &amp; 149lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron also in second with a same square but his stands at 6'1ft &amp; 123lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Rebecca still in last place as she's on square 23 by the the size at 7'2ft &amp; 136lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the choice is this: Do you want finish off the game or do you want to follow Alec &amp; see what he's doing at Leo's swimming pool?</span></div></div>",

Currently she is 5'2\" at 98 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's family game night, and the Martins have recently purchased a new board game. Lisa had bought it from a strange shop as she was coming home from work, thinking that it would bring them together. Little did she know was that this little innocent board game had incredible powers, something they would all find out soon. It took awhile for her to convince the ever busy family to sit down and play, but finally they all took a seat around the four sides of the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this nice?\" She said as he got comfortable on the carpet. \"We've haven't done something together as a family in ages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, do we really have to do this?\" Dean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I was waiting for a very important call.\" Cindy said. \"Joanne asked Scott to the dance, but he hasn't replied yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dreaming, Scott only dates tall girls.\" Dean laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Julie Foster only goes out with guys over six feet tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm still growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, growing dumber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's enough you two!\" Frank interupted their arguement. \"Your mother went through the trouble of buying us this new game for us to play.\" Frank said. \"The least you can do is play for an hour or two. THEN you can go back to whatever you want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them gave each other a spiteful glare, but stopped arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's start.\" Lisa said, putting up a cheerful smile as she places the four small metal characters on the starting position. \"I guess I'll go first.\" She took the dice and rolled out a three. She reached out to move her piece, but to their surprise the piece (which was oddly resembled her for some reason they just noticed) moved on it's own, sliding across the board until it landed on a...</span></div></div>",

Now then honey, I think you're suppose to pick up one of those blue cards over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa regained her wits and nodded, taking the top blue card from the board. As she read it, she frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say?\" Frank asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up, confused. \"It just says 'gain half a foot in height.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the words escaped her lips, the card suddenly flashed. Lisa dropped the card in surprise and then something impossible happened. Before their eyes, they watched Lisa suddenly grow taller! Her legs stretched out away from her, and her body lengthened, causing her head to rise higher and higher, until finally she was 6 feet tall, even. Her clothes hugged her body tightly and awkwardly, having been made for a woman much shorter than she was currently. The bottom of her blouse was now too short, exposing some of her stomach, and the end of her jeans came up to her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dean, Cindy, you two watch your language!\" Lisa snapped at her kids, breaking her out of her surprise momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you freakin' grew half a foot!\" Dean said. \"Who cares about cussing now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think the game did this?\" Cindy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit, idiot!\" Dean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you don't have to be mean about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"QUIET!\" Frank bellowed, silencing them. \"Lisa, where did you get this game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a shop that i found when I took a wrong turn today.\" Lisa said. \"I thought it was odd because I know that part of town very well, and yet I didn't recognize the street at all...this all seems like one big dream.\" She tried to get up and almost lost her balance before she got used to her new height. \"Everything looks so...different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean looked at the board game. \"If one roll made mom grow to six feet tall, what happens if we play through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it could be dangerous.\" Frank said, taking the die before his son could grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, come on, give it to me!\" Dean said, trying to take it and accidentally knocked it out of Frank's hand in the process.

Two decks of identical-looking cards were situated in grooves in the center of the board. Each boy picked out a playing piece, different colored wooden pyramid-shaped blocks, from a drawer carved into the wood and fit it into the groove. Ian was the yellow piece, Julian was the red piece, and Adam was the Black piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no instructions or anything,\" Adam frowned slightly. \"Oh well, I'm sure we'll figure it out as we go.\" \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who goes first?\" Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's roll to see!\" Julian suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did so, and Ian won the roll. He then rolled again to start, getting a four and landing on a red square. \"What do I do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam shrugged. \"I dunno. Draw a card, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan did so, turning it over for everyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's blank.\" Julian pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" Adam said. \"Maybe it's just a throw-away card or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" Ian said. \"It's changing! Look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before their eyes, a red square appeared in the middle of the white card. Above the square, in script writing, appeared the word \"Height.\" Below it appeared an image of a pair of dice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that's pretty awesome!\" Julian said. \"It just appeared out of nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it's a hologram,\" Ian suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it wants you to roll the dice,\" Adam said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan did so, landing a seven. As the dice came to a stop, the number seven then appeared, filling up the card, then disappeared. In its place appeared: \"You will grow seven feet taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ian asked, frowning. \"What does that m--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped as he felt his clothes begin to get tighter, and then start to rip. His body started to expand, his legs getting longer where he sat and his torso stretching upward. He scooted away from the board, not wanting to hit it with his feet which were beginning to rip through his socks. His face looked scared but also excited about what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Julian exclaimed. \"It's really happening! You're growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan didn't say anything as his clothes ripped and fell off, landing in scraps below him. The only thing that stayed on was his boxers, and by the time he had finished growing, over 12 feet tall, they seemed like they wouldn't last too much longer, and would be shredded if he tried to stand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a freakin' giant!\" Ian cried out, his voice much louder than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This game is amazing!\" Julian's face was full of anticipation. \"My turn next!\" He rolled the dice, getting a three, and moved his piece, landing on a ...</span></div></div>",

Wonder what that would mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, only one way to find out,\" Adam said, motioning to the stack of cards and jabbing his elbow into Julian's side in fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWW!\" Julian cried playfully. \"Stop that!\" He stuck out his tongue at Adam and started to jump at his friend to tackle him, but was stopped by Ian's large hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you just pick up the card?\" Ian impatiently asked. \"I want it to be my turn again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" Julian chuckled. \"Take it easy there, big guy.\" He reached over and picked the next card off of the stack, turning it over. It, too was blank, and the three boys waited to see what would appear on it. After a moment, the word \"Muscle\" in big, bold letters faded into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Julian pumped his fist in the air. \"I get to bulk up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the word, a picture of a spinner appeared. \"Wait, it says you need to spin now?\" Ian asked, scratching his head. \"I'm confused. What spinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that spinner?\" Adam said, pointing to the middle of the board. Sure enough, a brightly-painted wooden spin wheel was now there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Ian's eyes went even bigger than they already were. \"I could've sworn that wasn't there a second ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?\" Julian exclaimed. \"I want to get some MUSCLE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the spinner by the center and got ready. It was a very large spinner, having room for numbers from 1-100. Taking a deep breath, he let it loose. It seemed to spin forever, finally slowing down and coming to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"72!\" Adam cried out. \"Boy, I bet that's good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, bold text appeared on the bottom half of the card: \"You will grow 72 pounds of muscle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian jumped to his feet, getting in position. \"Here it comes! I can feel it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscles had started to pulsate, visible through his shirt to the other boys, who watched in wonder. They began to push outward, swelling bigger and bigger. Julian's wide frame got even wider, as pound after pound of muscle appeared on his chest and arms, pushing his shoulders apart. He looked at both biceps as they increased in size, and his shirt began to tighten, his enlarging muscles forcing the fabric to split apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Julian moaned in pleasure. \"That's it! Ah, I feel so GREAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his legs didn't get as much benefit as his torso, they certainly still had gotten bigger. His jeans were now nearly skin-tight, revealing a firm bubble-butt, and in the front a noticeable bulge seemed to be yearning to break free. As the final stages of growth hit, his shirt finally tore completely open down the middle and his sleeves tore. Julian kept the ripped shirt on like a vest, liking how it framed his large pecs and rippled abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam couldn't help but lean closer to Julian and place his hand, feeling the warmth and firmness of his chest. Julian didn't mind, in fact causing his pectoral muscle to flex under Adam's touch, causing the still-small boy to jump a little in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Julian asked his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Ian said with a grin. \"I still like mine better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think,\" Adam said, \"That it's my turn!\" He picked up the dice and started to roll them, excited to begin his turn and see what the game had in store for him.</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'll get even bigger than YOU!\" Adam exclaimed as he poked Ian in the chest.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ian said, furrowing his brow, \"maybe you will. Just remember that I get to go after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam flipped over the card, and just like with Ian's turn, the word height and a picture of dice appeared on it. \"Here we go!\" Adam called out as he shook the dice and threw them again. They landed, showing a 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww,\" Adam said, somewhat disappointed. \"Oh well, at least I -- Whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out that yell as his skin started to stretch across his increasing frame. Adam's body began to enlarge, the muscles and bones stretching out as he inched up. His t-shirt tries to stretch out to cover his torso, and his shorts filled in nicely, but after a few seconds, the sound of the fabric ripping filled the air.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, YEAH!\" Adam closed his eyes and reveled in his growth, perhaps a bit too much. \"Bigger!\" Ian and Julian exchanged looks, each made a little uncomfortable by Adam's weird reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam continued to get taller, his shirt ripping down the sides and the seams in his shorts starting to tear, the shreds in his clothes exposing his skin. Finally, his growth had stopped, Adam now almost exactly between Julian's height and Ian's, still as skinny as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Adam said, opening his eyes again and looking down at his body. \"I wish I could've grown a lot more... But I have another turn coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out his larger hands and grabbed the dice, rolling them again. He moved his piece, landing on a purple square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Purple?\" Adam asked, his eyes lighting up. \"What does that stand for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian rolled his eyes. \"Flip the over and find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam obliged. The text that appeared read 'Body Part.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Body Part?'\" Ian scratched his head. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I roll a dice, or...?\" Adam wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" Julian pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA button had appeared on the board along with a black panel. The panel started to light up, 2 sets of numbers flashing and changing at a near-instantaneous rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Ian sat up a little. \"This game keeps on getting more and more interesting. I guess you're supposed to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot letting Ian answer, Adam slammed his big hand down on the button, shaking the board and nearly sending the pieces flying off of it. The numbers stopped, both \"5\" and \"3\" flashing. Turning to the card, the boys saw words appear on it, reading: \"Your manhood's length will multiply by five and its girth will triple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My manhood? Does that mean my-- Ohhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam's words were cut off by a sense of euphoric pleasure surging through his body, concentrating in his cock. His friends grew wide-eyed as the crotch of already-tight shorts began to bulge, being forced outward by an incredible force.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster beast inside Adam's shorts burst forth, pulsating and heaving forth. It had a sense of power and impressiveness, already 10 inches long while flaccid. Its thickness was also increasing along with its length, becoming like a huge python that snaked down Adam's thigh.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Ian cried out. \"Adam, that's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam wasn't listening. His hands were rubbing up and down the exposed part of his chest, closing his eyes and tweaking his nipples. This caused the still-growing member to come alive, quickly hardening as Adam became more and more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, this too came to an end, Adam's rock-hard cock now as thick as his arm and nearly as long. The other boys watched, a little uneasy but also a little turned-on, as Adam leaned his head back and moved his hand down, wrapping his fist around the base of the shaft, unable to fully close his fingers around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Adam?\" Julian asked, shifting his jeans and aware of the increasing tightness in his own crotch, \"What are ya doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam opened his eyes and tilted his head up, looking Julian in the eye with a devilish smile on his face.</span></div></div>",

Matt is a shy boy, but he is very smart. Matt has dirty blonde hair. He has a girlfriend, Katie (see below), who he loves more than anyone else. He also has an older sister, Melissa, who is 17, 5'9\", and has C-Cup breasts. Melissa hates the fact that Matt is taller than her, and hates his girlfriend because she is prettier than Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie - 15 years old, 5'8\", 135 lbs., fairly fit, B-Cup breasts. Katie is a very beautiful girl, even though she only has B-Cup breasts. She has a nice hourglass figure, cute butt, and dirty blonde hair that goes to her shoulders. She is Matt's girlfriend and she loves him more than anything else in the world. Katie has a very kind and playful personality. Katie has an older brother, Tyler, who is 18, 6'1\", 198 lbs., and not quite as endowed as Matt. Tyler is kind of a jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley - just turned 15, 5'5\", 135 lbs., average build, large C-Cup breasts. Riley has shiny black hair that goes down to her hips, and has very slightly tanned skin. Her figure isn't as perfect as Katie's, but it's still very sexy looking. She secretly has a crush on both Sam and Matt. She has a younger sister, Cindy, who is 10, 4'5\", and has an average build for a girl her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam - 16, 5'7\", 150 lbs., average build, and has an average sized cock. He has brown hair, and is a mostly average guy. He does a twin brother who is younger than him, Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Start)<br>\r\nKatie arrived at Matt's house. She and some of her and Matt's friends were having a game night at her boyfriend's house. Matt's sister was at one of her friend's houses, and wouldn't be back until late, and Matt's parents were out doing something of importance, so the four of them had the house to themselves for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Matt, what game are we going to play tonight?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought maybe you guys should pick the game tonight from my family's collection of board games.\" Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley nodded, and headed off towards Matt's board game room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Matt, how is your relationship with Katie going?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's going a little slow, since Matt is so shy, but we're sure it'll last long! We know how much we love each other.\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley came back, holding an old looking board game, called \"The Growing Game\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this game! It looks old, but it also looks pretty interesting!\" Riley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'The Growing Game'? I don't ever recall having this game, but it's worth a shot, I guess.\" Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to a table and opened up the box. There were four playing pieces: Matt chose green, Katie chose blue, Riley chose yellow, and Sam chose red. There were also two stacks of cards, one pink and the other blue, and there were also two die and a game board. Sam grabbed the rules and read them aloud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When it is your turn, roll the die. Depending on what space you land on, the following effects will occur to the player:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen: Height<br>\r\nRed: Muscle<br>\r\nBlue: Breast size for girls, cock size for boys<br>\r\nPurple: Bonus! Boys get height, muscle, and cock, while girls get height, muscle, breasts, and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you land on a space, draw a card for your gender. It will have either 1x, 2x, or 4x, which will multiply the effects of your roll. After seeing your multiplier, you will roll as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen (Height): roll both die; add both, and you will grow that many inches taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed (Muscle): Roll the first die, then roll the other. Multiply the result of the first roll by 10, then add the roll of the second; you will gain that many pounds in muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue: Roll one die, divide that number by two, and if you are a girl, you'll gain that many cup sizes, and if you're a guy, you'll gain that many inches to your cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you try to cheat, you won't grow. If someone hasn't had their turn within 2 minutes of the last player finishing theirs, the effects of everyone's last turn will start to occur again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo finish the game, after the sixth turn, everyone has to agree to end the game. If not everyone agrees, the game continues until everyone does. All changes are permanent and irreversible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I don't know, Matt. This game doesn't exactly sound age appropriate, and I don't know if we want permanent changes.\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Katie!\" Riley started, \"It seems fine with me. I doubt the game could actually do what it says. But even if it did, are you worried I'll grow sexier than you?\" Riley said in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie just grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so I think the order should go Matt, Riley, Sam, and Katie. Or we could start with Katie.\" Sam suggested.</span></div></div>",

Matt blushed and looked at the card. It displayed the number 2x.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now I roll two times\u2026\u201d Matt muttered and rolled the die. He got two times a six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you gain 66 pounds of muscle but it gets multiplied so you get 122 pounds of muscle?! This is quite the game.\u201d Riley said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt rolled his eyes but then felt weird. His shirt began to feel tight. He was surprised to see his arms growing larger. He had been skinny but now pounds of muscle began to stack up on him. His pecs broadened and pushed a little bit outwards. Abs appeared and looked like they were carved from stone. His legs also grew and almost touched each other thanks to their sheer size. His calves had expanded so much he could easily run for hours. From the 5'11.5\", 125 lbs. and fairly skinny boy he was before, Matt had now grown to a bodybuilder\u2019s size with 247 lbs. He gaped at his muscles and so did his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, check that out!\u201d Riley yelled excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty amazing dude.\u201d Sam added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was flustered by the attention and turned to Katie who blushed at him. Matt blushed equally and flexed his bicep for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you like it?\u201d He asked uncertainly. Katie nodded vigorously and Matt sighed inwardly in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love it; I wish I could grow as well now.\u201d Katie told him wishfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned to his other friends and looked at them expectantly. They shrugged indicating they were okay with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you can go now if you want to.\u201d Matt said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie thought about it for a moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm... Katie, why don't you go first?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... sure. But just so you know, I don't believe that this will actually do anything.\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the board game made an announcement, somehow.<br>\r\n\"If one of you grows too big, enough that you can't play the game, the board will temporarily increases its size to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie rolled the die, and she got an 11. She moved her piece and it ended up on a purple space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got purple?\" Riley asked, \"Isn't that like the special square where you grow taller, stronger, bustier, and sexier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\" Katie responded. She picked up a pink card and there was a 2x on there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess I get double my rolls. But wait, it didn't say how to do the roll for this...\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you should do the roll for height, then muscle, then breasts.\" Sam advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie nodded, and then she rolled a 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll only grow 3 inches taller.\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait, Katie!\" Riley started, \"You got 2x, so that means you'll grow six inches taller! Won't that make you taller than your boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie just shrugged, but then she started to feel weird. Her shirt started to feel tighter, and her bra started to strain a little. Her shirt started to reveal her stomach. Katie kept growing, and her short shorts started to tear a little. Katie stood up, and noticed that everything seemed smaller than before. Matt got up too, so they could compare their heights. Katie was now taller by 2.5 inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this game actually does make you grow...\" Katie said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Katie, you're not quite done growing yet! Do your next roll!\" Riley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie sighed, and rolled a 2, then a 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, so you'll gain 25 pounds of muscle... wait, times that by two, and you'll get 50 pounds of muscle.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie then started to feel strange. Soon, her muscles started to grow. Instead of looking bulky on her, they made her look more fit. Her stomach gained six-pack abs, her legs grew thicker and more defined, and her arms grew as well. The end result made her look like a fitness model, and her muscles accentuated her figure, making it look sexier. Matt looked at his girlfriend, stunned by her beautiful figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's time for me to do the last roll.\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled a three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Katie! You get to grow three cup sizes!\" Riley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Katie started to feel strange in the chest. Her boobs started to expand, and her bra got very tight on her. Her shirt rose up even more, struggling to contain Jatie's assets. After she was done growing, Katie now had DD Cup breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Katie started to feel her pants stretching some. Her butt was growing too! It started to feel a little uncomfortable for Katie, but Matt couldn't look away from his girlfriend's almost perfect butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't good. How am I supposed to live like this? When we're done with this, I'll be a freak!\" Katie said, starting to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Katie. I'll always love you, no matter how big you get!\" Matt said, trying to comfort her.</span></div></div>",

Green will cause growing in height. Blue for body parts, yellow for muscles, pink for weight and red... you will see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Scott asked annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what is written down here. It wasn't a comment by me. I continue:<br>\r\nWhen landing on a field the player has to take a multiplier card. The change will be determined by the field and the multiplier on the card together. Some fields are special fields. <br>\r\nWhen moving on a special field the player has to take a 'Action' card. The card either contains a mini game or a random action. The mini game will be held between the captor of the card and the player next to him. The game must be played till the end. The player can't leave for more than an hour. If the player leaves for some reason, the player will be punished and the game will continue when a replacement for the leaving player is found.

I begin.\" Claire said and grabbed the dice. She got a 4.

Claire pants from joy while looking at her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They grew. They really grew!\" Claire said excited. She squeezed and moved them around to adjust them correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron didn't dare to stare because it's the bust of Scott's girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily also looked surprised at the boobs of Claire. \"You see...\" She said quietly. \"It works...

Oh there it is.\" she exclaimed. Riley hurried into the Game Place. \"Quick! Quick! I need a fun, new game board. Something exciting and unexcpected.\" she told the store clerk. At first he had a quizzical look then grew a smirk. He slumped back behind the counter. \"I've got just the thing.\" he mumbled.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested an unwrapped monopoly board onto the counter. \"That'll be 6 bucks.\" Riley pays him and takes the monopoly board back to campus. She rushes up to her dorm room and looks at it. \"Monopoly: Fast Food edition?\" Riley opened the box and started setting up the board. \"Please let this be fun!\" she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrienne, Maggie, Caroline, and Kelly. Riley's best friends walked into her dorm room. \"Riley, don't let this be a snooze fest like last month.\" said Kelly. The others agreed. \"Trust me, it won't.\" she said with hope in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all gather around the monopoly game board.

He had been on countless sports teams, and had the looks of a model. With short blond hair and deep blue eyes, all the girls in the school whent gaga over him. There was only one problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad didn't like people. Period. Some considered him asexual, others considered him an egotistical asshole. This is whst lead Chad to want to dominate others. He wanted to be the best, better than any man on Earth. He was 16 years old, but already had the phisique of an NFL quarter back. He worked out constantly, all a part of his endless quest to be the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when he heard about the new reality series \"Growing Pains\" and that it was looking for competitors, of course he signed up! He got little information on it. All he knew was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. There would be ten competetors, all male, ages 16-18<br>\r\n2. Everyday the contestants would partake in an intense physical challenge<br>\r\n3. The winning team got to experience some \"growing pains\", which sounded to Chad like an awful prize, while the losers voted a member off of their team.<br>\r\n4. Each team would consistt of five boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad didn't care about prizes or fame. The opportunity to beat 18 year olds was entising to him, so he signed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the first picked to be on the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe producers payed to have him fly down to the Carribean, where the show was to be filmed, and meet the other nine boys there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshal, African American, 17 years old, 6'0'', athletic build,<br>\r\nTom, Caucasian, 16 years old, 5'9'', slim build,<br>\r\nAllan, Asian, 18 years old, 5'10'', normal build,<br>\r\nJames, Caucasian, 16 years old, 6'2'', very athelic build, bound to be Chad's competition,<br>\r\nJessie, Caucasian, 18 years old, 6'0'', portly build,<br>\r\nAndre, African American, 18 years old, 6'1'', lean build,<br>\r\nSean, Asian, 17 years old, 5'1'', slim build,<br>\r\nBritt, Mexican American, 5'10'', slim build<br>\r\nWest,  Caucasian, 6'1'', Athletic build<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the look of the competition, Chad figured that there were only about three people who were true competition. He would have to watch James, for he was a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Chad hated threats to his winning percentage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host of the show was a newbie to the world of reality game shows who went by the name of Alex Newman. He had slicked back black hair, fair skin, and a nice face. He always wore sunglasses and was overly cheerfull, like thete was a double meaning to every word he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright contestants! Welcome!

Team one will consist of Chad, Tom, Jessie, Andre, and West. The rest of you will form team two. Now rest up, because you all have a big day tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad wasn't too worried about his team. West would be his best support, but he'd have to get Jessie on an excercise program, pronto, or else he would be a hinderance. Worst of all, he had to make friends...no, he wouldn't call them that. Allies. Allies is the better word here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no telling what would be in store on a game who's motto was \"The tables can be turned at any moment. Just wait.\"</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d spent over an hour at the post office in order to sign for some certified letter he wasn\u2019t even expecting. He\u2019d never had to sign for a letter before. He tore open the envelope to find out what wasted an hour of his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Dear Mr. Schwartz, We are pleased to inform you that you\u2019ve been selected to compete on the new season of <b>Big Man on Campus</b>.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward\u2019s heart skipped a beat. <i>Big Man on Campus</i>! His favorite (and only) reality show he watched!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bunch of nerdy guys live together in a house, compete in games and get voted off one at a time (just like Big Brother). The only difference is The Machine. It can make whoever stepped out of it taller, with less fat and more muscle than when they went in. No one knows how it works and the show\u2019s producers won\u2019t say, but it\u2019s definitely real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as contestants stayed on the show, they got to keep growing bigger, until at the end only one huge muscle stud remained. And along with a new body, the winner also got a million dollar prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only lasted a few weeks, but Howard watched every episode religiously. For as long as he could remember he\u2019d wished he were taller and better built. And when he found about open auditions for the next season he practically fell over himself to send in a tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">We feel you\u2019re an ideal candidate for our show<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nHe knew what that meant. 5\u20196\u201d and 125 lbs. soaking wet, Howard was the prototypical skinny nerd the show catered to. They even asked him to wear his glasses on the show rather than contacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy who won started out short and scrawny like him, and by the end had grown into a 6\u20199\u201d well muscled athlete who just the other day was named to the NBA All-Star team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe signed the all the attached paperwork and started packing for his trip to LA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward took his place on the darkened stage. Each contestant was led into their own little spotlight by a scantily-clad swimsuit model surrounded by half a dozen cameras. And they each had to stand there in nothing but boxer shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward looked over to the other contestant who would soon be introduced and tried to size up the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan stood 5\u201911\u201d, but weighed an immense 375 pounds of fat. He could\u2019ve just as easily been on The Biggest Loser instead. He looked the least happy about standing around in his skivvies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason also looked rather meek and embarrassed, but to Howard he looked like trouble. Even though he was nothing but skin and bones, Jason was 6\u20195\u201d tall. With that height he could divert more of his growth to his muscles and outshine all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank was almost the same size as Dan, but looked like he might have some muscle mass underneath the fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all they were a varied group physically, but still a typical group of nerds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth contestant, however, didn\u2019t fit the norm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name was Craig. He was 6\u20191\u201d and at least 200 lbs. of lean muscle; the typical football jock. He was already as big as many of last year\u2019s contestants were half-way though the competition. And unlike the others, he wasn\u2019t the least bit self conscious about being on TV in his underwear; he tried to look inconspicuous about flexing his arms and 6-pack abs for the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like the producers wanted to add some extra antagonism for the new season. Even if he didn\u2019t win, he was probably going to make things miserable while he was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGentlemen, welcome to the all new season of <b>Big Man on Campus</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spotlight lit up in the center of the stage revealing Tom Manning, the show\u2019s mostly tolerable host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis... is The Machine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother light revealed the real star of the show. It looked like a death ray from an old Sci-Fi movie with lots of tubes and flashing lights. Howard assumed that was all for show, but he didn\u2019t care as long as it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Machine can give you the body you always wanted, but only for a price.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom dramatically held up a large brass coin with a plus sign on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis... is a growth token. Each token will grant you one of the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inch in height<br>\r\n5 pounds of muscle gain<br>\r\n10 pounds of fat loss<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd new for this season, growth tokens can also be used to grant you \u00bd inch of growth... down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe models all tittered, as they\u2019d obviously been prompted to do. Howard heard they were going to \u201cspice things up\u201d this season and add an uncensored online feed of what went on in the house at night, but he never imagined that was going to entail everyone\u2019s dicks growing bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may notice a few other changes this year. The next Big Man on Campus could be... a woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more spotlights popped on and similarly under-clothed male models led out another group of five contestants- all girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was positively tiny. 4\u201910\u201d tall and likely not even 100 pounds. She seemed happy and excited to be here despite the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa was also very slight of frame, but unlike Claire stood a fantastic 6\u20193\u201d. Just like Jason, she could be trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and Denise were actually sisters. They were both about the same 5\u20197\u201d in height and both pretty heavy. They didn\u2019t look too formidable, but if they worked together, could prove a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the line stood Misty. She was clearly meant to be Craig\u2019s female counterpart. 5\u201910\u201d, blonde, tanned &amp; toned with big D-Cup breasts, she had the stuck up cheerleader look down to an art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, we made special adjustments to The Machine just for you. On top of the height, fat and muscle options the guys have, female contestants can also use their tokens to make 1 inch adjustments to their hips, waist or bust to sculpt the ultimate bikini bod.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe models dispersed amongst the contestants, giving each one a bag that hung around their neck. Howard pulled open the drawstrings on his and peered inside. Glinting from the bottom of the bag were two growth tokens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the first week, you each get two growth tokens to use however you please at any time. Each week, the remaining contestants will get more and more growth tokens. Four next week; six the week after that, all the way to the final week where the two remaining competitors will each get 20 tokens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward\u2019s mind reeled as he did the math in his head. Adding up the number of tokens one got each week, the two that made it to the final week each would get 110 tokens, plus whatever else won in the games. Last year\u2019s winner only ended up with about 50 overall. Whoever made it to the end of this was going to be gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThroughout the week you\u2019ll all compete in games to test your prowess, both mentally and physically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this year the winner won\u2019t receive extra tokens, but instead steal tokens from a competitor of their choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus, contestants can also give their tokens to others if they wish to forge alliances and team up against the competition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the end of each week one contestant will be voted off and no longer have access to The Machine. We keep going until only one remains.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, in addition to the Million Dollar prize, this year\u2019s winner will also receive... 50 additional growth tokens!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fifty more?!</i> Howard thought to himself. He was having trouble even comprehending how big that would make him if he won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Tom stopped to introduce each contestant and get a few words from them, Howard was so out of it, he barely said a word for his interview, sputtering out something about \u201cbeing thrilled to be here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig, on the other hand, was not at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw man, my life long idol is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Man, when he first won Mr. Olympia he was 6\u20193\u201d and a huge 235 pounds.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019d like to give Arnold a run for his money?\u201d Tom followed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, when I win, I wanna be so big I make Arnold look like this shrimp here,\u201d he said, motioning toward Howard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty\u2019s interview went about as expected, saying she knew she was already the hottest girl at her school, but wanted to \u201chotify\u201d herself further so she could become a famous singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the interviews were over, the lights to reveal the stage they were on was actually the giant living room the the show\u2019s over-sized house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Big Man on Campus house has everything you could ever ask for: a pool, a hot tub, an Olympics-grade weight room to test your growing muscles. Plus our army of designers will be here with new clothes custom tailored to your changing bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only thing we\u2019re short on is bedrooms. Each of you will have to share sleeping space with at least one other contestant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward, you\u2019ll be rooming with:</span></div></div>",

If anybody wants to quit for any reason, excluding a unanimous break, their changes are permanent and cannot be changed<br>\r\n2a. If one is able to find a reversal card and does not wish to use it on themselves, it can be used on another player who is either still playing or has quit<br>\r\n3. Once the game ends, it is up to each person to decide if they want to keep their changes or lose them. The changes are permanent if kept.<br>\r\n4. The game starts with all the cards in a pile. There are 124 cards, each one of five variants.<br>\r\nRed: Will make the player go through the equivalent of 1 year of puberty, assuming a linear rate and no limit.<br>\r\nBlue: Will make the player grow up to 1 foot. Amounts vary based on the specific card.<br>\r\nGreen: Will cause genital growth, as in Breasts and Butts for females and larger cocks for males. May also increase sensitivity.<br>\r\nPurple: Player choice. The player who drew the card may choose a growth and an amount. The rest of the players decide how much of the amount said player grows. Any growth is possible from Physical, Mental and even Metaphysical. If luck is decided to change this way, it is an exact 50/50 weather it will be good luck or bad luck, luck growths will not change this outcome.<br>\r\nReversal: Allows the drawer to reset their own changes or another player's. Can work on players that have quit the game.<br>\r\n5. No players are allowed to cheat in any way. If there are house rules, write them down below.<br>\r\n6.______________________<br>\r\n7.______________________<br>\r\n8.______________________<br>\r\n9.______________________<br>\r\n10._____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSet-up<br>\r\nShuffle cards into one pile. One player cuts the deck, then another player cuts it again. The last player goes first. Owner of the game shuffles. Play continues to the clockwise direction, unless specified otherwise in house rules. The only requirements to play are a deck and at least two people. One player takes one card, then the change occurs. If caught cheating, the effect will instead be thrown into reverse and the player will shrink the amount they would've grown. No other people can join a game after one round is complete. Any player may quit before their first turn with no penalty.<br>\r\nWinning<br>\r\nWinning is only possible if you manage to get all thirty of any one card, or all four reversal cards. If one player should succeed in this, they are allowed to draw one more card before the game ends and that change is decided independently of the other changes that may or may not have occurred. If the deck runs out, the player with the most cards of any one kind is considered the winner but may not draw another card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rules in place, the wizard placed his card game down. He planned on putting it up for sale tomorrow as a test run. He grabbed his wand and uttered a few Magic words. When he was finished, another copy of the rules appeared and the original had a deck of cards. He placed them in a case, then went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho finds the game in the morning?</span></div></div>",
