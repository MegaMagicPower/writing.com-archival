Paluntena had given him some time off now Skyworld was at peace and, while reluctant to leave his goddess, the angel accepted. Staying true to the angel's code of conduct, he was still outfitted in his usual wear. With Hades gone the underworld had resumed normal order and Viridi agreed to leave the humans alone for a while. Pit breathed a sigh of relief knowing that he could just relax in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the angel, a dark force watched from afar. They had been planning to use Pit's absence as an excuse to take over Skyworld but the angel seemed ready to battle again at a moments notice, even if it would end his holiday. A thought struck them however. Pit was alone. No Goddess to help him. No flight. No additional weapons. Practically prime for the picking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now problem two. They couldn't kill Pit because Palutena would just revive him. And even if they kidnapped him, he had a habit of getting out of troublesome situations. Unless there was a way to render him unable to fight back or escape. The dark force laughed as they knew just the way to immobilize the hero. And now was the perfect time! Pit had just fallen asleep. The dark force put their plan into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pit awoke, he was no longer dozing in one of Skyworld's fields but instead in some sort of prison cell strapped to a chair, He was left only in his blue underwear. His tunic and laurel had been taken from him. He looked around a saw...</span></div></div>",

Pit tried to struggle but it was no use, the cuffs that bound him were tougher than they looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfortable, Pitty-pat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hades? B-but I defeated you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You destroyed my body. My soul is still intact and my pets here are more than welcome to carry out my work. Speaking of which, hope you're hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the minions was a plethora of food. They each began approaching Pit but he held his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't bring your appetite, Pitty-pat? I guess the hose could remedy that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit gulped as a minion brought forward the hose, dripping with a weird liquid. Another one punched him causing him to groan in pain. While his mouth was open, the first one shoved the tube in his mouth. Pit nearly choked as the flow started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, he didn't think it tasted that bad, in fact it was rather good. He felt compelled to swallow more. One glance down though and the angel wouldn't be so blissed by the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis once flat stomach began expanding outward as the substance piled into his belly. Pit was completely unaware of this, lost in the taste of his torture. Before long, it looked like Pit had swallowed a ball as his gut billowed out into his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Hades keep going though?</span></div></div>",

He had been released from his shackles but his cell only had it, a bed and a large pile of food in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I won't stave.\" the angel huffed. That comment brought his attention to his stomach though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer the trained, flat masterpiece it once was, Pit's belly had rounded out and piled into a round gut in his lap. He was unsure how to react, just stunned at how he never noticed his gain. He shook and prodded it. It was heavy and soft, likely due to the fluid that Hades fed him. Standing up, it looked even more unnatural. It sagged a bit but retained it's ball-like shape and jiggled slightly every time he moved. He could barely see his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe act of standing was oddly tiring and caused whatever was inside his stomach to churn so he decided to sit back down, letting his belly rest again on his legs. He instinctively rubbed it to try and calm his gut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun there, Pitty-pat?\" Hades voice boomed. Pit didn't respond but curiously didn't stop caressing his stomach. \"Oh, feeling mad, are we? Well, I thought you should know something about your food.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm a busy soul, got a lot to do. Get it? Ha ha. Toodles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the angel wouldn't believe it, there was no way that was true. If it was then surely he'dbe hungry right-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Grumble*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" The angel remarked. He tried to ignore it and continued rubbing his stuffed belly. He knew if he succumbed once, the effects would stack and there would be a point where he'd never not be hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust ignore it. Don't look at the pile of delicious, filling, juicy food. Pay no mind to the burger dripping in sauce, cheese melting down the sides. Don't think about the cake, icing glistening in the cell's light. Pit licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hit with a pain of hunger. He clutched his stomach. He needed that food. No, it'd wear off. Maybe just one. But he'd never stop himself. When has food ever hurt anyone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach made a compelling argument. In truth, his mind had just been drowned out by the constant rumbling and groaning of his belly.</span></div></div>",
