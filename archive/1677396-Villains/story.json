The objects are moved smoothly (hence his name) and can be flung about twenty more feet outside Wesley's \"territory\", as he calls the range of his power. In a nutshell, he has telekinesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrengths: Wesley is calm and intelligent. He make sure nothing dangerous to him gets close to him and he isn't the one to reveal himself in public and wreak havoc. Wesley is not widely known, even to the government. If he in a postion that he has leadership over another, Wesley would be able to control the person well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: Wesley's a coward. If confronted by another superhuman, he would run away while flinging random objects around, endangering both him and everyone else. Welsey also don't like teaming up, so he has no allies. Plus, Wesley thinks he's the best person around, so he can easily underestimate others (i.e. Tammer and Mist)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikes to: Wesley likes listening to New Age music and eating Chinese food. He also perfers stalking random pastbyers in an allyway at night. Wesley also likes going online and ruining as many lives as possible before his computer gets picked up by the police; then he dumps it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApperance: Welsey is twenty years old and have longish dirty blond hair. He has a tiny beard on his chin and has dull blue eyes. He has a ovalish long head and a thin 5'8\" body. His skin is very pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMannerisms and Quirks: Tends to pick up pieces of trash with telekinesis and throw it in a random direction. Then he says it was the wind and laughs. Oh, and his laugh his very annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackground: Wesley was born in Wales and moved to the United States when he was two. During his childhood he didn't do a lot and a lot of people didn't know him well. When he was eighteen, his power emerged and he accidently killed his parents and caused a pileup. He had been on the run since and recently settled in New York.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here you go. I'm not sure if I'm suppose to start his story now, so I'll just give three choices.<br>\r\nNow, where does his story begins?</span></div></div>",

The day was just hitting it's peak it seemed as more people began to file in the withdraw money, or collect their daily wages in order to gulp them down before the dawning of tomorrow. This created an idle chatter, usual for the kind of place on this time of day as sweating laborers and white collar sophisticates for the few, if any time they rubbed shoulders. This was interrupted by the sound of several explosions, one at the entrance, one at the safe and one in the corners of the room where the \"rent a cops\" were stationed. Then, an attack was amplified over the loudspeaker as the sound of groaning and dying was heard over the loudspeaker. Then, silence until someone picked up the speaker, cleared his throat and began to speak. \"Good morning citizens, it is I your lovable criminal mastermind Khaotic, at your service.\" he paused for laughter at his fake radio DJ impersonation, which he did. \"Now for anyone who wants to be a hero, the hallway leading to the loudspeaker room as well as well as the bank vault, is littered with explosives.

This signaled the arrival of the resident superhero of the city, who was gifted for one reason or another with super speed. The hallway littered with explosives did not go off due to this, and the costumed hero searched for his adversary in the small room which contained the public access system. Khaotic was gone so it seemed, but in reality the moment the hero walked into the room he was injected with a serum which robbed him of his super speed. He couldn't feel this slowly working into his glands and nerves, but the moment he would try to use his gift, it would fail him. Which had left our hero as a metaphorical gazelle, trapped in quicksand, being stalked by a homicidal hyena who had lost his mind and had only one thought, to escort him from this world. Out of the shadows Khaotic slithered behind our hero who was facing the far wall, and in one swift motion he slit our heroes through, allowing him to die, bleeding and stunned on the white tile floor. Khaotic slipped out of a secret tunnel behind a bookcase which sealed and closed, allowing his escape. </span></div></div>",

To be stereotypical, she could've been returning to a social function, maybe even a date as she went her way down the alley. She was relatively attractive, let's say the stereotypical blond bombshell, with blue eyes and a pretty face now covered in smeared lipstick. Her heels clacked, which echoed down the dark corridors and continued through the sleeping city. Her dress was revealing to say the least, but she was wrapping herself in a dark raincoat in order to minimize the water damage to her outfit. She walked past a single trash can, lit by the first light in quite a while alongside a door. To a business, maybe an apartment, however she maintained her path when she heard a voice call out for her. <br>\r\n\"I met your kind before.\", a relatively unassuming and average gentleman popped out seemingly from behind the trashcan, his long hair was wet covering his forehead and seemingly clouding his vision for the most part. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" she nervously chuckled, for it wasn't under these conditions that she wanted to hold a conversation with any strange man she had just met in a dark alley. <br>\r\n\"The snobby <b>bitch</b> kind, the ones who think they're better than everyone else simply cause they are born with the looks. And that in one second, you can lose those just as easy as you gained them.\" She was startled and angered at the same time, but deep down was scared of the scowl on this man's face and the legitimate hate in his voice. She took her initial anger reaction and decided to confront the man with the way he was speaking to her. <br>\r\n\"Now listen here you piece of shit! You.....\" She had walked up to him and just as she was going to destroy him verbally, he stuck an unseen knife in her stomach and proceeded to drag in up over her rip cage and shove it in right where he heart was. Her eyes widened in shock as she let her down to the rainsoaked ground. \"Shhhh, don't speak honey.\" he said as he lit a cigarette, then took a quick drag and chuckled \"Your lucky I didn't take you home, we'd have some real fun then.\" He then continued on his way. This was the first in a series of murders seemingly random, by a villain who calls himself Khaotic. What next? </span></div></div>",

He is capable of super analyzation, detecting tiny details that usually go unnoticed, and he can remember anything and everything that he has ever experienced, no matter how long ago it was. He is determined, will do anything to obtain his goals, and is very manipulative when he desires to be. He wears a special armored suit that enables him to not only tap into hidden reserves of power, but give him abilities outside his genetic range of capability. He is currently working on a device that will allow him to read and control people's minds, among other things.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">My very first story! I'm so excited! ^.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, this puppy is a skewed version of reality, where a limited (not at all like the X-Men, where EVERYONE has some sort of ability (some of them are actually rather lame)) number of people have been endowed with genetic...gifts. Scientists have determined that the genes have stayed in a barely detectable state only one mutation away from producing abilities that are paranormal and...just plain weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this new scientific outbreak has stormed the news by force, officials (mostly politicians backed up by scientists) have assured the general public that the condition is extremely rare. All who have it must report to authorities immediately if their condition is hazardous, but only a handful have chosen this option (pretty much the only two were Pete (with a death touch that killed everything he came near) and John (who exploded infrequently)). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this gift is not without its societal implications. Some with it have turned to the hypothetical \"dark side\" and began to terrorize the populace. Others grouped together to combat the \"Corrupt\" (for that's what the term is now), and termed themselves the \"Law\". (The authorities protested until a bomb threat was handled successfully by the Law, and the resistance subsided almost immediately) Another group, the smallest of the lot, were dedicated to keeping themselves hidden or isolated to keep in touch with their abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, here are some bios for the villains. I'll just deal with the villain type and the ambivalent and add a section for do-gooders on another day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammer:<br>\r\nPowers: Able to call upon mythical creatures to do his bidding. They don't last very long, though, and he can't make up totally new ones or modify old ones to suit his current purposes.<br>\r\nStrengths: Mythology, history, and anything about magic. He may not be a sorcerer but those pesky Japanese demons are. He has been trained in six different highly complicated martial arts at this time from some of the demons.<br>\r\nWeaknesses: He isn't the sharpest tool in the shed; while he eats up fiction, he has little to do with most of actual life, and relies on his staff to make sure he stays alive. Namely things like baths, cooking, and other daily chores. He just doesn't get it!<br>\r\nGood for: readers/writers well versed in mythology and/or mythical creatures. This one's fun for those who like samurai stories or Greek myths or whatever has to do with legendary beasts<br>\r\nLikes to: Try to cause trouble, as he is mischievous. Has blond hair, cut short, and golden eyes. Average height. Male, about 30, but no sign of aging (from all the training he does) -- he looks about 18. Constantly getting ID'ed by cops in bars or driving his car. Hates the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Aurus<br>\r\nPowers: He has the ability to detect anything or anyone around him with something he terms their \"auras\", even though he's blind. Can shoot mental projectiles out of his hands, and also create short-distance portals to move from place to place.<br>\r\nStrengths: He's very intelligent, especially in psychology. He's also quite persevering and won't deviate from a task once it's been started. You know how better is the enemy of good enough? Well, for him, it's \"good enough is the enemy of better\".<br>\r\nWeaknesses: Very single-minded, and he won't often notice things if he's totally concentrated on something else. His rank on the Most Wanted list will fluctuate depending on his presence -- sometimes he'll be delightfully evil, other times he'll retreat to some secluded mountaintop and mutter to himself for weeks upon end.<br>\r\nLikes to: Solve problems and puzzles, as he is up for any mental challenge. Looks about 80, but he's been that way for over ten years, even though he's only 30 and actually quite fit. Constantly getting helped across the street. Wishes the world were easier to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ohm no Notagain<br>\r\nPowers: Can generate electricity from his body. Can also move at speeds of about 60 mph from a standstill. Looks like he's teleporting when, in fact, he isn't.<br>\r\nStrengths: Very concise. Never tries to protract an argument. Rather clixby (for those who know what that is :D).<br>\r\nWeaknesses: Doesn't spend quite enough time on important subjects, preferring to solve his problems before nine o' clock so he can watch Lost. Will often disappear during dramatic moments to watch TV, eat dinner, or go on a date.<br>\r\nLikes to: Watch TV, which he powers with his own energy, and race. Looks about 28. Constantly fidgeting. Wishes Lost would be on more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmbivalent:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Major Chord<br>\r\nPowers: Can play any instrument masterfully the first time. Can also use music to hypnotize others<br>\r\nStrengths: Very amiable and charming. He is also quite modest, even through his prodigious musical talent.<br>\r\nWeaknesses: Can't figure out where his gift came from, and also doesn't know he can hypnotize (no making him figure it out in the first two chapters <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">)<br>\r\nLikes to: Play instruments, and meet girls. Is 18, and perpetually cheering his coming of age. Constantly finding new instruments (and girlfriends) to play. Used to be a drummer in the army, finding his way up to the rank of major before they found out he was too young to serve. However, he had served his country and became exempt from the draft (which always makes him slightly depressed when he talks about it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Mist<br>\r\nPowers: He can form things out of pure blue mist energy. These can do whatever he thinks them to do, but only for a short time. Psychokinetic. Has superhuman agility, and slightly above average speed (say, about 20 mph at top speed).<br>\r\nStrengths: Has an IQ of over 275, and hard to trick. He is only moderately helpful, preferring instead to remain inside his laboratory. This lab was actually the reason his powers are so ranged -- exposure to radioactivity changed his appearance and abilities.<br>\r\nWeaknesses: Secluded and timid, he relies on his powers to do everything. Even though they've helped him in his work, he's slightly afraid of them, too.<br>\r\nLikes to: do sciencey things like tests and experiments. Looks like:<br>\r\nHas blue fur, a canine face, retractable claws concealed in over-sized, adorably soft cat paws, with a blunt-looking spike in the back of each paw that can actually cut through steel if enough force is applied. Slim and athletic, he has lighter colored fur on his stomach. Another spike lies on his chest, and several more can be extended from his back to form a pair of what can be called wings, though they can't actually help him do more than jump higher and glide. His legs are a bit like kangaroo legs, and this helps his agility by making him a more efficient runner. His fur is soft and luxurious, and he never gets pests. In public, he always wears a concealing, sapphire blue overcoat with a blue hat pulled down low. On the back of his head, midnight blue streaks give him the look of a normal person.   Constantly doing something in his lab. Practically worships his new color, namely blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drew a blank for the last one :S<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply adore proper grammar. It's probably my only fault :D Please share my appreciation of the finer points of the English language and we'll get along fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may add in characters at almost any time, so long as they aren't \"better\", per se, than the characters I have listed here. The only exception to this rule is that two more true villains can appear, and three ambivalent people. Got it? I hope so. Basically:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Use the characters listed<br>\r\n2.)Try to keep it \"G\" or \"PG\"<br>\r\n3.) You can add anybody so long as their powers are lesser than those here<br>\r\n4.) The only exception to #4 is that you can add two villains and three semi-villain, semi-hero people (herovillains?)<br>\r\n5.) Please don't use \"stoopid Inglish\" (as my friends and I put it)<br>\r\n6.) Stick to the storyline, please. Don't make up your own version of events, as that makes things tiring. For instance, if I said that it was because a giant spider got loose and terrorized the populace that those people are in cocoons, don't say that a meteor shower did it unless you are joking.<br>\r\n7.) Make sure the villain stays in character and evil, please. No making Ohm no Notagain start making dramatic speeches or Tammer decide that he wants to become a politician, naturalist, or philanthropist. Because they won't EVER decide to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankies, that's all! Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(wish me luck ^.^)</td>",
