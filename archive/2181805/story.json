This story will go from year to year in order, feel free to use knowledge from the books or movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after making your selection for what year to follow you can come up with a few scenarios, guaranteeing that everyone has the opportunity to see what they want from any given pairing. No rules against multiple shrunken witches and wizards, shrink the whole school except for one if you want. As long as one character remains bigger than the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what book/movie shall we venture into?</span></div></div>",

I have no interest in reading or writing about characters like Professor McGonagall or Molly Weasley in the role of power, just my personal preference and in no way a guideline for this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* An addendum to that statement, for the first year Hermione will be the only character shrinking or discovering tiny characters, it seems repetitive to make additional choices for the year with the smallest character cache. *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Hermione Granger suspecting Professor Snape's involvement in releasing the troll on Halloween that almost ended her life in pursuit of the Sorcerer's Stone, as well as the attack on Harry during his Quidditch game decides to take it upon herself to remove Snape from the equation by shrinking him with a potion he taught them to brew weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Harry, while attempting to sneak out of the Hogwarts dormitory is caught by Hermione who warns him that sneaking around the castle at night is strictly forbidden and that he could be expelled. Harry tells her not to worry because he has his invisibility cloak, but Hermione shrinks him anyways with the 'Reducio\" spell to keep him from leaving. Finding a place for him that he couldn't get out of until morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Ron and Harry are mysteriously shrunk in an instant while sitting on a couch in the Hogwarts Common Room, going completely unnoticed by any of their fellow classmates. Shortly after Hermione returns from the Library with a new book, looking for a comfortable seat to do a bit of light reading. (Unaware)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Draco Malfoy is shrunk by Hermione a week after he reported her, Ron, and Harry to Professor McGonagall for sneaking out of the castle after hours and getting them into trouble. She cites that while their detention was now over, Draco's was only just beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Harry shrinks on the Hogwarts express on his first journey to Hogwarts, after a young girl by the name of Hermione Granger enters his train car and enters what she believes to be an empty room. Harry calls out to the giant girl in the hopes of getting her attention but is unsuccessful before she sits down. (Unaware)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was young Harry Potter's first time on the train en route to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he was excited to see the castle for himself. The very concept of Magic was still new and wondrous to the 11-year-old boy who grew up with no understanding of his potential, or the relations between Wizards and Muggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd taken a train car for himself after being separated from his new friend Ron Weasley at Kings Cross after he excused himself to the restroom. He hoped Ron would follow up on their meeting and join him, it would be nice to have some friends going into an unknown environment such as Hogwarts before he arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter riding on the train for about twenty minutes, Harry noticed an odd glowing coming from inside of his right pocket. Reaching into and turning out his pocket Harry discovered that his new wand was responsible for the strange source of light. He flicked his wrist trying to turn it off, still not having a handle on the use of magic. However, the light only appeared to grow larger and glow brighter as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light finally began to fade Harry could tell immediately that something was amiss. His legs had shifted position and he felt as if he was now sitting on a flat surface. Upon rubbing and opening his eyes Harry discovered why. The small train car he had been riding in earlier was now gigantic in size, large enough to contain the Dursley's entire home, along with most of the surrounding neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had been shrunk down to an inch tall in height, sitting height about the floor in the seat he was occupying earlier. But with nobody around to witness his shrinking or any way to get to the floor from his current location, Harry felt as if he might be stuck small for some time. Fortunately, his wait might not have been as long as he feared, as the door to the train car clicked and slid open to reveal a young girl. Her name was Hermione Granger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a Hogwarts uniform and robe paired with a formal skirt that reached down to her knees, complete with a black robe. Hermione peered into the room, swearing she had seen a flash of light, indicating that someone was performing a bit of magic in here but the room appeared completely empty. Oh well, at least she'd finally found a nice place to sit down and rest until they arrived at the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione wandered in, sliding the door closed behind her and pulling down the blinder on the door for privacy reasons before turning the face the seat on her left. \"This is perfect, she's looking right at me.\" Harry said to himself, hoping he could get her attention and return to his normal size as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry jumped up and down, waving his arms and yelling up at Hermione in the hopes that she'd notice him. However, her eyes neither widened nor blinked as she took two steps towards where the famous young wizard had been sitting. She easily towered over him at an astonishing height as she turned to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bollocks!\" Harry's said, the look on his face turned from one of hope into one of fear as he recognized that he was too small to be seen without being looked for. It probably didn't help that his clothes bared a similar pattern and color to the fabric covering the seat. A lot of good this new information would do him now that the massive Miss Granger was no longer looking at her new seat, already straightening out her clothes and extending her bum out towards Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to react, Harry tried to run away but Hermione's bum easily bulldozed over him like he wasn't even there. Good thing he had the instinct's to fall on his back as Hermione landed on top of him, otherwise his spine might have been broken in two. Another thing to be grateful for was how strong Wizards bodies were by nature, any normal human being would have been crushed like an ant under the young witch's bottom. Trapping him somewhere under her right buttcheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven through the fabric of her skirt and knickers, Harry could feel just how soft Hermione's flesh really was as she began to adjust herself to her new seat. Strangely enough, it already appeared to be set to the shape of another person with a slightly smaller butt than her own, telling her that someone else was in her recently but they must have moved on. Nothing a few quick movements wouldn't solve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione grabbed her seat and pulled her weight in a downward spiral, hoping to conform the bench's cushion into the shape of her rear end. Harry's experience of this was much more dramatic, Hermione's bum going straight from bulldozer to steamroller as she forced all of her weight down on him, twisting and turning in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, much better.\" she announced, lifting her butt upwards slightly to fix her skirt before sitting down again. Her crushing weight removed from Harry's tiny body for only a mere second before her rear end came crashing down all over again, accompanied by a sigh of relief from the young girl as she made herself comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione reached into her bag, pulling out a book on charms and spells she'd purchased at Flourish and Blotts in the hopes of getting in a bit of light reading before they reached Hogwarts. Of course, to someone like Hermione the term 'light reading' was loosely defined as the book added over five pounds to her overall weight upon being set on top of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Hermione feels something moving around underneath her, getting up to find Harry sprawled out on her seat. She starts off nice and sincere as she apologizes for sitting on and flattening him with her bum. However, after giving her name and learning his true identity things take a turn for the worse as Hermione wonders what such a famous person was doing under her butt in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Harry wand begins to glow again from inside his pocket, activating a new spell that makes him slip through Hermione's skirt. Landing him just outside of her knickers as she rides the train unaware of her tiny passenger. Once the train stops, Harry finds himself stuck to Hermione's skin by sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Hermione feels something under her and gets up to discover a moving creature under her butt, without examining him more closely she determines that he must be one of the chocolate based products she's heard about. Such as the chocolate frog, a spell placed on them makes them run from the mouths of whoever attempts to eat them, but they aren't actually alive.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the additional weight of Hermione's novel resting on her lap bearing down on him, Harry's struggles began anew. He was both literally and figuratively in the dark about what was going on in the world outside of the space beneath the young witch's bottom. But with all 85 pounds(plus the 5-pound book) of Hermione resting on top of him, even moving his arms and legs proved to be very difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, Hermione could still tell that something was amiss with her seat. Something small, like a bug was struggling underneath the weight of her butt. Hermione didn't react hastily, and she wasn't very disgusted by the idea of sitting on an insect either. Contrary to most girls, she was excited by this turn of events. Her school year hadn't even begun yet, and already she had the chance to both discover and study a minuscule creature that could survive a full ninety pounds of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione leaned towards her right side, away from the window and put her book down in the seat next to her. She did this purposefully in an attempt to see if the bug-sized creature under her butt could handle the full extent of her weight. Precisely as she Hypothesized it would be capable of enduring, furthermore she came to another conclusion that the bug could withstand double her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to get her hands on this insect-like creature Hermione lifted herself off of her seat so she could examine it firsthand. Though for Harry the relief of being freed from the weight of the young girl's buttocks was short lived as she quickly spun around to inspect her seat more closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating!\" was all she said, astonished by the discovery that the so-called 'bug' she had trapped under her butt only moments ago appeared to have a human form. Most likely indicating that this was another student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello down there, terribly sorry that I sat on you like that. I was under the impression that this cart was empty, I hope you can forgive me, but I didn't see you.\" Hermione apologized, feeling bad that not only had she sat down on this boy, but intentionally tested him with her full weight. Though, that was probably something she should better have kept secret to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nice to meet you. My name is Hermione Granger, and your name is?\" she asked, hoping to put their previous encounter behind her. A poor choice of words she thought to herself, still embarrassed as she looked down on the inch tall boy as he prepared to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-My-My name is Harry, Harry Potter,\" he replied, craning his neck upwards. Hermione froze for a moment. She rose to her full height over the bench, towering over the shrunken boy who lived with relative ease. She couldn't help but look down at her seat and notice how he was barely visible from here point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you're Harry Potter? Well, you're much shorter than I would've imagined.\" the young girl said in utter disbelief. Out of all the kids attending Hogwarts this year, she made the one famous person her unwilling seat cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why was he so small in the first place?  Hermione was quick to rule out the possibility that he shrunk accidentally, given his social status and the legend of his scar. He must have shrunk himself on purpose for one reason or another, coming up with an explanation that explained everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so that's how it is?\" Hermione paused, putting the pieces of the puzzle together for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt, someone as famous as Harry Potter could afford early instruction in wizardry. It was no accident that he'd shrunken himself, she thought. He must have shrunk himself purposefully expecting a female student to sit on him, which is why he wore clothes similar to the train's bench. Unfortunately, Harry appeared to bite off more than he could chew when presented with her powerful buttocks and now he was going to pay the price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perverted little maggot!\" Hermione's voice boomed, quickly putting Harry on the defensive as she put her hands on her hips, her eyes glaring down at his tiny form while she scolded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you! Think you can shrink yourself to spy on me? Guess you bit off more than you could chew, don't worry I'll teach you a lesson you won't ever forget!\" Hermione said as she continued to berate Harry from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione wait ...\" was all Harry could say, trying to rise to his feet in an attempt to calm the young giant girl down before the train hit a bump in the tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the shrunken boy found himself tossed back onto the center of the bench, feeling a bit dizzy as a result. However, upon looking upwards a few moments later, Harry was surprised to see that Hermione was no longer looking down at him. Instead, she had turned around and positioned herself over the seat for the second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't talk your way out of this one little bug. I'm only giving you what you came here for after all.\" Hermione declared, hovering her skirt-clad butt over the shrunken boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please listen to me. I can explain everything. It was an accident I swear!\" Harry explained, but Hermione could no longer hear his actual voice, just tiny squeaks coming from his general direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you please do me the favor of shutting up?\" Hermione asked, taking one quick side step with her right foot before coming down fast on her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Granger's rear end eclipse's Harry's body in the blink of an eye, making contact with the seat hard before he could even move. Hermione worried that she might not have held herself back enough in her agitated state, she wanted to punish Harry for spying on her, not kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she only stunned him briefly. Successfully knocking the wind out of him for a few seconds while she sat on top of him, slowly trying to refill his lungs with the limited air supply under the bookworms butt. Before long Hermione was able to feel harry struggling underneath her, and while she wouldn't admit it out loud, it did feel quite nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you're quite comfortable down there. I'll need you to be quiet while I look for a spell that can help me deal with you properly.\" Hermione announced, shifting in her seat until she felt comfortable, pinning Harry under the mass of her left buttcheek while she rested herself against the window reading her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Harry, this experience was much worse than the first time he found himself under Hermione's bum. She was purposefully sitting on him this time, ensuring that the brunt of her weight was concentrated directly on top of him. She was also fully conscious of Harry's movements under her, enjoying them as the train ride continued along the tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven through the fabric of her skirt and panties, Harry could feel how each bump in the tracks affected Hermione. Even the tiniest thump or rattle had huge impacts on how the giant witch's bottom bounced on top of Harry and her seat. Hermione herself remained unaware that this even happened, already content with Harry's struggling beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, this spell should help teach you a thing or two about minding your own business and respecting a girl's personal space.\" Hermione announced, closing her book and moving it to the side so she could stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was relieved as he watched Hermione's butt lift off of him for the second time, though he doubted that he'd be receiving the same kindness she showed him earlier. She bent down slowly, drawing her wand from her knee tall grey sock and pointing it at Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat spell does Hermione have in mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Levicorpus followed by The Sticking Charm(No incantation available)- Hermione uses the Levicorpus Charm to hang Harry upside down and move him off of her seat so she can take her sock and shoe off before using a quick wand movement to stick Harry to the sole of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Epoximise- Hermione uses a transfiguration spell that Hermione uses to make Harry's body one with her panties. Forcing him to spend the rest of the day closer to her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Diminuendo- Hermione casts a spell that makes Harry even small, shrinking down to only one centimeter tall. Deciding that if Harry wanted to be the size of a bug, he might as well go all the way down. (What she does next is entirely up to the author of the next chapter.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry's heart sank as this giant girl he'd just met pointed her wand down at his miniscule body, the tip glowing with a blinding white light. Chills traveled down his spine as he realized she could probably annihilate him with the proper Hex. Luckily, Hermione was planning to get herself expelled before the school year even began, taking a different route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured that if Harry wanted to be small, then she should do the polite thing and grant his wish, thinking of a spell she'd learned from a book the other day. Not batting an eye, Hermione sternly fixed her eyes on Harry and spoke the incantation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diminuendo!\" The giant witch in training said sternly with a hint of anger in her voice. The tip of her wand flared and quickly faded away when suddenly, Harry began to feel a strange yet somehow familiar sensation in his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped he was wrong, but one look up at Hermione and his suspicions were promptly confirmed. It was undeniable that in the blink of an eye, the frizzy-haired first year's size had doubled, plus interest. Big didn't begin to cover Granger's vast size. The most fitting word Harry could think of on the spot was enormous, or maybe even, gargantuan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, a size befitting your actions! Perverted little bug!\" Hermione bellowed, her voice ringing so loud that it sent shivers down Harry's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, Hermione could no longer see Harry standing at her full height. She had only made him only a centimeter tall, meaning that he was now small enough to fit inside of her belly button. On top of that, Harry's clothes still matched the Train's seat, making him invisible to the naked eye from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this fact, Hermione had to lower her face to the train seat to talk down to Harry. She lowered herself slowly so that just her face hung about the shrunken 'Boy Who Lived' her giant face larger than any billboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I was going to let you off so easily. Obviously, you were prepared to be sat on, at your former size, so let's see how you handle it at this size.\" Hermione scolded, the 'it' she was referring to being her buttocks. Justifying her punishment for this tiny pervert with her butt as a kind of poetic justice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as she had before, the young witch jumped to her full height, towering over Harry with her hands on her hips, looking down on him with a sense of superiority behind her eyes. Harry paused, frozen in fear by the sheer size of someone his own age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione, seeing no reason she should continue talking down to this ant-sized wizard, turned her back on him, placing her feet apart at shoulder length before moving to sit down. This action broke Harry out of his trance too late for it to matter, attempting to run away as he turned his back to the falling Hermione. Unable to watch as she flipped her skirt to assure that Harry didn't escape even a single millimeter of her humongous hindquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry quickly rolled over as Hermione's body blocked out the surrounding light, shadows eclipsing his entire world as she fell towards him. The last thing he saw was her black panties-clad butt racing towards him, then, crushing darkness. At that moment, Harry was lost to the world somewhere underneath Hermione's left butt-cheek, even she couldn't feel where he was, her panties acting as insolation, forming a barrier between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the same was not true for Harry, he was still stuck between her Panties and the train cushion, but he could definitely feel Hermione on top of him. She must have weighed more than 3,000 pounds, if her skin wasn't so soft Harry's body would have been obliterated the moment she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of her cheeks was twice the size of the Dursleys house, and the fact that they were constantly in motion do in part to the train's momentum, rolling over the tracks, causing her body to shift on top of him every couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Hermione do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Hermione forces Harry to endure the rest of the ride under her rear, as the train travels over bridges, mountain ranges, and finally water before they can travel by boat to reach the Castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Hermione misses feeling Harry underneath her and moves him closer to her butt inside her underwear to better feel him against her skin before sitting back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Hermione bounces on Harry a few time to get her points across, standing up only to talk down to Harry and berate him before quickly bouncing her butt down hard on top of his puny body, before finally resolving to turn him back to normal size. Warning him that she would be so nice next time.</span></div></div>",

He had only been a wizard for a few days, and he did not want to end his time as one as a stain on a classmate's robe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, his struggles were getting to Hermione. She dismissed it as an itch at first, but it soon became clear that whatever was under her was not just an errant tag. It felt.... alive. In the muggle world, she would have just assumed she had a bug under her bum, but she had no idea what to expect on a magical train. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned to one side, relieving her weight from the cheek Harry was pinned under. She felt around under her bum, until her fingers seized on the little wiggling thing. She pulled it up to her face, dangling it before her dark brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was relieved he had been found. He didn't know this girl, but she looked nice enough, and anything seemed better than spending the entire trip to Hogwarts trapped under her bum. That is, until she said: \"Ooh, looks like I sat on one of those living chocolates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's eyes widened at her words. She thought he was just a piece of candy, just like the chocolate frogs he'd seen earlier! He shuddered at the thought of being eaten alive, and hoped this girl did not have a sweet tooth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione continued while she observed the treat struggling in her hand: \"I didn't know they made people shaped ones. And this one appears to be white chocolate.\" Little did Harry know, white chocolate was her favorite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry began to scream up to her that he was a fellow student, not a piece of chocolate. He had no intention of being eaten on his first day of school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know these things squeaked either.\" Hermione said, surprised by the sudden outburst of high pitched noise coming from Harry. \"I suppose it would be too strange to eat them if they were talking to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear overwhelmed Harry as he realized she couldn't make out what he was saying. At his tiny size, his voice was too squeaky to be heard. He had no way to tell her that he wasn't candy. And by the way she was licking her lips, he didn't have long to figure something out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione knew nothing of the fear and panic going on inside her fist. All she felt was the slight squirming of a magically enchanted sweet, along with an overwhelming desire to eat it. Of course, it had just been left out on the seat, and she had sat on it, but she suspected that some magic must keep these things sanitary given the number of chocolate frogs she had seen hopping around the train floor. Plus, her dentist parents hardly ever let her eat sweets. After looking around to ensure the owner her new treat had escaped from was nowhere in sight, she began to move Harry towards her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! You can't eat me!\" Harry screamed as he was brought above Hermione's mouth, his shirt pinched between her thumb and pointer finger. The bushy haired brunette tipped her head back as she opened her mouth wide, giving him a good look at the straight shot to the back of her throat, and the slippery tongue that would happily carry him there. The pink serpent danced in her mouth, eagerly anticipating Harry's descent. Her teeth were incredibly white and shiny enough to see his own reflection in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione lowered him slowly down towards her mouth, rather amused by the sight of the frantically kicking piece of chocolate. She was quite impressed by how realistic the magic was. This little piece of chocolate really seemed to be fearing for his life. Still, chocolate was chocolate, and she couldn't wait any longer. She lowered it into her mouth feet first, pursing her lips around its waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was powerless as her lips closed around his waist, obscuring the lower half of his body from view. He punched at the plushy pink barriers but this seemed to do little more than tickle her lip. Meanwhile, he felt her tongue spring into action, prodding playfully at his kicking legs. Even when his kicks landed, Hermione showed no indication that she cared in the slightest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Hermione LOVED the taste of her new magical candy. It was like nothing she had ever tasted before. Normally she would just toss the entire piece of candy in her mouth, but this was worth savoring. She licked and sucked at her snack, doing her best to fully experience the taste of her former cushion. Eventually though, she couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to take a bite. What did the inside of magical white chocolate taste like? It was time to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry screamed in agony as Hermione's teeth tore effortlessly through his legs, causing the severed appendages to drop down onto her tongue. He couldn't see them past her lips, but he knew they no longer belonged to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmmm.... \" Hermione moaned, in love with the taste of Harry's tiny legs. Her moans of approval shuddered throughout her entire face and lips, shaking the tiny Harry still pinned between them as he writhed his remaining body in pain. Dazed, he felt himself being lifted up away from her lips, allowing her to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what kind of filling this is?\" Hermione mused, tossing the tasty legs around her mouth. \"Too bad you can't tell me little guy. Guess I'll just have to live with the mystery for now.\"  Hermione said, before swallowing her first bite. Harry shuddered as he watched the bulge descending down her throat, knowing that it contained all that remained of his legs. Once it was gone, he turned his attention back to the girl's mouth, only to find she was already licking her lips in anticipation of her next bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry screamed even louder as he was lowered once more into her mouth. This time her lips were around his shoulders, with his arms and torso inside the saliva soaked cave his legs had been cast into the depths of. He cringed as he awaited the fateful bite, expecting to be snuffed out of existence when Hermione's teeth crushed all his internal organs at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to bite into the remaining piece of her candy, when she had an intriguing idea: how would it feel to have this magical chocolate struggle all the way down her throat? It seemed like the legs stopped working as soon as she bit them off, so if she wanted to try this out, she'd have to swallow the rest whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than the bite he expected, Harry felt himself caught up in a powerful slurp as Hermione sucked his entire body into her mouth. He felt her wet lips slide across his body, squeezing his neck tightly for a moment before popping his head into her mouth as well. Without her lips to hold onto him, he landed with a wet plop on her tongue, which was ready and waiting to carry him to his final resting place. He slid down the slippery pink appendage like a slide, heading right into the black hole of her throat. He tried his best to grip onto her tongue, but to no avail. Harry let out one final scream for help, before launching off her tongue and slamming against the back of her esophagus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof, he's a fighter.\" Hermione thought, giving a neck a gentle pat where her little morsel was currently struggling. This was enough to stun him, allowing him to fall the rest of the way down into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't even know why he was fighting on his way down her throat. He knew the girl couldn't hear him, he knew he wasn't going to survive this, but he refused to die without a fight. He was elbowing and kicking against her esophagus as peristalsis made short work of him, dragging him downward to the bubbling acid pit that was awaiting him in her belly. He managed to stop his descent for a moment, lodging his foot against a ridge of her esophagus, but a powerful slam against her neck from the outside world easily dislodged him, catching him off guard enough that he plummeted the rest of the way down without fighting, landing helplessly in her stomach. He was already knee deep in stomach acid, and it was only getting worse with each passing moment. Surprisingly, he found himself wishing he was back at the Dursley's. He hated his old life, but at least it was a life. Now he was doomed to be nothing more than a bit of ass fat on a young witch who was too dumb to tell the difference between a human being and a bit of chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione sat back in her seat, content with delicious snack. When the snack cart came around, she asked if they had any more of the tiny candy people, but was disappointed to find that they had no idea what she was talking about. She shrugged, assuming that someone must have brought her candy from home and accidentally let it get away from them. She resolved to try and find some more of them when she got to Hogwarts, before turning back to her book, unaware that the boy who survived Lord Voldemort's killing curse was currently proving no match for her digestive tract.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They'll learn their lesson.\" Hermione's voice boomed from above. The last thing the tiny pair remembered was bring reprimanded for their flying car crash, which had been suddenly interrupted by a flash of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded, they saw a familiar face overhead. It was Hermione, smiling down at them from above, her cute face framed by her familiar bushy hair. And she was enormous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the bloody hell is going on Hermione! Why are you so big?\" Ron asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Ron, if you paid a bit more attention I think you'd realize that I'm not big. You're just small.\" Hermione said, in her normal matter of fact voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are we small?\" Harry asked, noticing that they seemed to be standing in some sort of box. Ron was on his left, and the magical car was on his right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your punishment for that driving incident.\" Hermione explained. \"Professor McGonagall thinks you two have to learn to be more responsible, and so she gave you to me since I'm the best second year student in Gryffindor.\" Hermione explained, puffing out her chest with pride just a bit at the recognition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous 'mione, just change us back now!\" Ron demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do Ron. I can't change you back until I am sure you learned your lesson. My reputation is at stake here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learn our lesson? What does that even mean?\" Ron asked, annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means you have to learn that your actions have consequences. You got lucky and survived the tree crash this time, but you need to see that bad things happen when you make reckless decisions. And I have to come up with a way to teach that to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Hermione decide to teach them a lesson? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Hermione has to head to class, and she wants to punish them without them missing class, so decides to stick the tiny pair to the soles of her feet with magic. She warns them that she'll be quizzing them after class, so they better pay attention unless they want a worse punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Hermione decides Harry and Ron need driving lessons based on their crash into the tree. The car doesn't fly anymore, so she sets up a ground course for them where they'll avoid stomping feet, make jumps over parts of her body, etc. Hermione recruits Ginny to help be some of the obstacles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Hermione decides that her tiny friends will make perfect test subjects for some new spells she is learning. She will start with transfiguration practice, turning Ron into a chair in the Gryffindor girls common room (maybe for Hermione, or maybe Ginny wanders in and takes a seat?)</span></div></div>",

It's time we begin your lesson boys.\" Hermione announced, leaning forward and placing the car on the wooden floor in front of her flats. Hermione then rose to her full height, allowing Harry and Ron to marvel at how utterly gigantic she appeared looking at their friend from the ground up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think she's going to do with us, Ron?\" Harry asked, concerned as to why Hermione saw fit to place them on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell, do you think she intends to stand on us?\" Ron asked in response, fearing that shrunken vehicle wasn't build to withstand a stomp from someone of Hermione's stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be mental. Hermione wants to teach us a lesson, not kill us.\" Harry replied, the two boys gazing up through the windshield to see their friend in all of her towering glory. She was busy looking over her shoulder to confirm that there was, in fact, a chair placed against the wall behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allowed her body to fall onto the chair, her backside meeting the cushion with a loud <b>*thump*</b> that could be felt by Ron and Harry as a tremor at a distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, both of you get out of the car,\" Hermione said in a demanding tone, not asking them politely as she would normally, giving them an order. Both doors swung open, the tiny boys jumping out, instinctively realizing that disobeying Hermione could be met with severe consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now for your punishment. We'll need to be quick about this. Class starts in fifteen minutes, and we can't afford to be late.\" Hermione declared, not willing to risk her perfect attendance record over two shrunken nitwits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class? You expect us to go to class like this? Have you lost your marbles, someone could come along and sit on us! We could die!\" Ron said in a huff, thinking Hermione had lost her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you won't have to worry about that. Professor McGonagall has already permitted you both to sit at the front of the class with me, as for your new assigned seats...\" Hermione paused, lifting her feet and sliding her flats off so that they came crashing down on either side of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a long shadow over them was Hermione's socked feet, her toes flexing in delight as fresh air breathed through the fabric of her thigh high socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, her feet smell like old cheese. Does Hermione ever wash her socks?\" Harry whispered to Ron, not wanting to incur the wrath of a three hundred foot tall Hermione Granger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better, well at least you won't have to worry about getting cold. Unfortunately, these school shoes aren't very comfortable, and they don't breathe very well either. But I'm hoping the two of you will solve the former of those two issues while serving out your punishment as my new insoles.\" Hermione proclaimed, revealing her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, have you gone insane? Insoles? You want us to spend the rest of the day under your sweaty feet inside of your flats Hermione? Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds?\" Ron asked in a fit. Meanwhile, Harry stood by silently, not exactly thrilled by Hermione's plan either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Hermione! There has to be another way!\" Harry yelled, hoping Hermione could still be reasonable. But the brown-haired bookworm was not to be trifled with at her current size. She lifted her foot and slapped her toes on the ground in front of the shrunken pair with a resounding <b>*thud*</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is most certainly not another way! You two were reckless, you broke magical law, and you nearly got yourselves killed. You need to learn your lesson, and it most certainly won't be pleasant for either of you. Furthermore, you need to improve your grades, so I expect you to commit today's class to memory. I may quiz you on it later if I feel like you weren't paying attention.\" Hermione stated, drawing her wand for a bit of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't move a muscle. I'm going to stick you to the bottom of my feet. If you stay calm, then I promise you they won't get too sweaty down there.\" Hermione teased, displaying a smile as she showed off her socked soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coalescat\" Hermione said, pronouncing the syllables clearly as her wand produced a ball of white light with a flick of her wrist. Suddenly Ron and Harry were flung towards Hermione's feet, Harry back meeting with the ball of her left foot. At the same time, Ron adhered a little higher on Hermione's right foot, still under the ball of her foot with his face ending up just beneath her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're comfortable down there. You'll be spending a lot of time under my feet, so try not to tickle me, or I'll have to move you. But we're already behind schedule, let's get to class.\" Hermione giggled, turning over her shoes with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather simple action for Hermione, but a different matter entirely for Ron and Harry stuck to the second year student's feet. Their entire world rotated, turned, and shook with every movement she made, no matter how small. However, both had different views on how this experience took place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry saw everything moving around him and paid close attention to Hermione's footwear that was going to serve as his new home. Gazing inside too see that they were indeed well worn, they must have been the same flats she wore last year which would only make what came next even worse. Forced to watch helplessly as Hermione's toes crawled into her flat, shoving Harry face first into her hardly padded insole. Pinned down hard as she flexed the ball of her foot, cutting off all outside light as she slid her heel inside last, trapping Harry in a dark, sweaty hell under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon on the other hand, couldn't see anything but thinly veiled rays of light and shadows through the crevices between Hermione's toes. He could feel every movement of the young girl's foot, his nose pressed directly against her moist socked foot, only able to tell that he was entering Hermione's flat as his surrounding went from dark to pitch black. His back pressed against her insole, forcing his head deep between her toes, trying his best not to swallow a mouthful of foot sweat in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit, you two make much better insoles that I originally anticipated. It's quite a pleasant feeling to have you under my feet. Honestly, I'm surprised I can even feel you this well because of how tiny you are.\" Hermione admitted, though her voice was hardly audible from inside the tight confines of her footwear, so neither Ron nor Harry heard much of what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Hermione reached down and picked up Ron's family car. No bigger than a Hot Wheels toy car in the palm of her hand, she could so easily crush it if she wanted. But instead, she placed it on top of her nightstand and hurried off to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Boom, Boom, Boom*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ron's entire world began to shake violently as Hermione's feet stomped down the Gryfinndor stairwell. Each step impacting the shrunken boys with more weight and speed as she got closer to the bottom. It was as if Hermione was testing their durability, which was accurate. She wanted to confirm her calculations on the matter, purposely trying to crush them underfoot. But, as she expected they survived the entire ordeal as her feet landed at the bottom of the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione continued walking the halls for another couple of minutes until the feeling of walking over Harry and Ron became natural. As if they had always been one with her flats, struggling underneath her feet as living insoles. Then at long last, she arrived at Professor McGonagall's class for charms, hexes, and transfiguration spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention all, everyone. Quiet, please. Find your seats.\" Professor McGonagall said front the head of the class, watching Hermione walking down the steps. Wondering what she did with the now shrunken duo of Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley after she gave her free reign to do whatever she pleased to punish them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young brown-haired girl took a seat at the front of the class, crossing her legs so her feet wouldn't be on the floor. She wanted to make sure they had a chance to hear the lecture in the case she decided to give them a pop quiz. She enjoyed dangling them around, having them thrash about under her socked feet knowing they couldn't escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth offered a unique feeling under her feet. Harry was trying to push himself up and remove his face from Hermione's sweaty insole, which was already beginning to absorb more of the young witch's foot sweat. While Ron could breathe just fine, even though he was forced to endure constant heat and odor. Both left to wonder when their next breath of fresh air would be granted to them by their new owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down now, for our first lesson today we shall learn...\" McGonagall trailed off, a hush falling over the room as Hermione tried to start ignoring her new insoles to focus on her studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. After class Hermione goes through with her plans to give Harry and Ron a pop quiz. Threatening to step on, and then stand on them for some time as a penalty for every wrong answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Hermione decides that she likes feeling Ron and Harry under her feet. Moving them inside of her thigh highs too feel them better against her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. After feeling ticklish during class, Hermione decides to change up Harry and Ron's punishment. Sticking them to her butt underneath her skirt before returning too class. </span></div></div>",

The pressure of her heel had pinned him flat to the inside of her shoe, and he could only squirm helplessly as it pressed and kneaded him into her sweaty insole. But Harry's thrashing against her sock only seemed to irritate Hermione, because she quickly shifted tactics. Now she dropped her foot to the floor and tilted it back. The Boy Who Lived slid down slightly, only to be stopped by Hermione's heel. From above, Harry could hear Ron's surprised shout being muffled by the ball of the young witch's falling on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tense silence for a few seconds. Then Harry heard Hermione's hissing whisper: \"Do <i>stop</i> squirming so much. It's distracting me and if you don't stop right this instant I will be very cross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hermione moved her heel back slightly. It was an imperceptible distance to anyone of her size, but it was enough for Harry to drop all the way down to the back of her shoe. He hit the curved, firm end and crumpled into a heap, trying to make sense of his now vaguely-visible surroundings. He put out a hand to steady himself. It brushed against the insole of the shoe, which was now lightly damp with Hermione's sweat. Harry shuddered and reached out with his other hand. He felt the fibers of Hermione's sock for an instant before she reflexively flinched away. Regardless, Harry slowly staggered to his feet in the complete darkness of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the smell hit him, and he gagged. His and Ron's captress had <i>not</i> been doing a good job of keeping her shoe clean. Speaking of Ron... Harry looked up, but all he could see was Hermione's monolithic foot curving away into the murky blackness. \"Ron...?\" croaked Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, just out of Harry's vision, there was a flicker of movement, and a rather muffled \"Mmmmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ron was alive, Harry thought. He sniffed, and got a putrid lungful of Hermione's feet. He gagged again. Now his top priority was getting out of Hermione's shoe. He dropped to all fours and tried to crawl diagonal to the young witch's gigantic heel, but soon found that he was being forced to squeeze between the unyielding shoe and Hermione's smelly socked foot. Yet still the Chosen One pressed onwards, crawling in the dark until... aha! A chink of light! Harry began to crawl faster now, his desperation fueling his urgency. He was almost there, almost there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then everything became chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's foot slid back to the opening of the shoe, then rammed forward, forcefully picking up Harry before he could react and slamming him into the insole once again. Hermione stood up, inadvertently placing her weight on Harry and Ron. Harry felt like his entire body was being smothered by the unrelenting pressure. Then the pressure lifted for a fraction of a second, before it was cruelly brought back, again and again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was walking to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she got there and pulled her foot out of her shoe, her two tiny wards were thoroughly pummeled. A stunned Harry could only look on as the blinding light of the bathroom was replaced by the looming silhouette of Hermione. She did not look pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you sorry lot can't pay attention for one class and insist on distracting me, I think it's only right I get a little break at your expense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a casual flick of the wand, Hermione levitated Harry and Ron out from her shoe and dangled them in thin air in front of her face. Harry opened his mouth to protest, but her brown eyes radiated mischief mixed with annoyance, and he thought better of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two simply were terrible insoles\" her voice boomed, primly. \"As such, I think you'll serve better as cushions.\" Her wand sliced through the air. \"Silencio!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to scream, to beg for mercy, but no sound came out of his throat. Ron's face was slowly turning the same color as his hair, but his voice was similarly muted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione turned around, flipped up her skirt and pulled down her white panties. Then she leaned over, presenting her round pale cheeks. Harry was filled with an instinct to run, but he was still magically floating in the air, and it was a long drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione made a beckoning motion with her wand. Ron, now silently whimpering with fear, shot to Hermione's cheek and slammed headfirst into it. Though he was only a tiny speck to Harry, he could still make out Ron's frantic struggles as they created ripples in Hermione's buttflesh. But then Hermione pointed her wand at Ron and whispered \"Coalescat\", and Ron froze up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione gestured with her wand again, and Harry felt a brief burst of speed before he hit the giantess's other buttock with a meaty smack. He desperately scrabbled for purchase, pinching the vast pale globe before him in an effort to keep from falling, and he began to feel his voice return as his bushy-haired tormentor's face came back into view. She raised her wand, and Harry had just enough time to yell \"HERMIONE NO!\" before she brought it through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coalescat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn't move a muscle of his own volition as his face was smushed into the warm softness of his classmate's bum. His limbs were spread out like a starfish. He could still breathe, but all it was good for was screaming futilely into the witch's jiggly rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione giggled as she felt Harry and Ron's pathetic cries for help, drowned out by her titanic ass as she pulled her panties up and secured them snugly around her butt. She let her skirt drop down again, and inspected herself in the bathroom mirror. The boys were invisible to the naked eye. Perfect. This will be <i>fun</i>, Hermione thought as she considered all the things she could do to them in the next class as she made her way back to McGonagall's Transfigurations. She quietly walked over to her desk, pulled out her chair, and stood in front of it. She clenched her buttocks, savoring the reactions from her captives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she plopped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were pressed into her buttflesh, which formed a seal around them.

After the Fat Lady's portrait is slashed in the night by the supposedly murderous fugitive-at-large Sirius Black, Hermione and Ginny decide the only way to keep Harry safe and out of harm's way is to forcibly shrink him and then take turns ferrying him about Hogwarts in secret, for his own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Furious with Draco for picking on Hagrid, threatening the lovable half-giant's post at Hogwarts and ultimately getting his hippogriff Buckbeak sentenced to death, Hermione decides to punish the contemptible Slytherin by knocking him down a few notches \u2013 down to two inches tall, in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.

So I should leave Hogwarts then?\" Harry asked, almost a bit too defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just not safe, someone is likely to get hurt, and neither one of us want it to be you,\" Ginny announced, trying to calm him down so he'd hear them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbeldore is here, where else could I possibly be any safer?\" Harry asked, forcing a look between Hermione and Ginny. The two girls nodded to one another in agreement, and Hermione drew her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry took a step back, but the young bookworm was quick enough to cast her Charm on Harry before he even thought to reach for his wand. \"Reducio!\" only one word escaped her lips as she flushed her wand, no sound, no light, only an ominous feeling in Harry's gut that something was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, he watched as Hermione and Ginny began to grow directly in front of him, the castle walls and floor growing taller and taller as well. That went Harry remembered the Defense Against the Dark Art's lesson last year, 'Reducio' was commonly referred to as the Shrinking Charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to draw his wand to counter the effects, but Ginny quickly reached forward and grabbed it from him while he was at level with their navels. \"Sorry, but we're doing this for your good. You'll thank us later,\" Ginny said, looking down at her shrinking crush as she stashed his tiny wand in her pocket for safekeeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give that back!\" Harry nearly yelled, turning to look at Hermione, hoping she would be a voice of reason. But both girls were firm in their resolution to shrink Harry down, still getting smaller as he passes their thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive us, Harry this was the only way we could think of to keep you safe, your attendance is marked the moment you enter the room now, so we'll carry you around the castle in secret so Sirius Black can't find you. We've already spoken to Professor McGonagall and had your classes changed to fit our schedules.\" Hermione finally explained, getting down on one knee, so she wasn't talking down at Harry too severely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, so I'm just supposed to ride along in your pockets and pretend everything's normal?\" Harry asked as he reached the height of Ginny's ankles, surprised by how tall both girls were becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly.\" Ginny interrupted from behind Hermione, nervous that the next part of their plan would upset Harry even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Harry asked as he finally stopped shrinking at just an inch tall, basically a bug compared to his two classmates and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the part I wasn't going to tell you just yet, Harry. You see, the girl's uniforms don't have any pockets, so we'll have to improvise alternative ways of carrying you during school hours. One way we've come up with is keeping you inside of our flats where you'll be safe.\" Hermione said apprehensively, glad that she could barely hear him anymore now that he was so tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGryfinndor's brightest young mind only heard every other third word Harry said, while Ginny could only hear squeaking sounds from so far away. She ironed her hands, preparing to put her foot down and tell Harry that this was the way things were going to be. Starting with a show of force, Hermione swung her hand down and grabbed Harry in her fist, slowly enough so as not to alarm Ginny, but much to fast for Harry to evade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry, Harry, but this is the way things have to be right now. Classes have ended for the day, but we should probably get you acclimated to this new way of life as quickly as possible.\" Hermione said, containing Harry in her fist while she talked to Ginny about which one would take the first shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could hear their voices but not the words they were using, but it appeared that they had decided on the matter rather quickly. Suddenly he was tossed between Hermione's fingers, losing track of which way was up and which way was down as she swung her collapsed fist over to Harry's new temporary home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her fist opened, and Harry was shocked to find himself looking down at _______.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Hermione's empty sneaker, she then drops Harry into her footwear, telling him this will be his primary mode of transportation. She then slides her foot on top of him, going for a walk around Hogwarts with Ginny to test how he feels as her insole, describing how he feels under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Ginny's black sock, Hermione dumps Harry into Ginny's sock, believing she can keep better track of him that way than she could inside her old worn down sneakers, squeezing Harry between her toes when she puts it back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Hermione's butt cheeks, not wanting to keep Harry underfoot Hermione try an alternative route, dropping him down the back of her panties for safekeeping. Harry tries to fight his way out of having this happen, but slips and falls into Hermione's undergarments, becoming trapped against one of her buttcheek.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hermione slowly unfurled her fingers to reveal the sight of her empty black sneaker below Harry, with roughly a twenty-foot drop between him and her insole. Harry immediately rejected Hermione's plan, less keen on the idea of being shrunk now that he realized he would be spending the day under Hermione's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione quit it already! I'm not going inside your fusty old shoe!\" Harry yelled, perhaps not making the best choice of words giving her current size and situation. Hermione, taking note of what he said, became visibly flustered while Ginny stifled a laugh at her friend's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's what you think!\" Hermione said in an angry tone, failing to keep her voice low as she flicked Harry off her finger and down into her footwear. The shrunken Boy Who Lived, quickly lived to regret his choice of words as his back slammed into the worn-down insole inside Hermione's sneaker, forcing all the air out of his body and forcing him to replenish it with the only source readily available. Namely, the hot fumes of Hermione's sneakers, which she had been wearing all day long by the smell of his surroundings, not knowing about her doubled-up course load(Thanks to her Time-Turner).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the smell wasn't nearly as bad as he imagined, but the heat was so much worse than he could have expected, like falling into an active sauna dressed while dressed for Winter. What was Hermione doing all day, running from one class to the next without once taking her shoes off to allow her feet the opportunity to breathe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry pushed these thoughts as far from his mind as he possibly could when he looked out through the shoes opening to see Hermione and Ginny towering over him. Ginny was passively standing behind Hermione and looked quite small when compared to the towering Miss Granger, who was standing directly over Harry with one foot firmly planted on the ground. Meanwhile, her socked foot hovered above her shoe, leaving just enough room for Harry to see her face. Her white socks were damp, coated in a layer of sweat that adhered the fabric tightly to her foot, specifically the parts under her foot had turned a shade of grey, likely a byproduct of being worn for a few days straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn actuality, the reason she left space for Harry to see her and Ginny was so she could see Harry inside of her sneaker. She might have been upset with him at the moment, but she didn't want to hurt him, that said, stepping on top of him was exactly the remedy she needed to make herself feel better about his rude comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move, I wouldn't want you to get caught under my heel,\" Hermione warned, lowering her foot towards the entrance and eclipsing Harry in its shadow. In seconds Hermione's face and torso were blocked out entirely by her sole, but not Ginny, she was actively lowering herself to look inside Miss Granger's footwear where she could see Harry frozen in fear as his best friend lowered her foot on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, she did lose sight of him when Hermione's toes pushed through the hole leading into her shoe. Her big toe landed on Harry first, breaking him out of his trance and shoving him onto his back on Hermione's insole, only to pass him by and make room for the ball of her foot. The pressure he endured next was twenty times more forceful than his encounter with the bookworm's big toe, slammed under the full force of her foot as she tried dragging him to the front of her footwear where he would be safer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry rolled around under Hermione's foot in darkness, eventually sliding under her sole as she jammed her heel through the entrance of her footwear, trapping Harry inside with her socked foot. Luckily, he was able to adapt to his new surrounding rather quickly. As a wizard, his body was less perceptible to being crushed under immense force, and being shrunk reduced those chances even more due to the process of matter conversion. Not surprisingly, Hermione had done her research well while planning for this stunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, squirming around like a bug trapped inside his best friend's shoe was hardly an ideal setup by any means, he might not die from the pressure but, unless Hermione learned to wash her socks and shoes daily, he'd most likely suffocate on the fumes. Not even considering the horrors that awaited him if he ever entered Ginny's handed down sneakers and school shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I can feel him moving, should work during the day,\" Hermione announced, walking forward slowly to get used to the feeling of a living person under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. I was a little worried that Harry might pass out from the smell.\" Ginny teased, walking alongside Hermione, poking fun at her senior classmate about Harry's comment earlier that seemed to infuriate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure my feet smell s-satisfactory,\" Hermione said, stuttering unsurely, realizing she'd taken a dozen classes throughout the day, wearing these sneakers in her rush to get dressed this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can always ask Harry whenever you decide to let him out.\" Ginny giggled, the two girls acting casually, as they re-entered the more crowded areas of the Castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like yours would smell much better,\" Hermione said, a little too defensively. Nevertheless, the girls still shared a good laugh over the idea. \"Assuming you even plan to keep him in your shoes, I'm sure you have some original ideas for places to stash him.\" Hermione continued, not prying any further due to the nature of their arrangement to not know where Harry was after today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, a few.\" Ginny blushed, imagining a tiny Harry getting close to her butt inside her knickers, or keeping him close to her heart in her bra or chest pocket. \"But, just because I'm curious. How does he feel? Under your foot, I mean?\" Ginny asked, looking down at Hermione's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile these two Gryffindor witches enjoyed their joyful conversation, Harry was stomped repetitively under Hermione's socked sole. His face rammed deep into the fibers of her foot covering, unable to escape breathing in the blazing hot fumes it produced at point-blank range. Of course, Hermione and Ginny couldn't possibly believe that the experience was that bad since they were on the more pleasant side of the arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to lie, he honestly feels pretty good. He hasn't stopped moving from the second I stood on him. Almost like, he's consistently massaging my foot.\" Hermione announced, neither slowing down or picking up the pace of her steps. However, it did serve to affect the weight she shifted between her feet with each step, purposely putting more of her weight on Harry to better answer Ginny's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Is he that good at it?\" Ginny asked, intrigued by the possibility of having the shrunken Harry under her own feet. Ginny, curling her toes during her next step, trying to imagine what Hermione was feeling at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shocking, isn't it? I was only acting on impulse, but I might have to make this his primary transportation method.\" Hermione smiled, looking down at her foot. \"Until we can return him to normal, that is,\" Hermione added, but only as a side note to her earlier statement as if the idea of bringing Harry back to his former size made her sad all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny sensed Hermione's emotions and had to admit that she felt similar feelings towards Harry being so tiny around them. It was rather exciting after all, and amusing too say the least. Ginny, trying her best to cheer Hemione up without tipping off Harry if he could still hear them. \"I'm sure we'll have to keep up this charade for at least a few weeks, maybe even a month. So we should get used to taking Harry everywhere with us.\" Ginny announced, looking at Hermione's shoe, then at her face before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your probably right. We can't let Harry out of our sight for a moment.\" Hermione followed up, smiling back. The two girls rationalized that they were only doing what was best for Harry, even if they were going to try and enjoy as much as they possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? Do we continue following Ginny and Hermione today, or fast forward to tomorrow morning before the first class of the day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Continue following Ginny and Hermione as they take a walk around the Castle, wanting to get Harry used to life under Hermione's foot before tomorrow morning. Walking up and down stairs on their way, stepping on stone, wood, and even grass &amp; dirt to see if there is any change in Harry's behavior(Secretly, of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Fast-forward, it's 8:30 AM, and Hermione has to get her first two classes of the day. Starting with Muggle Studies at 9 AM, followed by Arithmancy at the same time. Meaning she'll have to use her Time-Turner to go back in time one hour, electing to keep Harry inside her Mary Jane school shoes for both classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Fast-forward, it 9 AM, and Hermione had left Harry behind with Ginny, waking up to her giant face. She takes a page from Hermione's book and decides that Harry should spend his first morning with her inside of her shoes, placing them next to him so he could willingly climb inside, though she might have to give him a nudge on the behind so she can get to her Potions class on time.</span></div></div>",

She casts a spell to return her to her human form while keeping her tiny, working out a deal with the shrunken woman to be her slave for the remainder of the term to keep her out of Azkaban.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.

When Bartemius Crouch Jr. attempts to put Harry's name inside the Goblet of Fire a rebound causes the individual named on the piece of parchment to shrink in size, one of several defensive mechanisms protecting the trophy. Because this takes place at night, Harry is shrunk inside the Gryfinndor Common Room before Ginny walks in and kicks off her flats, walking towards Harry and stepping on him before he ends up going through a hole in her stockings and falling under her foot. (Unaware)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Fred and George shrink while sitting on a window sill between classes, going unnoticed by passing classmates and the girls from Beauxbatons Academy. Eventually, it is Ginny who passes them by looking for a place to rest during her free period.

Fleur manages to escape and is found by Hermione Granger who initially wants to help restore her size, but decides she would like to keep her like this instead, a mix of having no female friends, being apparently difficult to be around (so having someone like fleur who can't leave her sounds like a great idea) and most problematically that the mix of dark curses used on Fleur had effected her allure, which due to her fear and panic was being pumped out at full blast in the teen witch's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) With Dragon hunting being 99% sight based Harry decides to use an invisibility charm on himself just before he reaches the nest, so the dragon will lose him and in the confusion he can grab the egg. The problem is he messes up the spell and accidentally shrinks to an inch tall, falling off his broom in the process. The only thing stopping him from going splat on the ground is where he'd been flying, having been directly above his fellow champion Fleur and falling directly on top of her, her hefty bosom cushioning his landing.</span></div></div>",

However, due to a mix of adrenaline and nerves, the spell blanked in his mind, his flustered attempt to remember appearing to onlookers, to be a bright flash of light, before his empty broom was bathed in dragon fire, crumbling to ash for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news for Harry was he didn't die, instead the spell caused his body to shrink, falling off the broom once he was too small to control it. This could have spelt disaster were it not for his location at the time of his shrinking, right above the spectator stands, specifically the Beaubatons stand. Harry's fall to earth was stopped by ivory hills, making him the envy of any of the other guys in Hogwarts if they ever knew, the deep cleavage of Fleur Delecours round and impressivly large breasts. At 4 inches tall he didn't make much of an impression against her jiggling mounds, his entire body swallowed up by a crevice smelling sweetly of a most likely expensive French perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur sighs as she sat in the stands, with Potter gone, be he dead or just lost the judges scored him a 0, then Bagman passed the egg to his only friend from what she could tell, a bushy haired brunette with a nice sized chest and perky ass, that she'd seen a few times when she decided to see the differences between her school and Hogwarts libraries. With nothing else to do the silvery blond witch leaves the stands and heads back to the carriage, stopping near the lake to readjust her tightly fitting bra, usually she'd have preferred to go without, but it was better to be professional than comfortable when representing the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movement didn't do Harry any favours as 2 globes of fatty flesh decided to pummel him between each other, something he was used to given the size of his obese cousin and uncle, but with the unhelpful reminder they were boobs, which even before he shrunk were at least the size of his head, and his lower wand began to awaken. While wizards had no real religions to worship Harry still prayed he wouldn't be found in such an awkward and compromising position<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Fleur doesn't notice Harry, meaning he's trapped in her cleavage as she goes about her day.<br>\r\n2) She feels movement and pulls Harry out, angry at him for perving on her like this, and deciding to punish him for his stupid action<br>\r\n3)Fleur retrieved Harry, but instead of anger there's joy and a little arousal. She could easily tell Harry was hard, but clear headed, meaning even at his current size her allure didn't affect him, the only explanation was that he was her mate, and given how small and helpless he currently is, she'll be having a lot of fun with her future husband...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Fleur entered the carriage she felt something between her boobs, she thought that tightening her bra before would be done with it but she was still feeling something in her cleavage. Meanwhile Harry was fighting with 2 soft mounds that threatened to engulf him in their embrace he was scared of what could happen if he gets found by the Veela and between her breasts. Fleur entered her room and sat on her bed then she looked down her vast cleavage and her eyes went wide seeing a little Harry Potter pinned between her breasts. Quickly she grabbed and pulled him out of there leaving him standing in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are.....Harry Potter!\" She said with more surprise and curiosity than anger in her voice, fortunately for the shrunken boy. \"E all through you were killed on the first task\" she said with her notorious french accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's face was blushing red because of being found between Fleur's breasts \"F...Fleur i.....i am sorry I was shrunk when the dragon was chasing me and then I fell into your.....\". He couldn't finish the sentence and stated silent waiting for Fleur's reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Veela listened to him but before answering she noticed something weird, every guy in her presence was affected by her allure turning a bit dumb and groggy, and in Harry's case due to his size that effect would have to be bigger....but that wasn't happening. Harry's eyes were not dilated and his attitude towards her was shy but not the one of someone affected by her Veela charm, he could talk and reason, and in Fleur's mind that behavior only had one possible answer.....he was his destined mate, the kind of guy every Veela searches for to spend all her life with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this fact hit her her eyes widened more as she was now deep in thought: she always dreamt with the day she could find her beloved mate of fate, on giving him all her love and affection as he deserved, and now he was literally standing in the palm of her hand, shrunken down, so cute and all to herself.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fleur?, are you.....ok?\" Harry asked seeing her deep in her thoughts and he started to get nervous when he saw her eyes on him and her look changing from surprise to affection and a bit of lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"o Harry\" Fleur sighed deeply \"I've never been better, my beloved\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? your wa...?\" Harry's question was suddenly interrupted when Fleur's hand closed around him gently, only leaving his face uncovered, and he was brought straight in front of the silvery blonde's stunning face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry I am so glad that you landed in my cleavage of all other places, this is clearly destiny\". She then closed her eyes and puckered her cherry lips while she brought the shrunken boy towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was kissed by those big pair of soft lips gently but also in an affectionate way, as he was being grabbed he could not use his hands but he tried to squirm away from the kiss with no luck at all. Although the kiss felt great and Fleur was smoking hot, he felt overpowered by it the feeling of the Veela's lips kissing him wasn't bad but he didn't wanted to stay like that forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the kiss Fleur pulled the boy away from her lips and shot him a loving and seductive gaze while he was blushing red, something she noticed and found even cuter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to be completely sure that you were my mate and that kiss confirmed it, your scent is....delightful\" she said with another deep sight and scaring Harry more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B....but...Fleur I have to return to the castle people might be worried after I vanished from the tournament I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted when Fleur placed a finger on his lips to stop him from talking, she loved how cute he was and how easy was for her to handle him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ush my love, now that we are together everything will be alright, your disappearance from the tournament it is the best excuse for you leaving ogwarts, while everyone is looking for you you will be safe and warm with me, and after the tournament I will take you with me back to France to spend the rest of our life together I will protect you and show you all my love always, you won't have to worry about anything never again\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Harry was indeed worried, however been shrunk and in the care of a loving and hot Veela who thought him as her destinated mate would be the dream of many of his classmates he didn't want to spend the rest of his life with a girl he barely new, in that size and with his friends thinking he is missing or worse: thinking that he is death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmfff!\" he tried to protest but the finger on his lips muffled every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur found adorable that he was trying to resist and loved his shyness she could see that Harry didn't wanted to be her mate and to be kept by her, but she was sure that destiny had bonded them together and he will have to accept it.....eventually, right now Fleur couldn't be happier, she had found her mate of fate, she had him in the palm of her hand at an adorable size, he was a bit shy something that to Fleur's eyes made him even more adorable. And athough she would never harm him or let any harm come to him, she could easily dominate him with her body when necessary, she would never let him go and shower him with affection every day also his scent make her lust a bit but she knew that she had to control that side of her Veela nature if she was to rough she could kill him or hurt him badly when making love and she would never forgive herself if that happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Fleur just wants to relax with her beloved so she places him between her soft breasts and lays down in bed cuddling with him and hugging him between her boobs although Fleur's affections would be a little to much for Harry who gets smothered in the Veela's bossom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) After the tournament's first task Fleur needs a long bath and unfortunately for poor Harry she plans on drag him with her for some fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She began caressing his face with her fingers and then started fondling his chest and stomach with one of hers. Her other hand went down to his pants and she began rubbing her thumb over his hardening member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry moaned softly, he didn't know what was going on but he enjoyed the feel of Fleur's soft skin against his own. He tried to pull her towards him but she wouldn't budge, and then he felt a burning sensation on his chest. It stung a bit but he didn't mind, as long as it was Fleur doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing became heavier as he felt Fleur's tongue flick his nipples and his hands grabbed her hair while she worked on his chest. He wanted more but didn't know how to ask for it so he just tried to enjoy the moment and focus on the pleasure, which he wasn't that experienced at but he was getting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F... Fleur....\" he moaned not knowing what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't respond, she just kept kissing and licking him all over his chest as her hand continued to rub his hard-on. He felt pleasure unlike he ever felt before and with those feelings, he started to worry that she would stop if he spoke too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F... Fleur...\" he said again and then again when she didn't respond, still rubbing him with one hand and not removing her lips from his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before he came into her hand, breathing heavily and calling her name. She took her mouth away and looked at him, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste nice, I want more...\" she said and then went down to his pants and started rubbing him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhh! G.. God... Fleur...\" Harry panted, he was out of breath and didn't know what she was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could react, he felt something wet and slimy on his member and then a popping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" he grunted in pain as he felt something wet hit his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and saw that she had put his member into her mouth and was sucking on it like a madwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it, he was about to ask her to stop but she was going too fast and he couldn't even think straight. He just felt a lot of pleasure he didn't expect. He was shocked and couldn't help but stare at the roof while she went to work on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before he was moaning and calling out her name, with a lot more dirty words. He was just about to release into her mouth but she didn't stop and wanted him to release as much as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F... Fleur... agh... I'm gonna...\" he panted and then his eyes rolled in the back of his head as he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a lot of wetness on his chest and stomach when he woke up and was in a slightly soft bed, though he didn't feel any pain anywhere. He looked down and saw that his robe was open and he had white liquid on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry groaned as he tried to get his bearings and unsteadily pulled himself up into a sitting position.<br>\r\n\"Where... am I?\" he muttered softly, to no one in particular.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been nearly two months since the closing of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and things only continued to get worse in the Wizarding World. Rumors of the dark Wizard Voldemort's return spread like wildfire, carrying his influence across the realm of magic. However, those closest to Harry Potter understood that these claims were more than just rumors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione Granger and Ginny Weasley, in particular, were seriously concerned for Harry's safety. Sure, Harry had been able to defend himself against DeathEaters, Dementors, and even a Basilisk over the past few years, but the two girls were worried that one of Voldemort's followers might still come to claim Harry's life and devised a plan to keep him safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Ginny's Home---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry woke up with a splitting headache, unable to fully remember the last thing that happened to him before he passed out. Though, he was pretty sure that Hedwig had just dropped off a letter from one of his classmates from Hogwarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right Hermione! Your plan worked perfectly.\" Harry heard, recognizing the voice as Ginny Weasley's. What was she doing there, and why was her voice so loud? It sounded as if she was screaming despite the calm tone of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, it was a simple bit of magic to perform. The spell was triggered as soon as he opened the letter I sent.\" said the voice of Hermione Granger. Is what she said true? Did she send Harry a hexed envelope, and why would she do such a thing to one of her best friends? The answers to these questions would soon become apparent as Harry opened his eyes and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding above him at a massive scale was both Hermione and Ginny, who quickly noticed that Harry was now awake. \"Look, Hermione, he's finally up!\" Ginny announced, the two girls getting on their knees to better see Harry on top of Ginny's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here, what happened to me?\" Harry asked, paying close attention to the guilty expressions displayed by the Gryfinndor witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see Harry, we were worried about your safety, now that you know who has returned.\" Hermione began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we talked it over and decided that it was in your best interest that we find a way of hiding you until the Ministry can deal with the situation. Hermione spent the entire summer studying shrinking charms and seals to enchant the letter we sent you. We even turned the inside of the envelope into a Portkey, that way you'd be teleported straight to us safely.\" Ginny continued, hijacking Hermione's explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so our plan from here on is keeping you our person for the rest of this year. Hogwarts is still the safest place for you as long as Dumbledore's around, but shrinking you is an extra measure to ensure your safety.\" Hermione continued, adding on a bit of extra information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone mental Hermione? How can I possibly be safe while I'm this small? I mean, what if someone accidentally stood on me, what then?\" Harry asked, concerned about potentially being crushed underfoot by a normal-sized person walking around the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked Harry, allow me to clarify for you that at this size your body is much stronger than usual. In fact, we fully intend to hide under our feet inside our shoes throughout the term. Nobody would dare look for you between Ginny's toes, or underneath my sole.\" Hermione clarified, horrifying Harry with how casually she could say such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insane, do you really think I want to spend the rest of the year under your smelly feet, Hermione?\" Harry asked, instantly regretting his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\u203d\" Hermione yelled, slamming her open palm on the bed in front of Harry, causing him to bounce backward, landing flat on his back looking into the eyes of a fuming Hermione Granger. Harry had never known her to be so violent before, excluding the one time she punched Draco square in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you know that I practice exceptional foot hygiene, as does Ginny. The fact that you have the nerve to insult us like that utterly ridiculous, I was going to keep you out of Ginny's shoes during Quidditch. But now I think I'll let her use you like some extra padding for her feet during games, see what you think of her feet when they're all sweaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione wait, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...\" Harry began to explain, but Ginny interrupted from behind Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're wasting too much time, let's just grab him and go already. If we spend any longer here, people are gonna start wondering what we're up to. Plus we could be late for the train.\" Ginny stepped in, pulling Hermione back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, okay Harry, since we shrunk you against your will. We decided that you could pick who you'd ride with on the train to Hogwarts. Me or Ginny, who will it be?\" Hermione asked, fully prepared to introduce Harry to her \"smelly\" feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich girl does Harry pick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Ginny, she sits on the bed next to Harry and removes her loafer and sock on one foot, picking up Harry and tucking him away between her toes for safekeeping. Putting both on over him, so he's completely hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Hermione, she slips off one of her shoes and brings it up to Harry on the bed, laying it down with the open end facing him. She tells him to climb in, but she has to give him a bit of a nudge to force him inside before she can wear it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Ginny, Hermione leaves the room, so she doesn't know where on Ginny's body she decides to house Harry. Ginny uses this opportunity to drop Harry down the back of her knickers, so she can feel him under her during the train ride to Hogwarts.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry was now a fifth-year student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry, and with the revival of Voldemort along with leading Dumbledore's Army, our young hero has been forced to improve his talents at a higher pace than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, Harry has begun researching advanced spells, charms, and even potions beyond the skills of even seventh-year students like Fred &amp; George Weasley. Asking Hermione for help in gathering the necessary reading materials, 'borrowing' books she couldn't check out from the restricted section of the school's library at night with the aide of his Invisibility Cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening during the Christmas break Harry decided that he was ready to practice something special, learning how to apparate. The spell seemed simple enough, utilizing a flick of a wizard's wand to teleport them instantly over a great distance but was considered to be a very advanced technique. Similar to a Portkey which transports any number of witches and wizards to a predetermined location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's give this a go then,\" Harry said to himself, ready to attempt apparating for the first time. He planned to transport himself from his quarters in Gryfinndor Tower into the Room of Requirement to greet the students of Dumbledore's army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about the place he wanted to go, picturing it clearly in his mind before raising his wand and flicking his wrist to activate the spell. Then he instantaneously vanished into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process was a rough and strangely jarring experience, but it didn't surprise Harry all that much when he considered the fact that most people vomited their first time. And while he didn't do that, it was taking a considerable amount of time for him to regain his senses after the jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as his vision began to clear and his hearing returned to him, Harry realized that he was not in the right place at all. Unaware that the chamber had a protective enchantment on it that prevented it from being located or teleported into, Harry was forced to reappear in another part of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Harry noticed was a red, white, and pink pair of checkered converse sneakers with cherries and strawberries on them. He'd seen them plenty of times before, and always on the feet of the same student, Luna Lovegood. Only these were much bigger, probably even twenty or more times bigger than Harry himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered how this was possible, did someone cast the engorgio charm on Luna's sneakers as a prank? No, that wasn't it. The room was considerably larger than her shoes. And as Harry's vision began to clear, he noticed other supersized objects around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressers, books, and beds, all build to scale fit for a giant of over three hundred feet tall. But that was impossible. The average adult giant only grew to be somewhere between twenty and twenty-five feet tall. Presented with this information, Harry decided that only one explanation made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>*Boom*</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry turned quickly to see two pale skinned bare feet standing before him, toes scrunching, nails painted several different colors. Looking up, Harry confirmed his hypothesis. His body had been shrunk down, and he was now inside the Ravenclaw dorms looking up at a massive Luna Lovegood as she got out off bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ravenclaw fourth-year stretched her arms over her head, humming a happy tone. Given her scale, Harry estimated that she must have been close to three hundred sixty feet tall. It's no wonder she hadn't noticed him yet, to Luna he was no bigger than a fly at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry thought about running sure. He was a talented young wizard in his own right, and given time he might find out how to restore himself without help. But who would lead Dumbledore's Army in his absence? And what would Cho think if he suddenly disappeared shortly after kissing her? He decided to try and get Luna's attention. She seemed like a kind-hearted girl, maybe a bit naive but he at least thought she'd help him. She could take him to see Hermione or Professor McGonagall, surely they could think of some way to undo what had happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna, Luna! Look, down here!\" Harry yelled, but to no avail. Luna's ears were so far away, his screams for help didn't even register as a squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried jumping up and down, waving his arms in the hopes that the movement would catch her eye. \"Ugh, if only I had my broom!\" Harry yelled frustrated by the fact that nothing was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Luna had finished her morning stretch. Moving on to get herself ready for the rest of the day, even if there wasn't a lot to be done. Luna dressed in clothes she intended to wear the next before going to bed, thus saving her time in the morning in case she woke up late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna began walking forward. Lifting her foot over Harry and creating a gust of wind strong enough to knock the unprepared shrunken wizard onto his back as she passed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>*Boom*</b></font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's foot caused yet another quake as she left Harry behind, taking a step towards her dresser. The blonde witch opening her top drawer only to find that all of her socks had been stolen yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nargles.\" She muttered to herself, when in fact it was her bunkmates that were responsible for stealing her clothes. Luna blamed most instances of bullying on Nargals, either being too naive or too nice to confront her classmates directly. However Luna thought it was strange, Nargals must have really loved feet since they kept on stealing her socks and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, ready to wear her shoes without socks for the tenth day in a row. Will Luna finally spot Harry next to her shoes or will she remain unaware? What happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Luna notices something on the floor next to her sneakers, investigating further too see that it's actually Harry who asks her to bring him to someone for help. Luna then decides to bring Harry to Hermione or Ginny for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Luna sees Harry next to her shoes and assumes that he is a Nargle trying to steal them. Luna acts on this, pressing her foot down on Harry and sticking him to the underside of her sole before she puts her shoe on. Telling him that she will release him when his friends return all of her socks and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Luna remains unaware and Harry must try to climb her and her bed in order to get her attention before she leaves to either go to class or Dumbledore's Army. Anything can happen.</span></div></div>",

Harry's eyes met her gaze as she scanned the floor for her converse sneakers, noticing something rather odd. There was a tiny creature, no larger than an inch tall close to her footwear, small enough to be a fairy or even a pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It couldn't possibly be?\" She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Nargle!\" Luna announced, both surprised and shocked, by this turn of events. She'd finally cornered one of the tricky creatures in her room, and by the looks of things, he was trying to steal her shoes yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Luna! It's me, Harry!\" He yelled, running towards the gigantic blonde witch and waving his arms, trying to get her to examine him more closely. Luna was always so gentle and kind to everyone around her. Which was why Harry was shocked to see her raising her foot into the air to squash him like a cockroach underneath her naked foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ought to teach you a lesson.\" She said, speaking a cold, almost threatening tone. Harry stopped in his tracks as Luna's sole raced towards him, unable to escape without magic he fell to the floor beneath her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Boom*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's foot landed on top of Harry, pressing his back into the hardwood floorboards as she twisted her foot down on top of him. His face forced into the sweaty flesh of her sole after a long night of being under the covers. The petite fourth year ground her foot down without mercy on what she assumed to be a Nargle, while in reality, she was torturing her shrunken friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept this up for a few more seconds before finally lifting her foot off the ground with Harry stuck to her sole. \"Serve's you right, Nargle. I don't care if your body is indestructible, don't expect today to be pleasant. I've finally captured one of you, and I won't be releasing you until your friends return what was stolen from me.\" Luna announced, meanwhile Harry attempted to free himself from her foot flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean by that Luna?\" Harry yelled in the form of a question, straining his neck to speak up towards Luna in the hopes that she could hear him. But it was too late, Luna thought him to be impervious to death and had already decided on harsh punishments for the suspected shoe thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna scrunched her toes, wiggling them about as a breeze of fresh air washed over them. It was cold, but she didn't mind, it was the last time she would experience this for a while as she gazed down at the Nargle, stuck to the bottom of her foot like gum. \"You've done a naughty thing you little thief, and must be punished accordingly. I don't know why you see fit to steal my socks and shoes, maybe for housing and shelter or some other reason, but I'm quite fed up with it now. If you want to live in them so badly, then I would have allowed it so long as I get to use them during the day. Unfortunately, you did ask for my opinion and will now be disciplined, if you little things enjoy the smell of my feet so much then maybe you should just live in my shoes all the time, including  the times where I'm wearing them.\" Luna finished, sinking Harry's hopes of escape as she ended her lengthy statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde Ravenclaw paused for a moment, bending down to pick up her shoes from the floor before sitting on her bed, raising Harry into the air with her foot, giving him a good look around the room to see that they were indeed alone, meaning that nobody but Luna herself would be able to come to his rescue. \"Luna, Luna!\" He continued to yell as loud as he could, only coming across as a squeak to the blonde's ear, a sound typically made by Nargles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind, all your little friends already ran off with all my socks. So, I'm afraid you'll only have my foot to keep you company until your friends return what rightfully belongs to me.\" Luna said sternly, bringing her shoe under her foot, Harry looking down to see a dark moist cave below, her toes drumming on its entrance as the smell up foot sweat rose to greet him. Unable to do anything at all as Luna quickly slid her foot into place, trapping Harry under the sweaty mass of her foot flesh, his back sinking into her worn-down insole, making him think \"What kind of creature would want to steal these sneakers?\" They were at least a year or maybe even two old, dirty, and marred with an eternal impression of Luna's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed him down hard with her sole, ensuring that he could not escape as she tied her sneakers tightly with a double knot only on the shoe Harry was in. Making it hard for him to breathe as she pulled him against her foot by tugging on the laces. Finally giving him some space as she focused her attention on putting on her second shoe. In the end, she felt kinda bad for the Nargle, realizing at the same time that he had to be punished for his transgressions against her. But she also felt sorry for enjoying it so much, the ticklish sensation against her sole was quite pleasant, making her wish that she had a second one for her other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Luna do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Luna goes for a walk around the castle, hoping to get Harry better acquainted with his new life as her insole. Being sure to take a thorough tour of Hogwarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Harry tries to take out his wand to apparate himself out of Luna's shoe. However, Luna twists her foot down on him, causing him to be teleport-ed between her toes as a result of the spell rebounding, losing his wand in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Harry tries different ways to get Luna's attention while she goes to talk to Hermione, who notices something is off when he see's only one of Luna's sneakers are double knotted.</span></div></div>",

No sex for the first through third years Harry and friends attend Hogwarts, feet, vore/mouth, and sitting/back of panties content is fine though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. I know it might sound difficult, but do try your best to keep the characters in character, don't make them act in a way they would never behave. Not to say they have to act completely proper, but please don't jump from one extreme to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Keep chapters over a certain length while being sure to use proper grammar, punctuation, and your knowledge of the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No toilet, scat, or farting themed chapters, I don't care if you're into it. The majority of readers are not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No Crossover content or OC's, not that I have much of a problem with them personally but it makes it much easier to follow up for everyone. Plus it's a better read, in my opinion, most of the time if everyone knows the character they are reading and writing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. You can previously claim a chapter you wish to write and I will make sure it stays that way for up to 2 weeks. Do not write for any chapter marked with \"(Reserved)\" because that means it's already taken.<br>\r\n</td>",
