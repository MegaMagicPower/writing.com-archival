Yeah, I did.\" Hunter said.  \"Why?!?!\" Blitz almost screamed.  \"Urrrrrppp...  Sorry, I couldn't help myself.  I was so hungry.\"  Hunter said.  \"You were hungry?!?!  You are not the only dog in this house that needs to eat!!!\" Blitz exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz was so mad that all the food was gone.  He was soooooooooo hungry, but that was not any food in sight that he could eat.  That is till his eyes landed on Hunter.  'Oh, he looks so tasty with that big gut of his.' Blitz thought.   Wait!  I don't want to eat him.  Blitz felt something near his mouth.  He tried to wipe from his mouth with his paw, but was shocked when he found out it was saliva.  'No this is not real.  I'm not that hungry that I would eat one of my comrades!' Blitz thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one look at Hunter made Blitz's stomach growl.  'Maybe if I get a taste of him then my stomach will stop and realize that he doesn't taste good.' thought Blitz.  Blitz leaned over to Hunter and licked his neck a few times.  \"Hey?!?!  What was that for?\" asked Hunter.  Blitz didn't answer him, shocked by his own revelation.  'Oh my God.  I have to eat him he tastes so freaking good!'  \"Hello?!?!  Earth to Blitz!!!  Anyone in there?\" asked Hunter.  Again, Blitz didn't answer him.  He just pounced on Hunter, and stuffed Hunter's face into his maw.  Blitz swallowed Hunter to his chest then stopped at his massive belly.  'It's going to be a little hard to swallow that.' he thought.  Blitz started slowly swallowing Hunter's belly in.  Inch by inch of Hunter's delicious belly entered Blitz's maw.  He kept the same pace after he swallowed the rest of Hunter's gut.  He got to Hunter's knew, and slowly swallowed Hunter's legs in like noodles.  When Blitz got to his feet, an idea came to him.  He started tickling Hunter's feet.  Hunter started thrashing in Blitz's gut.  Hunter's squirming sent Blitz over the edge, and he came all over the underside of his gut.  After his spasm subsided, he swallowed Hunter's feet in.  The rest of Hunter slowly slid down Blitz till he came to fully rest in Blitz's huge belly.  'God!  He tasted so good, and he is wriggling so pleasantly down there.' thought Blitz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Blitz lost his balance and fell on his back.  He looked up at his enormous globe and started rubbing it.  He kept rubbing it till... *Buuuuuurrrrrrrrrpppppppp*   And with that Blitz fell asleep to digest his big meal...</span></div></div>",

This made Muzzle's stomach growl in anticipation, and his mouth started salvatating.  Muzzle was really hungry, and Blitz looked very appetizing right now.  He decided he couldn't wait any longer for food.  Muzzle started with Blitz's head, slowly gulping the sleeping dog.  Blitz's taste was incredible, and Muzzle couldn't stop licking him.  He got Blitz's neck in and started working his shoulders in.  Muzzle then swallowed his shoulders and chest.  He then started with the swell of Blitz's huge gut.  He stretched his mouth little by little over the dog's mammoth gut.  Halfway through Blitz woke up, and started struggling and shouting.  Muzzle finally finished with Blitz's delicious belly.  Then came Blitz's cock.  Muzzle started licking it like it was a sucker.  He swallowed the dog's sheath which rubbed against the back of his throat and Blitz came spurting warm fluid down Muzzle's throat.  Blitz stopped thrashing for the moment, but he resumed when Muzzle started playing with his feet.  Muzzle then swallowed Blitz's legs, and Blitz entered his captor's stomach fully.  Muzzle's cock started squirting massive amounts of jizz all over the underside of his bulging stomach.  With Blitz's body not constricted so much he started struggling again which Muzzle tons of pleasure.  Muzzle then laid on his ex-comrade's bed, watching his bloated belly squirm and listened to the shouts from within.  He started belching every minute until his stomach stopped squirming and he couldn't hear anything except his stomach gurgling while it worked on his gigantic meal.

He makes it to the door and opens it.  There standing outside the door is his Siberian Husky comrade, Exile, with a huge belly as well.  Both dogs were a little surprised, more Exile then Muzzle.  \"Muzzle had did you get outta your restraints?\" Exile asked.  Muzzle saw Exile's stomach squirming a lot.  \"Oh, oh I just drank a lot of water!\" exclaimed Exile nervously.  Muzzle started to back up, and Exile rushed forward to grab him.  However Exile tripped, and his head landed in Muzzle's mouth.  Muzzle started gulping Exile down.  In went his neck and shoulders.  When Muzzle got to the husky's gut, he didn't to go as slow as he did last time with Blitz since his mouth was already stretched enough to accomodate Exile's mammoth gut.  Within a few seconds Exile was up to his gut in Muzzle.  Muzzle then started to lick Exile's cock like he did with Blitz.  He swallowed his cock, too, and it started spurting down Muzzle's expanded throat.  He finally swallowed up Exile's legs like they were sphagetti noodles.  Exile then fully entered Muzzle's expanding gut.  Muzzle fought to stay standing under the weight of his enormous gut.  He shut the door and locked it.  He then made it over to Blitz's bed and flopped down on it.  When he did that his gut started sloshing like crazy.  If Exile wasn't squirming before he was full out squirming now, and also cursing for all he was worth.  Muzzle then let out a massive belch.  Exile started to slow down, but continued to weakly fight.  Muzzle let out another burp, and Exile stopped fighting completely.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">this interactive is mainly for vore. if you either don't know what this is, or don't like what this is, then leave immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nnow that that is out of the way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthis is an interactive based on doggy vore. in other words dogs are prominent. it can be almost any dog and they can either be pred, prey, or assistant in the vore situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd prefer a dog be a part in most of the vore, even if they aren't being vored or voreing, though, that is not a strict rule, and as long as most vore has the doggies, then I'll permit some other as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nagain, I won't allow female vore under almost any circumstance. if you really want a female character in this, send me an e-mail. also, if you have any questions, send me an e-mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll male-vore is acceptable, but the doggy-door in the title is referencing AV, and it is the one I'd prefer. there is no rule against not using AV, it's just the one I prefer in this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe dogs used may be from any show, though please list the show when putting him down, and preferably a link to  the wikipedia page for the show, if at all possible. also, any dog may crossover into any other show. if the show already has a link on a starting page, then it isn't necessary to make one when crossing over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\noh, and for the sake of quick-referencing, please make the title of chapters where you choose a dog to have the dog's name as the title, in case he shows up elsewhere and other's want to know his show, in case they already do not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsorry for all the rules and guidelines... now, on to the main event!</td>",
