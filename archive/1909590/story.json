However, lately you've run out of tasty gems to eat, so you've been wanting those for weeks now. You're in Twillight's Library again, trying to get Twillight to buy you some gems, without any succes, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But, Twillight..'' you whine, but quickly got interrupted by Twillight. ''Sorry Spike, but I can't get you gems everyday, I don't have enough bits right now, okay?'' Twillight said. ''Then how am I gonna get some gems?'' you mumble. ''Well, if you want those gems so badly, why don't you go look for some work, I'm sure somepony could use some help.'' Twillight replies. Yeah.. yeah! That would be the solution to your problems, maybe if you worked hard enough, you could probably even get a Sappy Sapphire, those things are delicious. ''All right, Twillight! I'll be off trying to help somebody!'' you say, as you run off. ''Don't hurt yourself!'' you hear Twillight say from the distance. ''I'm good, Twillight.'' You say as you slam the door behind you. You suddenly heard the sound of books flying and falling everywhere, with a frustrated Twillight screaming; ''Spike!'' after the noise. Better get outta here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around Ponyville to see if somebody needed some help with something, but no succes. You walk down the road, kicking a stone around when you notice a dashboard with all kinds of notices on it. A certain one catches your eye..</span></div></div>",

You run off to Sweet Apple Acres and hope that they still have somebody they need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came to Sweet Apple Acres, and you knock on the farm's door. You hear somepony coming down the stairs, and opens the door. You notice Applejack standing in the door. ''Oh, hey there Spike! Are you here for Twillight, er' sumthin'?'' Applejack asks. ''Uh, no.. I'm here because you had a job for Apple Picker?'' you say. ''Oh, err.. do ya have Twillight's permission for that? 'Cause I mean..'' You nod. ''Well, all right then, Spike.

You stop, and just walk back again. ''Oh, uh.. heh heh.. I knew that.'' you say, as you walked past her again. Applejack facehooves and mumbles. ''Don't screw it up like last times you tried to help, will ya?'' she mumbles. ''What?'' you ask.  ''Nothing.'' Applejack said as she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran off to the nearest apple field, and you notice Big Macintosh in the field. ''Hey, Big Macintosh.'' you say. You notice Big Macintosh looking up, noticing you. ''Oh hey there lil' fella.'' you hear Big Macintosh say to your surprise. No ''eeyup'' like usual? That's.. strange. ''Uh.. wow, since when are you so talkative?'' you say. ''Oh, err..  eeyup..'' Big Macintosh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that was weird. Oh well. You started picking fruit, and tried to work as hard as possible. You climb into the trees to pick some apples, or to catch all the apples Big Macintosh bucks from the trees. Although a little slow, you did a decent job on it. However, you seem to notice that Big Macintosh is looking this way a lot. It makes you feel like you're doing something wrong. ''Uhm.. Big Macintosh..?'' you say. ''Uh.. wha now?'' Big Macintosh asks. ''You're looking this way all the time, am I doing something wrong?'' you ask. ''Oh, err.. sorry, lil' fella, ya distract me a lot.. I mean.. no, ya're doing a great job, Spikeyb-- err..'' Big Macintosh mumbled. You frown. ''Well, eh.. all right, then..'' you say, as you continued picking fruit. He did seem to be a little distracted. You climb the tree again, and you suddenly slipped and you're starting to fall down, were this trees always this high, by the way?! You suddenly heard galloping. You look to the other side and notice Big Macintosh charging this way, and notice he takes a leap, catching you on his back. You catch your breath again due to being scared off the long drop, and you look at Big Macintosh. ''Th-thanks, Big Macintosh..'' you say, as you lean forward to ''hug'' Big Macintosh. ''No problem, lil' fella..'' Big Macintosh said. You let go of him, and dropped of Big Macintosh's back. ''By the way, Spike. Why are ya doing this job, anyway?'' Big Macintosh asked. ''Well, I ran out of gems to eat, so Twillight gave me the idea to get a job and earn them myself. Why, actually?'' you ask. ''Oh, err.. out o' sheer interest, lil' fella.'' Big Macintosh said. You nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both went back to work until sunset, both chatting and picking apples. ''Oh, looks like it's getting late, lil' fella. Go get ya're reward from my little sister, I'll finish up.'' he says. ''All right, see you tommorow!'' you say. ''Er, Spike, we only needed somepony today. The advertisement showed that, right? One whole week, and today was the last day. '''What..? Oh..'' you said. Well, that seriously sucks.. you seriously liked being around Big Macintosh. You just walked away to get your reward again. You knock on the door of the Sweet Apple Acres farm, and yet again, Applejack opens up. ''Oh, heya there, Spike! What's with the frown?'' Applejack asked. ''Oh, yeah.. I'm kinda sad because I didn't read the advertisement too well, and noticed this is the last day.. and I kinda liked working here with Big Macintosh.'' you say. ''Oh, but Spike, you can always visit us again anytime, ya'hear? Here's ya're 10 bits.'' Applejack said, and handed you the bits. ''Yeah.. thanks..'' you say, as you wandered back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came into Twillight's Library again, and she happily greeted you. ''Hey, Spike. How did it go? Did you get some bits?'' Twillight asked. ''Yeah..'' you say, as you just walked off again. ''Is there something wrong, Spike?'' Twillight asks. ''..nothing..'' you say, as you wander off upstairs to go into your ''bed''. ''Poor Spike.. I wish I knew what was bothering him.''</span></div></div>",

''Ugh, who wakes someone up at this time of hour?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step out of your bed. It didn't seem to wake up Twillight. Better not to wake up Twillight at this time of hour, there's no need to. You walked downstairs to the front door. You open the front door to see noone in sight. You look around for a bit, but you don't see anypony around here.. You look down, and you notice, a basket full of gems! There's all kinds of high-quality gems in this basket for you to eat. You pick up the basket and bring it inside, while you noticed a note inbetween all these delicious gems. You pick up the letter and notice the somewhat sloppy handwriting, you can kind of make it out, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Spike,</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You were a nice fella to work with, and you sure did a good job for a new applepicker. Probably not as fast as us, but it doesn't matter, Spike. Anyway, you seemed very sad about leaving, So I discussed with my sister and decided you could still work with us here if you want. Also, these gems are a gift from me. It wasn't neccesary, but I think you might like them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush. Man, Big Macintosh is such a sweet guy.. You wonder why ladies don't fall for him. And to be honest, you never actually saw Big Macintosh with a girlfriend. You decide to taste one of the gems before coming back to sleep. You take a good gem, lick it slowly so your taste buds could get the maximum taste out of it. After that, you just pop the gem in your mouth, chewed on it and swallowed it whole. Man, that was good. You decide to go back to bed. You go upstairs and stepped into bed to get some sleep again. You simply fall asleep until the next few hours are there.</span></div></div>",

So, I'm probably gonna go there now. You felt that your boner has stopped, so you just jump out of bed. ''Oh, that's great! Don't worry about helping me with the books, I'm fine. Besides, Owlicious is here to help me.'' Twillight said.''Okay then, Twillight.'' you said, as you ate your breakfast and ran to Sweet Apple Acres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at Sweet Apple Acres after some time of running, and still had plenty of energy left.

Maybe she was just not your type.. You even wonder if Thunderlane has any interest in you either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Spike?'' Thunderlane says, also stopping you from spacing. ''U-uh.. y-yes?

You son of a--'' you say mad, but got interrupted by Thunderlane. ''You're flying, Spike.'' he said with an amused tone. As you noticed yourself flying in the air, flapping your wings, you couldn't hold your excitement. ''ALL RIGHT! I'm flying! THIS IS TOTALLY AWESOME.'' You managed to get a lot of attention, though, as many ponies seemed to have caught their attention on you. You could hear all kinds of mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''A dragon in Cloudsdale?

''Relax people, he's not an harmful dragon. He won't eat or attack you.'' As you descended to the ground, ponies started to rapidly form a group closing you in. You got touched and poked almost everywhere by the enthuisiastic ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh my god! He is real!'' ''His tail is real too!'' ''Can you breathe fire for me?!'' ''Show us your flying skills!'' ''Marry me!'' ''Oh, I was wondering how dragon's their hide feel, kind of softer than I thought!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you almost drown in the crowds of ponies, still managing to keep your hand out, you notice someone poking your hand, you decide to hangt onto it, and it pulled you out of the crowd. You soon notice it's Thunderlane. Blushing, as you were practically holding hands. As some pegasus ponies tried to chase you and Thunderlane, but Thunderlane could easily outfly them, and as soon as the crowd lost sight if you and Thunderlane hid in an lone alley. ''Th-thanks, Thunderlane. You really saved my rear there.'' you said. ''No problem.. And about that rea.. err.. rescue, no problem.'' Thunderlane said nervously. You frown, but suddenly notice you're still holding the hoof of Thunderlane, and very firmly too. You quickly release his hoof. ''S-sorry.. I was.. uh.. still in shock..'' You blush, and quickly turn around before he sees you blushing. Thunderlane just frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Anyway. There's too much crowd now, maybe we should train somewhere else?'' Thunderlane says. ''Good idea.'' you reply. ''I know just the place!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you started to discuss with Thunderlane on where to go train flying, you started talking about your life and heard somewhat of Thunderlane's lifestories, and he really seems like a great and nice guy. But the question still runs in your mind, ''Does he like YOU?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Either way, it's getting late, Spikey. Want me to fly you home?'' Thunderlane asks. ''Spikey?'' you think by yourself. ''That would be nice.'' you quickly reply to Thunderlane. ''Good, let's go!'' Thunderlane said, taking off and flying towards Ponyville. ''W-wait up!'' you shout as you fly after him. You both flew to Twillight's Home together. As you land before the door of Twillight, you look up and see Thunderlane. ''Thanks Thunderlane. Want something to drink or something?'' you ask. Thunderlane made a nervous face. ''U-uhm, sorry. I really have to get going, I, um.. need to some.. stuff. But thanks anyway.'' As he flew off on a fast speed. ''I hope I didn't do anything wrong.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock on the door. You notice Twillight opening. ''Oh, hey Spike! How was it up there in Cloudsdale?'' Twillight asks. ''Oh, it was GREAT!'' you walk in, and tell everything to Twillight, except the things about your love interest for Thunderlane, though. ''Wow, that's so neat! Are you good at flying yet?!'' Twillight said, seeming pretty proud of you. ''Well, I  kind of am able to stay mid-air, but I can't really properly fly though. Thunderlane will probably teach me. Sorry to say so soon, but I'm kind of tired, and I want to be fit tommorow to train my wings and flying skills.'' you reply. ''No problem, Spike. Have a nice night of sleep, Spike. I can handle these book organizising on my own.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to bed. But something was troubling you. Rarity. What are you gonna tell her? You're probably going to need to tell her, because lieing to her might end up giving even more trouble. ''Can't worry too much. I need my sleep.'' you mumble, as you slowly fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, he has been ''tamed'', so to speak by Fluttershy, so he won't be any problem. Probably. ''Hey, Discord.'' you say. ''Oh, uh.. hey Spike. You've grown.'' Immeditealy already getting close to you with his snake like body. ''Uh, could you maybe..?'' you ask nervously. ''Oh, right. Sorry. You're probably wondering, why am I here? Well, I wanted to see Ponyville again, and Fluttershy, ofcourse.'' he immediately continues. ''Oh, really now?'' You say, doubting his actions. ''You sure you're not causing havoc?'' you ask. ''Oh, my, certainly not, Spikey~, I don't want to turn into stone again. Besides, I'm better now, you know that!'' Discord answers, with a pretty gentle and trustworthy smile. ''All right..'' you say, lifting your shoulders. ''Well, so where are you headed?'' Discord asks. ''Oh, just to Rarity's house.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord looked up in shock. ''Rarity's house!?'' Discord yells. ''What? What's up there!?'' you ask, worried, quickly stepping into Rarity's house's direction. ''N-no no no! Nothing! Nothing at all! You really gotta stay away from there now. There's nothing wrong, though!'' he says, as he stopped you quickly. ''You're a bad liar, Discord.'' you say, as you slap off the hand that's blocking you. You quickly walk off. ''Spike! Wait!'' Discord yells. You ignore Discord. Rarity could be in danger! You approach Rarity's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity could maybe be trapped! Rarity could be in a fire! Rarity could..<br>\r\nYou look through the window.</span></div></div>",

Rarity couldn't.. she wouldn't.. yet right there.. You guess she didn't love you as much as you did to her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scurried off from the window, noticing Discord standing there. ''I.. I guess I'm too late.'' Discord says. ''I'm sorry.'' You walk up to Discord with tears in your eyes. You just lay your head on his middle half, and let some tears flow, trying to muffle your sadness. Discord looked worried, and rubbed your back gently. ''There, there.. Come on, get yourself together. You're bigger now, aren't you? Don't feel bad about such a..'' Discord coughed, keeping his words back. He seems pissed Rarity did this to you for some reason. ''But, Rarity.. she..'' you look up to Discord, but he quickly silences you by gently putting a finger on your mouth. ''Shh, it's okay, all right?'' Discord says. ''A-all right..'' you say, having calmed down. ''Let's get you home..'' Discord said, as he tapped you on the back and walked back with you to Twilight's Library, while cleaning himself up with a sheep, ofcourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get home with Discord, and as soon as you knock on the door, Twillight immediately opens. ''Spike! Where have you been? I needed you-- Discord?'' she looks up to Discord. Discord shook his head and pointed to Spike. You sniff. ''Tw-twilight.. I wanted to go to Rarity.. but when I looked trough her window, she was.. with another stallion..'' you say. ''Ohh, Spike.. I told Rarity to be more careful..'' she said, as a slip of the tongue. You look up. ''You knew all this?!'' you said, furiously. ''W-well, yes.. Rarity was gonna tell you, but..'' You became even more furious. ''Well then. How about FUCK YOU!'' you said, as you walked away. ''Spike, wait!'' You turned around. ''No! I don't want to see you anymore!'' you said. That stroke Twilight like a bolt in the heart. ''W-well fine! Then stay out!'' she said, as she walked back in and slammed the door shut. You look at Discord, who has an worried expression on his face. ''D-Discord..'' you say desperately. Discord suddenly looked kind of mad, and started mashing on Twillight's door. ''Twillight! Don't just let Spike alone out there! Take him back in and talk it out!'' Discord screams. No response. Discord looked at you and sighed. ''You could come with me to the maze if you want to.'' Discord says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord is suddenly so nice.. has it really been that change that Fluttershy made him like this? He seems passive-aggressive to other people though.. Anyway, you should probably go with him.</span></div></div>",

''All right.. let's go.'' he said, as he walked off with you towards the maze. You both have been quiet for a while, and have just been walking. You wonder why Discord is so protective over you. ''Hey, Discord..'' you say. ''Hm?'' Discord hums at a questioning tune. ''Why are you so protective over me?'' you ask. ''Well, something inside me tells me that I should help you, it's a weird but nice feeling.'' You frown. Whatever, Discord is an unpredictable guy anyhow, so it doesn't matter. You scoot somewhat closer to him. Discord notices, and already put his lion-like-arm over your shoulder, while just walking on. You blush. The arm over your shoulder sure feels nice and protective.. Discord is kind of the only guy you can trust right now. What a surprise, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aaaaand, here we are.'' he said, as he stopped in front of the maze. He quickly makes an entrance to the middle of the maze, puts a roof on the maze and seals off every way into the middle, as soon as you arrived in the middle, that is. You walked to the middle, and you just noticed Discord swinging around his finger so silly. You then arrive at the middle of the room. It looks very organized, like a tiny room. It had an bed, closet, couch, tv, everything. You could see yourself staying here for the time being. You sit up on the couch, turning on the tv and laying back. ''Hey, Spike. Want a drink?'' Discord asks. You look to your side and notice Discord bending over to the minibar, fully revealing his amazingly arousing big ass. You blush. ''Er.. I.. j-just give me a coke, thanks.'' you stutter. ''All right.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your eyes, Discord has such an amazing ass.. he's cute, caring.. wait.. is this the feeling of.. love?<br>\r\nOh god, it is. What are you gonna do? You.. guess you could try to allure him.. or just let it slip.</span></div></div>",

''Hey, Discord.. do you keep your minibar always so low?'' you ask. ''Uh, why?'' You smile. ''You bent over, and I could see everything. Nice ass, man.'' you say. Discord's confused expression quickly turned into an naughty grin, with a blushing face. ''Guess I figured out what emotion I had ith you. It was love.'' he said, and picked you up to start kissing you. You let him steer this kiss, man. What a good fella and a good kisser. You notice he turned himself from you, leaned onto the table with both elbows and bent over to show his ass right in front of you. ''Wh-whoa.. heh..'' you get closer, and started rubbing his ass gently. Discord then used his tail to push you against his buttcheeks, trapping your face inbetween them. ''Gotcha, Spikey~..'' he says naughtily. You smell the smell that comes from the ass, and quickly got an erection from all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ohh, what's this?'' Discord says, as he took hold of your dick. ''Eh, quite small, it could never fit.'' Discord grins, and releases you from his buttocks. ''Shut up.. show me yours then, Mr. Asshole.'' you say. ''Very well.'' Discord says, as soon enough his dick appeared, revealing quite a big dick. ''Uh, wow.. I..'' you say, speechless. ''Heh, yeah. That is my usual reaction. Are you sure you can take this, though?'' Discord said, as he transported you and him to the bed. You lay in an comfortable sitting, with your ass spread. ''Yeah, our assholes are like black holes. Where do you think the princesses go when we carry them?'' you say. Discord burst out laughing. ''Whahaha, heheheh.. yeah, I like you, Spikey~.. you're my type..'' he said, as he began to lick your anus wet, and soon pentrated your asshole with his snake-like tongue. You moan a bit. ''Ahh.. Disc.. this is.. nice..'' you moan. You felt his warm, wet tongue traveling through your anus, licking every spot it could get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Discord took his tongue out. ''My Celestia.. this tastes amazing.. And quite a nice ass as well.'' he said, as he squished your buttocks. ''Squishy squishy~..'' he said, teasingly. ''Heh heh.. stop that. Come on, where's that dick?'' you said, as you crawled further onto the bed, and bent over to Discord. Discord grins, and slowly hotdogged his penis between your buttcheeks, and made it rock hard. Discord stopped after a while, and just slowly stuck his dick inside of you. You grunt a bit, but you can take it. ''There.. slow and easy..'' he said, as he stuck his dick further and further out, making it flexible. After a while, he picked up the speed. You start moaning again. ''Ahh.. Discord.. I love.. you.. harder..'' you moaned. Discord started humping you even faster, and eventually kept at a good speed. ''S-such a nice.. tight ass.. t-this your f-first time?'' Discord asks, gasping. ''Y-yeah..'' you answer. Discord grins. ''N-nice, so you lost.. your virginity.. to the Lord Of Chaos.. P-pretty impressive, i-if I say so m-myself.'' You grin. ''Y-yeah..''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nngh.. All right, Spike.. I'm going to.. cum.. prepare for a good load..'' Discord said. You prepared yourself for the load that came, and you suddenly feel the streams of cum flowing into your anus. You cum also, all over the bed. You felt some cum escaping from outside. Man, it is a massive load. After Discord has been done ''pumping'', he pulls his dick out of your ass. ''Ahh.. D-Discord.. y-you're the b-best..'' you said, as you felt the cum dripping from your anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord grins. ''Well, I want to do one more thing. Do you trust me, and would you want to be with me?'' he asks. ''After all this? Come on, Discy~..'' you say, with your feet swinging in the air. ''All right.'' he said, as he showed you his ass again. ''Oh, so something with your ass? Cool..'' you say, as you close in. Discord, however, began sitting on your face, gently farting a bit. A lot of people would get cockblocked here, however, you loved every bit of it. ''You like that smell?'' he asks. ''Y-yeah.. very much..'' you answer. ''Good..'' he said, as you suddenly closed in to his anus. You felt your nose being sucked into the anus. ''U-uh.. D-Discord?'' you said, terrified. ''Yeeess~?'' he asks. ''W-what are you doing?'' you ask, as you struggle. ''Relax, I'm.. sucking you up into my rear. I thought you might like it. You blush. ''Uh.. well.. I kinda do..'' you say. ''Then, enjoy the ride.. and please keep struggling. It feels amazing.'' Discord says. You struggle as your lord commands, and you hear Discord moaning, along with fapping noises. You felt the warm and smelly anus sucking you up, and soon you were already up his ass with your head. The flesh around you feels amazingly warm and nice. ''Enjoying it in there?'' Discord asks. ''Definitely.'' you say, as you felt the anus suck you in harder. ''Are you enjoying your Spike-edition dildo?'' you ask. Discord laughs. ''Definitely..'' he answers. You start struggling again, but let yourself be sucked up. After a good while of waiting and sucking, your tail was left, and Discord sucked it in with pleasure and ease. ''Ahh.. nice having you in there, Spikey~..'' Discord says. ''Yeah.. However, I'm kind of.. sleepy..'' you yawn, as you soon fell asleep. ''Ah, well, it is kind of late.. Good night Spikey..'' Discord said as he fell asleep on the bed too.</span></div></div>",
