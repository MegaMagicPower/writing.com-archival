If a character plays a vital role in their story, don't kill them. also, the only time it's accepptible to kill yourself is if you're ending the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-no sloppy chapters. Don't write a chapter just to say you made a contribution, actually put work into it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-second person only. this is YOUR point of view, so no third or first person. we want anyone to feel they're in the story, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-there is a way to end the story without death. this story takes paths that allow ending points that don't result in death, you'll see what I mean when you read it. point is, there IS a way to end the story without involving death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat's all for now, enjoy!</td>",
