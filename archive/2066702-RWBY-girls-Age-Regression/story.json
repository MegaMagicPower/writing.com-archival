Weiss discovered many of the pranks that this caped trouble maker made this week, including dying her white hair a vibrant green, buttering the door nobs which took her a hour to wipe off and open, and putting a laxative in Weiss' morning coffee, causing the heiress to almost spoil herself when attending a leader's meeting that <b>Ruby</b> was surpossed to be attending but begged Weiss to go instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Weiss divided to make this girl pay for what she did, And since it was obvious she wasn't responsible enough to be a leader, she has just the right punishment.</span></div></div>",

The blonde boy empties his uneasy stomach at a nearby garbage bin, while Ruby and Yang gaze at the sight of Beacon Academy in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby is initially overwhelmed at the sight of many weapons owned by the other students since her obsession with weapons is usually obvious at the moment .\"Ooh. Ooh. Sis!\" Ruby says to get her attention. \"That kid has a collapsible staff! Ooh! She's got a fire sword.\" Before getting carried away and almost drifting off into her own happy world.\"Easy there, Little Sister. Calm down. They're just weapons.\" Yang comments to Ruby. \"They're not just weapons. Their an extension of ourselves! They're apart of us! Oh, They're so cool!\" Ruby smiles in delight. This has been the first to actually see other weapons other than her's. \"Well, Why can't you swoon over your own weapon? Aren't you happy with it?\" Yang's question caused Ruby to take out Crescent Rose quickly and hug it.\"Of course I'm happy with Crescent Rose. I just really like seeing new ones. It's like meeting new people. But better.\" The 15-year-old said the last part in shame. As if a bit depressed that she doesn't have much friends. \"Ruby, come on. Why don't you go try and make some friends?\" Yang says while pulling Ruby's hood on over her head. \"But why would I need friends when I have you?\" Ruby pulls her head back and stares at Yang as she makes an excuse and runs away with her group of friends from Signal. Running very fast past Ruby, she turns around in a dizzy motion. \"Wait! Where are we going? Are we suppose to go to our dorms? Do we even have dorms? I don't know what I'm doing...\" Left stunned and dizzy by Yang's exit, Ruby falls on a trolley carrying luggage owned by Weiss Schnee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Weiss scolds Ruby on her carelessness, explaining that the content of her luggage is Dust; more importantly, Ruby could have blown them both to bits. \"This is dust mined and purified from the Schnee Quarry. What are you? Brain dead? This is dust! Fire, Water, Lighting, Energy!\" She also points out that Ruby is too young to attend the academy, continuing to criticize her by stating that Beacon is a school to train Hunters to hunt and kill Grimm, and not just an \"average\" combat school intended for sparring and practice, like Signal Academy. After checking on the vials in one of her suitcases, Weiss grabs a vial of purple Dust and slams the case shut, causing plumes of blue and yellow Dust to come billowing out of it. Unfortunately, while she waves the vial in Ruby's face, a large amount of the Dust leaks out. Ruby breathes some in and sneezes, Unknown to Weiss just did as she was weaving in Ruby's face was not regular dust but actually time dust which would make anyone younger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When the smoke clears Weiss looks around for the Red-haired girl to see that she's not there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Until she hears a small noise and looks down, Weiss saw a pile of clothes laying on the ground in Ruby's place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then she notices that there is something moving inside the hood,she then bends down removes the hood to reveal a newborn infant with a small pinch of red hair on her head and silver eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my oum\" said Weiss in disbelief to what just happen</span></div></div>",

Normally Blake would have ignored something like this but she felt oddly entranced, deciding to walk towards it.  She opened up the box and found it was full of diapers, they were rather plain except for a strange brand name she had never seen before.  Being the shy kinky girl Blake is she had always wanted to try wearing diapers but was too shy to actually buy them.  She figured this was her opportunity so she stuffed as many diapers into her backpack as possible.  Blake felt so dirty as she walked around in public with a backpack full of diapers she intended on using.  Back at her dorm in beacon, she sat the bag down and pulled a diaper out, her cheeks couldn't help but redden at the thought of wearing them.  She slipped the diaper on and blushed more at how comfy and warm they felt.  She put her shorts on over it so the diaper wouldn't be noticed, a smile spreading on her face.  She laid down into her bunk, grabbing one of her favorite books and started reading, lightly kicking her legs in the air.  Time had passed and Blake felt the urge to pee, normally she would have raced for the bathroom however she felt her body relax and she peed her diaper.  She sighed, pleased at the feeling, she should've been worried that her body just did that on it's own but the feeling of pissing her diaper was too pleasant for her to care.  Blake's book was beginning to get raunchy as she read on, she found herself blushing more and almost couldn't keep reading, it reminded her of when she first started reading these kind of books as a younger teen.  She brushed it off as added shyness because of the diaper.  She felt herself get wet and moved her hand between her legs and into her diaper, rubbing her pussy lips clumsily.  Usually she was very skilled with masturbating but found she couldn't think of any techniques she had learned.  After an hour of clumsy rubbing and acting like she's never touched her pussy before she managed to orgasm, her body shaking and spasming like she had never experienced an orgasm before.  In the back of Blake's mind she was concerned but the rest of her was fascinated with all the feelings, acting as tho she's never felt them before.  A mental habit Blake hadn't done since she was 13 seemed to come back, talking to herself out loud.  \"I should touch down there more often\"  she said to herself.  Blake had been sucking down water since she started reading causing her to have to pee a lot.  Pretty soon her diaper was full of pee.  Right as Blake got up she felt a pressure in her ass, she had to poop.  She clenched her butt and walked to the bathroom.  She was so close to the toilet when she felt a cramp and bent down.  \"I-I'm pooping!\"  She yelled to herself.  She relaxed and let the crap flow into her diaper.  This caused her slow regression to speed up, her mental age dropping to 8.  Barely remembering how to change herself, she threw away the old diaper and put on a new one.  \"I wish mommy was here, changing myself is so hard\" she whined.  She walked back to her bed, laying down since she didn't have anything else to do.  Her mental age was continuing to decline, playing with her boobs out of child like curiosity.  \"My boobies are so big\" she giggled to herself.  She got bored of that and started sucking on her thumb which kept her happy for awhile.  Blake is lying in bed, curled up and happy, her mental age is close to that of a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's get to the choices shall we?</span></div></div>",

So, with her mind and therefore her soul and aura being younger than her body, the diaper started a new process. It first took control of Blake's bodily hormones (with it already controlling her other bodily functions with her now unaware mind being unable to notice anything wrong anymore), and it gave the message to start reversing Blake's physical growth beyond her current mental age. Blake's aura also started to return to it's minimal and locked state since the mind and soul were technically younger and therefore weaker and untrained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic of the diaper had a sense of humor however. It used those same hormones to cause Blake's breasts to lactate and leak milk which drew Blake's attention due to her being closer to being a young cat faunus and the desire for milk that comes with it. While letting out pleased mewing like a kitten, Blake proceeded suck out each of her 'boobies' milk contents which was in actuality kickstarting the youthening of her body. As sucked and sucked, she didn't notice as she got smaller and smaller, her muscles and well formed curves melting away like ice cream. She didn't notice even as she finally reached being a flat chested 10 year old, the feelings of being satisfied by the milk overwhelmed her senses as she continued to shrink further to a truly chubby and adorable little catgirl the age of 5. She mewls and sighs with satisfaction as she falls asleep in her now much larger cum soaked bunk bed and clothes that she would not be able to fit nor be appropriate to wear for many years yet. She was no longer the fierce Cat Faunus Huntress of Team RWBY with a dark past. She is now just a cute little cat faunus who hadn't ever left Menagerie or even joined the White Fang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being the case..... where does Blake go from here?</span></div></div>",

She noticed that Yang's bed was empty, but presumed that the blonde had got up to be first in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Weiss stepped into the bathroom and Yang was nowhere to be seen, she was baffled. It wasn't like the party girl to get up early. But still being sleepy, Weiss just shrugged it off, hopping into the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was up next, groggily coming to her senses, as she rolled over and fell out of bed. She promptly stood up, and raised her hands in a fighting stance, fully awake now, as if her rolling out of bed had been an attack. This prompted Blake to slowly open one eye, spy Ruby in the middle of the room, and close her eye, falling back asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD MORNING TEAM RUBY!\" The younger girl bellowed, causing Weiss to drop the shampoo in the next room, and Blake scampered up to the top bunk in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUBY! Would you please shut up?\" Weiss demanded, poking her head around the bathroom door wearing only a towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" Ruby blushed, grinning goofily at her partner, who rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... Where's yang?\" Blake asked the other two from yangs bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she'd got up early to study. Smart idea if you ask me.\" Weiss replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you thought that was possible why?\" Blake retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I'm worried!\" Ruby exclaimed. \"What if something happened? She could be in trouble and need our help!\" Before either of the girls could try to comfort Ruby, there was a knock at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid, open up. It's me. We gotta talk. It's about Yang.\" Qrows voice came from behind the door. Without thinking, Ruby swung the door open and pulled Qrow into the dorm, causing Weiss to shriek and slam the bathroom door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Qrow! Yangs missing and we think she's in trouble and needs our help and we have to -\" Ruby was pacified by Blakes hand over her mouth, before the cat faunas let go of the team leader once she'd calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where she is?\" Blake asked calmly, but a hint of worry remained in her voice. Qrow sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls got dressed (while Qrow waited outside) before they followed the old man to Ozpins office. Once there, the three girls were greeted by Ozpin, Glynda, Dr Oobleck, General Ironwoods, and even Taiyang Xiao Long, Ruby and yangs father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad? What's going on?\" Ruby asked. The group all looked uncomfortable, except for ozpin, who was remarkably calm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's yang?\" Demanded Blake, somewhat more aggressive than she had intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here.\" Replied a female voice.

She was still a very attractive woman, with crimson eyes, Jet black hair and pale skin. However, instead of her Armoured combat outfit, she wore dark baggy trousers, and a dark red shirt that didn't cover her whole belly. She also had a black jacket draped over her shoulders, which couldn't be fastened over her belly. Her sword was leaning against Ozpins desk, near where Qrow was leaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ruby.

Right here.\" Raven replied, patting her belly gently. The girls stared in confusion, before ozpin spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would appear that Yang has accidentally used some sort of dark magic that grants the user one wish. However, the effects can be unpredictable. While I'm certain that this magic was used, I have no idea what she could have wished for that would result in this scenario.\" Ozpin explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yang only went missing yesterday! How is Raven already so pregnant?\" Weiss asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like he said, we don't know how this happened.\" Glynda replied. \"Raven showed up a few hours ago and explained the situation, and we knew dark magic was at work after Professor Oobleck ran some tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor.\" The green haired man corrected her, sipping his coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I still don't understand!\" Ruby said, her head hurting from trying to take all this in. \"How do we get yang back to normal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know.\" Qrow answered, before being interrupted by Taiyang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're doing everything we can sweetheart.\" He told his daughter, hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll know more on her condition once Raven has... given birth to her.\" Ironwood explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yangs... in her womb.\" Ruby asked, earning a few nods. \"And when she gives birth... wait, do you mean to say that Yang's going to be born again as a baby?\" Ruby asked as realisation hit her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We think so. Why?\" Taiyang asked. Ruby bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... mentioned something about being my younger sister.\" She told them. \"She said that she wished that she was younger than me.\" Ruby explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be what caused this.\" Glynda said. \"She wanted to be younger than Ruby, so the curse sent her back to ravens womb.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

All of a sudden, fluid began to seep out of ravens trousers, and formed a pool on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's coming.\" Raven managed to get out, as her face turned red and she moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going into labour!\" Oobleck called out, as they helped her to the elevator. \"We must take her to the hospital immediately!\" He stated in his usual enthusiastic tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for me!\" Ruby caller, following them, as the relevant or doors closed. \"She's my sister, I have to be there for her.\" She stated, as she and Qrow joined them in the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss and Blake, still somewhat in shock, we're standing still in Ozpins office, along with Ozpin and Ironwood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your friends mother just go into labour... with our team mate?\" Weiss hesitantly asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yep.\" Blake replied, her face had the same blank look as Weiss's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the hospital, Taiyang held his former lovers hand while she gave birth to their daughter... again, while Ruby and Qrow watched uncomfortably. Glynda had left to update ozpin, while Oobleck had rather been forced out of the room since he wasn't family, and had been harassing the doctors and midwives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several hours of Raven screaming in agony, almost crushing the bones in Taiyangs hand to dust, while Qrow and Ruby had left for dome thing to eat to calm their nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they were called into the room. There was no screaming coming from the door, and they entered to see Raven holding a small bundle of cloth. Approaching it, they saw a baby girl with violet eyes and wispy yellow hair. Yang.</span></div></div>",

The bottle contained a strange purple/pink liquid, which yang thought looked strange. She opened the note, and silently read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear yang, please drink this potion that I made especially for you. I think you'll be pleased with the effects of it. Sincerely, unknown\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang frowned. Whatever it was, it certainly looked strange, yet somewhat intriguing.

She walked over to yang, placed her hands under her armpits, and lifted yang out of bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird, since when has Blake been taller than me?\" Yang thought to herself. Looking at her partner, yang saw that Blake was a lot bigger than her. As though she'd grown several feet overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang...\" Yang looked at ruby, who seemed to have also grown. What was going on? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang... sis... It's going to be ok, you've just... changed...\" Yang frowned, confused, until Blake held her in front of the mirror.

Blake did as her partner asked, carefully putting the two year old on the floor. Yang only came up to just above Blake's knee now. Her hair was shorter, and her clothes no longer fit. Yang tried to walk forward, but tripped over her enormous shirt, falling over and banging her knee on the floor. Of course, as a child, yang felt pain greater, and even just banging her knee caused her to yell, and her eyes began watering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, it's ok. Come here.\" Ruby cooed, trying to comfort her 'big' sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuby, sdop it! Am not a bwaby!\" Yang almost shouted. Ruby backed off.

Maybe we should ask Ozpin, or glynda.\" Blake added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang looked up at her teammates. Whether it was from the potion, the stress, the shock, being in a toddlers body,  or just being overwhelmed by everything, yang suddenly burst into tears. The team stopped looked at her, panicking.

Yang was surprised that she almost yelled.

Oh well, might as well while it's already wet....\" Yang sighed as she let loose once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the hissing noise as she felt a new warmth in her diaper, a warmth that also coincided with her losing more months and pushing her mind further back into her Combat School education when she was just turning sixteen years old. She was thinking how wonderful it will be once she can graduate Signal before she applies for Beacon. It's only been a year since she perfected her babies, Ember Celica, when she was fifteen the year before.

As she put on the new diaper, she thought it strange how the old diaper seemed to be absolutely soaked like she had pissed in it more than once.... and suddenly her mind was filled with new memories where she remembered that she had been down to her last diaper and had come to the store while finding some stuff to celebrate Ruby's upcoming graduation from School. She had gone a couple of times in the last few hours after having a bit too much drink during her shopping spree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt brought her great pleasure to do it and try to hide the fact that she was wearing a diaper and had been wetting it while she shopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was done changing, and went to the sink and mirror to both check her luscious hair and wash up when she looked into the mirror....</span></div></div>",

The diaper's magic was designed to  prevent any customers from noticing anything wrong such as physical discrepancies. Thus, as Yang finally let it go, she also let go of the physical growth she had undergone since being sixteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not too noticeable to the eye unless someone was close enough to her to recognize it, but she had lost a few inches in height (making her around 5' 3\", 1.61 meters), her muscle tone decreased, and her assets decreased in fullness as well. With her body thus changed, she no longer had the muscle memory that she'd developed in her training in that time-frame, and she barely fit her current clothes and bra. She was now close to Ruby's fifteen year-old (current if we're around volume 1 time) size with only two inches and now only about two cup sizes bigger currently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this was done, she looked back up to the mirror without any memory of her previous suspicion, and her memories have changed to her having just gotten the diaper as a sample to try on (the pack she previously bought has disappeared) along with her current clothing (she now has a bag with her with properly fitted clothing. She did however feel the mess she just made and how loose the clothing was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it!, I just got this. Oh well, I know it at least works well, now I just need to buy the pack and put one on before I leave\", Yang concluded. She goes to leave the bathroom before also realizing that the clothes she just bought don't fit her (she mentally hopes that her puppies will continue growing so that she can continue getting all the boys and fit this new bra).

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amber's body was sore all over, as she slowly began to regain her consciousness. The young girl groaned, as she came to, and she opened her eyes groggily. She was in unfamiliar surroundings. What she was looking at was the ceiling, which, along with the walls, was white. She recalled her fight, and deduced that she must be in hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, take it easy kid.\" Amber jumped at the voice. She turned to its source, and spotted the tall dark haired man sitting mere feet away from her bed. She scrambled to sit up, grunting as the pain in her chest and ribs resided. The man seemed to comfort her, which didn't make her less suspicious of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... who are you?\" She questioned. Despite her young age, Amber had learned to adapt to her powers and become more weary of strangers, though some would call her paranoid. As though sensing her tension, the man backed off a bit, leading Amber to believe he could be a friend, but she didn't drop her guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Names Qrow. Qrow Branwen. It's OK, I'm a huntsman, and I know about your powers... Fall maiden. Don't worry, I'm here to protect you, not try to steal your powers like that woman.\" Amber's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's impossible!\" The maiden blurted out. The man who was Qrow leaned back, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently so, since it didn't work.\" He stated calmly. \"She just vanished, and her goons ran away.\" He informed Amber, refreshing her memory. Her paranoia kicked in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know? We're you following me?\" She demanded to know. Qrow simply chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah... but not like that. When we got word that someone was targeting the maidens, Ozpin sent me to look out for you. Good job too.\" Qrow took a swig from a flask in his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ozpin... so this is beacon? I'm in Vale?\" Amber asked, earning a nod from Qrow. He then proceeded to stand up and look out of the window beside Amber's bed. She saw a Raven pirched on a branch on a great tree outside her window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest up now Autumn. Doctors reckon you'll be up and about in no time, but they don't know about your powers. Since they enhance your Aura, I'd say you'll be back to normal in a day or two, and you'll both be fine.\" Qrows eyes widened as he realised what he'd just let slip. Amber glared at him, knowing he'd kept something from her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...both?\" Was all she asked. Qrow turned to her, smiling awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... you and the baby...\" He pointed at her belly. Without hesitation, Amber bolted up ignoring her pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do while I was out?\" She demanded, a serious look on her face. Qrow gave her a confused look, before an expression of realisation dawned on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I - NO! Nonononono! That wasn't what...\" Qrow stumbled over his words, before composing himself. \"Look, I was protecting you. I didn't touch you, I swear. Besides, you're way too young for me. What are you, 17? 18?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what happened, because I don't see how I could be pregnant considering I've never...\" Amber stopped herself, blushing, which made Qrow smirk knowingly. He then sighed, sitting back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ozpin thinks it's something to do with the woman who tried to steal your powers. Apparently she got you pregnant. Don't ask how, because we don't know. Just rest, I'll stay right here if you need me.\" He paused, looking at her. For the first time, sober saw what seemed to be kindness in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kind of tired.\" Amber said, yawning. Qrow nodded, sitting back, as Amber dozed off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She will be in the womb for nine months, as per usual)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness. It surrounded Cinder. She couldn't see a thing. She could hear voices and noises faintly. She could feel, smell, taste. But there was no light. She couldn't move much, though she didn't seem to be restrained at all. The last thing she remembered was trying to steal the fall maidens power, before a flash of light knocked he out and she woke up here a few hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrehaps she'd been arrested, and this was some sort of weird prison. Or prehaps she was in a coma. Or maybe she was dead, and this was hell. No, it was too cosy to be hell. It could be purgatory. Or limbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder tried to move, but her hand hit a soft flesh like wall. Her whole body was wet, and she was submerged in some strange liquid, but she didn't seem to be drowning. She also noticed that she seemed to be naked, and her body had changed too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't seem to have any teeth, and all her hair was gone save for a few patches, leading to velieve she had been imprisoned and tortured, having her head shaved and teeth pulled out. The thought both angered and terrified her. However, her arms seemed shorter, and we're a lot more stubby, like her legs, but they definitely hadn't been amputated or lost. She could feel her fingers and toes, although they were fat like sausages. What's more, her once generous chest was now flat, her breaths nonexistent. She touched her face, which felt big and fat, with no particularly defining features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangest of all prehaps, was a long fleshy cord attatched to her belly. She couldn't feel her bellybutton, and deduced that it was inserted into there. She was unable to pull it out, and her instincts told her that it may be the only thing keeping her alive, so she gave up trying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, Cinder rested, floating in the liquid that filled her prison. As far as she could tell, there was no way out of here. She was surprisingly comfy, at least since there wasn't much room here. There was only enough space for her to be curled up in a ball, her arms and legs tucked in, and the soft walls tight around her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly occurred to her that she needed to go to the bathroom. She opened her mouth to shout to her captors that she needed the toilet, but nothing came out. It wasn't that she couldn't speak, it was as if she had forgotten how to speak. She deduced that she wouldn't need the bathroom if she was dead, so at least that was a plus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly unable to hold it in, Cinder began to urinate into the fluid surrounding her. She felt unbelievably shameful, thinking that someone was purposefully trying to humiliate her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling tired, Cinder closed her eyes - despite being in pitch darkness - and slowly dozed off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

For a second, she was almost sad that he had left, until the curtain was pulled back to reveal him standing there with a woman wearing a white coat. A doctor she presumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe introduced herself as Doctor Gale, before asking Amber a series of questions like \"how do you feel?\" \"Do you remember what happend?\" And \"Are you in any pain\". All the while she was jotting down her answers, while Qrow was stood by the wall, watching over the maiden. The doctor finished her questions, thanking Amber. She turned to Qrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the father of the baby?\" She asked him. He snapped out of his trance in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- hell no! I'm old enough to be her dad got crying out loud!\" He chuckled, shaking his head. The doctor seemed concerned, and amber wasn't amused either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who the father is?\" Doctor Gale asked Amber. She looked at her, mouth hanging open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no...no, you see, I don't know how this happened. It's just that I've never...\" She paused, glancing at Qrow uncomfortably. He was looking away, pretending not to be paying attention. She guessed he was trying to make her less uncomfortable, which she thought was nice of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I've never has sex. I'm only nineteen. Maybe the ultrasound was wrong. Is there any other tests you can do?\" She asked. The doctor gave her an odd look, as she realised how stupid it sounded, to say she was a 'pregnant virgin'. Amber's face glowed a shade of red, before the doctor answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can arrange to have a DNA test. But if that's all, you seem to have healed at an alarming rate, and should be good to go whenever you'd like to leave. Although you'd better still rest up for a few weeks until your better. And make sure you stay healthy for that baby.\" She stated, smiling at the girl. Amber thanked her, and she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked down at her belly. It was flat, but wouldn't stay that way for long. Soon she wouldn't be able to fight, or do much for herself. She'd need some here to stay. Especially with people after her power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hands on to of each other on her belly, rubbing it gently, as it dawned on her that there was a human growing inside her without a father. Just then, Qrow put his hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her, Imma look after you kiddo. You're safe while I'm around.\" He smiled. She guessed he was being sincere, but it was hard to take him seriously when he was drinking from that flask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" She spoke, almost under her breath. She looked up into Qrows red eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qrow... I'm scared.\" She said. She wasn't going to cry, but she was biting her bottom lip and squeezing Qrows hand with her right one, while her left rested on her belly. Qrow touched her head, staring back into her big brown eyes. Truth be told this was the first time he thought about how attractive she was. Short hair looked cute on her, and her flawless dark skin was softer than anything he'd felt. He hadn't paid much attention  to her body, but her face was strong, yet full of innocence and the stubbornness of youth. He kissed her forehead, earning him one of her adorable blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But you don't have to be. As long as I'm here, no harm will come to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was released from the hospital that day. Qrow told her that he had a friend on the island of patch that she could stay with. Another huntsman named 'Taiyang Xiao Long'. He supposedly trusted this man, and oddly enough, Amber found herself trusting Qrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they left the hospital, Qrow told her that they'd be meeting with Ozpin to discuss the incident tomorrow. Ozpin had given her time to rest up before then, which she was grateful for. Amber and Qrow headed to Taiyangs home on patch on an airship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived about midday, giving them half a day of rest and another half day of sleep before meeting Ozpin. Before they arrived, Qrow mentioned that his friends had two daughters, aged 15 and 17, names Ruby and Yang. They were both going to attend beacon soon, and excellent future huntresses. Amber looked forward to meeting the two young women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the house, and Qrow opened the door.</span></div></div>",

He looked to be in his forties, and although he wasn't particularly unattractive, Amber didn't like how forward he was. Nevertheless, the tried to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I'm Amber. I don't know what Qrows told you about me...\" Her sentence trailed off, as she looked at Qrow. Tai did the same, Amber noted that he didn't seem to like Qrow, glaring at him, although he didn't say anything. The maiden wondered why Qrow had taken her to stay with a man who didn't like him, but assumed he had his reasons. It was a good hiding spot at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Tai were on a team together at beacon. We've known each other for years.\" Qrow explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, sit down.\" Tai said, as though Qrow hadn't even spoken. \"Can i get you a drink, anything to eat?\" He asked her. Amber was about to politely refuse, but she realised she was in fact starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... sure. Just water please. And a sandwich.\" She smiled at Taiyang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what kind? Ham? Chicken?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just cheese salad is fine, thank you. I don't eat meat.\" Amber explained. Tai went into the kitchen to make it. Amber sat on a sofa in the middle of the room facing the TV. Qrow apparently decided not to sit, instead deciding to lean against the wall by the window. The two remained silent until Taiyang returned with Amber's drink and Sandwich. She thanked him, before quickly taking a bite. Before long she had cleaned the plate, unaware of how hungry she really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure put that away fast. Guess hospital food ain't so good, huh?\" Tai commented as she nodded, taking a drink of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she is eating for two.\" Qrow retorted. At this Amber gasped, suddenly reminded that she was with child. She dripped her half empty glass, which smashed on the wooden floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, It was an accident!\" She explained, standing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. It's fine. It's just water.\" Tai explained. He grabbed a dustpan and brush, and swept up the mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Qrow said, awkwardly avoiding eye contact. Suddenly, a blonde teenage girl hurried downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard glass. Is everything alright?\" She asked. She wore jeans and an orange tank top, which left little of her ample chest and perfect figure to the imagination. Amber had to admit that she was a bit jealous of this girls looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine, Yang. Where's your sister?\" Tai said to the young woman. Amber recalled that Yang was the older sibling of the two daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby's out with zwei. Probably be back soon.\" She said. She turned to Amber. \"Hey. I don't know you, do I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm Amber.\" She introduced herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm Yang.\" The blonde said, almost flirtingly, though she had only meant to be friendly. Just then a shorter girl with a red cape burst into the room, exclaiming that she was home, as an adorable Welsh corgi rushed in, muddying the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUBY!\" Tai explained. \"I just cleaned!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Sorry dad!\" She said, turning to look at Amber. \"Hi! I'm Ruby, yangs sister.\" She stated, holding her hand out. Amber shook it, startled by this girls upbeat attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber.\" She replied. Qrow and Tai explained that she would be staying there while the two girls were at beacon and the two men were on missions. They didn't mention about the maidens, although they told the girls that she was pregnant, and that's why she needed to stay somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll probably need some new clothes.\" Yang pointed out, referencing Amber's tattered clothes. \"Don't worry, I've got loads of stuff you can borrow that I'm not taking to beacon with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! You can borrow some of my stuff too!\" Ruby exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I'm sure Amber would rather buy her own clothes.\" Taiyang stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the offer though.\" Amber thanked the girls. The five of them talked for a while, before the girls headed to bed, as they were going to beacon tomorrow. Taiyang explained that he was on a mission too, and would be leaving for at least a few weeks tomorrow. However, he was generous enough to leave Amber one of his credit cards so that she could buy food, clothes and whatever else she needed, before he too went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just me and you now.\" Qrow stated. There was an awkward silence. Finally Qrow spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm going on a mission too. Gonna head off in an hour or so.\" He paced around the room, while Amber sat on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best of luck.\" Amber wished him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want I could stay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber froze. She had her suspicions, but now she knew this guy - this man who was probably nearly thirty years older than her - was coming onto her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she respond?</span></div></div>",

She could tell he was half joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth be told, I'm not really into guys at all.\" She stated, hoping that would cushion the blow a bit, and he'd know it wasn't personal. It took Qrow a minute to get what she meant, until he suddenly realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh...so you're...?\" Amber nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. So you like...?\" Another nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sorry bout all that then.\" The two laughed it off, and she wished him hood luck on his mission, and he left. Amber realised how tiring pregnancy really was, as she yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiyang had been kind enough to give her his king sized bed, while he slept in the spare bedroom. Amber fell asleep rather quickly that night, despite her condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the night, she had dreams about the child. What it would be like. If it would be a boy or a girl. One dream in particular she had a baby boy that looked just like Qrow, and he turned out to be the father. Another she had a girl who inherited her powers, and there were two Fall maidens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in one dream, she gave birth to a beautiful girl, only for her to be taken away by the woman who attacked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke with a start. It was only four o'clock, and she decided to go back to sleep. </span></div></div>",

She walked, barefoot to the window and drew the curtains. It looked to be already midmorning, probably about nine o'clock. She washed herself and got dressed, before heading downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning. You sleep well?\" Taiyang asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you.\" She replied. She sat at the table, and Taiyang sat in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls have headed to catch the airship to beacon. It's their first day.\" Taiyang explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe talked to Tai for a while, mostly about her stay at his place. He told her that she could do whatever she wanted, make herself at home, as long as she didn't 'tear the place down' while he was away. He'd be back in about six weeks to see how she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I didn't realise it was that time already.\" He said. \"I'd better get going.\" Before he left, he gave Amber his scroll number, as well as a few numbers she might need as well. Amber spotted Ozpins number, and remembered that she had a meeting scheduled with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Tai said. \"Qrow called. He was already debriefed by Ozpin. Said he didn't want you to worry about getting too worked up, and told me to tell you to relax.\" Amber was grateful that she didn't have to go. It had been months, maybe longer, since she'd had a day to just relax. She was usually fighting or helping others - it was going to be a boring nine months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thanked Taiyang for his kindness, before he left, and Amber was alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating breakfast, Amber looked down at her clothes, and saw what yang meant. They still looked good, but they were Dirty and a but torn, and since she had nothing else, she'd have to find some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could go out and buy some clothes, but she wanted to relax today. After smelling her clothes however, she decided she'd have to change today. She remembered Yangs offer for her to wear some of her clothes. The girl was only two years younger than her, and they were about the same sizes, except for yangs much more generous chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she go and buy new clothes, or try on yangs outfits first? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amber decided against going out today, choosing instead to see if see if yang had left anything for her to wear. The maiden headed upstairs, before realising that she had no idea where any of the rooms were in the house. After a minute of looking around, she found what appeared to be Yangs room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't untidy, unlike Amber had imagined for a teenage party girl. A few messy patches, but her room was mostly clean and neat. Her bed was under the window, with a table beside it. She had a set of shelves left of the door, and as Amber walked further in, she spotted a desk opposite her bed. In the back left corner, facing the desk, Amber found Yangs wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but feel like she was snooping - an invasion of privacy. But the girl had invited her share her clothes, and with Yang gone, there wasn't much more she could do that was as invasive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber quickly headed for the closet doors, finding a note attatched to the front. She took it, and read what yang had left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey. Hope you find all you need. Call me if you need anything, or just want to talk.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   -  Yang    X<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a number written at the bottom of the page, which she presumed to be Yangs. Amber smiled at her thoughtfulness, though was confused by the kiss left on the note. She was sure it was just a friendly gesture, however, maybe the blonde had been flirting with her last night... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber placed the note on the desk, before opening the wardrobe, revealing that it was packed full of various outfits, shirts, jackets, jeans, skirts and much more. The girl was in no rush, and decided to try a few outfits on. She noticed a long mirror next to the desk that she could use to check herself out in. Settling on her first outfit, Amber stripped to her underwear and dressed herself in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the mirror, she saw herself in a white tank top with a logo on it. She wore a brown bomber jacket that was open, and a short skirt, that barely covered her, leaving little of her legs to the imagination. That was, what wasn't covered by her knee high brown boots, which had tall heels, making Amber stumble clumsily as she walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably best not, what with the baby.\" Amber told herself aloud, taking off the outfit. Besides, the shirt was made to hold yangs huge E cup breasts (she had seen her bra lying around) and appeared baggy on Amber around that area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed the silly outfit, before picking another one instead, changing into it. She managed to fit the plain grey t-shirt without trouble. However, when it came to the skinny jeans, Amber had trouble fastening them. The cause of the problem - her big round butt, which didn't fit in the jeans. She looked up at the mirror, seeing the jeans zipper just an inch or two away from closing, but her panties showing through the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to ruin yangs jeans, she took them off, before realising something - she only had one set of underwear. Hoping she wasn't crossing the line, Amber located and opened Yangs underwear drawer. Her panties were all folded neatly in the drawer. They all looked rather comfortable and attractive, and Amber was embarressed to admit that she was a little excited to try them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching for a bit, careful not to mess up her underwear, Amber found the something different. Unlike all of yangs other underwear, this was much more mature. The maiden picked up what was a black, lacy thong, holding it in her hands. She was shocked that Yang would have something like this, but suddenly Amber's head was filled with images of the blonde woman wearing this with a matching bra, her toned body making Amber blush. She rid her mind of those perverted thoughts of a younger girl, but since she was looking for some underwear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Amber could realise what she was doing, she had slipped into the thong, and was admiring her otherwise naked lower half in the mirror. She felt like there was nothing there, with only a thin layer of cloth between her privates and the rest of the world. She turned her body, and saw how her bubble butt was complimented by Yangs underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was unsure if this was innspropriate or not. The girl was only two years younger, and she had said to help herself to her clothes... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since she was short on clothes, Amber decided to keep the thong on. She was sure that Yang wouldn't mind... probably. Luckily, she had no reason to ever find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber decided on an outfit, putting on a cream coloured t-shirt with a brown leather jacket, along with a dark brown skirt that was longer than the least one had been, coming down to the middle of her thighs at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe admired herself in the mirror, and decided that due looked pretty good. She jokingly posed a couple of times, and laughed at herself, before tidying Yangs clothes away and shutting the closet door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure what exactly to do, the fall maiden decided to explore the house she'd be staying in for almost a year. Closing Yangs door behind her, Amber walked across the hallway. She recognised Taiyangs door, having slept in there. There was a door to her right she hadn't been in. Opening it revealed ruby's bedroom, her bed against the wall, and a wardrobe, desk and shelves like Yangs room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered, there was a loud barking sound, which startled Amber, who almost fell over in shock. She spun, ready to fight the intruder, only to see the cute little dog she'd seen yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. What your name?\" Amber smiled, kneeling in front of the dog. It seemed to like her, resting it's front two paws on her lap. Amber glanced over at where it came from, spotting a dog bed and bowl with the word 'Zwei' written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your name's Zwei?\" Amber asked the dog, as if it'd answer her. Recognising his name, the dog got excited, wagging it's tail and barking enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Amber.\" The maiden said. \"I guess we'll bale housemates for the next few months. What follows you think of that?\" She continued talking to the dog. Zwei looked confused, before barking, and he jumped up and lucked Ambers face between her jaw and her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Zwei!\" Amber laughed, standing up and wiping the dog spit off of her face. Feeling less lonely, Amber decided to take zwei outside. She let him downstairs, and he enthusiastically sprinted out the door. Heading out, Amber made sure to grab the key so not to lock herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a seasonal maiden, Amber thrived in the outdoors. Nature had always been her natural habitat, and controlling it meant the world to her. Using her powers, she lifted a stick out from under a pile of leaves, and tossed it far away, prompting zwei to sprint after it. Before long he was back, dropped the stick at Amber's feet and waited. She threw the stick, further this time, and a panting zwei ran after it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sunny day, and Amber decided that she deserved to relax for a while. She played fetch with zwei for a while, before heading in to grab some lunch. Seeing her go inside, zwei ran into the house, his filthy paws muddying the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, zwei!\" Amber ushered zwei away, while she grabbed some cleaning products from the kitchen and cleaned up the mess, before sitting down at the table to eat lunch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was now nine o'clock. Amber had just finished her dinner and washed up the dishes, before putting zwei back in ruby's room to sleep. She'd had a rather long day to say she was simply relaxing, which wasn't to say it wasn't the most fun she'd had in a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had decided to take a bath. It had been so long since she'd had a long, relaxing bath. She usually only showered, and on the occasions she did bathe, it was normally anything but tranquil. Amber had located the bathroom earlier, as she made her way to it upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed at the enormous bath. It was built into the corner of the bathroom, with a shower to the right of it, and the toilet and sink adjacent to each other on the opposite wall. The bathroom was a large one, meaning that there was room for a spacious bath. She estimated that she could fit herself in there three times over and still have plenty of room. She turned on the taps, allowing the tub to fill with hot water, while she undressed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped out of her skirt, and pulled her shirt over her head, before unhooking her bra at the back, and sliding yangs sexy underwear off. She stood in the bathroom naked, looking in the large mirror on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was an attractive young woman. She had plenty of curves, particularly her big bubble butt, though her breasts weren't unappealing to the eye either. Her dark skin was toned, and she'd built up a strong muscular frame through all her combat, though this was hidden by her feminine body shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was attractive, though her body was riddled with marks and scars from her previous battles. Ones that had become permanently before her Aura had fully healed the injury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her abdomen, just below her left breast, was a scar where a bandit had sliced deep into her flesh when she was only a young teen. Another scar made its way from her left shoulder and down the back of her arm, where a swordsman had snuck up behind her, almost taking her appendage. Another scar decorate the inside of her right thigh, where she'd been hit when an archer tried to take out her horse, while another ran along from her hip bone to her ribs - one that she didn't seem to remember recieving, but had been there for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed her hair back to look at her right ear, where the earlobe was slightly but not noticibly mangled from a time before she was a maiden, when a man who had messed with the wrong little girl came close to cutting her throat, only to catch her ear instead as her was pushed to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was a short scar in the centre of her back, where cinders arrow had come inches away from piercing her heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber chuckled, as she realised that she'd probably have to add stretch marks to her list of scars by the end of the next nine months. She rubbed her hands over her flat belly, wondering what it would be like when the baby was ready to come out. She imagined what it would feel like, how heavy she would feel, how fat she would get, how tired she'd be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bath was almost full of water, as she turned off the taps, before stepping in. The water was hot, but as a maiden, she didn't mind, as steam filled the room and coated the mirror in condensation. She lay down, letting the bubbles and the water swallow her, as she sank into the bath. Her whole body below her neck was submerged, as she felt relaxation wash over her. Deciding to fully enjoy the bath, Amber sunk her head under the water, so that she was fully submerged. Her powers granted her an extention on how long she could hold her breath underwater, allowing her to enjoy the relaxation of being surrounded by hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber resurfaced, breathing again, as she pulled her hair behind her. In the weeks leading up to her assault, she hadn't had a chance to have it cut, and it was getting longer than she'd like, reaching almost past her neck. She'd have to go out and have it cut at some point. Surely there was a town nearby with a hairdresser on patch - she didn't want to go all the way to Vale just for a haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maiden enjoyed her bath for what felt like an Eternity, all the stress and tension in her mind and muscles had melted away. She checked the time, realising she'd been in the bath for well over an hour. She giggled to herself, pleased that she didn't have anything to do but relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out the bath, letting the water out while she dried herself with a towel. There was a red dressing gown on the bathroom door, presumably ruby's. She reached for it, and put it on, it just about covering her privates, and leaving her long slender legs on display. However, an idea occurred to her, which she debated in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could go nude. She was living here alone, and Taiyang didn't have any neighbours, so nobody would see her. She could easily wander the house naked without being caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber wondered where that idea had come from, having always been a sensible and rational woman, she was having strange and rather naughty thoughts lately. Prehaps it was something to do with the pregnancy... </span></div></div>",

Besides, ruby's dressing gown barely fit her, so she'd be practically naked from the waist down even if she did wear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber wandered out of the bathroom naked, as the cool breeze tickled her body. She sauntered downstairs in her birthday suit, her feet on the warm carpeted floor. She sat on the sofa, curled up with a blanket over her while she watched TV. Perhaps she would have been better with clothes on... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut bring nude just felt right! Something told her it was because she was a seasonal maiden, that she was more comfortable in her natural appearance, she'd simply never had the luxury to experience this before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, Amber felt tired, yawning. She turned off the TV, and headed to 'her' bed. Her first day of pregnancy was a breeze. She just wished she could be like this forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMEANWHILE - CINDER (IN THE WOMB)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder was getting frustrated. She had thought up several possibilities for her situation, but each one had flaws or inconsistencies, meaning that she had no idea where she was. Or at least, she didn't want to admit it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, it had occurred to her that the place she was was a woman's womb. It wasn't entirely unbelievable. It would explain the tube going into her belly as an umbilical cord, and the liquid she was in would be amniotic fluid. It all made perfect sense, except for one part - HOW ON REMNANT DID SHE GET HERE? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, she knew it was true. If so, that would mean she had nine months of this torturous bore to endure. It wasn't so bad though. It was actually rather relaxing. She found that she could get used to this, the more time she spent in there. There were many questions Cinder had, but one that stumped her, that she couldn't even guess at, was WHO was carrying her in their womb? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Six months. Six months Cinder had been in the belly of a woman she didn't know the identity of. And she still had three more to go. Of course, with no way to tell the time, she had no idea how long she'd been in here. She estimated between 20-30 weeks, but had no idea. Plud she seemed to sleep and wake up as her body saw fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, the belly had expanded a bit, which meant she had more room to... float, in... which was kind of a positive. What's more, she hadn't eaten in all this time, so with the umbilical cord confirmed, she could verify that she was inside a woman's womb. She had thought at first that it was good that she knew where she was, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA WOMB? HOW THE HE'LL DID THIS HAPPEN? And when her nine months was over, she wouldn't be free. She'd be a baby! She'd be someone else's baby, with her own thoughts, her own personality, but the body of a Damn baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts turned to her own daughter, as they did every time she was awake. Cinder had been a criminal, evil, cruel and all that. But she loved her own daughter more than life itself. She was barely an adult, only 17, and should still be in school, except she had insisted on joining her mother in her work with Salem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo had always been a quiet girl - mainly because she was mute - but for another reason too. See, because of her being mute, she never made any friends at school. She was often teased and picked on by others, and she had some rough years growing up, to put it lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut ever since Salem had accepted her into their organisation, she had a huge confidence boost. Not everyone had liked her being there at first, her only being 14 at the time of her joining. But after she proved her worth, demonstrating how efficient she worked, and how, despite not being able to communicate verbally, was fiercely intelligent, cunning and devious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer joining was not without sacrifice of her mentality though, as she developed a huge sadistic streak, finding pleasure in the pain and humiliation of others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite this, Cinder loved her daughter with all her heart, and would fight with all she had to see her again.

During her pregnancy, she had lots of time on her hands, and learned a great many skills, including how to bake. She had decided to make a chocolate cake for when Ruby and yang came home to celebrate their team progressing from the qualifiers in the Vytal festival tournament, to which Ruby suggested they have a party. They had invited some friends, as well as Taiyang, Qrow and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was looking forward to seeing Ruby and Yang again. She'd seen them a few times, when they came home some weekends, or when she went into Vale to meet with them and gang out. She placed the cake on the table, before stepping back and rubbing her belly. She has started growing a few months ago. Her belly had swollen out, and was looking very pregnant now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been nervous about how she would look, thinking she'd get fat once the pregnancy progressed. However, she found that most people thought she looked rather cute while pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiyang had come home after a month, and she had been living with him for five months since then, with him leaving for unspecified timed every so often for work. She had joked that she was like a housewife, to which Tai laughed, stating that he didn't need another wife yet. Even Qrow had promised to be back in Vale for team RWBY's first tournament fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had even got a new hairstyle, her dark brown hair was now cut shorter, so it was like a short haired bob at the back with bangs at the front. She didn't like it at first, but yang said it suited her, which caused her to keep it, and it eventually grew on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's pregnancy wasn't easy. She suffered terrible morning sickness, and found herself eating much more than usual, which wasn't saying much considering her nomadic lifestyle. In fact, despite her expanded belly, Amber still managed to pack on a few pounds, particularly around the hips and legs. It was barely visible, but she noticed it, though didn't mind. She was pregnant, after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Amber was busy homemaking with Cinder in her womb, cinders daughter, Neo, had infiltrated beacon, along with emerald send Mercury. She had taken her mothers place on their reconnaissance Misson, and was in charge of the two, though they hadn't taken kindly to the fact that they had to take orders from someone a few years younger than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, they'd had to learn sign language to allow Neo to communicate with them. Emerald had given up before long, so Mercury had to tell her what Neo was saying, making communication between the two girls only half possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next big struggle had been adjusting to Neos methods of handling problems. While Cinder was patient and calculating, striking at the right moment, Neo was ruthless and somewhat unpredictable. Nevertheless, Neo had kept both Roman and the white fang under control, while she and the others worked their way towards the Vytal festival finals, where their plan would come to a climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury had taken to liking Neo, and admired her skill and cunning, whereas Emerald seemed to be jealous that she was the daughter of Cinder, a woman she considered to be the mother she never had the chance to know. Regardless, Emerald obeyed Neos every command, same as Mercury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerald had just returned from 'running an errand' as neo had instructed her, and entered her dorm room. She saw that Mercury was laughing, presumably about something neo had said - or rather, signed - to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot.\" She though to herself, without speaking. \"Can't he tell she's just playing with him?\" Mercury ignored emeralds entrance, seemingly entranced by Neos almost hypnotic multicoloured eyes. However, Neo greeted emerald, waving and smiling sweetly at the girl, who grunted in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's got your panties in a bunch so bad?\" He chuckled, acknowledging her presence, while Neo pretended to stifle a fake laugh. Emerald presumed this was some sort of game Neo played with guys when she was bored. To make them fall for her, but they could never have her. It wasn't even like she was that pretty. Yeah, she was cute. Cute like a puppy or a kitten, but Emerald was more physically attractive, right? Or was short, silent and irritating what guys were after these days? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing other than the usual.\" The green haired girl replied. \"If you guys don't mind I'm gonna go to bed.\" Neo looked at the clock, and saw it was almost ten o'clock. She signed over to Mercury, who just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Emerald asked him. He frowned at her, before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she was about to do the same. Come to think of it, I might too.\" He stated, yawning. Emerald walked into the bathroom, and began to change into her pyjamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo watched through the open bathroom door as the girl undressed down to her underwear, before taking that off too. Mercury couldn't see from where he was sat, his back against the wall with the bathroom door, but Neo was on the opposite side of the room, and had a clear view of Emerald naked form. Emerald then saw through the reflection in the mirror, Neo starring back at her. Neo wasn't phased, and as soon as she did, she smirked, winking at emeralds reflection and blowing her a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerald slammed the door shut, startling Mercury, while Neo heard her muttering, making out the words 'freak' 'pervert' and 'Psycho'. Neo agreed with her on two of those. Sure, she wasn't ENTIRELY mentally stable, but who really is? And so what if she appreciates seeing men and women naked? It's not like she was attracted to Emerald, and she wasn't hurting anyone. But she didn't think that made her a freak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Neo was a perfectly normal girl, who just happened to have a perfectly innocent passion for homicide and anarchy. </span></div></div>",

Mercury swapped places with her, as he headed into the bathroom to change. Sharing a dorm with a guy meant that they had to dress in the bathroom, although Emerald wouldn't have been comfortable changing around just Neo. Or Cinder for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo was watching emerald, who looked uncomfortable to be left alone with this strange girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to shower?\" Emerald asked the girl. Neo shook her head, and signed that she preferred to shower in the morning, though Emerald didn't understand her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" She replied. Neo signed something else to her, and looked like she was waiting for a response. She knew emerald didn't know sign language, and was just trying to piss her off. And it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? What the fuck? I don't understand you!\" Emerald sighed. Neo shrugged. She stood up, and removed hrs coat, then her boots, then her shirt and pants. When she got to her underwear, she didn't hesitate, and unhooked her bra and dropped her panties. She coughed to get emerald attention, though wasn't looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerald glanced over, and saw Neo, naked in front of her. Her breasts weren't extremely small. Maybe only just a C cup. Her skin was white, I'm contrast to emeralds, and her hair flowed down her back like silk. She had a small waist, and rather wide hips for a girl of her stature, and a small but round ass atop her strangely long smooth legs for her height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played with emerald, who fell into her trap. As she bent over, pretending she couldn't find her pyjamas, Emerald got a long good look at her cute round butt, as she subtly shook it in front of her. Emerald had never looked at girls like this before, but there was something about Neo that was hypnotic. Entrancing. Seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she snapped out of her trance, and realised that if she could hypnotise people, she must have done it to Mercury. No, that was silly. Neos semblance wasn't hypnotism. Could it be that people obeyed her simply because they were attracted to her. It would explain why Adam Taurus had agreed to ally with her, even without falls power after Neo had suggested that she and Adam have a 'private talk'. Emerald realised what was happening, all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo was trying to push Cinder out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf her mother ever returned, Neo would lose the status she had attained. But if she seduced all of her mothers subordinates, Cinder would have nobody to lead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't seduce me so easily, you bitch.\" Emerald spat at Neo. The shorter girl stood up straight, and faced emerald, still naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what game you're playing.\" Emerald continued. \"You're trying to take over from Cinder. Do you even care where she is? Do you even want her to come back? Did you ever love your mother?\" Emerald cried out at Neo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Neo react? </span></div></div>",

She then approached Emerald, and the two girls starred at each other, faces inches away. Neos naked body was almost touching emerald, as she smiled into the girls crimson eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning or hesitation, Neo spat in emerald face, before she slapped the girl hard, who let out an abrupt scream as she fell onto her belly on the floor. Emerald tried to get up, but Neo had straddled her back. Grabbing a fistful of jade hair, she yanked the girls head back, who whimpered at the fresh pain on her scalp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo grabbed her parasol with her free hand, and flicked open the blade at the end of it, pointing the weapon into emeralds eye, as though threatening to cut it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by that. I'll do what you say.\" Emerald pleaded, getting the message, though she was more cautious than actually afraid, and above all, angry. She turned red, embarressed that she'd been taken down so easily by this girl, and pretended to struggle under Neo to satisfy her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo knew it was an act, but it pleased her nonetheless. She stood up, and retracted the blade from her parasol. As Emerald got to her knees, she felt a pain in her back, as Neos parasol made hard contact, knocking her down on her front again. Emerald tried to stand, but Neos parasol crashed down on her back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo continued beating emerald, as her top hitched up, and Neo had a direct shot at her bare skin. She hit her about fifteen to twenty times, before she finally stopped. Neo was panting, sweat making her naked body glisten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmeralds body, on the other hand, was not so beautiful. Her back was red, and though there was no blood, Neos assault would leave scars all across it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green haired girl whimpered, as she struggled to stand, refusing to cry. She looked up at Neo, who was smiling her usual sweet smile. Emerald adjusted her pyjamas, her back was sore and tender now. Neo signed that on second thoughts, she would prefer a shower this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury exited the bathroom, and couldn't help but gawk as he watched a naked neo saunter past him seductively, before locking the bathroom door from the inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" He managed, as Emerald noticed his cheeks were crimson and there was a noticeable bulge in his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guess they're all pervs' she thought. She lay in bed, turning onto her side to face the wall. She was still in agony, but wouldn't allow Mercury to notice. She was still humiliated, but wouldn't allow Neo to know. Though that was nothing, compared to how much she missed Cinder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will find you.\" She whispered to herself, though it was intended for the woman who gave her life meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Mercury asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. G'night.\" Emerald answered, closing her eyes and pulling the sheets right up to her chin. She was usually a back sleeper, but her back was in immense pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Looks like I'm a front sleeper tonight'. </span></div></div>",

Amber had yet to meet Ruby and yangs teammates, but from what she'd heard of Weiss and Blake, she was sure they'd be lovely young ladies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber finished the last of the preparations. They weren't exactly having a party as such, but most teams had headed home for the weekend to see their families before the tournament began, and Amber had suggested that they bring the rest of their team with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere'd been no word from Qrow. Presumably he was still out on his mission, although Amber was worried as he hadn't been in contact in weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her pregnancy had been relaxing, Amber found that she had gotten restless lately. Being stuck on patch, there wasn't much to do, and on top of that she felt her powers getting rusty. Plus there'd been no explanation for her 'mysterious pregnancy'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked at her own belly in the mirror. There was a human growing inside her womb. It filled her with joy beyond measure, but when she tried to think about how it got there, she was filled with dread and fear. It had to be something to do with that woman - Cinder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maiden put her hand on her bump, and felt what must have been the baby kicking her. She couldn't control her smile, as she grinned down at her baby. Little did she know that the 'baby' was in fact her assailant, frustrated and infuriated by her predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's thoughts were interrupted as the front door swung open, and a familiar short red haired girl bounded into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'RE HOME!\" Ruby bellowed, exciting zwei, who ran in circles around her. Ruby was quickly followed by her father, of course, carrying all of the girls bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" He said, struggling with the bags, as Amber giggled. Next was a silver haired girl, with icy blue eyes, and a scar on her left eye. She wore a white and black outfit, not her combat gear, and high boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Schnee?\" Amber asked, shaking the girls hand. Weiss returned the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, Weiss is fine. Thank you.\" The girls greeted each other and Amber introduced herself. She then saw a dark haired girl enter, who seemed calm but somewhat anxious, prehaps an antisocial? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang introduced the girl as \"The adorable and sexy Blake Belladonna\" which made the black haired girl squint her golden eyes in annoyance at Yang, but blush in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang!\" She protested, much to yangs humour, as she laughed at her friend. Amber introduced herself, and all the girls and Tai sat around the room. Amber was sat on the sofa, next to Blake and Yang, with Blake in the middle. Weiss was sat on an armchair to Amber's right, and Ruby was sitting on the arm of Weiss's chair. Tai leant Swainsthorpe the wall, ready to head into the kitchen to get the girls dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five girls talked for a while, mostly about the tournament, and their other friends in the tournament, until suddenly...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A glance at the clock told her that it was already half past nine. If she set off now, she'd get there just in time. She grabbed the first thing she saw that was suitable and put it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pink dress. It had been hers when she was a child, and she was surprised it still fit her, albeit a little tight. The dress was made for a child, so it wasn't intended to be securely or revealing. However, the lacy dress looked like it might tear, as her ample breasts seemed to be threatening to burst out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area around her crotch clung tightly to her thighs, making her uncomfortable, but she ignored it. She looked at herself in the mirror. Her dress was covered in ribbons, the short frilly sleeves covered her shoulders. Winter had obviously outgrown the dress years ago, and didn't even remember having it ever near her military quarters. However, the fact that it obviously didn't fit went unnoticed by winter. She tied her hair into pigtails with pink ribbons, and left her room, notably barefoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way swiftly to the briefing room, she passed a few people who gave her strange looks. Some more people giggled, whispering and looking at her, pointing, making her uneasy as she blushed, picking up the pace as not to be late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting room consisted of various pieces of furniture, but the room was dominated by a large square table with about twenty seats around it. General Ironwoods sat at the head of the table, while the rest of the seats were occupied by other atlesian military officers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had finished discussing a previous operation, and the topic had turned to Agent Schnee and her assignment to transport a large shipment of dust to Vale in order to increase defence during the Vytal festival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agent Schnee will be here momentarily. In the meantime, we shall discuss the contents of the shipment.\" Ironwoods told his officers. He was clearly annoyed that it was 10:08 and there was no sign of Winter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Winter burst in, and twenty-nine heads turned to look at her, including Ironwoods, the officers and security. She opened her mouth to apologise for her tardiness, but no noise came out. She was focused on why everyone in the room was starring at her in what appeared to be a mixture of disbelief and shock-horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir expressions quickly turned to smiles, then laughter, as they saw the humour in winters situation. Everyone was laughing now, even the security guards who tried to maintain their composure. All except Ironwoods, who was visibly angry with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter was still confused. She didn't understand why she was being laughed at by so many people. She was dressed appropriately for her age, and only a few minutes late. She didn't know why they were laughing, but she didn't like it, and he eyes began to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you think this is funny, do you?\" Ironwoods roared, silencing the laughter. His shouting made Winter scared, as she watched him with teary eyes, unsure how to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some sort of joke? I can overlook your lateness this one time, seeing as how you're usually very punctual. But what am I to make of this... this... wardrobe malfunction, of sorts?\" Ironwoods questioned. Winter felt a tear roll down her cheek, but held back the rest of her tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

From the way everyone reacted to her entrance, she knew something was wrong, but couldn't figure out what. And General Ironwoods shouting at her really scared her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter couldn't hold back her tears, and promptly broke down crying in front of everyone. The room fell silent, say for winters wails and sobs. Her face was red and stained with tears, and her nose was running down to her lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronwoods then looked on, overwhelmed and slightly dazed, as he watched a small yellow patch grow on winters crotch area. It got bigger until urine was trickling down her legs and forming a puddle underneath her on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general was bewildered. He had just watched one of his best agents urinate herself, which made her cry even more, and was just watching her with everyone else. He looked at his men, as if for answers, and saw some laughing, some looking away, and the rest looking back at him for answers. He turned back to winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along Schn- ... Winter...\" He instructed, taking a gentler tone with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter rubbed her eyes, and found that her legs couldn't move. As Ironwoods took her arm, she staggered alongside him, her dress squelching as she moved. Still crying, winter was led to Ironwoods transport military truck, and was led inside by the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed that there was no child car seat for her to sit in.

Or at least, that's what she believed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only five minutes for the driver to take Ironwoods and winter to the generals quarters. Winter was led in by Ironwoods, and had stopped crying now, though she was still snivelling. Ironwoods took her inside, and she saw that his quarters in atlas was basically a huge apartment, like a mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general took winter into the living room, and sat her down, still in her wet dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winter... There's something seriously wrong with you. I don't know what it is, but I promise I'll help you. You'll have to stay here until I find answers though.\" He explained. Winter didn't understand, but she knew that James was nice, but scary when he shouted. She nodded, rubbing her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was the first day of Beacon's vacation month. Room by room, students filed out to spend what would seem like an eternity away from school. Weiss, Yang, Blake, Pyrrha, Ruby, and Nora all had planned on an exclusive girl only vacation at one of Weiss' family beach homes. Except for Blake and Pyrrha, these girls were cheering on their way out. It was as if they'd never been outside the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Blake and Pyrrha, both were going along mostly out of peer pressure. Neither wanted to be a stick in the mud and decline. Still, they couldn't hide their true feelings. On the outside, all the other girls could tell that Blake would miss Sun and Pyrrha would miss Juane. Unfortunately for Blake and Pyrrha, their exit out of the academy to the beach home went by without a hitch. In less than an hour, they were already on a private blimp to the beach home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ride there, the rest of the girls talked about what they planned to do. At a couple points, Weiss was tempted to tell Blake and Pyrrha to cheer up. However, at each of these moments, Yang cautioned her against it. According to Yang, they'd cheer up pretty soon. So, Weiss just tucked in her frustration with a pout, thinking to herself \"they better.\" Even if she really wanted to say something, she knew it was to early to complain. Blake would certainly get defensive and, without a day passing, the other girls would surely take Blake and Pyrrha's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride there took a little longer than the girls would've liked. In about 3 hours they arrived, but they all thought it'd only be an hour and 30 minute flight. Poor weather delayed them for an insufferable amount of time. All the built up excitement, made them practically sick with suspense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived though, the weather had passed, leaving a bright beautiful sun to greet them. All of the girls, even Blake and Pyrrha, were amazed at the scale of this house. It was humongous! It had individual rooms for all of them, several TVs, a pool, a hot tub, a fabulous spot by the ocean, and breathtaking views. Of course, just the front view of the house was enough to make them all go crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing their reactions, Weiss gave a smug smile. \"See, I told you it would be awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was the first to respond. \"I can't believe their leaving us alone without supervision! I hope we all can live up to the responsibility.\" Pyrrha merely looked at Ruby and Nora after making that statement. Fortunately for her, neither of them noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls followed up with statements like \"Thank you so much!\" and \"You're amazing\" to Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their shock and gratitude ended, the girls rushed to certain rooms claiming them for their own. Surprisingly, there were no fights over who got what room. Usually, Blake and Weiss would argue, but Blake really didn't feel it'd be polite to complain. Blake, like all the other guests, figured Weiss pulled a lot of strings to make this happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half hour into their unpacking, something odd happened. The door bell rang. When Weiss came to open the door, nobody was in sight. However, there was a ginormous boxed present on the stoop with a letter attached. All the guests figured this was another surprise by Weiss and started praising Weiss another dozen times. Of course, Weiss was surprised by the package. However, she had no problems being praised for it. Weiss just took the praise without letting anyone know she was equally surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, Nora, and Yang desperately wanted to open the package, but the other three girls insisted they read the letter first. Strangely, there was no address on the letter. The card inside was quite simple. It had a nicely decorated heart on the front and inside merely read...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy vacation month girls! Here are gifts in honor of this glorious month. I wasn't able to get gifts for everybody though. I got gifts only for the older girls. For now, I apologize Ruby and Nora. I'll make it up later this break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for Ruby and Nora, all the girls were ecstatic. Out of Ruby and Nora, Nora was especially annoyed and quickly asked. \"Hey.. what kind of joke is this? I'm the same age as all of you. How come I didn't get anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss responded rather carelessly to this question. \"I don't know. Maybe because you act younger than us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora's annoyance turned to sorrow after that line. \"I-I-I really act younger than you all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss followed up with another mean comment \"Maybe not as young as Ruby, but more or less, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby quickly raised her voice \"Hey! That's not nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora just turned to her teammate, to see if it was true. \"D-do you agree Pyrrha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was nervous with her answer. \"Well.. not all the time. I mean... sometimes you act more mature. It doesn't matter though Pyrrha. We all like you for who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora was frustrated and depressed from her teammates answer. \"Cya later then.. I'll let the big girls have their big girl time...\" Nora quickly went out to the beach to blow off some steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby followed suit. \"That was pretty mean guys. I'll cya later. Have fun with you gifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ruby left there was a void of silence followed by Blake and Weiss' first vacation argument. \"Ya know, you didn't have to be so mean to her. That was uncalled for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, you all were thinking it. What's wrong with a little honesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're definition of \"a little honesty\" is off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I didn't give that sorry excuse that Pyrrha gave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha then shot up and defended herself. \"At least, I tried to be gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you failed hard at it. Whatever, I'm going to open this box and we can talk it over later. Besides, Ruby is with her. I'm sure she'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a collective sigh from Yang, Blake, and Pyrrha in response to that. Their hands were pretty tied. They wanted to see what was in the box too. Not to mention, going to apologize for Weiss' statement didn't feel entirely productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, they pitched in and helped unwrap the present. What they found were four individual boxes inside, some bigger than others. Each was labeled for one of the four girls. Within seconds they each had their own present and, on the count of 3, opened their gifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss got a new dress, much like her current one, but this one was far more elaborate with snow designs spread throughout. It also felt more comfortable, as though it was made out of cotton. This type of fabric was one that Weiss used to wear all the time when she was little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang got her old teddy bear all sewed up, looking newer than ever. \"MR. SNOOKUMS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other girls looked at her funny. \"It's not what you think. This used to be my favorite teddy bear and Ruby ruined it when she was really young. I thought it was thrown out, but apparently not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining three girls \"aww\"ed in response to her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake got a book titled \"Peace between Humans and Faunus: Years of Long Forgotten History.\" Immediately after reading the title, Blake hugged the book tight. This is something she'd always wanted to read about, since she was young. However, very few books covered the topic. The book was a purple hard cover wand smooth to the touch. It was the perfect gift for Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Pyrrha got a golden crescent style bracelet, which reminded her of the symbol on Juane's shield. It was also a bracelet, one of her favorite fashion accessories since she was little. However, as she grew up to become a huntress, it had become too risky to wear bracelets. In time, she just forgot about the accessory to focus on her training. Seeing another bracelet though, especially one so pretty, brought back so many wonderful memories. She was in complete love with this bracelet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost seconds after finding out their presents, they were distracted by them. Slowly but surely each of these gifts would regress them into babies. However, they would be too distracted to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's age regression shall we follow first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yang rushed into the room where she unpacked her belongings. Immediately, she started jumping onto the bed with her teddy bear in her arms. Little did she know that the teddy bear was siphoning age from her as she held it. The more surface it touched, the faster it would suck the age out of her. The teddy bear had a limit though. Once the bearer reached a year old, it's age sucking function would cease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe age regression that was beginning to take shape was unusual though. It wouldn't erase the regressed's memory, but it would give the victim the mental and physical trappings of a 1 year old. Lastly, it wouldn't get rid of the victim's ability to speak, but it would heavily hinder it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these nuanced details were hidden behind Yang's love for her precious teddy bear. Yang just kept bouncing on her bed, gigging with glee at her reunion with Mr. Snookums. After about a 5 minutes of needless bed jumping, something went wrong. Yang dropped her Mr. Snookums onto the floor. In reality, there wasn't any reason to be concerned. However, at this point, Yang was only 10. (Meaning she lost 7 years.) As a result, the fear that she would lose her teddy bear again loomed heavily over her. With each minute she had spent with Mr. Snookums, she he remembered how heartbreaking it was to lose him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after dropping Mr. Snookums, tears formed around the corner of her eyes. She raced to the floor, holding Mr. Snookums tightly in her ever shrinking arms. In a high pitched voice, she screeched \"PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME MR. SNOOKUMS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emotional trauma of dropping her teddy bear distracted her from the increasing bagginess of her clothing. In fact, within only a minute of squeezing Mr. Snookums in her arms, she reached the tender age of 5. Her clothes, which were already short at the age of 17, merely slipped through her. This left her as nothing more than a naked 5 year old squeezing a teddy bear on top of a pile of clothes. And after another minute of senseless squeezing, Yang's age regression stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she was just a 1 year old, a wailing one at that. Her fears of losing Mr. Snookums never went away after she started hugging him. In fact, hugging him only made her fears larger. Her fears became so big, that even while hugging Mr. Snookums, she was terrified. So, like any terrified baby, she had started wailing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the naked Yang peed on her previous clothes out of increased fear. Soon enough, more fears were toppled on, such as a fear of freezing to death, a fear of malnutrition, and a fear of being unloved. All of these added on fears were a result of being naked with no one to care for her. For that reason, common fears of baby-hood crept onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once powerful student was now as weak as can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho shall we follow now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss hurried to one of the bathrooms with her brand new dress. She didn't want to lose a second of trying it on. Right after entering her individual bathroom, she locked the door and stripped naked. Common sense seemed to be the last thing on her mind. After all, she should\u2019ve kept her panties on, but for some reason thought the dress would \u201cfeel grander\u201d if she didn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer loss of what some people would call \u201csanity\u201d had to do with the fabric of the dress. It carried sentimental memories of her being wrapped up in it as a baby. She loved the fabric so much that she had demanded as a child that her other dresses be made of the same fabric. It wasn\u2019t until she approached her teen years that the fabric stopped being used for her clothing. The fashion industry was moving into other fabrics and poor Weiss couldn\u2019t change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now was different. Somehow, someway, the same design she loved so much was made with this beloved fabric. What she didn\u2019t know was that for every second she wore that dress, a month of age would vanish from her. The age regression effects also mimicked that of Yang\u2019s teddy. She\u2019d be able to speak, but poorly at that. She\u2019d have her memories, but she\u2019d have physical and mental characteristics of a 1 year old. Since she was only 17 when she first put on this particular dress, within a mere 3 minutes and 12 seconds she\u2019d be a 1 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Weiss regressed, she noticed the dress becoming bigger on her. That said, she didn\u2019t actually connect what was happening. Rather she just tried to bury herself more into the fabric when she noticed it was bigger. By the time she was 13, she started panicking. She was just then beginning to fear losing this fabric as Yang feared losing her teddy. In essence, that first minute of senseless joy was over. Tears came into fill the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss started to believe that it wouldn\u2019t be long until she outgrew this dress (Even though the dress was literally too big for her at this point.) Her tears eventually mounted into a perpetually worse problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss began to notice the dress was getting wet and, thus, uncomfortable. As a result, Weiss began to cry even more. She couldn\u2019t stop telling herself that she \u201cruined\u201d the lovely dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the age of 4, the weight of the now wet dress was too heavy, causing little Weiss to fall flat on her butt. At this point, only one side of the dress could hang from her shoulder, while the rest of the dress sagged to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coldness of the bathroom floor felt terrible! Even worse, Weiss\u2019s tears had made the floor wet and slippery. She tried to get her bearings, which quickly meant getting on all fours in the crawling position. But by the age of 2, even that position was quite hard to maintain, as the floor was too slippery. So, Weiss finally fell belly first onto her wet new dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 12 seconds, she just laded there, wailing her eyes out.  It wasn\u2019t long after before the little one had to go poppy. As an infant, she could only do one thing. She let her instincts take over, causing her to make a nice big brown stain on the middle portion of the dress. For the remainder of her one-on-one with the dress, she just mentally criticized herself for being so messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once dignified student was as messy as can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho shall we follow now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right after Blake found out what her gift was, she wanted to find the most soothing place to read it. That wound up being the chairs out by the pool. As soon as she got outside, she realized it was too hot though. So, she booked it to her room and put on a two piece bathing suit. Normally, Blake wouldn\u2019t wear something so \u201cshow-y.\u201d This was no normal occasion. She wanted to read this book in the best circumstances imaginable, regardless of what others might think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, she had put on her lavender two piece bathing suit. She then raced outside with her new book, set up a towel over a plastic relaxing chair. Then she dived into the book. She wanted to read through the contents as fast as possible. However, this only played into the age regression function of the book. For each book syllable she read to herself or out-loud, she would lose 1 week. The age regression effects operated the same for her as they did for Yang and Weiss. At the age of 1, she\u2019d have mental and physical baby habits. She\u2019d be able to talk, but to limited effect. This further meant that her ability to read would be hindered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of these factors were even remotely noticeable to her though. The age regression effects didn\u2019t impact her reading until she hit the twelfth page. By this point, she was only 5 years old and her bathing suit was already loose and beneath her. As for her bow, it was taking much of her head now, much larger in proportion now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, she had spent much of the age regression completely immersed in this book. That all changed though at the age of 5. At this point, she had trouble pronouncing some of the words. Some words she couldn\u2019t even understand anymore. Blake\u2019s reaction to this was unusual. Upon having difficulty reading, Blake merely lectured herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe internally prodded herself on her inability to read much farther. This aspect then distracted her from the message in the sentences. In gist, she was focusing more on simply reading the text, instead of understanding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for about a minute, by which point she was already at age 1. At this age, she couldn\u2019t even concentrate on the book anymore. Instead, her five senses dominated her focus. The burning sensation of the sun scared her. It was as if she forgot what it felt like to be outside. The soft crashes of the waves off to the distance frightened her. It was as if she felt a monster was trying to get her. Everything seemed so big to her. From her perspective, she was high above the ground and the slightest sight of the ground caused her to panic. The weight of the bow was even too much for her to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in a feat of cute baby bravery, she tried pulling it out. After a couple tugs, it managed to come undone, leaving her cat ears exposed. Unlike at age 17 though, at age 1, her cat ears took up a large part of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, she couldn\u2019t help but talk to herself out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWisen-wup Bwake.. be bwave\u2026 me no afwad ob monsta!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then another wave crashed and Blake completely lost what little composure she had. She quickly burst into tears, wailing at the top of her lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still desperately wanted to read that book, but everything was so scary. She couldn\u2019t help herself. She just wailed, hoping someone strong would save her from the frightening monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once composed student was as scared as can be. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All the other girls were out of the main living room so fast that Pyrrha felt it best to stay there. She quickly put the golden bracelet on her wrist. Instead of being obsessed with the object though, like her friends, she was obsessed with what the object represented. It represented bracelets, a fashion accessory she could no longer enjoy. It represented a time in her life where creativity had a bigger emphasis. It represented something she long missed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly, the age regression effects for this gift correlated with the thoughts it conjured. More specifically, for each memory brought on by the bracelet, Pyrrha would regress to whatever year she was at in that memory. For instance, if she remembered a bracelet at X age, she would regress to said age. Like her friends, by the time she hit age 1, she\u2019d have baby mental and physical tendencies and her speech would be significantly altered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first memory she could think of was her last bracelet. It was a silver bracelet and had acquired an element of luck. Whenever Pyrrha had worn that bracelet, she felt like the odds came into her favor. That said, there\u2019s a special reason this bracelet was her last. It was her only bracelet to break in sparring. She was 13 when it had happened. As always, her instructors recommended her to remove it and she ignored them. Pyrrha couldn\u2019t remember how exactly the bracelet broke as the memory was tucked into her subconscious. Still, she could remember what happened and, more importantly, how she felt when it happened. When it had happened, she was emotionally devastated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pyrrha started picturing the memory, tears flowed from her cheeks. Within that instant, she regressed to the age of 13 and her clothes became noticeably baggy to a bystander. Her head brace was now around her neck. She was too mentally distraught though to realize any of this. Her tears carried on for about a solid 5 minutes, until she slowly regained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting out of this stupor, she noticed her new bracelet again and a happier memory came to her. She thought of the point in her life when she was obsessed with gold bracelets. She had nearly 12 bracelets that year, all a different design, but nonetheless gold. This was roughly around the age of 5. As a result, her body quickly shrunk to that of her 5 year old self. Her hair was notably shorter, not going down nearly as much. Most of her clothes were now on the floor leaving a mostly naked 5 year old. The only piece that remained was her head brace. It was now around her waist. The golden bracelet that spawned that memory was on the couch near her. Pyrrha was happy though throughout this, only thinking of her many gold bracelets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last glance at the new bracelet, she remembered the first bracelet she ever got at the age of 1. It was a bean bracelet with a crescent design on it. She could remember very little about that time in her life, but the bracelet\u2019s crescent was imprinted into her memory. It was this unique bracelet that made her fall in love with bracelets in the first place. It was shiny, so pwetty\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you one might expect, by this point Pyrrha had regressed all the way back to the adorable age of 1. And, of course, she was completely and utterly naked. Nothing more. At this point, she didn\u2019t have nearly that much hair left, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind. In fact, unlike her friends, she seemed\u2026 happy. She crawled out of her head brace and looked around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooo.. soo pwetty\u201d she said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she just looked down at her chubby hands with curiosity. \u201cMe so tiny, me..\u201d And then it hit her... \u201cme a baby.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after coming to this realization, she remained happy. Very quickly after coming to this realization, a baby instinct kicked in; she started sucking on her thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Pyrrha hadn\u2019t registered all the implications of being a baby. In complete truth, she had only registered one implication\u2026 \u201cMe no ma wa-spon-sa-bol!\u201d (\u201cMe no more responsible!\u201d is what she said)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once capable student was now rather helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, let's follow Ruby and Nora on their way home. They have a biiig surprise awaiting them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time all their friends regressed to babies, Ruby and Nora were on their way home. They had traveled quite a distance from the house. So, it\u2019d be a little bit until they heard Blake\u2019s wails outside. On their walk, Nora unsurprisingly did most of the talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe they said what they said\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora, I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t mean it. Weiss probably was embarrassed she didn\u2019t know your age and wanted to cover her tracks. I bet Pyrrha just didn\u2019t want to start an argument.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill though, I mean how could she think I was younger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s not the nicest thing to think, but people tend to believe younger people have more spirit. Honestly, I\u2019ve come to take it as a compliment. Ya know? I mean, I like being spirited. It beats being a buzzkill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 you really think it\u2019s that simple? If it is, then I\u2019m ecstatic! I\u2019d love to be known as the most spirited!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, me too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh\u2026 that makes me wonder. What gifts did the others get that would imply their older? Maybe dictionaries and monotone lectures. Those things are so boring!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, that\u2019d be funn-\u201c Ruby cut herself off upon hearing a faint wail. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe wail, it\u2019s pretty faint, but it sounds like it\u2019s coming from the beach home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a WHALE AT THE BEACH HOME?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 not that kind of wail. I was referring to like a scream, like someone\u2019s screaming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooo\u2026 then in that case, yes I can hear that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound good. I think we should hurry to the house. I feel like something\u2019s wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure? I just thought they were watching a scary movie or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby just ignored Nora\u2019s theory and started running, keeping her ear out for the sound. The sound kept getting progressively louder. The sound of \u201cwaaa!\u201d turned to \u201cWaaaaaah!\u201d and then eventually into \u201cWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\u201d By that point, the two of them were merely steps away from seeing the house. Ruby started to panic. \u201cThat sounds like a baby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t be silly Ruby, I\u2019m sure a baby wasn\u2019t sent in the mail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, I meant it in that-\u201c Ruby paused with fear upon finding the source of the noise. It was what she feared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora just turned to Ruby in childlike curiosity \u201cmeant by what Ruby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby said softly \u201cturn to where I\u2019m facing. That\u2019s what I meant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora did as instructed and was amazed at what she saw. \u201cWOW! It really was a baby!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora was filled with glee. She loved babies. They were so cute and adorable. So, like all the other times she spotted a baby, she went up to it, hoping to cuddle it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora picked the naked baby up, rocking it back and forth. \u201cHi there little one, what\u2019s your name? I\u2019m Nora, a qualified babysitter professional!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora\u2019s rocking greatly soothed Blake, causing her to slowly calm down and wipe her tears off. \u201cWha-wha aw ya tawkin\u2019 abowt Na-wa? Ya kno me.. Me Bway-ka\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting. I have a friend named Blake too, but she\u2019s much older.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake started to get upset. \u201cStop tweetin me wike ah bay-be. Me is dat freen-da.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause of silence, followed by Nora\u2019s sudden realization \u201cYou mean... You\u2019re Blake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby came up behind them. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to tell you Nora. I think our friends were turned into babies.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby then picked up Blake, who was suddenly shocked at hearing she was a baby. \u201cWay a min-net\u2026 da wud es-pwane why you too aw a-bol ta hole me, but den dat meens\u2026\u201d Blake suddenly burst into tears. \u201cME A BAY-BE! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby quickly rocked her back and forth, humming to sooth her. This surprisingly worked wonders. Once Blake wiped away her tears again, Ruby calmed her by saying \u201cIt\u2019s okay Blake. We can fix this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that, Nora responded \u201cAwww.. do we have to? She looks sooo cute! I can\u2019t wait to see what the other-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake cut her off. \u201cMe nah cute! You no bay-be me. Me oda wike you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora joked around after that line, booping Blake\u2019s nose \u201cEeeeexcept, you\u2019re not anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blake burst out into fury, Ruby cut in. \u201cNora, please stop. It\u2019s not helping. Now, Blake, please tell us what happened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora shrugged to that response, making funny faces to Blake in the midst of their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake finally had a moment to speak though. \u201cWew, me an da odas got diffa-wen gifs. Wees ga a dwess, Yan ga ah teddy name Mista Snuk-ums, Pie-wa ga bwace-wet, an Me gots book.\u201d Blake then pointed to the book on the chair. \u201cSo, me ga dwessed fa owt-side an den me wed book, but on da twa-twa-twa (she had trouble saying twelfth) on da page too afta ten me ha twob-bol weedin\u2019 an den me ear monsta! Me got sca-wed an staw-ted cwy-win. Den ya too a-wibed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora responded first to Blake\u2019s story. \u201cMonster? What monster?\u201d A couple seconds after Nora asked, another set of waves crashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after hearing the sound, Blake said \u201cDAT!\u201d and buried her face in Ruby\u2019s chest, hugging for her dear life.<br>\r\nRuby smiled \u201cThere there Blakie, that\u2019s just the waves. There\u2019s no monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked up at her friend with a tear-y eyed face \u201cY-y-ya sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. But let\u2019s get you inside anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded \u201cMe agwee\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Ruby with a naked babified Blake in her arms opened the pool door to the inside. Nora followed behind. \u201cNora, I have a feeling, all of them were turned into babies. Please go upstairs and find one. We need to get them all re-situated. I call my sister.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should we follow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ruby carefully walked to the middle level, trying to be mindful of Blake\u2019s feelings. That said, it was a little hard to do so with Nora\u2019s shouting. Ruby couldn\u2019t make out what Nora was saying, but it better have been worth it. Once Ruby got to the middle level though, she couldn\u2019t see Nora, but she could hear two sets of wails. One was fainter coming from Weiss\u2019 room and the other was more pronounced coming from her sister\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby couldn\u2019t help but hurry to her sister. It was a very instinctual move, but she wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. By rushing more and moving to the louder sound, Blake started to get scared, clutching onto Ruby\u2019s dress. Right as they were approaching the room, Blake had lost it. She started bursting into wails as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAAAAAAAAAAAH\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby momentarily ignored Blake\u2019s wails to see her sister. Just moments after Blake started wailing, Ruby spotted Yang. Yang was still hugging Mr. Snookums as a naked baby. Not to mention, the room smelled terrible. The scent of Yang\u2019s pee soaked clothes filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s nose was not enjoying it. \u201cOh my.. that smells really bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake continued to scream. \u201cWAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRest assured, Yang couldn\u2019t help but look up to see where the noise was coming from. Immediately upon seeing someone, she screamed \u201cNOO!! PWEASE NO TAKE MISTA SNUK-UMS! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was losing her patience, but she tried to contain herself. So, she simply took some deep breathes and started singing a song to sooth the babies. \u201cRock a bye babies in the tree top, If they holler the cradles will drop. Rock a bye babies in the tree top, if they holler the cradles will drop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but after several more lines of that song the two babies, Blake and Yang, were drowsy, on the verge of going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Ruby carefully but quickly kneeled down to Yang\u2019s level. She gently placed Blake near Yang, butt first on the soft carpet. Normally, putting a naked baby on a carpet was a terrible idea. Then again, this was one of those special circumstances where it didn\u2019t matter as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby softly spoke after lowering Blake. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here. Are you two alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Yang drowsily looked to where the sound was coming from and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby gave a smile and motherly said. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t want my two amazing babies to be sad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying that, Yang looked around in disbelief \u201cWay.. wha? M-m-me ah bAY-\u201c Ruby cut her off with a finger, already knowing what Yang was about to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhh.. it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll take care of this. You all won\u2019t stay young for long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang adorably tilted her head in curiosity. \u201cYou wiw?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake responded to that one, crossing her arms in cute frustration. \u201cYep. A-par-wen-wy, me, yo-wa, Wees, an Pie-wa tur inta bay-bes. Da gifs wa ah twick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang defensively hugged her little teddy bear after hearing that. \u201cNu uhh\u2026 Mista Snuk-ums i-ent mean. He fwen-wy. He neva wud do dat to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake became even more frustrated. \u201cDen es-pwane why Wuby is so bii an we sma-ol, an an dat we nay-ked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang couldn\u2019t retaliate against that, but the thought of Mr. Snookums being the cause of something so terrible just saddened her so. She slowly said \u201cDen\u2026 he-he-\u201c Ruby cut her off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Sis. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t Mr. Snookums doing. He\u2019s your friend after all. Let me just check something though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang defensively said \u201cNO! You bwake Mista Snuk-ums be-fa. Me no twus you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby paused for a moment, before facepalming. \u201cOh yea\u2026 Then.. you got me. I understand why you don\u2019t trust me. Can you tell me though how your reunion with him has been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm.. me gess\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Yang was going on her long-winded story, Ruby used an eye device to see if any more dust remained on the teddy bear. Fortunately, it registered as magic safe. Ruby thought to herself \u201cIt seems the effects have worn off. Best to check the other items, but for now, we should be safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby just nodded her head throughout Yang\u2019s story \u201cUh huh, ahhh, that sounds cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Ruby, Yang took the bait. Blake on the other hand, knew Ruby didn\u2019t really listen and just sighed. She said to herself \u201cAh.. ya haf ta be kiddin me..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang tilted her head \u201cWha? Wha da matta?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha da matta? WHA DA MATTA? We aw bay-bes! Dat wha da matta! Me am fwi-ten-da, bu yo-wa seem ta be fine. Ya eben dun we-wise ya pee-da on ya cwos! Why dat?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby tried to cut off Blake, but nothing seemed to work. She got her ears ready for the two to fight and eventually cry. However, nothing of the sort happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang simply said back \u201cYea? So? Me ge ta be wit Mista Snuk-ums, so me hap-pee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was shocked \u201cWah! Wa abowt di-pas an bed times an an an bay-be foo. Da dent dat upset you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah wiw-wy. Dis me bwake.

Fa yo-wa, ya hab bee time stor-wies, an stwowa wides, an an Wuby hugs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake paused for a second. \u201cMe gess.. Me jus na use ta it. Me tink sometin ba is gonna hap-pen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWike wha?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWike\u2026 wha ib me fa ob bed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDat why bay-bes hab cwibs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBu ho-wa aw we gonna ge cwibs an wha wiw odas tink ib dey see us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBwake, dat fa da gwow-nups to de-cide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBu me am gwow-nup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. You bay-be. Wike me.. An, an\u2026 me happy yo-wa bay-be wike me\u201d Little Yang got a little tear-y eyed and hugged Blake after saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was caught off guard by Yang\u2019s warm hug. Being a naked baby was a rather cold experience. Blake\u2019s reaction to the hug was quite positive though and she too got a little tear-y eyed. \u201cTanks.. sowwy me be-in gwump-y. Me jus jus scar-wad. Bu me twy ta be hap-pee. Me gess, cus me not awone. Tanks fa show-wen me dat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo pwob-wum. Dat wha fwens aw for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Yang said that, Ruby couldn\u2019t contain the \u201cdaaaaws\u201d and hugged them both. \u201cAwwww, that\u2019s exactly the kind of attitude I like hearing! Let\u2019s go onward to Weiss! Isn\u2019t this so exiting?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake spoke up after that. \u201cYa kina woo-ened da mo-men.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rebutted. \u201cMe wike it. Dats me bay-be sista!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, Ruby lifted the two babies up, one in both of her arms. Blake to her left and Yang to her right. Ruby couldn\u2019t contain her giggles though from Yang\u2019s statement. \u201cTechnically, you\u2019re my baby sister now Yang. Not like I was. It\u2019s no longer a saying. It\u2019s more literal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang blushed \u201cYa ga me. Fa now, me caw yo-wa mommy sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby laughed \u201cHaha, I humbly accept.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat exchange just made Blake say in a deadpanned voice \u201cMe neba gonna unda-stan sista bons\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them all laughed as Ruby slowly walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho shall we follow now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She started calling out enthusiastically \u201cIs anybody home?!\u201d This loud question blocked out the noise coming from Weiss\u2019 room. As for a response, well, maybe there was or maybe there wasn\u2019t. Nora couldn\u2019t tell because she was too busy talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora enthusiastically shouted to Ruby\u2019s annoyance. \u201cA little baby told me that you all turned into babies! Where are my babies at? Ahh, come on! Don\u2019t be shy! I guess if no one will speak up, I\u2019ll go to the living room! If you all are hiding, I\u2019ll find ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora rushed up one more set of stairs to the top level and plopped herself on the couch unaware that Pyrrha was just nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 now if I was a baby trying to hide from me, where would I go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha then spoke up, getting Nora out of her self-dialogue. \u201cNora?

So.. anyways, how is the second baby-hood going?\u201d Nora then lifted her babified teammate into her arms, cradling her back in forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha nervously looked up to Nora to say \u201cWew.. dis may soun odd comin fwom me, bu me weawy wike it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora was happily astonished \u201cReally?! That\u2019s awesome! Because once I heard that you were a baby, I was soooo excited. I have so many ideas for what we can do.

Ruby guessed you all turned into babies as well due to the gifts. I wanted it to be true, so I just acted on it, and what do you know, she was right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.. dats a-wat ta tay-ka in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe no kno. Me jus figur dat me da onwy wun. Me sorta wor-weed dat da wes aw bay-bes too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? I thought you just said you really like being a baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe do. Bu dat da ting. Me tink da odas, e-spe-awy Wees, be angwy wit it. Den yo-wol wiw wan ta chay us bak. Bu bu\u2026\u201d Pyrrha started to tear up \u201cme no wanna go bak! Me wanna be bay-be fa-eba!!!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora reacted rather professionally and motherly to Pyrrha\u2019s concerns. She rocked Pyrrha back and forth and said calmly \u201cIt\u2019s okay baby\u2026 As you\u2019re team mate, I won\u2019t make them do anything to you that you don\u2019t want. Think of me as your mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha quickly calmed down. \u201cWe-weawy? Me no hafta tur bak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. I mean we\u2019re on the same team and I just happen to be a fantastic babysitter. Granted, if I\u2019m gonna be changing your diapers for the next several years, I think \u2018mommy\u2019 sounds more accurate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha grew a giant smile on her face upon hearing that \u201cYay! Nowa Mommy! Mommy Nowa! Dis is da bes gif eba!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, I could also bring you into battles on a baby harness and you could learn how to fling arrows. You could be the first ever baby huntress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how ridiculous this sounded, Pyrrha was not in the right state of mind and replied \u201cWeawy?! Dat soun fun! Me.. me\u2026 happy\u2026. Tank you Nowa\u201d Pyrra then motioned for a hug and Nora fully accepted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about a solid minute, the two of them were embraced in a ginormous hug. They were no longer just friends or teammates. They were also fully invested in a mommy and baby relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, for Nora, something unpleasant happened in this moment. Pyrrha suddenly felt the urge to pee and peed all over Nora\u2019s pink dress skirt! And Pyrrha really had to pee. That said, Pyrrha had no idea what was happening though while she did it. It was as if the lower portion of her body was just acting on its own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Nora didn\u2019t make a commotion. Instead, she just continued to hug Pyrrha throughout the entire accident. It was a little hard to resist doing something about it though. Not to mention, Pyrrha peed for what seemed to be a solid minute. Nonetheless, Nora said nothing. She knew the little one had to pee and it was better on her than the carpet or couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Pyrrha was done, Nora held Pyrrha in her arms, preventing the little one from seeing what she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was the first one to speak up after the hug. \u201cNowa, me can nah way fa ma ob ya wubbin. Afta dat amay-sin hug, me bets yo-wa gib da bes bed time storwies an diapa chan-ges.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora just giggled it off. \u201cHaha, you have no idea Pyrrha. My diaper changes will rock your world! Actually, on that note, would the little one like a diaper change now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha just paused for a second to adorably think \u201cMmmm.. yes pwease!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome! There\u2019s only one teensy weensy catch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha adorably tilted her head in curiosity \u201cWha dat Nowa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have no diapers or baby powder, so I\u2019d have to be using the red cloth from your previous clothes without any powder. Is that okay sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe gess. Me nots eba gonna nee dat, so me no mine. Me do wan pow-da eben-tu-awy dou.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, that\u2019s my girl! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be getting you fresh diapers and baby powder later today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTanks mommy, I meen Nowa\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowa said in response \u201cCall me whatever you like sweetie. I don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha giggled at the thought of continuing to call Nora \u2018mommy.\u2019 \u201cHehe, kay Mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without much of a second later, Nora stood up with Pyrrha in one arm and kneeled down to get the red cloth. She then used the couch as a surface, gently putting Pyrrha on it without letting her see Nora\u2019s wet dress skirt. Nora did this, because she figured the couch was soft and that Pyrrha wouldn\u2019t have to go again for a little bit. Once all the pieces were in position, Nora lifted Pyrrha\u2019s chubby legs high up and slid the red cloth underneath. Luckily for Pyrrha, that cloth was cotton and made a great makeshift diaper. Nora then wrapped the cloth around Pyrrha\u2019s behind and locked it snugly in place with a bobby pin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nora was finished, Pyrrha giggled \u201cMe wike da di-pa Mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, I\u2019m glad you do sweetie. Now, do you want to go to your friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha pondered for a second and then responded \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Nora picked up the little one into her arms and walked down to the main level at a moderate pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shall happen now?</span></div></div>",

She accepted what happened, but things just felt way too weird today.

Eventually, little by little, the little ones calmed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, at this point, Ruby would stop, but she continued on. Nora followed along. After a few more sing throughs, all the babies were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby did this, because she was honestly tired and the last thing she wanted to deal with was a baby Weiss wining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure enough it was another package with no sender. On the package was a little letter that read \u201cEnjoyed the surprise? Here\u2019s the package I promised earlier. For your sanity, I recommend you use this dust immediately. Just throw it on the ground in this house and reality will transform to aid you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby asked the obvious \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo idea, but there\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora then threw the dust on the ground and the house was instantly consumed in thick pink smoke. Ruby and Nora were scared, but just waited it out. About a minute later, the smoke cleared and both of them were amazed at what happened. They were older!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom their figures, they guessed both of them were in their early 20s. Not only that, the house changed too. All the walls were painted in a de-saturated pink with little white clouds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shall they do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
