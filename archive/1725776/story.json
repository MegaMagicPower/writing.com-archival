After a while though, they will break/run out of ammunition. Combo Weapons are allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other Survivors</b><br>\r\nOther Survivors can be helpful or hostile. You can help save them or kill them, depending on the situation. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*Bigsmile*\" title=\"Bigsmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Death</b><br>\r\nIf you die, you don't have to end the story. You can continue as a zombie. Of course if someone shoots you in the head, destroys your brain, cuts your head off, and so on, you're dead, permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Time</b><br>\r\nYour story can be during the time of the first Dead Rising or after, or before/during/after Dead Rising 2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Who are You?</b><br>\r\nYou could be anyone. You could be Frank West/Chuck Greene themselves, or another mentioned survivor, or your own character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Point of View</b><br>\r\nI recommend 3rd Person Point of View.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Zombies</b><br>\r\nZombies have their own language, so if you end up as the Undead, use a different color, font type, or style, to represent Zombies speaking, and to translate what they are saying into \"English.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules</b><br>\r\nLeave options for other survivors/zombies. Also, follow basic spelling and grammar rules; I want good quality stuff. And one more thing, don't copy the game word for word, unless it is necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything goes, though try to keep a limit on swearing and sexual references. Also, be sure to have plenty of food to regain your energy. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*Bigsmile*\" title=\"Bigsmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor more information about the games, check out the following sites.
