But with the heat comes sweat, with sweat comes hunger, which can easily ruin a good day, but the three sisters were in luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria got up and look around, asking, \"Why didn't we bring berries with us?\", Lin woke up said, \"I didn't think we would need any, I was clearly mistaken.\" Eve got up and looked too hoping that she would find something first, but Victoria would beat her to it when she noticed a nearby stream with a large Oran Berry bush right beside it. \"Perfect\", Victoria ran toward the stream with Eve tailing her and Lin watching them. When Eve and Victoria reached the berry bush they noticed something odd about the Oran berries on the bush; they were twice the their normal size, they looked slightly darker, and for some unknown reason, there was a trail of berry juice leading into a hole in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shrugged it off and started picking the berries, they managed to get half the berries off the bush when Lin joined them, \"I'm sure this is enough\" Lin said when they had picked 9 berries. \"They look great, let's eat\", and they each ate their fair share. As they ate, they got bursts of juice on their faces, they continued to talk to each other in between bites, and they even made jokes about the juice on their faces. After they finished the 9 berries, they were completely full, if not over full, they agreed to rest for a while to let the berries digest.</span></div></div>",

Once they almost turned completely blue, the three of them woke up, not noticing their changes. \"Well, that felt good\" Victoria said while stretching, \"Yes, I feel refreshed and...uh\", Lin noticed that Victoria was blue from head to the middle of her lower legs, Eve also saw this and spoke up. \"Victoria...you're blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria looked down and saw what they meant, she was almost completely blue, her feet were the last to go. She looked at her sisters and noticed that, they too were blue. They look at themselves and confirmed that there wasn't a single bit of them left that wasn't blue, and they even noticed that the juice that was on their faces had absorbed into their skin. Lin looked at her panicking sisters and said, \"Ok, lets just stop and try to think about how we can fix this\".

She placed a hand on her butt and felt it grow in her hand, she turned to tell Lin, but she saw that Lin was having the same problem. Lin was having another problem, the full feeling also moved to her chest, causing her to develope breasts, Lin was surprised but also concerned. She hesitantly reached for one of her growing breasts and gave it a light squeeze, she blushed hard, and let out a slight moan.

Her cheek where she was chewing the gum had started to turn a dark pink and started to spread across her face making her eyes pink and her hair a leafy green. The pink slowly made its way down her neck and to the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still a good ways away from her destination and Miette was keeping a close eye on her as best as she could, she could see that the gum was doing its job and Serena was completely unaware of her transformation. She decided to make her way a head to see her work in progress from another angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another 10 minutes of Serena walking and chewing she suddenly stopped in her tracks and her Braixen followed suit but when it looked up at its trainer, its eyes widened and jaw dropped, Serena was completely pink from head to toe with the exception of her hair, which was green and her clothes which were untouched. And it was only going to get worse from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena placed a hand on her belly, she had began to feel extremely bloated and the feeling was getting worse. She looked down and saw that she had turned a dark pink and her hair had become the color of leaves. She began to panic, she looked at herself for a bit, but her attention was brought back to her belly when she saw it starting to bulge out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe place her hand on her now growing belly and tried to push it back but to no avail, it just kept growing. When she tried to run she felt something sloshing in her stomach, a liquid. She gave her growing belly a good slap and she heard a faint sloshing, but then her belly had a sudden growth spurt. Her belly pushed her dress further up and could be seen through a small slit in her dress, her dress started to stretch around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon her once average butt started to grow along with her belly, causing the skirt of her dress to ride up exposing her ever growing butt. Serena felt this and place a hand on her butt, and squeezed it blushing a bit but still wanting it to stop, she was thankful no one was watching her, or so she thought, Miette was watching from afar and was sort of enjoying the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, she felt a full feeling in her chest and she immediately knew what was going to happen, her breasts started to fill up with the unknown liquid that was also in her belly, and was growing fast. She grabbed one of them and gave them a light shake, she felt the liquid sloshing, she knew there was no going back, she just stood there letting her body grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 minutes, Serena was still growing and growing fast, her dress had ripped apart, the stocking were hanging on but nearly at their limits, and her boots had popped off, she was just standing there in her bra and panties, and she had given her hat to Braixen. Serena had become nearly rotund, her arms and legs had thickened, her belly, butt and breasts had grown tenfold, and her cheeks had swollen up, making her speech muffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena felt her growing form, thinking when it would end, but she just hoped it would end soon. See looked at her Braixen, who was sleeping, and made sure that if anything bad...or worse were to happen, she would be able to get its attention. See closed her eyes and tried to think happy thoughts, but her thoughts of performing and Ash, had turned into thoughts of ecstasy and juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes, she looked down and saw that she had become a pink, round, juice ball, and she suddenly wanted more. She had grown to a diameter of 8 feet and her breast had become 3 feet in diameter, her head, hands and feet were sticking out, but she wanted to be bigger, her mind had change almost completely.</span></div></div>",

Lana spoke up \"What is it, some kind of rare fruit? A Pokemon Toy? Some Cool Shades?\" Mallow responded, \"I wish, nope and you really think I use those?\" She took out the packs of gum, \"I saw these and thought the 3 of us could try them together, what do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

She turned to Mallow and Lana only to find that Mallow's legs and Lana's face were also turning blue and the blue was spreading, they looked at each other in both disbelief and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening?\" Lillie said while watching the blue spread down her arm towards her shoulder, \"I'm not sure why this is happening, but it's not good\" Mallow said as her whole left leg turned blue and her right started turning blue. Lana told Popplio to create a small bubble to see her reflection and saw that her eyes had turned a dark blue and her hair was doing the same. The blue continued to spread on all three girls, turning their eyes and hair a dark blue, covering them from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was only the start as once the were completely blue, with the exception of their clothes, their problems were going to get worse. \"Mallow...where did you get that gum\" Lillie said with concern in her voice, \"I found it in a small store, there was only 3 packs left\" Mallow answered.<br>\r\nBut before anyone else could speak, their stomachs started gurgling, the sound got louder by the minute.</span></div></div>",
