It took about an hour for him to reach her chair and in that time she had drunk 4 glasses of champene and had a 5th sitting on a table beside her. By the time Spiderman had reached her foot she was asleep! \"Dammit! this makes things so much harder.\" Peter thought he was hoping MJ might feel or see him. While he was thinking his spidersense went crazy and he dodge as MJ shifted her foot which probably would have crushed him. More caustious this time he approached her foot which was clean and smelt like she had taken a shower and put lotion on them. Spiderman used his Spider powers to adhere to MJ's foot and began to climb to the top of her foot . When he reached her ankle he was nearly thrown off when she moved her foot in her sleep. When she stopped he began climbing again. As he climbed he noticed that her legs were perfeclty smooth \"Great she buy's expensive lingere, champene and has her legs waxed in anticipation of our romantic evening and I'm missing it all because i'm 1cm tall and she's had so much champene she's asleep. when she wake up and I'm not here she will be sad or pissed one I hope she don't take it out on me.\" he thought as he climbed at about her knee he had to take a rest because of how small he is and the fact that he is burnig up from the heat of her titanic body. Suddenly he started laughing to himself \"I call my self Spiderman and now I'm the size of a spider gotta love irony\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued his slow climb up her leg till he got to her thigh and stoped to notice two things, one. Her negligee begins above him and it will be hard  to climb, Two.

She couldn't be certain exactly what WOULD happen and Nadia probably wouldn't like the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nadia was distracted, Kamala slid through an open window, keeping her treasure in her arms. When she was away from the house, Kamala returned to normal size sprinted away before slowing into a nonchalant walk, looking for a good, wide area to test her potential new size. It would also be good if there were some larger buildings around so she could gauge she just how big she would get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was finally free to unleash the Pym particles and see what they could really do! She popped them open and without activating her powers she started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited and looked around.Her surroundings shrunk, a sensation that wasn't new to her, though her growth was slower than usual. It felt... different. She wasn't stretching herself, instead new tissue was forming by the second. At first it felt painful, but then it felt invigorating like she knew she was getting stronger by the second. She soon towered over houses, reaching and surpassing her usual limit, then kept growing as though nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamala had heard the Pym Particles could strain the users mind and body, which is why Henry and Nadia were reluctant to grow, but she actually felt pretty great.

That was great! How did this work exactly? Was she twice as strong and twice as tough? She couldn't wait to see the looks on the Avengers faces when they could see what she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet she wanted more. 60 feetish was about the \"normal\" size for a pym particle user but she knew they could get larger than that and she had taken a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe concentrated, willing the Pym Particles to continue their work. The buildings around her grew smaller and smaller, she had to watch her step lest she crush a car or person and still rose higher, her body quickly becoming large and wide enough that she  had to stand with her legs apart. Hmm if she wanted to test her limits she was going to have to find somewhere she could really cut loose.  Fortunately her new height gave her a better view. She could see a wide open park. Perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamalla headed towards it, watching every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me! Superhero coming through!\" That was fun to say! People gawked up at her, though they weren't too scared. They had seen giant heroes before, though rarely as large as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly reached the park and was soon so large that she almost crushed the trees with her feet. She had to be over 200ft now. Probably 250ish but she had no way of being sure. She still wasn't feeling the supposed strain this put on a size shiftier which in her book was a good sign. Now it was time to use her powers and see what she could really do. Kamalla took a second to think about this.  Her powers allowed her to grow about six times her normal size,, though she wasn't truly sure she had reached her limits, so if there wasn't any complication or side effect of mixing the pym particles with her Inhuman powers, unless it unlocked some kind of hidden ability or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell no point speculating about that, it was time to put this the test.

Bigger than a mountain? And yet still she grew.

Before long her head pushed through the atmosphere and the rest of her soon followed. How was she not suffocating? It seemed impossible, yet here she was.  Her thoughts were distracted by the beauty of space and the glistening stars around her.  She noticed the earth was seeming further and away, and took a step in to space, allowing her self to float. Before long she would be able to put her arms around the earth, then soon hold in her hands. She watched the planet dwindle before her eyes, having an urge to poke it just to say, say she,  though feared the .destruction she might cause.

She finally opens her eyes and sees blue, then she hears a sound of something coming to her, it made the sound of what a fly makes when right next to her ear. She looked and saw a Very tiny plane that was no bigger then her pinkie toe, she saw all the people looking at her in awe. While giving the citizens a gentle smile, she then decided to wave at them and say hello. When she waved, then plane went straight down. Janet with a casual move of her hand, let it land on the palm of her hand. She then asked \" Is everyone all right\"? The pilots gave her a thumbs up and she gave a huge sigh, she then apologized to the people and when they left her palm, she looked down at the city. The skyscrapers only reached her waist, her showdow covered New York itself. People were staring up at Giant girl in shock. They knew she could get big but never have they ever seen her get this big. People had there phones out recording it and sending it out on social media, there were also other news channels covering at the super heroine massive size. There were some people who were fine with the new size Giant girl had, but there were others who had there concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople were wondering what she was going to do, because there were no Aliens, Giant monsters, or Giant robots. There was nothing going on so why would she be using this new size now? Some speculated she was just testing her new growth out, or maybe there was an accident and she grew to this new size. Others thought she was trying to take over the world and be some type of goddess, others thought she was going to kill all the humans. So what does she do now?</span></div></div>",

People who were daring enough would run up and touch her boots, which Janet would SEE and just giggle at. Helicopters from news station got a better look at her. Her hair looked like a giant corn field, her back stretched for what look like forever, and some helicopters even got a great look at her rear end, but Janet put a stop to that by glaring at them, and because they loved living, they backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet couldn't contain her excitement and just had to smile. She had done it, broken past her growth limit and had gained more power than she thought she could have. On top of that, she became the focus of the news, while in most cases she didn't like having all the attention, right now she was loving it. Everyone was loving her new size and some were now calling her a goddess, she also got even bigger breast, which could easily destroy a building, and a enormous Butt. She looked behind and saw a lot of men, even a couple of women looking at her ass. \"Well what to do now, hmmm, oh yea\" Janet lifted her head high in the air and had a big, kinda evil smile on her face, \" I think it's time to pay rock face a visit, now I just have to get his attention\". Janet then got an idea and turned her head, where she spotted a helicopter right next to her, she then asked \" hey, could bring that camera you got there and focus on my face\" they obliged her and everyone could one see her enormous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey rock face or whatever your name is, I want a rematch, so meet me in the desert and fight me, then will see who the biggest and strongest is\"! She then looked down and said \" excuse me, could you people be so kind and move out of the streets, I really don't want to stomp on you guys\" they moved. Then she lifted her boot up, people could see every little thing on the bottom of her boot, the dust, crumbs, and sand between the soles of her boot, it then came down with a massive BOOM, causing everyone to be lifted off the ground. Other people waved her on, cheering her name, some even going on there knees and bowing down to her.

They weren't stupid and knew while crime has gone low, it doesn't mean it has stopped, so they decided to leave the friendly neighborhood wall crawler and size changing heroine to defend the city. The two youngest members tried to get Tony to reconsider, but the billionaire play boy would not let up. Now we see the two heroes dressed up in there regular clothes and being Peter Parker and Janet Van Dyne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were eating at, in Peter's choice of words, the best burger joint in New York. We see them both sitting outside, with there food in front of them, Janet reached in first and had the first bite. Peter looked on with a smug smirk as Janets eyes shot up as bright as Tony's armour and she began to scarves it down as fast as the Hulk. After a few minutes of eating in silence, Jan leaned back in her chair as her not so amused face came back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter thanks for taking me here, and I know you have all ready heard this from me for the billionth time, but man I'm Pissed off\"! Peter looked at her with a small smile \" hey I know, I would rather be on vacation to, but\" he said this with dragging the last word out \"if Captain America thinks us two staying here is a good Idea, then we're probably doing what's best\". Janet looked back at him with a LOOK that said are you kidding me \" Pete, you do know this was Tony's Idea right? I mean I love Tony, but you and I both know his Ideas usually don't work\". Peter tried to rebuttal his friend but couldn't come up with any more arguments, so he just gave up and kept eating, his eyes drifting back and fourth between Janet and a couple guys starring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet looked where he was looking to see the boys starring at her with drool coming out there mouths. She giggled and waved at them before returning to her food, and finishing off the fries. The two then headed off and went to a ally, which was a short cut to Avengers Tower. Just as they passed by a trash can, the group of boys from earlier came and surrounding them. A muscular man, who looked to be around his early 20s got up close to them, and put a hand on Janets face. He gave her a disgusting smirk \" Hey sweetie if you want to get passed, you got to give me some \"special treat\", his buddy's all laughed, but then they stopped as they heard Peter laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader then went to Peter and picked him up by his shirt \" WHAT YOU LAUGHING AT, ARE YOU STUPID OR INSANE?! It was then he heard all his guys scream and run, before he could yell at them to come back, he noticed a huge showdow completely cover him. He looked back and saw that the women wasn't just any women, she was Giant Girl, and she looked pissed. She picked him up easily and then said in a dark tone \" When I'm done beating you, you better clean up your act, or I will find you, and I will swallow you up, GOT THAT?! It was then the man started to beg and cry, Janet then knocked him out with one punch. She looked back at Peter with a scowl on her face \" you could have helped\", Peter gave her a smile and said \" yea I could have, but you handled tougher things before, I was sure you could have squashed him like  a bug if you wanted\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, but let's get going, I'm already getting hungry and I might have you as a snack\".

You see a woman scurrying around the floor in panic as you scoop her up and examine her. You look at your table of slaves and say \"Let this serve as an example.\" You take the screaming woman and set her on your tongue, which is laying out of your mouth, slowly retreating her into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You toy with the woman, swishing her around before taking the lady out with two fingers. The shocked woman struggled as you brought her up to your teeth, where you slowly bit into her stomach. She hollers in pain as you stop and lift your tongue up, making the morsel fall into your throat as you was her down with a swallow.

X-force V3 issue 25 if you're wondering. She was robbed I tell you.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My children...' Selene's voice echoed, Selene's inner circle looked up in awe of the newly ascended goddess before them, her glowing blue form towered above her palace 'I hunger. Bring them to me, the sacrifices... The ones with power... All of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inner circle did as they were told and set out to gather any who had not been absorbed by Selene. Nearby, X-Force were trying to come up with a plan to defeat the new dark goddess. Warpath explains that the worlds magic users cannot be relied upon to help, as they have been affected the worse by Selene's ascension. Warpath proceeds to teach his team the ghostdance so that Selene cannot consume their souls. (ass pull) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inner circle finish collecting the last of the resurrected on Necrosha and Blink teleports them back to the palace, just in time for X-force to barge in and attack them. A fight breaks out between the two groups with the inner circle ending up on the back foot. Warpath confronts his brother ,Thunderbird, who is under Selene's control, Thunderbird unable to directly help his brother has just enough control to inform Warpath that the only way to defeat her is to stab her in the heart with her own knife, which Thunderbird possesses. Warpath manages to break his brothers neck and claim the knife 'It'll be over soon' he says to Thunderbird and begins to make his way towards Selene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene senses Thunderbirds death 'No' she says as she realises someone has taken her knife. (divergence from comic incoming) Selene looks down at her feet and see's the members of X-force looking up at her and Blink teleporting away with Mortis. Enraged she slams her fist down at them but they manage to evade her (she doesn't shrink down to fight them in this story) 'The X-men. Xavier and his children, fighting to the end, how noble.' Selene's powerful voice boomed down at them 'But the end is here, worms. Your souls are mine now! And I will have them all!</span></div></div>",

'Because you are weak' Angel yells at her. Selene snarls, before a grin creeps across her face 'If I cannot feed on your souls, then I will have to be satisfied with burning the flesh off your bodys.' Selene boomed before burning then crushing Angel to a pulp in her hand and letting his ashes fall onto his teammates below. 'You fucking bitch' Domino screamed as she opened fire on the massive goddess 'Do you truly believe that your claws and knives and guns can kill me? I am a goddess!' Selene bellowed as X-force charged forward and began attacking her 'I am beyond this realm! I am beyond human and mutant!' she continued as she crushed Wolfsbane beneath her gigantic boot 'You are nothing to me! I am Selene! I am..' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey' Selene was interrupted by Warpath who was running towards her, knife in hand 'We get it. You're Selene. Now how about you shut up 'goddess' and get ready to die.' Selene's eyes narrowed as she noticed the knife in his hand 'You are a fool if you think you can stop me now' she roared and stepped back out of what remained of her palace and smashed her arm into it, sending the structure crashing down upon X-force. Selene began laughing in triumph, it boomed across Necrosha, echoing with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued laughing until she saw movement out of the corner of her eye. Looking down she saw the mangled form of X-23 clawing her way out of the rubble 'What do we have here then' she chuckled 'Don't know when to stay down, do you.' Selene reached down and plucked the helpless girl from the ground. X-23 struggled as much as her broken body would allow, but her healing factor wasn't repairing her fast enough 'Cease your pointless struggles, you cannot escape me' Selene said as she brought the tiny girl up to her face, Selene noticed that X-23 was healing. Selene studied the girl in her hand and became curious 'you seem a little young to be running around with assassins, what's your name?' Selene's question was met with stony silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndeterred, Selene began probing X-23's mind, the young girl tried to resist but couldn't stop the dark goddess from seeing her memory's, her entire life. 'Hmm' Selene smiled 'I have myself a born killer, you should have been part of my inner circle, Laura isn't it?' 'I would never join you' X-23 said, her body sufficently healed, allowing her to talk. 'Why not? you have more in common with my little circle than the X-Men' Selene smiled and then continued 'Speaking of which, it appears I have lost a few followers, no matter. If they could not survive then they were not worthy enough to follow me.' Selene began speaking to her captive again 'You survived when they could not, I think you should replace one of them, don't you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX-23 began squirming again and yelled 'no, i'm nothing like you' 'Such fire, and you're right, you're not like me. I am a goddess and desire your service Laura. Make no mistake, you will join my side and be the first of my heralds.' Selene boomed 'I saw what protects your soul from me Laura, this ghostdance. Now hold still.' <br>\r\nSelene began to bring X-23 closer to her face and to X-23's horror, Selene opened her mouth. X-23 began to squirm and yell furiously which caused a laugh to emanate from Selene's throat. X-23 screamed as she was pushed into Selene's colossal mouth, her small body was wrapped in Selene's powerful tongue and drawn in further. Selene savoured the tiny girl thrashing around inside her mouth 'Mmm' she moaned. Inside Selene's mouth X-23 heard the moan all around her and looked towards its origin, there was just enough light for X-23 to see Selene's massive, powerful throat, that could easily swallow her whole. She began fighting more ferociously, but could do nothing but wait for the dark goddess to devour her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo X-23' surprise, her expected fate never came. Instead she was gradualy massaged by Selene's huge tongue, until finally being deposited back into the goddesses hand. 'I dont..' X-23 sputtered. covered in saliva 'Understand?' Selene boomed 'have you not noticed my little Laura?' It slowly dawned on X-23 what Selene had done as she looked at her skin. The paint was gone, the one thing stopping Selene from devouring her soul has been sucked away. X-23 shook and closed her eyes. This met with laughter from Selene 'Laura, I can feel your soul now, you are mine, now and forever' Selene reached inside X-23, but instead of consuming the young girls soul, she began altering it.</span></div></div>",

She leapt forward, knocking Iron Man aside, and using her cybernetic arm, she delivered a shock to Thanos's hand, loosening his grip on the Infinity Gauntlet. Before the Earth's heroes could react, she herself had pulled the gauntlet from his hand. The power it contained flowed through her and was almost more than she could bear--but she knew she could not stay. With the power of the Space Stone, she let the Gauntlet pull her towards one of the two remaining stones. The Mind Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Wakanda, Shuri had managed to separate Vision's mind from the Infinity Stone which formed the core of his brain. With Wanda fighting in the battle, though, they had no way to destroy it. They wouldn't even get the chance. Nebula appeared in the lab and took the newly-detached Mind Stone from Vision's forehead where it still lay. In another cloud of blue space-warping energy, Nebula vanished again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Titan, Nebula reappeared in front of Dr. Strange. \"Now, wizard. You will submit to my power and surrender the last Stone.\" Against the power of the Mind Stone, he could not resist and surrendered the stone to her. She had now completed the Infinity Gauntlet, and had the power of a god. But unlike her adoptive father, she did not feel the need to destroy half the universe. Instead, she would make it all her plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the world returned to the way it was before Thanos began assembling the gauntlet. Those who had fought him and his forces would still remember what had happened as if a dream, but things were back to the way they should be, more or less, but with a cruel and bitter new goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Nebula thought, what should be her first decree as the new goddess of the universe?</span></div></div>",

The girls relaxed, deciding to sit down on the massive palm of there friend and see what it was like to sleep on a goddess. By God, it felt great! Despite her body being tough enough that planets exploding only tickled her and being able to take punches from Gods, her skin was soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower girl grinned down at them \" Hey you two, enjoying your nap time\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two just nodded, to busy trying to comprehend how Karen's hand can be so comfortable. Then all of a sudden, Karen felt one of her muscles spasm. During the pain she accidentally dropped the two teens and with the spasm only lasting a second, she luckily caught them again with little to no problem. Fearing that might happen again, the massive super heroine put the them on the ground and after that she sat down, letting her back rest on a mountain nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlee ran to Karen's side quickly, with misfit not far behind. The two got right next to Karen's leg and deciding she was close enough for her friend to hear her, she says \" Karen are you ok\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked at her with a gentle smile \" Yea I'm fine, just a little pain in my muscles, probably a side effect of the growth.\" In her mind though, Karen was very scared of what had happened. Her friend's at the JSA sent her a message when Atlee went to get Misfit. The message had said that the sunlight the kryptonians use for there power was going to increase by a tremendous factor. The only reason they could think this was happening was that now that Karen was so big, her cells size have also increased. They were going to need more energy and the sun could give them plenty of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, Karen couldn't help but be happy. She had always been weaker then her cousin Kal-El and on some occasions Super girl as well. Now she can be stronger then them, not just a little stronger, but WAY stronger. Her finger alone could more than likely beat them in a arm wrestling contest. Hell forget about her limbs, her ASS alone could defeat the two kryptonians no problem. Not that she would do anything like that! Those two were her family, the last of her mind. She looked at for them like a big sister. Well giant now but still, actually thinking about it, maybe she could ask Kal and Super girl to go have a sparring match. She would very much want to know who could win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other, all the power she had now, she barely has any control of it. When the sun comes out, this power is going to get way BIGGER. The last thing she wants is to grab someone between her fingers and crush them like a grape. Well with a little training and some help, she could learn to take that kind of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked down and picked up the two little hero's. She began to float while saying \" Time to get back to work girls, and-oh shit, didn't even think of where to put you guys\". The blonde giantess then looked at her massive cleavage, then at the two teens. The two knew what she was thinking and didn't want to do her idea at all. They protested but the massive heroine plucked them from the ground and put them between her massive boobs with no Waring. The two screamed as loud as they could, but Karen ignored them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to save an explanation for later, and actually enjoying the little ones squirm in there, she set off to her city.

But, Zatanna uttered another backwards-spell to levitate it into her hands. She then uttered a third spell, making it small enough to fit in the empty diamond setting of a gold ring on her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this had been accomplished, she waved her left hand while saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ecurB, egreme-er sa eht taB-eineg. yletelpmoC tneidebo ot em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis resulted in a second cloud of smoke.

Mary giggled at his voice, which sounded very quiet and high-pitched, \u2018yes, I can hear you, little officer\u2019. \u2018Good, because I have to tell you that you are causing the destruction to the city with your gigantic size\u2019, officer continued speaking into his loudspeaker, \u2018but this was on accident, because streets are too narrow to fit in and people and cars are too small to notice\u2019, \u2018Whether it was by accident or on purpose, you are under arrest\u2019, he finished and Mary</span></div></div>",
