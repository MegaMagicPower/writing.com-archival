Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character was making the same motions with nearly exactly the same timing as the last attempt, and the one before that. Each press of the keyboard was refined to a science, to the point where Sam could feel intuitively the actions of the protagonist. He had spent ever hour of his free time for the past six days looking at the heroine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back, to the point where real life seemed to fade away.\u00e2\u0080\u009droll here, wait a second... align the camera to the fourth stripe in the wall, and here we go. After this is 3 minutes of non stop panic. Following my failure, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another ten minutes to get back here, assuming I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fuck things up again, in which case I will need to reload my save, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to tack on another 20.\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Sam takes a deep breath. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the last one he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take before his defeat. Probably something stupid this time around. A misclick. A badly preformed roll. Falling off the cliff the devs decided to put smack dab in the middle of the arena.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWelp, here goes\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For the first phase of the boss, everything went smoothly. There was an easily identifiable rhythm that he had at this point master. When the right arm goes up, backstep. When the left arm goes up, side step toward the attack. When both arms go up, sprint through the giants legs. Each successful dodge gives you enough time to make one attack. Of course, if you had invested early on in ranged attacks, the whole fight is already finished. But alas, here he was, chipping away at the boss with his meager short sword, because his lightning spear did next to no damage to unarmored enemies. After about 10 minutes wasted hacking away, the boss entered the second phase. The phase where Sam had died 2,000 times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the second phase of the boss is pure Rng. While Sam has beaten bosses ranked as fans as much harder, the element  of randomness left him despondent. However, today, luck seemed to be on his side. He got three easy attacks in a row, and, having used the majority of his consumables, ended the fight with relative ease. \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>finally</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d sam wheeled back and watched the prerendered cutscene. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is it\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, skipping through all the dialogue lines.

I\u2019ve mastereed this section\u201d. Perhaps boosted by this confidence, he is able to complete the entire pathway to the boss without difficulty. Bizarrely enough, now that the boss had been completed once, Sam found it easy to repeat again.  But as he went skipping through the final cutscene once more, the same thing happened. Not even restarting it allowed access to completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam tried again and again, and was now beating the boss every time. He could began mimicking Scarlet\u2019s grunts whenever he rolled, to ease the boredom. But nothing would change, the game refused to be won. It felt like each grunt from scarlet was mocking him rather than the opposite, the game knowingly forcing him to listen to the same audio clips over and over again. Sam was stuck like this.

He wiped the sweat off his brow with the back of his hand. Lifting five sixty-pound boxes was a task in and of itself, but putting them on the third shelf \u2014 that was a goddamn ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy weight fell on his shoulder, sending him whirling back to meet a face that seemed to be mostly smile, besides the coiff of blonde hair framing its top. It was Kevin, his senior at work and age, by one year and three years respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn good job, Zach,\u201d he remarked, striding around the storage room. \u201cYou\u2019re strong as hell, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach\u2019s head jerked up and down in brief acknowledgment. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t wanna work the register, man? It\u2019s <i>way</i> easier than lugging all this stuff around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m good. Dealing with customers is a bit\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c..easy.\u201d finished Kevin. \u201cJust give people their change and ask the old ladies how their day was, and you don\u2019t have to break your back for two hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach rolled his shoulders and winced slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not that much of a people person, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey meandered to the clock card system, both fishing their respective cards out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose not being a \u2018people person\u2019 means you don\u2019t wanna get drinks with me and some other guys?\u201d asked Kevin. \u201cBuffalo Wild Wings, forty minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m also not a\u2026 drinks guy.\u201d Zach swiped his card in the ancient machine, which chugged for a good four seconds before inking the appropriate rectangle. \u201cAnd, it\u2019s Friday, so I \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool, it\u2019s cool.\u201d Kevin raised his hands in the air in placation. \u201cJust floating it out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thanks for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vaguely awkward silence persisted as they both shed their uniforms and meandered towards the staff exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later, Kev.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, Zach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside Zach twisted itself into a knot of guilt. It wasn\u2019t that Kevin wasn\u2019t a good guy, it was just that he.. well..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n\u201cHeyoo, everyone, Zee-Gamer here with ya! <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">god i really need to change that name</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 had better things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not better, per se, just things he wanted to do more. He wanted to return to his kingdom of LCD displays and wires, his 52\u2019window into a different world. He wanted to <i>stream</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreaming served to destree and excite, all without the fuss-and-muss of face-to-face interaction. He had been particularly interesgtd by the speedrunning section of the internet and even amassed a couple WRs of his own on some logging sites. There was just one big problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach took a peek at his recording monitor. The value he was looking for was on the bottom right: Viewers: 2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was him, and the other was his bot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pained wince was quickly replaced with a bright smile, not that it mattered; he didn\u2019t even have a face cam. It's not like he was expecting a larger number, he was just hoping for one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter. The show must go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, so tonight we\u2019ll be running Bepisman.\u201d He shuffled through some papers he had on his desk. \u201cIt\u2019s an ad-game parody, but it\u2019s pretty tightly made, so there\u2019ll be less glitch-skips than normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen lit up with the unskippable intro cutscene: Bepisman looking forlornly into the horizon where his erstwhile paramour \u2014 Lady Ocke \u2014 was overlaid, clutching a billowing hankie to her forehead in an eternal swoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so, um, the MC is <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">named Bepisman because of Pepsi</font>, <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">and the girl\u2019s Ocke</font> <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">because of Coke...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, he was mumbling again. He snuck a peek at the count again: 4 viewers! Nice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe game\u2019s a neat mix of Ghost and Goblins and, uh, the Persona games, I guess. You\u2019ll see the second part in a bit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe navigated Bepisman through the halls of Castle Bepis with alacrity, only stopping at a short, rotund man who bore a striking resemblance to a grain mascot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is Earl Quaker, and normally I wouldn\u2019t talk to any NPCs, but you have to sit through all of his dialogue if you want the end game weapon early, so, uh, buckle in, I guess. NPC\u2019s have amechanics that are \u201d<br>\r\nHe hit the TALK button and started mashing it, skipping through the entirety of the geezer\u2019s dialogue. Still, it took a good two minutes, during which his eyes were glued to the chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreatGazoolie: lol wtf is this ResidentSleeper game<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfiregirl426: shutup i like the pixel art<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this part is a little boring, Gazoolie, sorry.\u201d Zach nervously chuckled. \u201cAnd yeah, Firegirl, I like the art too. There\u2019s a lotta heart in the game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreatGazoolie: LUL u just got kaepora\u2019d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfiregirl426: look at the screen &lt;:o<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach\u2019s eyes shot back to the screen. Shit. The earl\u2019s dialogue reached a \u201cWould you like me to repeat that?\u201d and he accidentally hit \u2018Yes\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops. Uh, sorry, chat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening didn\u2019t go better than that. People flitted in and out of the chat (mostly out), some leaving messages of encouragement, and some leaving less than-encouraging messages. Those stuck in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nzomgcopter: LUL is this prerecorded? hes not talkin at all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nkripyatgmr: does this dood have fisher price router? its like im watching JPG slideshow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxnubletronxX: do u have a schedule? or r these streams just random?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach took the brief time afforded during another unskippable cutscene to grimace. They each had a point: He was focusing a bit too much on the game to interact with chat, if he even spoke at all! The last ten minutes had consisted of relieved sighs on successful skips and pained groans whenever RNG screwed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a look at his desk revealed His setup was a ramshackle nest of cords and HDMI cables with a dollar-store capture card. He could probably skim some money from his budget to upgrade one thing or another, but he\u2019d be eating ramen for a couple of weeks if he tried that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last comment was a bit on-the-nose. His streams were spontaneous and highly conditional: he had to have enough time and energy after work to try one. Fridays usually were \u2018The Day\u2019 but even that wasn\u2019t consistent. Some stammered half-response would have to do for an answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Zach zero to death\u2019d the boss with a grimace on his face. There were only 3 people left in the chat \u2014 GreatGazoolie and firegirl had shot him a follow before leaving, fortunately \u2014 and he was on time to set a new record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018s not like anyone\u2019s gonna watch some nobody play a fangame...\u201d he grumbled. Sure it was what <i>he</i> wanted to do, but it wasn\u2019t gonna grow his fanbase. He clicked the split timer on its final subdivision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 2:11:04. New world record. Thrilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright guys\u2026 Er, guy, I guess. Sorry for the bellyaching, but I\u2019m winding down the stream for tonight.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response from chat. Typical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach shut down the recording software and streaming portal with knit eyebrows and a sputtering of air from pursed lips. Sure, he wasn\u2019t expecting to get, like, <i>front-page</i> big in six months\u2019 time, but, y\u2019know, getting at least double-digit\u2019s\u2019d be nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set records! He beat times on games that were actually played! That had to count for something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite his supplication to a sense of fairness in the world, ten people did <i>not</i> subscribe to him on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared up at the ceiling and groaned. If only <i>something</i> could change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach was drawn from his \u2018woe-is-me\u2019 soliloquy by\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Someone had posted something in his chat that was, evidently, not as dead as he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squinted at the message; it was from some user called \u2018DeusEstMachina\u2019, which had to be one of the more pretentious names he had seen on the site. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach raised a host of emotional walls in preparation for the message, a precaution that his bruised ego <i>insisted</i> was necessary. If this jamoke saved a message for after the dream, it had to be something particularly vitriolic\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeusEstMachina: GROW YOUR VIEWERBASE FOR **FREE** BY END OF TOMORROW PROMISED!! CLICK HERE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a shortened URL. Zach frowned. This was almost worse. Scratch that, this <i>was</i> worse; there\u2019d be no emotional catharsis of banning some jerk, just the sad, sad Old-Yeller-ing of a spambot. Shouldn\u2019t the auto-admin take care of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s my first one,\u201d Zach mumbled, aiming his cursor over the offending message, bringing up the almighty drop-down menu...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he fatfingered the link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goddammit,\u201d moaned the streamer aspirant as various tabs opened and closed like a series of possessed doors. He brought out the big guns quickly: ctrl+alt+shift-ing Task Manager open before anything bad could happen \u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownload manager pop-up. Uh oh. File explorer was accessed immediately, but the file \u2014 temporalcircuit.exe \u2014 wouldn\u2019t budge for anything, not even the almighty delete function. Sighing, Zach went to get a drink of water as his antivirus puttered to life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only got five steps away from his desks and four seconds into another session of self-pity before the error noise rang out so loud he could hear it from his headphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach negotiated the five steps\u2019 distance as quickly as he could without stumbling over the rapunzel-length bundle of cords stemming from his computer. He reached for his headphones from instinct, but stopped himself <i>right</i> before he put them on which saved him a visit to the doctor; considering the volume of the muzak that shot out of the things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA purple window sat in the middle of his screen, bright clashing yellow letters reading \u2018POPULAR MAKER ONE DAY GUARANTEE\u2019, a neon green button labeled \u2018START\u2019 beneath it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach grimaced as hard as he could. This <i>screamed</i> malware. Poorly written, kill-your-computer malware. He tried to click away, but once again, the error noise blared out even louder than the music. Task-manager was once again accessed, but it bounced off the program like a sword off plate-mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaddya mean, \u2018Process cannot be ended,\u2019?\u201d Zach grumbled, furiously clicking the useless button. He leaned over the keyboard to his streaming laptop \u2014 to hopefully find a solution that didn\u2019t involve bricking his tower \u2014 but the enter key must\u2019ve been pressed somehow, because a chime rang out from his discarded headphones, loud as Big Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jerked back to the recesses of his uncomfortable chair with a grunt, followed shortly after by a groan. The janky \u2018START\u2019 screen had vanished and been replaced by another window, headed by \u2018EZ ONE-STEP QUESTION ANSWER\u2019 in the same yellow-on-purple vomit aesthetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach set his face into hard lines. This\u2026 felt like a lost cause. The broken-english .exe in front of him clearly wasn\u2019t going to go, and it probably would\u2019ve ransomed his data five minutes before if it was going to do that. Maybe this was some weird esoteric data-gathering program that just <i>happened</i> to look like the bad kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might as well give it a shot \u2014 the reckless move partially motivated by the fact that his phone and laptop didn\u2019t seem to be responding to his desperate pleas for search-engine access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the purple program in front of him had a <i>lot</i> of questions written in disparately competent English to choose from. Like, scroll-down-for-five-minutes a lot. Whenever a question was clicked on, a weird multiple-choice was brought up with equally manifold examples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird was definitely the word for it</i>, he considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrow still knit in slight concern, Zach scrolled at random and selected the query\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If it had been something like 'Why do you want to be popular?' it would've been a no-brainer. To make a decent amount of money, have a decent quality of life with the hobby he enjoyed evolving into a full-time career, and to have a decent ego boost from having his name mentioned on different online communities. Maybe someday he'd even get the honor of being in one of those speedrunning compilations of a particularly beloved title, finally setting a new world record after having mastered every technique, every exploit, every oversight the game had to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this question? It wasn't really something Zach had been anticipating. He was somewhat lucky that there were pre-determined answers in front of him rather than a free response box. Otherwise it was 50/50 as to whether he'd actually write a meaningful answer that made use of all the allotted characters or just type in 'idk' and call it a day. He started looking over the options available to him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>My looks.</b> <i>Becoming the kind of streamer that people want to stick around for isn't always easy. That being said, your genetics definitely gave you an early advantage, allowing people to come for the content and stay for the lingering questions in their head like 'What's this knockout doing playing video games all alone on a Friday night?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome air went through his nose a little quicker than usual as he found the idea quite humorous. \"That's exactly it; I got into the speedrunning game so people could stare at my Adonis-like features. This program really <i>does</i> get me!\" He hadn't even really considered the use of a webcam up until now- his rather introverted nature assumed people would flock to his channel solely for the gaming content, rather than watching the man behind the scenes. \"I guess if I really was that easy on the eyes it'd probably be worth it, but as is no one's going to care what some random 6/10 nobody looks like while running through Bubble Bobble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>My raw talent.</b> <i>Despite the presence of so many fish in the ever-expanding sea of gaming videos, you managed to break from the pack and stand out. Could it be your penchant for finding new ways to break a game? Or maybe your complete dedication to avoiding mistakes in your runs? Either way, you seem to bring that special something to every one of your streams, and your fans know it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to believe that's true, but...\" Zach seemed a little dejected. He wasn't the type to discover new exploits on his own, so that was an unlikely avenue of success. And at the end of the day, it would be silly to say that he was one of the best speedrunners in the world right now. If he <i>was</i>, surely he'd already be famous, right? Besides, how much did being talented matter if he never branched out from the niche games he admittedly was so fond of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>My personality.</b> <i>Your gaming prowess was never really the way to popularity for you. Rather, it's your ability to be down-to-earth that your audience finds appealing. You listen to feedback, and give the people what they want. No bullshit, just a friendly all-around wholesome (albeit a bit awkward) person, inviting others to come together as a community with a mutual love for gaming. When fans have told you that they basically considered you a friend, you didn't even bat an eye.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only it was that easy,\" Zach scoffed. It sounded to him an apt description of 80% of streamers as a whole. Getting popular on personality alone seemed virtually impossible without being either A) exceedingly lucky or B) an eccentric that people came to stare at in awe and confusion. Not having to develop a fake persona just to grow interest in his streams was certainly more desirable, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with some of these descriptions anyway? Feels like I'm doing character customization for Twitch Simulator 2020,\" Zach questioned. Regardless, he knew he should pick <i>something</i> in the hopes of getting this damned program off his computer. After some internal deliberation, he finally moused over... </span></div></div>",
