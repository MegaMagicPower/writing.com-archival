Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character was making the same motions with nearly exactly the same timing as the last attempt, and the one before that. Each press of the keyboard was refined to a science, to the point where Sam could feel intuitively the actions of the protagonist. He had spent ever hour of his free time for the past six days looking at the heroine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back, to the point where real life seemed to fade away.\u00e2\u0080\u009droll here, wait a second... align the camera to the fourth stripe in the wall, and here we go. After this is 3 minutes of non stop panic. Following my failure, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another ten minutes to get back here, assuming I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fuck things up again, in which case I will need to reload my save, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to tack on another 20.\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Sam takes a deep breath. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the last one he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take before his defeat. Probably something stupid this time around. A misclick. A badly preformed roll. Falling off the cliff the devs decided to put smack dab in the middle of the arena.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWelp, here goes\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For the first phase of the boss, everything went smoothly. There was an easily identifiable rhythm that he had at this point master. When the right arm goes up, backstep. When the left arm goes up, side step toward the attack. When both arms go up, sprint through the giants legs. Each successful dodge gives you enough time to make one attack. Of course, if you had invested early on in ranged attacks, the whole fight is already finished. But alas, here he was, chipping away at the boss with his meager short sword, because his lightning spear did next to no damage to unarmored enemies. After about 10 minutes wasted hacking away, the boss entered the second phase. The phase where Sam had died 2,000 times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the second phase of the boss is pure Rng. While Sam has beaten bosses ranked as fans as much harder, the element  of randomness left him despondent. However, today, luck seemed to be on his side. He got three easy attacks in a row, and, having used the majority of his consumables, ended the fight with relative ease. \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>finally</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d sam wheeled back and watched the prerendered cutscene. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is it\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, skipping through all the dialogue lines. He went to the npc to claim his end credits...<br>\r\nAnd the npc gave him a choice prompt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe time is how or never, Scarlet. The choice is yours, will you follow your ancestors and claim the giant-heart, or retain your humanity, at the expense of-<br>\r\nSam skipped the dialogue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho cares, I already won.

I\u2019ve mastereed this section\u201d. Perhaps boosted by this confidence, he is able to complete the entire pathway to the boss without difficulty. Bizarrely enough, now that the boss had been completed once, Sam found it easy to repeat again.  But as he went skipping through the final cutscene once more, the same thing happened. Not even restarting it allowed access to completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam tried again and again, and was now beating the boss every time. He could began mimicking Scarlet\u2019s grunts whenever he rolled, to ease the boredom. But nothing would change, the game refused to be won. It felt like each grunt from scarlet was mocking him rather than the opposite, the game knowingly forcing him to listen to the same audio clips over and over again. Sam was stuck like this. Able to beat the final section by heart, yet unable to claim its rewards. \u201cWhat could I possibly be doing wrong\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feel free to change how the event occurs (or what happens that day) based on what changes occur each time, but it should be obvious that the characters are stuck in some kind of weird time loop (whether they are aware of it or not is up to you).
