Curious inhabitants approached these portals and a few even entered the portals. With a loud whoosh the inhabitants found themselves moving at high speed to a distant planet. On the distant planet whose day until then had been normal portals began to appear. Bizarrely the portals opened and exited in similar areas (desert to desert, jungle to jungle etc.) Much to the terror of the inhabitants on the exiting side was the giant animals coming out of the portals. To the 'giants' they were confused at their now shrunken surroundings.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the fun begins and where in the 'small' world are we?</span></div></div>",

Nobody was prepared for what was about to happen, as somewhere in the middle of the city a mysterious giant portal appeared. Suddenly something pops out of the portal as it closes with a loud sound, as everybody looked up they all uttered two words. \u201cA Doberman\u201d even though what they were seeing was plain as day the people still had troubles perceiving it, thoughts like how was this even possible crossed their minds. But one thought persisted over all else \u201cwhat is going to happen\u201d, as if answering the questions the giant raises his paw while all the people below look up with awe speechless. Then with speeds almost not matching it\u2019s incredible height it lowers the paw smashing it right in the middle of downtown. The resulting impact creating a shockwave that envelopes everything within range, then the 500 foot tall canine barks out which causes people all over the city to cover their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog hasn\u2019t even noticed the people or even the city right underneath him, though the people didn\u2019t know whether that was a good or bad thing. The Doberman slowly lifts the other massive paw up and again puts it back down, this doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of effort is put into it but the effects on the world below is anything but harmless. And now with two massive craters and a whole lot of destruction underpaw he finally takes notice of the world below him, The giant dog...</span></div></div>",

As the massive Doberman looked down at all the tiny people and buildings a wicked grin appeared on its muzzle, this in turn caused the humans in the city to panic. The dog crushes an overpass with his humongous black paw pads, then with a loud deafening howl he smashes his muscled leg through a row of high rises. Licking his lips the Doberman crushes several cars in a parking lot, as the police start to show up he looks down to a blockade of police and SWAT cars with officers hiding behind cars and firing their pistols. Although the most the bullets can do is provide a minor annoyance about on par with a bug bite, growling menacingly the huge canine pounces down onto the blockade crushing the cars and officers in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly so as to enjoy the feeling of everything under his mighty paws, he stomps through the blockade watching the whole police force run from him. Then he walks over to where all the tallest buildings are, with every single step crushing multiple people and cars. You arrive in a short amount of time looking down at what was supposed to be the crowning achievement of the whole city, but as it was grand for human standards the dog couldn\u2019t help but think how pathetic it looked in his presence.

She has thick, soft purple fur a thick white mane of fur around her head. She carries her thick bushy tail curled up over her back. She loves to be given treats! All that feed her are friends. She loves to give sloppy kisses and hugs. Her belly is huge, she's over twice her ideal weight. She likes it that way. More room for treats! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne moment she was strolling along through a field the next there was a flash and she was in a different place! She looked around. The field was now covered in little houses, streets, cars and lights. In the distance she could see taller buildings. It looked like a normal city, but a toy sized one?! She had no idea that this was no toy city... Yet. She was now standing 750ft at the shoulders. Houses were barely half the height of one of her mighty paws. She yipped when she saw little creatures running about. They wore clothes, stood on two legs and had two arms like the masters back home. But they lacked their own fur, apart from on their heads and they was the size of bugs? Curious she lowered her head over a nearby group of these little creatures and sniffed. They screamed as her suction pulled them up towards her massive wet nose. A few even got sucked right up into her nose! She whined and sneezed violently. The creatures were jettisoned at very high speed with a liberal amount of snot. Their bodies crushed on impact with the ground and coasted in green slimy gunk. The ones who hadn't been sucked into her nose were blown away. Along with nearby cars. The car alarms blared and annoyed her ears! She lifted a paw and smashed it down on the cars, silencing them for good. Her paw let off a loud boom, shattering most windows within a few miles and alerting more to her presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople started to flee in their cars, the streets soon gridlocked. Meanwhile she looked down at the group she had sniffed and sneezed upon. They looked like they needed to calm down.... A big sloppy lick should do the trick! She opens her maw and out slides her saliva coated tongue. The people scream at the sight of her open jaws over them. Her tongue slides out and with a heavy wet slap hits the street. Cracking it under its immense weight. The tongue slides at them people. They scream and run. But the tongue is to fast and wider than the street... Her tongue was 50ft wide! People stick to the great muscle and are dragged under it as it slides along, pulverising them instantly. The tongue leaves a trail of saliva, cracked tarmac, ripped up earth and crushed vehicles. The tongue returns to her maw and she yips. Where had the creatures gone?! But she now had treats to swallow. She gulps loudly and licks her chops. Yummy! If she licked them, they gave her treats! The fact the humans WERE the 'treats' didn't cross her primitive feral mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts her head to study the area around her. The streets are packed with these lovely little creatures. Her tongue lulled, her belly rumbled in anticipation of treats. She also had so much more lovely sloppy kisses to give out! But where to head to first? There was so many choices! There was the highway, jam packed with tens of thousands of cars. The train station was quite busy, there was several trains at the station or just pulling away. Some taller buildings nearby more her height appeared to be full of these creatures. There was the very tall skyscrapers in the city centre and there was also the airport, lots of planes were taking off. She decided to head for... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She finally heads for...</span></div></div>",

She loved to chase them down, Lay on them with her big fat belly and slobber all over them, much to masters annoyance. But he always let her off and gave her treats. But master wasn't here, the train were packed with the little creatures who would surely reward her with treats? A chance to play and eat without being scolded?! She panted merrily as she strolled towards the train station. Her massive paws smashing apart houses and crushing many people and cars. She didn't notice, she was purely focused on the trains. Also she was under the belief that the little creatures would get out of her way. It wasn't her responsibility to step around them... So she ended up crushing thousands without a hint of malice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people at the train station really start to panic when they see her stomping this way. Smashing her way through everything in her path. Some push onto the awaiting train whilst others run. The train driver sees her coming right for his train. He ignores the red light and opens the throttle. ''Come on!'' He cried as his heavily loaded train started to slowly accelerate away. The giant canine was still coming right at him. The beast was panting heavily and it's tail wagged. As it smashed on through the train station and came on after his train. Passengers screamed as the ground started to shake with her heavy paw steps. Overhead her fat belly blocked out the sky as she grunted and began to lay down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda had caught up with the train. Like with masters toy trains she would step ahead then lay down to pin it under her body. Then she would lovingly slobber over every carriage. Soaking them in drool. She rarely chewed. She groaned and laid down, expecting the usual result. But with a mighty thoom and quake her body slams upon the train and ground. She felt a crunch and yelped. Normally that doesn't happen. Confused she stood back up. The train was gone! Only a strange thin metal oozing blood was beneath her?! She whined. That wasn't fun! She wanted to lick it all over and get some treats! But another train is coming at her. She barks happily and lays down, waiting for it to approach her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver couldn't believe his eyes at first. Emerging around the tall buildings he had laid eyes upon a giant canine up ahead! He had seen the giant canine crush the other train. He slammed on the emergency brakes hoping to stop before the giant canine. Which had stood back up, studied the mess then spotted his train and laid back down. ''Please stop!'' He begged as his train approached the awaiting giant. His train passed the outstretched legs and stopped short of the beast's chest. A great maw and slobbering tongue fills his vision as he screamed in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train had stopped right before her muzzle! So thoughtful! She opened her jaws and released her tongue. SLURP! She dragged her mighty muscle lovingly over the locomotive. It groaned and collapsed under the assault. She licks over and over. It felt so good and she got a little treat in the process (the driver). Passengers started to fell out of the train. She saw this and brought her thick legs and paws together. To avoid being crushed the people had no choice to get back on the train. She held the whole train between her long and thick legs. There was no escape, all would be lovingly licked and slobbed upon. Oh and give her treats! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted her head to uncouple the locomotive and spit it aside. She brought her maw over the first carriage and wrapped her tongue around it. Slurping loudly her powerful tongue crushes the carriage in its tight and loving embrace. The windows explode and thick saliva oozes in. Passengers fall out and stick to the tongue. Andromeda swallowed constantly. So many tasty treats! So much to slob over. She continued to slob and suck over every carriage. All the passengers ended up in her fat belly. She finished the last carriage and dropped it. The train was a mangled mess covered in her thick saliva. She whined. The trains weren't usually so fragile. But she got to give out loving sloppy kisses and the creatures had given her loads of treats! It was time to find something else to slob over and to get more treats... She looked around for something else to interact with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue lulled out of her mouth oozing drool and tail wagged rapidly. If it wasn't for the destruction and deaths she would look quite cute. Andromeda finally sets her eyes upon...</span></div></div>",

She has to travel down a street to reach the 'bowl' but she realises how rude she's been. When chasing the trains she had forget of the others filling the streets. How rude of her! She'll have to fix that! She lowers her head and releases her tongue. Lovingly licking over all those in her path and receiving plenty of treats in return! She was a good girl after all. She was completely oblivious to the fact her treats WERE the creatures. She was making slower progress towards the stadium now for she was spreading her love. Security had spotted her approach and chaos followed as the 50,000 people tried to exit the stadium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was busy licking over some people in the stadiums car park when she heard the many screams. Her ears pricked up and she looked at the stadium. She whined. What was causing this commotion. Surely not her, she may be big and powerful but she was just a big cuddly pup? She would have to help calm them all down it seems. She trotted towards the stadium, crushing dozens of cars without noticing. Her tongue lulled and tail wagging. She wanted to look as goofy and friendly as possible. Maybe if she calmed them down they would give her treats? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a great crowd of them running from the stadium before her. She bounded after them. Her paws shaking the ground and knocking many people over. She leaps over them. Shaking the ground violently when she landed and leaving four very deep paw prints. The crowd was knocked over by the impact or stopped in shock/terror. They gawped up at her as she turned around to pant down at them lovingly.

She whined as she would of liked them to give more belly rubs. The creatures buildings looked like they would be nice to rub herself against. She looks around for a suitable building. Her tail wags and she yips happily when she sets eyes upon the perfect structure. A building as thick as her body and even taller than her grabbed her attention.  The fact it was made of highly reflective glass added to it's attraction.. It was perfect! She strolled on over. Squishing many people under her paws without realising. The whole building shook as she came over. Inside people and furniture fly about as her paw steps reverberate throughout the structure. Built to withstand earthquakes the building is at no risk of collapse, nor does any of the glass break... Yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up at the building and with a grunt she lifts up onto her hind legs. She brings her paws around the side of the building high up and with a great smash her paws grip either side of the building tightly. Shattering the extra tough glass with ease. Her paws sink in as she grips the structure. Many people are crushed by her paws of fall through the large openings to their deaths on the ground below. She shuffles her hind paws so her belly slams into the building. The glass cracks in places but manages to remain intact. She holds her head back, looking up into the sky as she also pants heavily as she hugs the building. She grunts and drags her belly up and down, grinding against the building. It groans in protest. Glass breaks in places. The building constantly shakes as she lovingly hugs it. People struggle to flee from the structure. But they start piling out of the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people watch with shock and awe from within their offices. The belly of the canine like a great fluffy curtain. The view of the city now a wall of thick purple fur. The windows cracked and shattered under the immense pressure. The canine's heavy panting audible over her groans and the groans of the building. Outside people who chose the wrong exit had to run under her. Her massive hind paws shifted slightly as she rubbed against the building. There was also the falling debris to content with. But out of desperation many run under her. Some made it, overs were hit by falling shards of razor sharp glass which acted like swords. Furniture was also falling out of the building. Her teats had penetrated a little deeper, and were tearing through floors as she dragged her body up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people who had ran under stopped to look up at her. They was greeted with the sight of her massive fluffy butt cheeks and thick legs. Her thick tail curled up and wagged slowly, revealing her two holes. Her wrinkled tailhole puckered occasionally. Her vagina was small and dry, she wasn't close to being in heat. They gawped up in shock and awe. Some even took out there phones and filmed her hind wriggling about over them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda was lost in ecstasy. The building was so fun to hug! It groaned in protest at her hug but it held. She looked about as she continued her hug. Something catches her attention, There was little creatures standing right under her lovely big fluffy butt! She grinned and wriggled her backside. Giving a little show. After belly rubs she always loved a good butt scratch and it looks like these creatures wanted to give her one! She released the building as she let her hind legs slide aside, dropping her sexy big butt on them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people scream as her butt comes over them. Staying to take photos was not such a good idea after all! They ran but it was to late. WHUMPF! Her butt slams onto the ground. Crushing many under her cheeks. Two unlucky people were not squished but instead ended up her anus! She moaned with pleasure as she could feel the struggles within her arse! She couldn't believe this, so much pleasure all in such a short time. She was really loving this new place and she had so much to explore! She for now sat contently and let the creatures wriggle within her arse. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the 'massage.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so lost in pleasure she hadn't noticed the ________ approaching her at first!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw blue and red flashing lights from down one street. Soon the wailing things appear with the blue and red lights flashing on top. She was now very interested in these wailing things. She releases her butt toys. They were alive, but covered in shit and had a few broken bones. She started to approach them slowly. She cocked her head with curiosity as she approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReports of the giant canine demolishing the city had been believed as a joke at first. Until the police had seen her first hand. Unsure what to do they had waited until a sizable amount of them had gathered. It took a while, the streets in grid lock. They had to guide people out of the city. The canine having been left on her 'rampage' they now headed for her. She was demolishing a building by wrapping herself around it seemed. Equipped with shotguns the convoy of fifty police vehicles emerge down the street from the giant canine. She was sat by the building now, which was damaged but still standing. She was grinding her backside against the ground and groaning contently. She stood up, two people dropped out of her rear, covered in a brown substance often found in bottoms... ''Set up here! Weapons out!'' Ordered the commanding officer. The police pile out of their vehicles and aim their shotguns at her. She was coming at them slowly. The ground shook under each of her steps, they waited for the order to fire. In total there was five hundred of them. Could they stop these monster? They wasn't sure but they had their duty to do. The army was expected to arrive soon as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her amazement hundreds of the little creatures emerge from the wailing flashing things. They all pointed black sticks up at her. She lulled her tongue and wagged her tail. Sticks? Did they want her to play fetch?! She was always happy to play games! She growled playfully and slammed down into a play bow. The ferocious impact knocked many of them over and the wailing things. Huge fissures tore up the street and levelled nearby buildings. The creatures stood back up shouting and aiming their sticks at her.  Their sticks started to pop and burst fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion is, do the guns hurt her or is her fur to thick to penetrate with standard weaponry?    </span></div></div>",

Before arriving here she had drunk quite a large quantity of water and now it wanted to come out! She was going to have to take a leak. But she wasn't just going to squat down any where! How gross! She looked for a suitable place to relieve herself. Buildings crumbling as she casually strolled through them. She stepped on humans without the slightest notice. She looked to an fro for a peeing spot. But all she could see were buildings, streets, humans and raised light transit systems. She whined again as she was now gagging to piss. But with a happy bark she sees a suitable place. There appeared to be a 'burrow' that went under the ground. She could see humans going down there. She bounded on over to the hole and sniffed. She could smell many humans but also waste. Maybe this is where they went to relieve themselves? She'd be a very good girl and pee here, in the right place! She turned around and squatted over the hole. Shifting her paws as she got her rear in the correct position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the subway many hid from the giant stomping about above. her heavy  paw steps echoing throughout the tunnels and stations. The lights flickered as the power supply was disrupted with every step. Years of collected dust fell from the ceilings as she stomped about. The trains had stopped, the constant power disruptions disabling them. Many had derailed thanks to the quakes created by her foot steps. On one station they could hear her right overhead. Cowering in fear the humans prey she would move on. But the paw steps stop and it goes quiet. A few brave people ascend the stairs to look outside. They were greeted with the sight of her gigantic fluffy backside looming over them. The air reeked of smoke and fire. All around was destruction. Demolished buildings, crushed cars, downed powerlines and fire hydrants gushed out great geysers of water. Her vagina winked and she let off a loud grunt. The people scream and run. Smart ones run onto the devastated streets. Not so wise ones run back into the subway. A stream of red hot, highly corrosive and green stinky piss erupts from the canines vagina. Thousands of gallons of the canines waste envelops those on the stairs, they were almost instantly killed. Bones shattered by the powerful stream but worse their flesh was burnt off in seconds.  The tsunami of lethal piss splashes onto the platform. Smashing through pillars, ticket booths, gates the piss was unstoppable. It envelops thousands and eats away at the station. The track and concrete walls even start to dissolve in the potent piss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda groaned as she pissed into the opening. It was a perfect shot and it felt so good to relieve herself. And she was being a clever girl by peeing where the creatures would! Her tail wagged as she completely emptied her gigantic bladder. She thought she heard muffled screams, but she must of imagined it. She finished urinating and stood back up. Her pee was quite stinky. It may even attract a male. She wondered if more of her kind were about? Her thoughts interrupted by a loud crash as some nearby buildings collapsed without warning! She strolled over to investigate. The ground had caved in beneath these buildings. Within the crater of rubble was a large quantity of her piss. She must of overfilled the creatures latrine. Oh well, at least she was relieved now. But then she felt something from her anus. She now need to defecate! She whined as she would have to find a place to drop her logs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more she strolled on, looking for a place to shit. She wasn't going to do it anywhere. She was a good girl and would do it in an appropriate place. She saw the perfect spot to take a dump. The river. She walked on over, carving another trail of destruction. By the river was a ferry terminal. Which was busy with fleeing people. Most ferries had left. The last was just about to depart when she approached. She stomped onto the terminal and watched the ferry as it pulled away. There was plenty of creatures onboard. She may play with them in a minute. But right now she really need to shit. She turns around and squats down, positioning her butt over the river and ferry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the ferry panic as they saw the giant canine approach. The ferry's captain saw her coming and quickly he ordered the ferry to depart. But as they had barely pulled away the giant smashed through the terminal and looked down at them. Her tongue lulled with great brown puppy eyes looking at them lovingly. But she turned and presented her rear. Her tailhole was huge and with a grunt a giant turd appeared. People jumped overboard as it looked as though the turd would hit the ferry. The great logs breaks free and with a loud splash it land in the water. Just metres from the ferry. It sank quickly but also produced a great wave. Many were swept over board. Some who had jumped before the turd drop ended up being crushed under the great turd. She dropped two more logs, splashing the ferry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda groaned as she squeezed out the third and final turd. She turned to study the water. Her logs had sunk into the river. The ferry was untouched, apart from being splashed with water. Many of the creatures had jumped into the water. She looked down at them and barked to say hello cuties! She wasn't to keen to wade about in water. But she could always make an exception. She really wanted to play with these creatures and the ferry! She briefly looked back at her trail of destruction the scent of her piss filled the air. Maybe a male or another of her kind  would join her soon? She thought nothing of the death and destruction she had caused. It was time to play!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prepared to step into the river...   </span></div></div>",

She turned to face her trail. She could see him in the distance. He had a great black coat. His eyes a deep blue. He was following her trail. He was coming to her! He was stunning. Whilst she was over weight he was athletic and bulging with muscle, not fat. His claws long and sharp. His mane was braided in several in places. His top canines jutted out of his mouth like sabres. He must of been used by a warrior. She was only kept as a companion. She waited for him to approach her. She wagged her tail and lulled her tongue as he raised his head to look at her. He stopped following her trail and instead ploughed a new trail of destruction through the city. He tore through buildings effortlessly, his razor sharp claws easily sliced through steel and his bulging muscles propelled him through concrete as though it was tissue paper. Thousand more were killed by him, he couldn't care less. He was a warrior, he'd killed many in his lifetime and he had no second thought a about snuffing out bugs. His thick pads soon coated in debris and blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped by her pool of piss to sniff it. Andromeda watched him intently. He grunted and cocked his hind leg. Revealing his thick sheath and massive testicles. He started to piss atop her pool. Flooding the crater and nearby streets. His piss reeked. He was a big male and of course he had to mark everything that he considered his. She rolled her eyes. Males, so predictable! But his piss did smell good and he was so strong and sexy! She started to walk towards him. Tail wagging and tongue lulled. He stopped and stared at her. She submissively lowered her ears and crouched a little. She knew he was above her in status. He growled at her, baring his fangs. She yelped and laid down. Crushing a few buildings under her fat belly. He glared down at her, fangs still bared and he growled continuously. She whined at him and gave him her puppy eyes expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male who is called Orion and used as a mount by a warrior finally acts towards Andromeda. He _______ her.</span></div></div>",

He flicked his tail as he walked through some nearby buildings, levelling them with his mighty paws and legs. He snarled and lowered his head and with a loud chomp  snapped up some people in the street. Andromeda whined as she watched him. Clearly he wasn't interested in her nay more and he was not being very nice to the little creatures. She stood up and decided to leave him to it. She turned back to the river. The ferry was a short distance away, but she'd easily be bale to catch up with it. She stepped into the river, being careful not to step on her submerged turds. She produced small waves, as she was being so careful not to produce tsunamis. To her amazement the river only just submerged her paws, It was so shallow! But it would be easy for her to wade on through. She waded after the ferry, tongue lulled as she prepared to show it some love and affection. And all the little creatures on board would give her even more treats! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the ferry sighed in relief when they saw the giant canine turn away from them as something else caught her attention. The heavy thumps and quakes indicating there was another giant out there! Soon they saw a great muscular black furred male canine approach her. Panicking that they was about to be set up by two giants. The female approached the male who growled at her. She was all submissive and even laid down. The male soon turned away and stomped off elsewhere. Leaving the female alone. She turned and started to approach them. Screams of panic filled the ferry as the great fat female stepped into the river and she started to wade after them. She was gaining fast. Some jumped over board. They didn't get far as she stepped on them or drowned them with the waves her steps were making. The rest ran into the ferry, hoping that would save them. Her great paws land beside the ferry. Rocking it violently and splashing great waves into the sides. People were thrown about violently. Bashing into the walls, chairs, each other. The coxswain who had been gunning the engines to max was knocked clean out. His limp body pulling the throttles back to idle. The ferry was going nowhere, it was trapped between two thick legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda panted down at the ferry. She had caught it between her forepaws. It was no longer trying to get away. It was all hers to play with! It was so small, only being 90ft long, or shorter than one of her paws! She found it quite cute, a big sloppy kiss was in order she thinks! Lowering her head she released her tongue and slapped it onto the ferry. Crushing the small bridge in the process. Her saliva oozes all over the ferry, it dribbles down all the windows and even pour within. Much to the passengers disgust. She could fit it in her mouth is she wanted.... Yes, she would scoop into her mouth! She carefully laid down and opened her jaws wide she shoved her tongue into the water under the ferry and with ease she lifted the vessel up upon her slobbering tongue. Her tongue and the ferry withdraw into her maw. She sealed her jaws, surrounding the ferry in darkness.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passengers screamed as there was loud wet slap and the roof groaned as something heavy drags over it. Thick drool oozed down the windows and through the doors. ''She's licking us!'' Someone cried as the drool started to ooze into the ferry. It pooled around people. Some of whom stood on chairs to avoid the thick sticky stuff. But worse was to come the canine backed up and laid down. She somehow produced no wave but there was worse to come. Her massive jaws appear wide apart and showing off the huge cave that was her mouth! Her tongue slides out and dives into the water. ''She's going to eat us!'' Screamed a lady but before anybody could attempt to flee the tongue comes up under the ferry, rocking it violently upon the squishy saliva coated muscle. The tongue takes them back into the maw. Rancid hot dog breath fills the air. The jaws close around the ferry and plunges them into darkness. They was trapped in the ferry in the maw of a giant fat canine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda moaned as she lovingly pushed the ferry into her hard ridges. She slurped her tongue all over it and much to her delight she started to receive treats! This ferry was even more fun to play with than the train. She wished master would invest in model boats, then she could have them to play about with too! But she was a little to rough. The windows shattered, the super structure collapsed under the immense pressure her tongue was applying. All the passengers and crew ended up being devoured. The ferry was a twisted mess. She stuck her tongue out to study it. It was unrecognisable to her and she was not getting any more treats. She whined and spat the slobbery wreckage out. She looked about for a larger more stronger boat to interact with. She yips happily when she spots just the vessel...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quite the attraction and a colossal overweight canine had her eyes set right on it. She waded on over tongue lulled and tail wagging furiously. It was the perfect size for her! Unlike the little ferry that was smaller than a paw she could practically lay on the aircraft carrier with room to spare! The people on board had been watching her as she stomped about the city and then entered the river to wreck the river ferry. They screamed and ran. But her heavy paw steps had shaken away the gangplanks. They were trapped on the carrier as she soon loomed over head. She gazed down at the carrier and eyed up the aircraft and humans. She was panting merrily. Blobs of drool splattering everywhere. She lowered her head and used her tongue to scoop up a fighter jet. Playfully she nommed on it then spat the mangled wreck out. She was just being playful, no harm in playing with toys, right?! But she wasn't just going to nom the aircraft. She had another plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carrier was the perfect size to lay on! She stepped over it, positioning it between her legs. It was long enough but her great fat belly was wider. But she should be able to lay upon it comfortably. She lowers herself onto the vessel. With a crash her fat belly crushes the island and soon all the aircraft under its sheer bulk. Many people were squished. She groaned contently as she fully laid on the deck. Her great weight pushing the carrier into the water. She panted contently as she slowly pushed the carrier into the water. Already the lower decks were flooded. People drowning within the dark interior as the power was knocked out. She was oblivious to the carnage beneath. As far as she was concerned she was giving a harmless 'hug' to the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the carrier hit the bottom. Now her body began to press down on the ship, crushing one deck after another after another. Within moments she found her self lying in the water. She whined. The ship should of kept her dry. But it had vanished! She stood up and looked around, confused. How could something so big vanish?! She didn't realised it was now a compressed sheet of metal upon the riverbed beneath her gigantic fat belly. She stepped back upon dry land, crushing the carriers visitor centre and many hiding people. She grumbled and shook the water off of her belly and legs. Covering many nearby buildings. She looked into the city and yipped. Whilst she had been messing about in the river more giant canines had appeared apart from her and Orion, the muscular male who had ignored her ten minutes ago. She could see at least six others now. One of whom was coming her way! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda is about to be joined by another giant dire wolf to accompany her on exploring the little city. What character shall be joining her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Nugget - A golden brown furred male. Who is even fatter than Andromeda!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Shadow - A black coated young male. Muscular but less so than Orion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Altair - A white and black coated female. Long mane, feathered paws and tail fur. Used in shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Fang - A grey coated old male. A grumpy aging Warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Mila - A pure white female. She has a thick silky lion like mane.  </span></div></div>",

But by larger not only was he taller he had a far wider girth to match and he had a truly huge fat belly, that made her look slim! She wagged her tail and lulled her tongue. What a sexy beast, just her sort! She even glimpsed his naughty bits. Two large fluffy orbs swinging majestically between his chubby hind legs and a long thick mound in front. He looked at her briefly as he started to approach. She watched him intently. She yipped when he lowered his head to the street below. He was panting heavily. Great blobs of drool spilt onto the street below. Covering many humans. But what amazed her the most was his steps. She just walked through the buildings. He was carefully stepping over them, his gigantic paws slowly came down on the street. Giving humans time to flee from under them. Lightly they touched down. Crushing cars with ease and cracking the tarmac. But nothing more. Apart from a light thud and crunch his paw steps hardly made a sound. It made his progress slow, but non deadly. He lovingly panted over all the humans beneath his head as he passed overhead. The worse he done directly to humans was drool on them, but it was only done lovingly. His tail, thick and curled up over his back like Andromeda wagged rapidly from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also had a pair large leather bag hanging over each flank. Clearly he was used to carry things for his master. Andromeda still watched him intently, waiting for him to reach her. She yipped when he stopped and used his tongue to pull up a bus. He took the bus back and dropped it into one of the bags. He brought his head back to the street as he scanned it closely. Still drooling excessively. He licked up a few more vehicles. A Yellow Taxi, a white mail truck and red sports car were carefully picked up and dropped into the bag. No doubt damaging them despite his gentle handling. He stopped over a crowd of humans and whined at them. They screamed and ran. But he tipped his head on it's side and scooped them up with his tongue. Unlike Andromeda who had dragged her tongue over thousands crushing them instantly his sideways lick was non lethal. Though the humans were now stuck to the massive saliva soaked muscle. He carefully took them to the other bag and dropped them in! He strolled on. Stopping to collect more humans and vehicles. Which he kept separate. Despite being focused in the street below his head he still managed to not damage any building or kill a single human. He was a true gentle giant. Like Andromeda he loved to give hugs and sloppy licks but he was well aware of his great bulk, he never wanted to hurt anybody or thing. He always checked there were no insects under him before lying down or walking through. Though in a new exiting place he wasn't going to break his habit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he clears the buildings and walks on up to Andromeda. She looked up at him, whining. He also whined as he lowered his head to her. They sniffed at each other and released there tongues. With a loud wet slap they slap together. Saliva splatters everywhere, covering many nearby buildings and vehicles. As the two giants 'kissed' Their tails wagged furiously. They eagerly curled there tongues  around each other and squeezed. Waves of pleasure shot through both canines. It was the first time they'd met another overweigh canine of the opposite sex. They would make good mates... Releasing each others tongues they step back and admire each others body. Nugget grins as he carefully pulled the bags of humans and vehicles off of his large leather harness. The bags had handles for him to carry them and flaps to cover the contents. He carefully set them aside on an empty car park and covered them so the humans couldn't get out. Then he turned his attention back to Andromeda. Now he didn't have the humans to worry about he could interact a bit more lively with her...      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda and Nugget both engage in....</span></div></div>",

His backside held high in the air, his thick tail wagged rapidly as he lulled his tongue, oozing long strands of saliva. Andromeda grinned and barked once. Nugget turned and with a grunt pushed off the ground. His four paws ripping up large chunks of earth as he leapt into the river. With a mighty splash he landed. Producing four large waves that rippled out in all directions. 'Luckily' for the little humans there was no boats, ships or swimmers close to the two fat canines. He started to wade rapidly through the water. Looking playfully over his shoulder at Andromeda. She barked and leapt after him. Producing four smaller waves. The worse that happened was some flooding on the streets. But few people were left in the area, having already fled or been lapped up by Nugget. The two giants were playing chase. Andromeda followed after Nugget. Admiring his large fluffy backside as they ran. His cheeks were even fluffier than hers, she was a little jealous of that but what really grabbed her attention was the two giant orbs swaying about between his thick hind legs. They smacked loudly against the thighs as they swung wildly back and forth. She drooled at the sight of those balls. He would be a good mate. When she came into season next. She couldn't wait! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda slowly caught on Nugget. She released her tongue to 'tag' him. She aimed for his massive sacks. With one push she reached them. Giving them a good sloppy lick! Nugget moaned contently and turned. Time for him to chase her! He'd loved her lick on his privates. His time to lick her naughty bits! He ran after her, easily keeping up. He let her stay ahead. To admire her backside like she had with him. He couldn't wait for her to come into heat. Her vagina was dry and small. Not ready for mating. But he still wouldn't say no to a taste! He released his tongue and gave her vagina a sloppy lick. Andromeda came to a halt and howled out with pleasure. Nugget moaned and thrust his tongue in deeper. She groaned and squeezed his tongue as it penetrated deep. Her vagina was soon well lubricated with liberal amounts of drool. Nugget withdraws his tongue and savours her flavour. She turned to face him. She barked and he obliged. Turning he ran again. With Andromeda in hot pursuit. She once again aimed for his balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever their game of play chase is about to be interrupted. What is the interruption? </span></div></div>",

He barked and headed right for the ship. His tongue lulled and tail wagging furiously. He could smell thousand of humans within, he really had to go and say hello! He forgot about the game of chase. Andromeda right behind him and oblivious to the novel object that had attracted Nugget's attention. In just a few leaps he was just a few steps away from the cruise ship. He could smell the humans fear. He of course loomed over the vessel, he would have to put on his best puppy dog behaviour. He was really a very big friendly boy after all. He came to a halt and was about to put on his act when... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelped as Andromeda ploughed right into his backside! She had not been prepared for him to come to a complete stop. Her head goes under his privates, lifting his hind into the air whilst slamming down his front. She to yelped as she was pinned under the males privates. The impact released a tsunami that slammed into the cruise ship side (they had approached from the ship's port side). The ship was violently keeled to starboard. Those on deck were washed overboard by the wave. Within people and furniture tumble violently onto the starboard side of the vessel. It looked like it was going to roll right over Poseidon style, but luckily it was left at a severe list. People were hopelessly trapped against the walls. The floor angle to steep to climb. The furniture was piled on them. Everybody was injured by the impact. Several were knocked out but luckily there was no fatalities. Several people were in the water, looking up at the ship tipping towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNugget realised the ship was in danger. It had to help! He got up off of Andromeda, who gasped as her head had been forced under the water by his heavy backside. He quickly lifts a massive paw over the starboard side of the ship and carefully places it on the side. With a grunt he pulled the ship upright. Handling the hundred thousand ton vessel like a sack of feathers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin all the people could see was a giant paw pad coming at them. They screamed in terror but with a soft thump the pad just covered the windows as the gigantic canine pulled the ship back upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNugget having righted the ship spots the people in the water. He lowers his large head and released his giant wet tongue. The people screamed as his tongue curled under them and lift them up out of the water. Thinking they was about to be swallowed to their shock the canine carefully drops them back on the deck of the ship. He doesn't stop until everybody he fell into the water was back on board. Safe and sound. Apart from being wet and soaked in his thick saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he'd finished his rescue mission. Nugget lowered his head and sniffed at the humans. Making sure none were injured. He whined softly as he smelt their fear. They didn't need to be afraid, he was their friend! He laid down and gave his best puppy eyes expression. He held his muzzle inches from the ship. Hoping one of them would give it a scratch. Much to his delight one man bravely approaches him and reaches out. Nugget moaned contently as he felt the little hands stroke his fur. Soon more people approach and stroke his muzzle. He groaned and lulled his tongue. Oozing long trails of saliva into the sea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising the giant canine was friendly. His action so far proving so, many people pluck up the courage to approach and stroke his presented muzzle. But soon there was to many people and not enough muzzle! Nugget realised this. He would have to present more of himself. His great fat belly should do! Carefully he turned and with the upmost of care he rested his belly alongside the ship. Like a great mountain of fur. The people stroked at it. His warm soft fur enveloping them. Waves of pleasure shot through his body. He couldn't believe this! He groaned constantly. Andromeda watched Nugget intently as he saved the ship and passengers. They were rewarding him with strokes! She had to have in on that! She came up alongside the other side of the vessel and rested her belly alongside. Sandwiched between giants. The passengers were spoilt for choice. They brought their heads together and once again kissed. Thrusting their tongues together and into each others mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed with the ship for half an hour. loving every second of the contact. But they soon had to get moving. They carefully backed away from the ship. Andromeda had really liked that, she would try to more like Nugget in her interactions from now on. Apart from many videos of destruction. Ones of love and care would go on from the giant fluffy pair. They look for their next destination...   </span></div></div>",

The smoke irritated both of their noses. They snorted and waded on further out to sea. Nugget started to approach another ship. Andromeda barked at him. She wanted to see what lies further down the coast. The large male whined but obeyed. He walked alongside her so that he could see what lies ahead. A few boats were in their path. Carefully they stepped over the boats. The people on board bravely (or foolishly) filmed the giants as they approached and passed right overhead. Those under Andromeda only getting shots of her belly. But Nugget being a very well endowed male presented a further view. His musky and massive genitals pass with just inches to spare in some cases. The people choking on the musk or trying to push the giant bits away. Which was a futile effort due to their extreme weight and the fact it sent waves of pleasure through Nuggets massive body. Nugget was loving it, he made sure to pass over as much boats as possible for a cheeky genital stroke. Both their tails wagged rapidly, producing strong gale like winds that blew the people into the water, but nobody was seriously injured by the two canines. They wade on, following the coast away from the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they walk alongside cliffs. Chalk white and around 500 ft tall, or half Nuggets height. The cliffs were nothing to the two canines. Though they could see humans walking along the top. Beyond the cliffside walks they could see jam packed roads and small villages. The small villages deeply interested the two giants. But they would rather find a bigger settlement to explore. There must be another untouched one further along the coast! Eagerly they wade on. Looking ahead for the sight of a city or at least a town. They encounter a few more boats. Nugget making sure each one ended up giving him a cheeky rub down under. He got a little carried away, his fat pink tip poked out of its sheath. Andromeda saw this and lowered her head to give it a slobbery lick. Much to his delight! But they had to find more humans, kinky fun could come later... On they walk, his slobber coated dick returning to its sheath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon their nostrils start to bring in the scent of thousands upon thousands of humans. They also could smell buildings and vehicles. They was so close to reaching another large human settlement!

Most of the buildings were tiny, not even passing the top of their paws! There was the odd tall building. But even the tallest wouldn't reach past his ankle! How cute! The two giants thought as they made their approach. People started to panic and flee at the sight of the two approaching giants. Reports from the city and across the globe showed cities being razed by giant creatures. Evacuations were already underway but were about to ramp up for the town. The only way out were four roads that left the valley the town was situated in. Already at near gridlock. People took to running on foot, as if they could outrun any giants that way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing careful not to flood the city with thee wavs their paws produced they had to slow right down for the last few steps. The town had a large sandy beach. Now it was covered in abandoned towels, wind breakers, and a few people who were to shocked to run or had some weird macro fetish and were coming to 'welcome' the giants. One crowd waved up at the biggest, Nugget. He looked down at the crowd, panting heavily. Drool splattering around them. ''Eat me!'' Cried one man as the giant canine opened his jaws over them. Andromeda watched Nugget intently as he lowered his head at the humans. He turned his head on its side and obligingly lapped up his willing 'snacks' though he was of course not going to eat them. He moaned contently as he sealed them in his mouth and swished them about, gently. Well to him gently but it was like being stuck in a stormy sea for the humans. Slathered in drool, bashed into his teeth and hard roof ridges... Some how no breakages or accident swallows occurred. Andromeda having watched Nuggets catching technique decided to try it out herself. Finding another willing crowd she lowered her head and tipped it on its side. Releasing her tongue she curled it around the humans. As opposed to dragging it over them, which was always fatal (but unknown to her). She was surprised not to receive treats for the lick but now she had the sensation of wriggling humans on her tongue! She sealed them in her jaws and let them wriggle. She moaned contently as waves of pleasure filled her body. This felt so good! No tasty treats but a pleasurable experience instead, she should of done this from the start! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNugget went to spit the people out into his bag... Oh no! He'd left it in the last city! He whined, he wanted to keep these humans for later. He could carry them on his back but they might fall off. Oh well he reluctantly lowered his head and spat them out. Leaving them in a pool of his saliva. He whined at them as to say sorry for not keeping them. He looked at Andromeda. Who had a mouthful of humans and she seemed to be enjoying the experience greatly. He barked at her. She whined and like him spat the humans out. He didn't want her to go to far and hurt them. Now they looked at the town and it's panic stricken populace The strong scent of fear hit their nostrils. Nugget really did not like the scent at all. They should be happy to see them, not scared! He and Andromeda had already given some love to some of the humans. They had much more to give! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNugget stepped forwards, planting a paw on the beach. The warm soft sand felt so good. But he had to move on. He looked into the town and whined. The streets were tighter here. He couldn't make a step without causing damage. He was well to soft natured to even think of just bulldozing through, how rude that would be! Andromeda could fit however, thanks to her slightly smaller stature. She stepped on in. Whilst in the city she had been rude and walked on through buildings now she knew to take care. She let people run before planting a paw. She lowered her head and started to lovingly lap up people non lethally. Poor Nugget felt left out. But then he saw the roads leading out of the town. He could walk around and interact with the humans there! He turned and quickly bound around the outskirts of the town. He reached the road, which was at total gridlock now. Seeing him people abandoned their cars and ran of foot. Making it easy for him to lap them up. He lowers his head and slurps up hundreds. All getting a good slobbering in his maw before people released. None would get away, he would slob them all lovingly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda meanwhile steadily walked across the town. She was slobbering over anybody she could catch. Like Nugget, she would leave none un slobbed! Within an hour thousands of people were slathered in drool. Only a few who had hidden in the buildings escaped the sticky and wet canines maws. Having had their 'fun' with the town they walked on once more. Heading inland. They followed a road, lovingly turning it into a drool soaked mess as they went. Soon the road takes them to... <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

But Nugget whined as he wanted to fetch his two bags full of humans and vehicles. The larger male wins the argument. Andromeda reluctantly follows.

Clearly used in conformation shows the canine was showing off to the humans below. A old male, grey furred was lying across a road. In his mouth was a bus. Which he was casually slobbering all over. Under his paws and belly were humans, pinned down but not crushed amazingly. Orion, the big muscular male was going down another road. Stomping on every car and swiping at humans. His claws red with blood! Andromeda growled, how disgusting! Nugget whined, he didn't like it but he was not the fighting  type. Andromeda wanted to go sort Orion out, but Nugget refused to fight. She growled with annoyance. Nugget quickly headed into the city towards where he'd left his bags. Andromeda followed, but was still itching for a fight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke stung their eyes and nostrils. They were terrified of the fires, having to take long detours around the ruined city. The streets gone, buried under rubble from levelled buildings. The odd paw print was visible. As well as patches of blood. The sight saddened the two giants, especially the every gentle Nugget.

The fur strands and saliva indicating who had eaten the humans. Orion! Andromeda whined when she released what happened. Nugget backed up and lifted his head slowly. He threw back his head and let off along sad howl. Andromeda joined him. Singing their sorrow together. Once the howl had finished Nugget turned around and Snarled viscously. Andromeda yelped. The mellow gentle giant was pissed, big time! His fangs glistening with his saliva, he chomps angrily and charges. He was heading right for Orion.

Andromeda ran after him, but struggled to keep up with the larger incensed male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNugget cleared the city and tore up the earth between him and his target Orion.

He'd barely stood up when millions of tons of flesh slams into him at hundreds of miles an hour. The violent impact threw Orion hundreds of feet. With a violent quake his body slams into the ground. Kicking up a great cloud of dust and shaking the ground violently. He slides along due to the momentum, but is stopped by Nuggets fangs clamping onto his ruff. Nugget pulled his head back, easily lifting Orion. He threw the muscular male over his back. Orion yelped as he somersaulted through the air. But he managed to land on all fours with a heavy thump.

Blood oozed from the puncture wounds but he shook his muzzle free and returned the favour. Sinking his fangs into Orion's muzzle. More blood sprays. Their huge forepaws slash and push at each other. They remained standing up on their hind legs as they grappled, slashed and bit each other. Blood flowing down their coats and onto the ground. Andromeda whined at the sight, she didn't want to interfere.

Curious he looks around to see he was surrounded by humans! Several were right up close and stroking him. He moaned contently. The humans backed up. He panted merrily and lowered his head and gave those closest to his slobbering more a big sloppy lick! As if to say thanks cuties! The humans petting him continue to do so. He groaned contently. Damn, it felt so good and to have them trust him. Just what he wanted. In bliss he laid his head on his leg and let the humans continue. Down under he was getting a little hard, but he managed to resist getting a full erection. He just lulled his tongue, oozing thousands of gallons of drool that formed in a large pool. He looked around to see what was happening with Andromeda and the other canines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndromeda was still fast asleep. Few humans were near her. Many were wary as they remembered her rather destructive stroll from earlier and she had eaten thousands. But it was sort of obvious now that she had been completely oblivious. Nugget having helped stop her unintentional killing and destroying. A few humans were petting her fat belly. But that was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old grey furred male was still nearby, laying partly on his side. His legs sprawled out sideways. The bus he'd been slobbering all over was sat in a pool of saliva near to him. He had many humans pinned under him. But he was not squishing them. They seemed happy, as they stroked at him. What made Nugget yip was the males cock, it was fully erect and oozing pre. Some humans were actually stroking the old males balls. Nugget was a little jealous. Having experienced humans rubbing down there he wished the ones petting him would do the same to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on to the final canine, the lanky female. She was sat down with many humans pointing up at her. Her long fur trailed on the ground. Humans stroked at he soft and luxurious coat. Some even becoming entangled in her feathering. She was panting softly. Clearly loving the attention the little humans were giving her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, some of the humans had realised that the only safety from the giants was the giants themselves. Or at least the ones that had shown to be friendly. All over the world reports of giant animals of various species rampaging about filled the news channels. Videos of destruction and death from all over. These humans had seen their city be attacked first hand. The odd video, showing friendlier giants also filled the news channels. Nugget and Andromeda of course feature in such videos. There was several of them just lovingly slobbering over the queues of traffic. And so when he also appeared and killed the aggressive canine the humans knew now they had a guardian. A few other canines who were acting more friendly were nearby. The lanky female had just strolled about, crushing the odd car but clearly just eager to show off her body. The old male seemed content with soaking buses in drool then setting them back down. So now they stroked there giant 'guardians' and the giants seemed to appreciate the attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the peaceful interaction wouldn't last. For finally after half an hour of stroking, loving sloppy licks and admiration came something to put a stop to all of this...</span></div></div>",

Screams filled his ears along with various crashing sounds. He looked down to see strange tiny two legged creatures scurrying about. He cocked his head with curiousity. They kind of looked like master, but they had no fur and were so small. They ran in and out of the structures. One of his paws was as large as one of the structures. His paws all covered in thick armour with massive blades on the tips to act as claws. He lifted a paw over the nearest structure and slowly lowered it. His paw touches the roof. With a loud crash the roof collapses under the weight. He growled and pushed on down. Easily crushing the structure under his paw. How weak! This action whipped up a frenzy with the little creatures. Their screams intensified as they ran about. They got into strange metal things that made pathetic growling sounds and moved along strange grey trails. His eyes flashed as he stood up on all fours and walked forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople stared up in shock at the monster towering over them. One second there was a mighty flash the next the beast was lying there right by the edge of the suburbs. Many started to flee those some stayed and watched or even filmed the giant. It seemed to resemble a feline. Though it was covered in blood red armour with great spikes in many places. On the head their was two great forwards pointing horns and massive sharp fangs on the lower jaw. Some really foolish people went right up to the slumbering giant and touched the armour. Those that got close enough could see small details that confirmed the beasts gender. A large bulge under the tail covered the beasts privates. Their was grilles to allow him to pee. Green stains from the grilles and surrounding armour confirmed this. The people here didn't get to share their discovery. The beast grumbled and growled as his body shook as he awakened. As he sat up his rear came down and crushed the people. Though one 'lucky' one was trapped in the pee grilles. When the beast lifted a paw and used in to crush the nearest home the people fled. The beasts yellow eyes flashed from within the armour as he stood up and walked forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow stomped forwards. His massive paws flattening homes and snuffing out countless lives with every step. He didn't care, he was a ferocious killing machine and after all it was only 'bugs' he was crushing. Each paw step let off thunderous thuds and sent out great fissures that tore up turf and tarmac. Water pipes burst and sprayed great jets of water. Power lines collapsed, blackening out the area and electrifying many unlucky humans. Cars were blown over by the heavy paw steps and displaced air. Gas pipes burst and ignited, leaving a trail of fire in his wake. He snarled and looked about for his master. Where was he, had they done something with him?! He was sure these bugs had done something with his master. He would find him, even he had to level the entire habitat! He stomped on and lowered his head after a nearby group of the humans. They screamed as his great tongue slid from his jaws. A gigantic pink barbed saliva soaked slug. He dragged it after the humans and with ease it caught them. Most were pulled under and crushed instantly. A few survived to be thrown back into his maw and swallowed. He belched and licked his lips. The bugs were delicious and felt good going down his throat! Oh was he going to enjoy his search. He could trash the city and feast as he looked for his master. He continued on through the suburbs. crushing houses and licking up hundreds of humans in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He could see the city was not just made of little houses. There was so much more to destroy. He turns to leave the suburbs and instead he approaches...</span></div></div>",

The little homes had been so easy for him to crush but these taller buildings should be more worthy of his efforts. The five apartment buildings were all grouped together and of varying heights. The smallest reached his belly whilst the tallest was just as tall as him.  The other three were sizes in between. He groaned and headed for them. Below his paws continues to lay waste to all in his path. His head dips occasionally as he releases his tongue after groups of humans and sends them to his belly. It was a quick and easy journey. He studies the five apartments closely. Within he can see and smell hundreds of humans. They even piled out of the ground doors. He head dips once more to lap up those that tried to flee the apartments. Smarter people fled out of the opposite side or stayed put, thinking they was safe inside. How wrong they were... Shadow decided to start from small to large. Having lapped up the humans below he turned to expose his rear to the small apartment. Those within gawped up at his armoured backside. The human stuck in his pee grille was still conscious somehow. He was getting the full stench of Shadows encased genitals. Being a big male he had a very potent musk and his marks could be smelt from over a dozen miles away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow started to back up. His thick hind legs straddling the small apartment. With a loud crash the various spikes on the armour slices into the building. Furniture and unlucky humans were sliced up by the razor sharp blade like spikes. Shadow then dropped his big hind onto the building the human stuck to his pee grille screamed as he was knocked free and fell atop the roof. Shadow's butt was now sat upon the building. He used his hind legs to hold his weight. The building groaned and cracks formed as he increased the pressure. He took the weight completely off his legs and let the building take it all. With a loud crash it collapsed from the top down. Shadow groaned and pushed down to speed the process. He was way to heavy. Within thirty seconds the apartment was a pile of rubble with him sat upon it. Hundreds of residents were crushed. He didn't care for the building or humans. They were food and toys as far as he was concerned. He stood up and shook his butt to fling off any debris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his attention to the next apartment building. He walked over and lowered his head to lap up the humans trying to flee. He couldn't sit on this one. But he could still use a back part of himself. His tail. He turned violently and with a loud crash his armoured tail smashed right through the building. People and debris were thrown everywhere. The apartment building collapsed in on it self as the unsupported top floors crashed down on the lower floors and kept going until only a pile of rubble remained. Shadow wasn't down. He repeated the process on the next two apartments with the same affect. All that remained was the tallest apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked on over and showed off his backside once more. But he wasn't going to use his tail this time. He groaned and sprayed forth his urine. Like a Big cat it was a fine spray that easily passed through the grilles. The fluid was highly corrosive. It sizzled against the apartment, the windows shattered all over and gave him a clean shot into the building. He sprayed several more times. Flooding the interior with the lethal fluid. Humans and furniture were dissolving, as was wires and steelwork. Fires started and filled the interior with smoke. Humans 'lucky' not to of been sprayed now couldn't see there way out. Shadow turned around to study the mess. He snorted and decided to end the misery. He lowered his head and with a snarl he charged forwards his massive horns and body armour tore through the structure with ease, even more so with the damage. He tore on across several streets leaving massive paw shaped craters and levelling many more small shops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe skidded to a halt, carving up two long trails of destruction. He looked back at the trail of destruction he'd made. He snorted. The bugs habitats were so weak. He  was about to walk on when something caught his attention... </span></div></div>",

He tried to pin point the sound, for it was so annoying. He growled as he looked about. The wailing was coming from multiple places. He saw strange flashes of blue and red amongst the buildings moving towards him along with the wailing sounds. Were these guardian bugs? He guessed they were he flicked his tail disdainfully as he stomped towards the closest 'guardian bug' which was a Swat team van. Upon spotting the van he stopped before it and snarled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swat van skidded to a halt. The twelve swat team members gawp up briefly at the beast looming before them. The beast snarled. The snarl made their bones shake and cracked nearby windows. Gaining their composure they lifted their automatic rifles and opened fire. Their bullets harmlessly hit his armour, which was made of a strong metal that easily resisted the bullets. Shadow fumed, how dare they attack him?! He opened his jaws and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nROAR!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let's forth a monstrous roar that blew out all windows, cracked concrete and burst water pipes for miles around. The roar blew out all humans ear drums, many were knocked out cold or were cringing in agony. The swat team suffering the later. He charged forwards. His four paws tearing up the street, the torn up sections were thrown back, levelling a small restaurant. With every step the impact shatters more of the street and causes the closest buildings to collapse, his roar having weakened them. The swat team tried to retreat but it was to late. He leapt up over them, they could only stare at the underside of one of his paws that rained debris as it came down on them and ground them into a fine paste. The violent impact produced a crater deep enough to expose the subway beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow huffed as he lifted his paw up to look underneath. The swat team but a stain and their van a piece of sheet metal. He shook his paw to remove their remains then he focused on the other swat teams. Who had all gathered up nearby. He wasn't going to let them off. He snarled and started to charge at them. He tore through buildings without care. None would slow his charge. The swat teams fired at him. But once again their bullets were useless. As they had gathered in one spot it would be easy to deal with them. He leapt up over them then in mid air he flipped onto his back. With a mighty crash the swat team and nearby buildings were crushed under his back. His thick armour cushioned the impact. He snorted and rolled onto his paws. He stood up and shook. Flinging off the debris on his back and damaging many nearby structures. He didn't even look down to study the mess. The wailing had stopped as had the futile attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in charge here and none of these bugs could stop him. He groaned contently as his cock swelled within it's sheath. He would further prove his dominance by spraying the area. He casually strolled about, spraying his mist like urine on various structures. To spread his scent. He sniffed the air, perfect! But his spraying had attracted another giant. He could sniff the other giant approaching it was...</span></div></div>",

Who was outside the city but quickly approaching. Now his master was a heavily muscled Liger who was a warrior of his tribe. Usually he wore armour like Shadow but before he'd been taken here he was out of combat and wearing nothing but a black loincloth. Being a Liger he was a mix of a Lion and a Tigress. He had sandy coloured fur with faint black strips. His chest sported a six pack and his arms and thighs bulged with muscle. He lacked a mane. His name was Hercules, he enjoyed a good fight and wasn't afraid to mock his opponents. ''Shadow! There you are!'' Yelled Hercules as he ran to meet his mount. Shadow tore through the suburbs, levelling hundreds of homes and crushing thousands as he eagerly ran to meet his master. Hercules stopped just before the suburbs and waited for his mount to reach him. Shadow skidded to a halt before his master. Being a Grand Cat he was taller than his master. Hercules patted Shadows armour and received a lick to his face in return. ''All right big fella! At least you're here with me. Just what is this place?'' Hercules looked past as his mount at the city. Great trails of destruction indicating were Shadow had been walking. Fires, plumes of water and smoke were evident along the trail. ''Looks like you've made quite a mess already big guy. I'll think I'll check it out, follow!'' Hercules walked past his mount and headed into the city with Shadow following. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules stopped before the first house. He crouched down to have a better look. ''What a strange habitat. I've never seen something like this before'' he muttered to himself. On his world it was equivalent to the dark ages. He reached down for the house and with ease tore it's roof off with his claws. ''So fragile. What are those!?'' He yelped as three humans ran from the house screaming. He threw the roof aside, crushing a few nearby cars but the humans had his attention. ''Hmm.. They also have two legs and arms...'' He muttered as he stood up and walked after the humans. Easily catching up he crouched down and scooped them up. He brought them before his face and sniffed them. They screamed as his suction pulled them towards his nostrils. Their fear excited him, his tail thrashed about. ''Aww you weird furless mini apes are afraid of me?! So you should be!'' He laughed as the humans tried to run off his hand. He simply curled his fingers and trapped them. Their hands pathetically beat against his fingers. 'What to do with them?' He pondered briefly. Shadow stomped up beside him and nose at his hand. His broad tongue licked against Hercules's fingers. ''Do you want them big boy? Okay then'' he opened his fingers and before they knew it the humans were lapped up by Shadows powerful tongue and swallowed. Shadow moaned contently and burped. Hercules laughed ''Shadow! So rude'' He stood up and looked at the city. ''Come, let's go have some more fun big boy.'' Instructed Hercules as he walked into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules stomped on houses, enjoying the sensation of them crumbling under his feet. Shadow was just as keen and with his larger paws he was even better at crushing houses. ''Such a powerful big boy. Showing off eh?'' Laughed Hercules as he watched his mount work his magic. He just stomped about levelling everything in sight. Hercules felt his cock harden as he watched his mount stomp about. He looked down to see his loin cloth starting to bulge outwards. 'Ooh getting excited' he thought as he lulled his tongue and using his hand he squeezed his nuts. Shadow turned when he saw and smelt his masters erection. He came up and nosed Hercules growing bulge. ''Easy big fella.'' laughed Hercules as he pushed Shadow off. ''Ooh I need to release my urges...'' He panted as he looked for something to help him release...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hercules's keen eyes scanned the area for something to pleasure himself with. All the buildings around him were homes no bigger than his paws. They wouldn't do and the taller buildings were to far away. Most houses were so weak and would shatter if he was to shove his cock into them. He looked at the street and his eyes locked on the humans. 'I'll use them... To have the tinies flaying pathetically against my cock and balls. That'll be fun!' He thought as he decided to use the humans to pleasure his genitals. But the humans were in small groups or cowering in nearby still intact homes. The streets largely messed up by Shadows massive paws. The huge beast was still stomping out. Decimating homes and cars with every step. He couldn't be bothered to spend ages gathering enough humans. But then his eyes spotted something handy. A bus was trying to leave the suburbs, it was rammed full of humans. ''Ah! Trying to run little ones? I don't think so!'' Laughed Hercules as he whistled loudly. Shadow instantly stopped in his tracks and looked at his master. Hercules pointed at the bus and gave one command... ''Fetch!'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had watched the giant beasts stomp many homes, including his. He'd just ran out in time. The armoured Monster planted a paw on his home obliterating it and his car! ''Oh fuck! No!'' He cried as the beasts paw lifted. The remains of his home falling all over the street as the paw lifted and slammed down on the house opposite. He turned and ran looking for help. Most homes had already been stomped. The streets were blocked by debris, crashed cars or deep paw print craters. The beasts were moving away at least. He had to avoid cars that were mounting the paths in their attempt to escape. To his relief he saw a bus, people were piling on. They to had watched their homes be crushed. He leapt on board, it was a tight fit. The bus was packed. The driver pulled away and headed for the nearby motorway. It looked like they was going to make it but then the ground shook and loud crashing could be heard. John and the others looked back and screamed as charging right at them was the armoured cat! The beast tore through everything in his path. The beast was easily running at a few hundred miles an hour. In seconds it was on them. The beast growled loudly and leapt over them. The kick off tore apart the street behind them. Out of sight briefly the beast slammed down ahead of them. It had turned in mid air to face them. It's paws blocked the street. The driver slammed on the brakes and tried to turn. But it was to late. A few people leapt off the bus as a giant pink slab of flesh, the beast's tongue curled around the bus. The bus groaned as it was squeezed in the tongue's embrace. The windows cracked under the pressure. Foul putrid Cat breath fills the bus as the beast lifted the bus high into the air then walked off. John realised he was trapped onboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules watched his mount as he chased down the bus. Easily catching up with it. He leapt ahead to block its escape route. The bus futilely tried to turn around. Shadow simply released his tongue and wrapped it around the bus. He didn't crush it, being a good obedient beast. ''Bring it here Shadow!'' Ordered Hercules. Shadow immediately obeyed. He deliberately stepped on the few humans that had leapt off the bus as he made his ay over. Hercules picked the bus off of Shadows tongue. It was soaked in his thick drool but intact and full of humans. ''Good work Shadow. You may keep playing'' said Hercules as he studied the bus. Shadow turned and stomped about the suburbs once again. Hercules grinned at his trapped victims. ''Now for the real fun'' he laughed as he used his free hand to rip off the back of the bus. A few humans tumbled out and fell to the ground. ''Woops!'' Your not supposed to drop down that far...'' He reached down to his loin cloth and pulled it forwards, exposing his genitals. His barb tipped cock was half erect, though the humans would soon help it reach its full size. ''Time to pleasure me little ones. In ya go!'' He laughed as he tipped the bus into his loincloth. The humans tumbled out and fell against his cock and balls. His cock was very sticky, any human that landed on it was stuck to the surface. The others tumbled down the loin cloth and came to a rest against his massive fluffy balls. ''Oohhh...'' He groaned as the humans flailing bodies massage his genitals. He dropped the empty bus aside and with a loud snap he released his loin cloth, covering the humans and his genitals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn screamed as he and the other fell out of the bus and into the anthro beast's loin cloth. All he could see was a fat barbed call and below two large balls. He missed the cock and landed against the fabric. He tumbled down and fell against one of the fluffy testicles. He tried to climb away but the fabric was to steep. He kept sliding back against the testicle. The stench of the giant's arousal was very strong. His nose stung from the stench. His eyes watered. Around him other tried to escape to no avail. Looking up above was the fat barbed head of his cock and further up his feline head grinned down at them. ''Let us out you sick fuck!'' He yelled. The beast just groaned and then released the loincloth. With a loud snap John and the others were covered in darkness. The cries and screams of the others were deafening. The stench of his genitals increased in the now enclosed space. John beat on the testicle ''Let me out!'' He cried weakly as he felt so dizzy. He was about to be 'released' from his prison, but not how he wanted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules gritted his teeth as the humans pleasured him. His cock grew longer and fatter until it was at it's full length. His loincloth now tented steeply. ''Fuck... So good..'' He panted as he neared climax. He decided to aid the humans, whose struggles grew weaker as they suffocated in the musky loincloth. He grabbed his bulge and squeezed tightly. Waves of pleasure filled his body. He lulled his tongue and tipped his head back. Within the humans stuck to his cock were crushed into a bloody paste. Those against his nuts were 'safe' from Hercules squeezes but worse was to come. Pre leaked from his tip, staining the cloth and oozing down towards his balls. The warm fluid enveloped many humans. But with a loud ferocious roar Hercules blew his load. Instantly flooding his loincloth with his thick cum...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was close to passing out when he felt and heard loud squeezes from above. Screams were silenced by the sound of crushing flesh and bone. He just knew the beast was squeezing his cock. No doubt the poor people on it were now paste. 'Sick fuck!' he thought as he then felt a warm sticky substance ooze down against his legs. ''No... No... No!'' he cried as he knew what it was. The beast roared and bucked forwards, tossing him into the loincloth and stream of pre. But almost immediately a far thicker fluid completely enveloped him as the cock above blew it's load. The thick cum filled every single inch of space. It forced its way into ears, noses and mouths. John and the others literally drowned and or suffocated in the thick cum. What a way to go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules panted heavily as he felt his cum pool against his balls and cock. His loincloth felt moist to the touch. ''Oh, I've never cum like that before!'' He whined as he looked at his loincloth. He pulled it forwards to have a look at the mess. All he could see was his cock and cum soaked balls. His loin cloth had soaked up most of the cum. But the humans were all lifeless and covered in his love sauce. His cock was covered in crushed remains. ''Eww  gross. But at least I had a good time.'' He sat down and pulled off his loincloth. He studied it, it was heavy with his cum and several humans bodies were stuck to it. He dropped it aside and looked at his exposed bits. His testicles like his loincloth were soaked in cum and covered in bodies. ''Oh I need a wash as does my loincloth...'' He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does he wash?  </span></div></div>",

Shadow immediately lowered his head to Hercules's loincloth and gave it a good sniff. ''Like it big boy?'' He asked as Shadow released his tongue and dragged it loudly across the loincloth. Lapping up humans and cum. Shadow moaned and a licking storm ensured. Each lick leaving long trails of drool as he licked the loin cloth all over. He soon had the cloth 'clean' though now it was soaked with his saliva, rather than cum and bodies. Shadow moaned contently as he sat back and licked his lips. His tail thrashed about wildly, sending debris flying everywhere and whipping up a small cloud of dust. ''Damn, you really enjoyed that, didn't you?!'' Laughed Hercules as he studied his mount and 'cleaned' loincloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow chuffed and strolled on up to his master. Lowering his massive head towards his genitals. Hercules pushed him back. Shadow whined and lifted his head. ''Now, now big boy. Why don't we take your helmet off first?'' Replied Hercules as he reached for the clips that attached Shadow's head armour to the body. With a loud click the head piece separated at the shoulders. Hercules pulled off the head piece and set it aside. For the first time the humans saw the head off the beast. His thick black mane on full show along with his thick powerful muzzle. His great sharp sabres a brilliant white and two glowing golden eyes were to other prominent features. Hercules stroked at the thick mane. ''So soft. Come down my big boy'' he cooed. Shadow laid down, resting his thick fore paws either side of his master. He chuffed and moaned contently as his master stroked his mane and head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules always enjoyed stroking Shadow. He was such a big and powerful beast. He always got excited down under. But he'd never partaken in any sexual activity with him. Until now. He grabbed his cock, still erect and messy as were his balls. ''Have a treat, big boy'' he said softly to his mount. Shadow eagerly lowered his head towards his master shaft and gave it a good sniff. Then he released his big fat tongue and gave the cock a lick. Hercules groaned as waves of pleasure shot through his body. Shadow also groaned as he licked again and again. Eagerly licking off the humans remains. He brought his mouth over his masters cock as he slowly enveloped it in his maw. Hercules gasped as his cock vanished within his mount's jaws. The beast could so easily bite it clean off. But he knew he wouldn't do such a thing. Shadow caressed Hercules's cock with his tongue as his jaws reached his sheath. He wrapped the cock fully in his tongues embrace and gave a few squeezes. ''Fuck!'' Cried Hercules, Shadow groaned as he released the cock and lowered his tongue to lap at the two testicles below. His tongue loudly slurped as he gave each testicle a sloppy lick. Cleaning off cum and bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a less than a minute Shadow had cleaned his masters genitals. Hercules felt an other orgasm coming on. The hot mouth and tongue enveloping his cock was to much. He laid back and growled as once again he bucked his hips and blew another load, right into his mounts mouth. Shadow eagerly swallowed the saucy treat. He sucked loudly, Hercules roared as this action prompted more orgasms. He blew again and again. Each load lovingly swallowed. After the tenth orgasm Hercules was spent. ''That's... That's all, fuck that was good Shadow!'' He panted as Shadow lifted his head off of his master's cock. He stepped over his master and laid carefully atop him. He lowered his head to Hercules and lovingly licked his master. Hercules laughed and stroked his mount back. ''Easy big fella!'' He stroked his mount as Shadow returned each stroke with a lick. The two giants laid like this for ten minutes before...</span></div></div>",

But he was a very large and powerful creature. He backed up as Hercules sat up and stood back up. His cock had slid back into his sheath. He reached for his loincloth. Whilst it was still a little moist he decided to put it back on anyway. Shadow eagerly waited for him nearby. His tail thrashed about and his tongue lulled, oozing drool onto the wrecked homes and streets below. Hercules walked up to his mount and stroked his mane. Shadow groaned out loud as Hercules's hands ran through his mane. ''We've never interacted like that before Shadow, time for me to return the favour'' he whispered into his ear as he walked along his mount. Reaching his backside Hercules studied the back piece. It bulged outwards to cover the huge genitals underneath. From out here Hercules could smell Shadow's musk. He unclipped the armour whilst Shadow intently looked back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules knew just how big Shadow's balls were as he of course had to cover them multiple times. Shadow's bits were just over twice the size of his and about level with his head. ''Such monsters'' he muttered as his eyes met the now exposed nuts and sheath. He'd never touched them before. He dropped the armour aside and reached for his mounts balls. Like his own they were so soft and squishy. Shadow let off a loud and long content groan as his balls were fondled by his master. ''Like that big boy?'' Asked Hercules. Another loud groan confirmed Shadow's consent. Hercules picked up the increasing musk. Shadows sheath was swelling as out slid his cock. Like his it was barbed but a lot shorter and fatter. Hercules grabbed the cock in his hand and pumped it. Increasing Shadow's arousal. The balls pulled back as with a grunt Shadow ejaculated, all over Hercules's chest! Hercules gasped ''Damn Shadow!'' The cum soaked into his fur. Curious he wiped a blob off with his finger and gave it a taste. 'So thick, hot and tasty' he thought. His mount had sucked him off, he would do the same. Eagerly Hercules opened his mouth and placed it over Shadows erection. Shadow moaned as his master sucked him off. Hercules caressed Shadows dong with his tongue. The barbs feeling great as With a grunt Shadow fired off another load of cum. Hercules eagerly swallowed but then another wave of cum was released followed by another and another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules had forgotten that Grand Cats when aroused would orgasm dozens of times though the record was two hundred. He was starting to fill quite full. He took his mouth off of Shadows cock and coughed. ''Too much Shadow!'' He gasped. Shadow growled softly. He was still in the mood and didn't want to stop. Hercules backed up and looked for something to pleasure his now very horny mount...   </span></div></div>",

There was a group nearby he ran to them and before they knew it he had them in his hand. He returned to his Shadow. He snarled as he blew a load onto the street below. His eyes glowed as he hungrily looked about. His eyes set on Hercules. ''Easy big boy. I've got something for you!'' He said softly as he reached Shadows backside. Hercules placed his hand with the humans against one of Shadow's massive balls. The humans squirmed, tickling Shadow's testicle. Which made his snarls return to a content moan. Hercules stood aside as with a grunt Shadows ejaculated over and over. The cum pooling below. But the humans tired and to keep his mount satisfied Hercules had to push against the testicle. With a wet crunch the humans were crushed under the pressure. ''Crap!'' Hercules gasped as he had to back off to find more humans. Shadow snarled once more as he was no longer being pleasured. ''Calm big boy, I'll get some more for you.'' Said Hercules as he searched for more humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the nearby homes were levelled. He found the odd human whom he scooped up but time was running out. Shadow would soon take matters into his own paws. With a loud crash Shadow started to stomp forwards. He was heading further into the suburbs. His boner leaking cum as he walked. Sending thick blobs everywhere. Hercules sighed, at least he wasn't his mounts focus at the moment. Shadow snarled as he approached an untouched area. Here people were still fleeing or hiding. They had little idea what was about to happen. Shadow stepped right over the first house. Until it was under his hind end. Then he squatted down and with a loud crash his genitals crushed the house, his dick penetrated within. He groaned and blew his load. The house exploded in a shower of cum, furniture and debris. But his hump had the desired effect. All the humans started to flee there homes. The streets filled with them running and screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had them right where he wanted. He positioned his bits over the street and squatted down. His heavy balls and cock slammed onto the humans. Crushing them under their bulk. He dragged himself forwards. Humans were pulled under his bits sending waves of pleasure through his body. He even had a few humans enter his urethra, the tunnel slick with his seed. Then he blew his load. The tsunami of hot seed smothering dozens. They didn't get to suffocate as Shadow dragged himself over them. He repeated the process constantly. Drag himself alone, ejaculate, drag along... After a few dozen orgasms his sexual appetite was satisfied. His cock slid back into its sheath and he stood back up. He casually turned around and strolled back towards Hercules. Who had been intently watching mount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuffed as he approached Hercules, who walked up to meet his mount. ''What a show Shadow. I've never seen you go like that before. All better now big boy?'' He asked as he stroked his mount's muzzle. A content groan confirmed Shadow had indeed relieved himself. ''Let's get your armour back on. Oh with a surprise'' Hercules held up Shadows back armour piece. Within were the few humans he captured. ''Just to keep you happy'' he giggled as he placed the armour back over Shadow's genitals. The humans enveloped in darkness and his thick musk. They of course struggled about tickling Shadow's balls but he was not driven into sexual overdrive this time. The humans however soon slid down to Shadows sheath, finding the grilles that let him pe whilst armoured up. The stench of his piss was strong. The humans tried to squeeze through...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules picked up Shadows Head armour. ''Let's leave this off for now'' he instead tied it to a strap hanging over Shadows belly armour. ''So big boy. Lay down so I can mount you.'' Instructed Hercules. Shadow of course obeyed he laid down so Hercules could mount him. His armour having a saddle like section for a rider. Once mounted Shadow stood up and awaited instructions. Hercules looked about from his higher up position. There was more of the city to explore or they could venture elsewhere and see what they find...  </span></div></div>",

Hercules studied the rest of the city. There were thousands of more houses. Hundreds of small stores, garages, two stadiums, several sky scrapers and so on. He sniffed the air. He could smell millions of humans. Though most were trying to flee the city in anyway possible. Whilst the two Cats had messed about with each other most humans had fled from the immediate borough. ''I think there's plenty more for us to check out Shadow. Walk down that path'' Instructed Hercules. Pointing at a large road that ran from the suburbs right into the city's centre. Shadow obeyed. He stomped forwards, going at a leisurely pace. Far ahead Hercules could see humans. Fleeing throughout the streets. ''That's right! Run little bugs!'' He laughed. Shadow snarled loudly, blowing out many nearby windows. Hercules giggled and stroked Shadows ear. ''Such a big bad boy!'' Shadow groaned as he casually stomped right along the road. It was actually narrower than his body, so it ran right through his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany more homes were levelled as Shadow tore right through them. Abandoned vehicles were blown over by each of his paw steps. Any hard surface he stepped on instantly shattered under his bulk. His paws displaced great quantities of air, creating powerful gusts of wind and to add to it each step shook the ground. Far outside the city seismometers were going crazy. Hercules of course noticed the damage and effect of each paw step of his mount. ''So destructive and you're  just walking, we are like gods to these little bugs'' Shadow grumbled in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they was now leaving the suburbs and reaching a commerce area. Single storey shops, cinemas, fast food restaurants lined along the road with large car parks. So Shadow was now just stepping on tarmac. Within the buildings humans cowered, hoping the giants would walk on. Hercules sniffed the air. He could smell the humans in the surrounding buildings. ''Stop Shadow'' he ordered. Shadow came to a halt as he to sniffed about. A nearby building caught their interest. ''Let's check it out Shadow'' said Hercules as Shadow headed for the building of interest... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building is an...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The building in question was a fast food restaurant, of the Burger variety. Both Hercules's and Shadow's sensitive noses picked up many to them exotic scents. Processed meat, cheese, salad potatoes, grease, oil, fat and so on. ''Such a strange scent. I can smell the little creatures in there. I wonder if this is were they hoard their food?'' Hercules said to himself. Shadow grumbled and snorted as he found the scent to be quite strong. He sneezed several times. ''Oh my, not often you sneeze Shadow'' gasped Hercules. But both were still curious of the building. ''Try to block off the scent Shadow. Go easy, so not to level the place.'' Shadow obeyed, he slowed to a slow stalk. His massive paws lifting slowly forwards one by one and coming down gently. Though the tarmac still cracked under his sheer bulk. Humans in the burger joint hid under tables, in the toilets, store room and kitchen. Which was futile, both Cats could easily smell them. ''Aww trying to hide I see. Not that it'll do you any good!'' Laughed Hercules as through the windows he could see the humans cowering under the tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow finally reached the restaurant. He stared down at the roof, cocking his head and looking at it from side to side. ''Rip it off Shadow'' instructed Hercules. Shadow lifted one of his paws over the of the roof. The long claws easily sliced into the structure. With a grunt he pulled back. The roof peeled off like a sardine can. Exposing the interior. ''Surprise!'' Giggled Hercules as Shadow lowered his head into the restaurant. He snarled as the humans screams annoyed him. Many humans fainted or were knocked out by his powerful snarl. He sniffed loudly. Paper napkins and wrappers were sucked into his nostrils. Shadow snuffled and then loudly he sneezed. Blasting snot all over the place. ''Eww... Gross Shadow. I'm not trying any of the food in there now!'' Shadow wasn't bothered at all. He released his powerful tongue, the massive muscle crushed tables and humans as he lapped about. Humans, burgers, fries, salads, paper, tables...He lapped them all up and swallowed. He cleared the dining area in seconds. His tongue slid into the kitchen. First hitting the store room and devouring most of the stock. But his tongue continued into the kitchen. It hit the red hot deep fat fryer. Shadow roared as he burnt his tongue. The roar shattered walls and even made Hercules jump. He lifted his head away and then he swiped with his paws. Demolishing the restaurant and sending debris flying for miles. Dozens of humans were crushed by the flying debris and countless more businesses were damaged by the enraged Cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow shook his head and continued to snarl as he was in so much pain. His tongue whilst powerful was still sensitive and having touched red hot oil that stuck to the muscle he salivated heavily. Flinging drool everywhere. Hercules held on for dear life. ''Woah! Easy Shadow!'' He cried but Shadow was to focused on his burnt tongue. He stomped about as he looked for water to cool his tongue. He was careless were he stepped. Humans, cars, buildings... He stomped through them all. He moved at a brisk pace, desperately he looked about for water. Hercules could do nothing but hold on tight. An enraged and/or injured Grand Cat was a dangerous beast to control. Hercules knew he would have to let Shadow do what he wants. Not that he blamed him. 'Fucking bugs hurt my mount!' He thought as Shadow ploughed on through the city, until he found a source of water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He saw the hoses spraying water and that was enough to get his attention. He stomped towards the truck. The firemen saw him coming. ''Fuck! Run!'' They dropped the hoses and ran. The driver started to pull away but it was to late. Shadow lowered his head and a loud crunch his fangs pierced the truck as he lifted it into the air in his jaws. Already cool water gushed from the onboard water tank. Soothing his burnt tongue. He groaned contently as he sat down. Right on the burning building. His armour in this case protected him from the flames. The odd flame flickered through the grilles for his pee. But the trapped humans acted as living shields. They were moist with sweat.  The burning building easily crumbled and thanks to the few thousand tonnes of beast sat upon it he snuffed out the flames. Hercules leapt off his mount and waited nearby. Shadow sighed as the fire truck successfully cooled his tongue. He swallowed the water and firemen who were still in the truck. With a toss of his head he tossed the mangled truck into a nearby building. He stood back up and looked back at Hercules. ''All better big boy?'' He asked. Shadow chuffed in reply as Hercules came back up to him. Hercules studied Shadows backside. Apart from burnt rubble he was fine. He brushed off the rubble and noticed the humans were still alive within the armour. ''I see your 'passengers' are still alive Shadow. How I don't know'' Hercules giggled as he looked at humans struggling to get through the grilles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped when a rumble came from within Shadows belly. Shadow gritted his fangs as his belly rumbled again. ''What's the matter?'' Gasped Hercules as without warning. PHWARP! Shadow let off an ear splitting fart! ''Fuck me Shadow!''  Cried Hercules as not only was the fart loud it absolutely stank. The greasy junk food was having a really bad effect on his bowels. Shadow snarled as he let off another guff. The humans choked on the monstrous stench and passed out. Hercules covered his nose and wafted his free hand. ''I think you've eaten something bad!'' He sighed as he once again had to remove his mounts back armour piece. ''Don't fart in my face!'' He growled as he exposed Shadows backside. His tailhole puckered as he let off another fart. Blasting Hercules right in the face. Hercules cried and fell back, levelling a few buildings. ''Fucking hell Shadow!'' He growled as he sat up. Shadow whined and turned around and lowered his head to Hercules. Hercules sighed and stroked him. ''I'm fine, you can't help it. But I think we need to find somewhere for you to defecate'' Hercules stood up and walked on along the streets. His mount following. Farting the whole way as the greasy junk food irritated his bowels. The farts were so loud they blew out windows and cracked concrete. Any humans within a mile was treated to the horrific stench of his bowels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't hold back much longer, his ring was stinging as he continued to fart. He needed to find  a suitable latrine or he was going to do it on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The stadium, it was the right height and of course the pitch 'bowl' was fully enclosed, so it should contain the mess. ''Over there Shadow!'' Hercules pointed at the stadium as he head for it, following the streets. There were more cars and humans here as the area had not fully evacuated. Hercules simply stepped on them or kicked them aside. Those he missed were crushed under Shadows mighty paws. Those really 'lucky' to survive both cats paws were instead blasted with Shadows rancid greasy flatulence. The grease and processed meat were playing absolute havoc with his gut. The great predator could easily devour tonnes of raw meat, but just a few dozen kilos of greasy junk food was enough to very quickly give him the squirts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Shadow managed to hold it in as they reached the stadiums car park. It was fairly deserted, apart from the odd car that ended up both of their paws. Hercules walked up to the stadium and gazed in. 'What a strange construct. Is that Earth in there?' He thought as he studied the pitch and the surrounding seating. 'What do these creatures use this thing for I wonder. Well I know what Shadow will be.' He noticed a few humans cowering in amongst the seats. He grinned '' I wouldn't hide there, unless you want to drown!'' He laughed as he stepped back and Patted Shadows head. ''There you go Shadow, take a shit in there!'' He backed away as Shadow turned around and backed up. The top of the Stadium was almost level with his balls. With a loud crash his two giant fluffy balls rolled across the roof. His sheath cutting into the roof with ease. His legs pressed back into the side of the stadium, cracking the structure as he sat back slightly. Positioning his butt so it was aimed over the pitch. He sat back, the stadium groaned under his weight but it held. He lifted his armoured tail, fully exposing his puckering ring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans within the stadium thought they would be safe in here. But when they heard the beasts approach they cowered behind the seats and even with the hallways. Above the great head of the giant Liger grinned down at them. His eyes scanning them and the rest of the stadium. ''Where's the four legged monster?'' Asked Bob, one of the humans as he was sure he had felt the other giants heavy footsteps. The Liger backed away. Bob sighed in relief but then the a great armoured tail appeared, backing up over the stadium. He heard a loud crash and felt the stadium shake as soon the whole backside appeared atop the stadium. two giant fluffy balls indicating he was a very well endowed male. But with a grunt the beast sat back and raised his tail. Exposing his tailhole. A great wrinkled puckering pink ring. The beast grunted again as his tailhole expanded. ''Oh no! No!'' Cried bob as he turned to run. But it was to late... PHWARP! The beast let off an ear splitting fart immediately followed by a wave of thick, mushy shit. Poor bob was instantly smothered in the horrid waste. Drowning in A giant Cats Diarrhoea, what a shit way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow lulled his tongue and moaned contently as he completely flushed his system. Flooding the stadium with his waste. Though it was technically the humans own fault for it was their nasty junk food that caused his stomach troubles. He half filled the stadium. Most of the humans within drowned in the thick stuff. But those on higher levels survived to pass out thanks to the strong stench. The shit slowly flooded into the stadium, heading for the exits. Hercules wafted his nose. ''Phew what a pong Shadow. But is that better big boy?'' He asked as he walked up and stroked his mount. Shadow chuffed happily and rubbed against Hercules. Saying yes in his own way. But Shadow had one last thing to do. He kicked backwards. Knocking the half of the stadium onto his waste. ''Ah, what a good idea Shadow'' laughed Hercules as Shadow walked around the stadium, kicking the whole of the top section onto his waste 'burying' it under tonnes of rubble. Within minutes his shit was covered and the stadium was ruined. ''Well whatever they used that for they won't be using it in a hurry. Serves them right for giving you the shits!''  Hercules said as he studied the wrecked stadium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around to Shadows rear to give his backside a look. His tailhole was no longer puckering and the farts had stopped. Though it looked somewhat sore. ''I think I'll leave your backside uncovered for now Shadow. Is your butt sore?'' He asked. Shadow whined. ''I take that as a yes. Lets find something to relieve it, shall we?'' Shadow chuffed and laid down so Hercules could mount him. He stood up and awaited instructions. Shadow's anus really was quite sore, he would love to rub it against something. Master would find something for him to rub against. he looked around himself. The tall skyscrapers looked appealing. But then the little humans caught his eyes.  He could use their struggling little bodies to massage his anus. But he would use whatever master chose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does Hercules decide to let Shadow rub against? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

They ranged from twice to six times as tall as Shadow. Shadow chuffed in agreement. They did indeed look sturdy enough to rub his backside against. Hopefully they won't collapse unlike the apartment buildings he demolished earlier.  He started to stomp along the streets once more as he made his way towards the city centre. He ignored the humans and vehicles below. Casually stomping on them or kicking them away. As he walked further into the city the buildings grew taller and the streets narrowed. Shadows head armour, that was hanging over his side was already smashing through buildings.  '' Don't worry just keep smashing through them Shadow!'' Ordered Hercules as the buildings finally ended up not having a sufficient gap. for his body. His thick muscular shoulders easily pushed through the front of buildings. His armour shielding him and the many spikes and blades helped him tear through concrete and steel like tissue paper. Any humans in the front half of a building would would be crushed as the building collapsed around them. Shadow and Hercules didn't care at all. Shadow just wanted to itch his backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter carving his way to the centre Shadow stopped as they reached the skyscrapers. Unlike the other buildings every skyscraper was surrounded by a large plaza, so he at least had room to manoeuvre. He looked up at the tall structures the glass made them look so shiny and mesmerised both Cats. ''Oh wow. How did they even make these hives?'' Muttered Hercules. Shadow growled. Hercules jumped then realised why. Shadow was looking at his own reflection. He pounced forwards and with a loud crash he swiped at the other Cat. His armour claws ripped through glass with ease. Exposing the interior. Below humans were running all over the place. The shards of glass sliced down on them like blades. Making a right bloody mess. Shadow's growl faded as the other Cat was gone. He looked in the now exposed skyscraper. Humans and office s stared back at him. He sniffed and snorted. Hercules face palmed. ''Shadow... It was just your reflection you big grumpy furball!'' Shadow grunted and turned around. The humans within screamed as his snarling face was replaced with his backside. His tail lifted to show off his balls and sheath. With a grunt Shadow marked the structure. His hot corrosive piss sizzled as it dissolved humans and furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stomped away to find another skyscraper. There was one twice his height and many times wider. It looked perfect! He ignored the reflection, though realising it was him he stopped to admire his own face. His lovely sharp white sabres glistened. Within humans gawped out at him in shock. The giant cat just loomed before them. Baring it's fangs but not growling. Shadow released his tongue and gave the glass a few broad and sloppy licks. He wanted to moisten it up for his backside. The humans just saw a great pink fleshy blanket slurp against the windows. The glass cracked under the pressure and was covered in wet lick marks. But worse was to come. Shadow turned and lifted his tail high up to expose his backside once more. The humans now had a view of his gigantic balls, sheath and puckering anus. With a grunt Shadow backed up and the humans screamed as his bits zoomed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith ease his fat balls and sheath penetrate the skyscraper. They slid over humans and furniture, crushing them under their sheer bulk. His balls were several storeys high, entire floors were demolished as he backed up against the building until his ring was touching the saliva coated glass. He groaned and began to rub from side to side. He tipped his head pant and lulled his tongue as his stinging anus was rubbed. It felt so good! And his balls and sheath tingled as they smashed about. He was absolutely loving it. Hercules giggled as he looked back to watch his mount rub his backside. ''Enjoying that Shadow?'' He asked. Shadow just kept rubbing away. But soon he had gouged out a long horizontal section of the skyscraper. He stepped forwards and with a grunt he marked the building several times. His corrosive mist like piss filled the structure. Burning away at anything it touched. He was far from done. He headed for the next skyscraper and repeated the process. With half an hour every skyscraper had been used as a itching/marking post. His anus no longer itched. The skyscrapers sizzled from within as his piss ate away at the supports. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow stopped and laid down on one of the Plazas. Crushing several humans and newspaper stands. Hercules stepped off and surveyed the area. ''What a mess Shadow. Just using your balls.'' Loud slurps filled the air as Shadow took his head to his backside and licked his nuts and sheath. The fat barbed tongue lovingly wrapped around his nuts and sheath as he cleaned off the remains of humans and furniture. ''Really Shadow'' sighed Hercules as he looked up at the skyscrapers. He was feeling a little hard down below. 'I wonder what these things feel like to hump' he thought as Shadow's slurps echoed throughout. The humans screams also echoed as they were burnt alive, trapped or fled on foot. Finally though Shadow's licking session was interrupted by...</span></div></div>",

His cock's barbed tip was already peeking out of the sheath. He approached the opposite side to were Shadow had rubbed his backside. He stopped before the skyscraper, so that his bits were inches away from the windows. He deliberately held back to give the humans a chance to admire his bits. But of course the humans were all dead or dying. Thanks to Shadows corrosive piss. Hercules lifted his hands and gripped the skyscraper. His claws easily ripping through the glass. Several humans were skewered by his claws. Any human high enough within the skyscrapers had been 'safe' from Shadows piss. Though they were all trapped. Hercules carefully pressed his nuts and sheath against the skyscraper. The windows cracked under the pressure, but they just about held. ''Ooh...'' He moaned as the smooth glass felt so good. He dragged himself up and down. His balls tingled and sent waves of pleasure throughout his body. His cock grew harder, slowly it emerged from the sheath and swelled as he got a raging hard on. The pointed barbed tip of his cock tore through the glass. Hercules groaned and backed up a little. He used his hand to hold his cock horizontal and then he thrusted forwards. His cock rudely penetrated the skyscraper. Crushing furniture and humans. His balls smashed into the scraper as he fully inserted himself. His balls easily smashed into the building, taking out several floors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow intently watched his master as he humped the nearest skyscraper. He sat up and swished his tail as he watched his master hump the skyscraper. Hercules snarled ''Ah fuck your piss stings Shadow!'' His dick was rubbing over Shadows pee, which was so strong it made Hercules cock tingle. Shadow snorted at his masters comment. His piss smelt lovely and surely would feel great as well?! But Hercules was his master and he wouldn't grumble over the matter. Hercules continued to thrust against the skyscraper. Shadows piss was only producing  a slight stinging sensation. Hercules's pre was already starting to ooze out and envelop his cock. Hercules couldn't hold back. He roared as his balls pulled back and his cock exploded a long thick stream of cum. The cum tore out the other side of the skyscraper and splattered over the side of the next skyscraper. Some blobs of the thick love sauce landed on the streets. Many humans were enveloped in the stuff. Hercules was not done he blew twice more, his cum completely covered the side of the next skyscraper. It oozed down and pooled at the base of that skyscraper. Enveloping even more humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules pulled out and looked down at his erect member. ''Fuck! I need more release!'' He headed to another skyscraper and repeated the process. Being a big cat he could ejaculate dozens of times in succession. He humped every skyscraper. So all the structures had been violated by both Cats. On one side was the area gouged out by Shadows balls and lower down the hole were Hercules's cum had shot out. The other side having a large hole were Hercules had thrust in. All the skyscrapers overall integrity had been seriously compromised, it wouldn't take much to make them collapse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules sighed and sat down. He stroked his member and balls as he calmed down. Shadow stood up and...</span></div></div>",

To him it was as pleasant as an expensive perfume. His powerful sniffs created a powerful suction. Paper, litter and even humans were pulled into his nostrils. Unfortunately this made his nose tingle. He snuffled and then loudly sneezed. Blowing out windows and ejected the humans at high speed. His thick snot splattered all over the skyscraper. ''Damn Shadow! What a sneeze!'' Laughed Hercules. Shadow snorted as he walked around the skyscraper. He lowered his head to the ground and sniffed at Hercules's cum. Apart from the cum he smelt the humans trapped within. He eagerly released his tongue and lapped the cum and humans up. He gulped loudly and moaned. So delicious!  He strolled about, licking up every blob of Hercules's cum. His tail whipped about, tearing into the skyscrapers. His belly filled once more, but unlike the greasy food he could actually digest the humans. So he wouldn't get the shits again. That had been so unpleasant, but as he licked up the last pool of cum and smashed his tail into a skyscraper...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skyscraper roared as it collapsed violently. As it wasn't a controlled demolition it collapsed outwards. Sending large chunks of itself into the surrounding skyscrapers. Shadow yelped and leapt back. Smashing against a skyscraper which also collapsed. It fell onto his armour as he leapt away again. Hercules gasped ''Fuck!'' As he had to leap back to avoid being buried..

Shadow stalked around the centre/large dust cloud. Smashing through the smaller buildings without a care. He still couldn't smell or see Hercules. He snarled as he realised that Hercules must of been trapped by the strange bugs collapsing hives! He swiped at an nearby office block, his claws gouged out four long slashes. He had slashed some humans on his claws. In his anger he leapt forwards and sunk his long sabres into the building. They punctured deep. Slicing through several floors.

Shadow backed up and bared his fangs. A low, deep rumble from his throat signalling his anger. His eyes narrowed to glowing slits as he fumed. These puny insects had killed his master! Now Grand Cats are fiercely loyal to their masters and they will avenge their masters if killed. Shadow already had a terrible temper and the humans were about to be on the receiving end of his fury.

She cooed as she approached. Below people screamed as she stepped over them. All they saw was her scale covered belly and long tail whizz by overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the play park the children watched the behemoth approach. Some ran but most stayed stuck on the spot. She stopped overhead and laid down. Ignoring the screams beneath her as she   laid down. CRUNCH. She heard the many crunches as she pulverised a few dozen humans under her belly. ''oops! Sorry!'' She whined as she realised her mistake. But her attention soon returned to the children. She lowered her head to them. ''Aww, so cute and tiny!'' She found them to be utterly adorable! She would love to give them a hug, but that would be impossible at her great size. She released her tongue for a lick. They backed away. ''Aww! I'll be gentle!'' She whined. To them her reassurance came out as a growl and she was showing off her fang filled maw... They all screamed and ran. She whined and lowered her ears. That hadn't gone to plan... She stood back up and noticed a twinge from her back end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back and whined. ''Going into heat again!'' She said. As her lips began to moisten and swell. She whined again as now she was feeling lustful. She needed to drag her vagina over something or find something to shove up it. She desperately looked for something to use to sate her sexual appetite...</span></div></div>",

She whined as her arousal and lust increased. ''Damn, always getting into heat so easy!'' She growled. Dragon Wolves would go into heat in just about any sexual situation or when feeling broody. Seeing the human children was more than a sufficient trigger. She yipped. ''Yes! The humans!'' She barked as she looked down at them running about. One wouldn't be enough, she needed a group. She walked on, looking for a big enough group. She wasn't watching where she was stepping. Many were crushed or skewered by her talons. Trees were knocked aside as were lamp posts. The lawns ruined with deep foot prints. Some humans who were in her way were not killed by her paws but instead got to watch her mighty body pass overhead. Her tail raised showing off her swollen dripping vulva. Her juices red hot splattered on people. Painfully burning them to death. Behind she left not only a trail of death and destruction. But one of her enticing juices. Any male within twenty miles, or a few hundred on this world would pick up her scent. She whined ''please be a big male for me out there!'' As she walked on and finally she found a big enough group of humans! She barked happily and bound over to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd screamed as they saw her coming after them. Her powerful footsteps shook the ground, knocking many over. With one big leap she lands over the group. Knocking them all down. She grins down at them happily. Her slobbering tongue lulled and fangs displayed in a toothy grin. ''Hi cuties! Want to have some fun with a big sexy girl?!'' She said happily. She stepped on over them, presenting her backside. The humans screamed or silently stared up in shock at the sight over them. Her vulva swollen and moist. Her wrinkled tailhole puckered and either side of the holes was her large butt cheeks. She wriggled her backside, teasingly. ''Ooh. Time for some fun!'' She giggled as she folded her hindlegs. Dropping her backside onto the crowd. They tried to run but it was to late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUMPF! SQUELCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who ended up under her two fluffy cheeks were instantly turned into paste. Those who ended up under her hard moist lips were crushed. Though under her anus or under her slit were swallowed by the two orifices. those in her anus were instantly hit by the smell of shit. The air thin and rancid. Her walls covered in dried shit coating the people. Those in her vagina were smothered by smooth warm flesh. She howled out in ecstasy as she swallowed and crushed the humans. ''Fuck!'' She growled as she sucked them in deeper. The humans struggles sending waves of pleasure throughout her body!  She gritted her fangs as she felt like she was going to burst! ''Ooh yeah.... Tickle me... Fuck yeah!'' She whined as she neared climax. She ground her backside over the ground, adding to the pleasure. Her vagina began to contract violently, crushing the humans within. They screamed as they was steadily crushed by each contraction. Finally she gave one big heave and the humans were all crushed by her powerful vagina. She snarled lustfully as she stood up and blasted out her thick hot female juices. The humans crushed remains blasted out. Those in her anus were all unconscious,. thanks to the powerful stench. She let off a small fart, which blasted the humans out at great speed. Smashing their little bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood panting, her vagina dripping. Behind her little sex toys were all dead. She looked back and whined ''So fun, but to fragile!'' She had really enjoyed that. But she was still feeling horny. She needed more release. She walked on looking for something to pleasure herself with. The humans whilst fun were just to fragile. Maybe one of their creations would be of use. She leapt up into the air and beating her great wings gained enough altitude to hover over the city. From up here she could see for dozens of miles. Her keen eyes scanned the city for a suitable sex toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her eyes spot the perfect object...        </span></div></div>",

There had been many protests about the explicitly shaped house, but so far it had remained standing. But now it had caught the eye of Umbra. Who was in need of such a building. She flew on over as fast as she could. Her tongue lulled and splattering saliva onto the city. Her vagina still oozed her juices. Which also splattered onto the city. Her drool harmlessly stuck on vehicles and humans but her love juices burnt who or whatever, they landed upon. She couldn't believe her luck! ''It's the perfect size for me!'' She laughed as she approached the phallus house. 'How thoughtful of them!' She thought as she landed near to the house. On landing she crushed several others houses, but she didn't really notice or care. her tail swayed about rapidly. Adding to the destruction. She eyed up the house as she stepped on over it. ''Perfect! Thanks for the toy cuties!'' She giggled as she thanked the nearby humans who hadn't ran or been blasted away. Lining up her vagina she squatted onto the building. Her moist wet lips sliding over it with ease. She tipped her head back and moaned as she pushed down further. Swallowing the house within her hot slimy  passage. Once again waves of pleasure shot through her body. She gritted her fangs as she would rise up then push back down, going lower each time. The house for now was withstanding her insertion. But soon she'd do more to test it's strength...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she managed to fully insert the building. Her lips touching the ground. She grunted and squeezed. The house groaned. The second squeeze it cracked. The windows shattered and her juices started to flood into the house. The house's owner was still inside. All he could see was a great pink blanket of smooth flesh smothering the windows. His house groaning around him. The air getting hot and stinking of her juices. When she started to squeeze he screamed as the windows shattered and hot burning juices enveloped him. Her third squeeze and the house started to crumble. The fourth and final contraction shatters the house. It crumbles into a pile of rubble soaked in her thick juices. She howled as she crushed the house. ''Fuck!'' She cried as she felt the tumbling bricks crash down her vagina. Sending more waves of pleasure through her body. But the fun was other, the house now finally demolished, though not how protestors would of expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and looked back at the slimy rubble. ''Ooh that was better. But not strong enough for me little cuties!'' She laughed as she looked at the odd human who rather than running had watched her lewd act. She was still feeling horny. But it seemed she'd attracted some attention. Her nostrils flare as she takes in the scent. Her ears swivel on the sound and she looks at the thing she'd attracted... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon she saw him, flying over the city. He was huge! His legs thick and muscular. But the massive sheath and balls between his hind legs was what had most of her attention. ''What a stud!'' She said in awe. The male was grinning as he approached her. In his fore paws he was carrying a bus in each. Packed full of humans. He landed a short distance from her. He stood up on his hind legs. His great wings spread to support him and show off his body. Umbra was fixed on his massive balls and sheath. ''Like what you see babe?'' He said seductively. She panted ''Ooh yes! What a stud!'' He grinned but brought his attention to the bus in each paw. ''Sorry cuties. We shall have fun later!'' He licked each bus, soaking it in drool before carefully setting them down. He now dropped onto all fours as his paws were free. The humans on the buses quickly piled out as he approached the female. He smashed through the few standing houses without care. She turned and presented her backside. ''Show me what you've got!'' She giggled as she wriggled her hips. He licked his lips and pounced on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrapped his forepaws around her waist and used his wings to stabilise himself as he began to thrust into her. She groaned as he inserted himself into her. In just a few humps his cock was fully erect and tied. His massive ponderous balls loudly slapped into her cheeks. With every thrust. She squeezed on his member. ''So big'' She whined. The male snarled as he orgasmed. Filling her with his fertile cum. He blew into her several times. Ensuring insemination took place. Once spent rather than lifting his leg other like a canine. He simply remained standing over her with is cock tied. ''An hour of this my love!'' Panted the male. The female whined but said nothing. unlike canines who remain tied for around half an hour Dragon Wolves take around an hour. This did give them a very high success rate and this time was no failure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd of onlookers had gather to film the two mating giants. They spotted their admirers. ''Aww we'll soon be with you!'' Panted the female. The male grinned ''Oh yes. We shall have some fun with them next!'' The people who must of been mad or brave to stay filming the giants had little idea what they were getting themselves into. Fifty minutes pass, the male groans as he finally feels his boner was going down. ''Soon be free!'' he pants...</span></div></div>",

His knot having gone down his cock pops free and swings about, splattering the odd drop of cum onto the wreckage below. He licked Umbra's vagina lovingly. ''ooh so tasty!'' He laughed. She moaned with pleasure. ''So big, powerful and sexy!'' She said softly to her large mate. He came up alongside her and licked her muzzle. She released her tongue and they wrapped in a big sloppy mess. Both groaning as it was their way of kissing. Finally the release each others tongues. ''Oh I forgot I'm umbra, what's your name big boy?'' Umbra asked the big male. He grinned ''Umbra? Lovely name as for me, I am called Tenebris.'' Tenebris looked down at the crowd of humans, who still were filming them or watching. ''Now, time to spread the love with the little ones!'' He licked his lips as he headed for a nearby crowd. They screamed and ran. He giggled ''Wanna play chase huh?!'' He crouched down ad with a grunt he leapt forwards. His fore paws tearing up large chunks of earth and wreckage. He landed over the group. His fore paws slamming down either side of them. The violent impact shaking the ground. The humans fell over, nearby buildings fell and great fissures appeared from under his paws. He grinned down at the crowd. His fangs on display as he licked his muzzle. ''Hee hee gotcha!'' He laughed. To the humans it sounded more like a roar. He stepped over them. All they could do was gawp up at his scaled belly but then his still erect member and large testicles sway overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe teasingly spread his hind legs and wriggled his hips, to make his large genital sway. His potent musk made the humans choke. Some started to run, others were to shocked or injured to move. ''Like what you see? What about a closer look?!'' He laughed as he squatted down. Lowering his privates onto the dazed crowd. More ran or tried to crawl away as his monstrously big genitals were coming down on them. But it was to late... His heavy fat balls land first. As he was lowering them slowly there was hardly a sound as they touched down. Apart from the crunching of several people who had been directly under the testicles. A few were smothered by his thick and heavy scrotum. His cock however he was very careful and precise. rather than letting it slam down he managed to hold it just inches from the ground. Now his cock, blue slightly barded was also very sticky. All those under his member found themselves sticking to it! ''Ahhhh....'' Moaned Tenebris as he felt the many hands struggling against his member. Those in his scrotum were just as ticklish. Great waves of pleasure shot through his massive muscular body once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood back up, the humans screamed as they rose up high into the air, still stuck on the bottom of his dick. He looked over at Umbra. Who watched him intently. ''Aww sorry babe! Want to join in?'' He dropped onto his side, crushing more houses and many unlucky people. His 'passengers' were jolted about by his flopping cock, but it was so sticky they weren't shaken free. He rolled right onto his back. His legs sprawled out along with his massive wings. More destruction was caused by his wings. But he didn't really notice or care. His dick stood up to attention. The female giggled and strolled on over. She stepped over him with her head over his genitals and her vagina over his head. ''Lovely!'' They said together as they both released their forked tongues. Both moaned with ecstasy as their tongues probed at each other's genitals. He thrust his tongue in deep to her slick love tunnel. She wrapped her tongue tight around his cock and squeezed. Several humans crushed under her tongue as the two giants sixty nine each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few humans on the cock screamed as her powerful slobbering tongue slid ever closer. Behind her wide fang filled maw loomed as she took the tip of his cock into her mouth and then she started to suck. Tenebris snarled as he was given a blow job by Umbra. He released his tongue from her vagina and panted heavily. ''Ohh... Yeah....'' He panted in ecstasy. He couldn't hold back. Though largely spent he still had a small reserve of cum left. Umbra had managed to suck the humans free into her maw. But she hadn't swallowed... Yet. He couldn't hold it. With a ferocious snarl he blew his load. Filling her maw with his thick, creamy love sauce. Umbra moaned and swallowed his sauce along with the little treats, the humans. She released his cock and stood panting over him. ''Fuck, that was good!'' She panted. Her mouth dripping the odd drop of cum. The big male under her grinned. ''Ooh yes! And there's so much more to play with! I'm loving this place and these funny little creatures!'' She stepped off over him so he could get back up. ''Ooh where to next?!'' Groaned Umbra as Tenebris came up beside her. The two giants study the city. Full of lust the two horny giants look for something else to 'play' with...   </span></div></div>",

Barked Tenebris. He leapt into the air and flapped his mighty wings. The ferocious winds pick up even more destructive than Umbra's. Buildings, cars, humans were brutally blown aside or apart as he flew overhead. Nothing survived in his wake. Umbra followed right behind the larger male. She was more focused on his balls than the destruction and chaos below. In just a few seconds they had reached the skyscrapers and other taller buildings. Tenebris stopped and landed onto his hind legs. He was straddling a tall building, that fit in between his legs. His hind paws having crushed several cars and sunk deep into the surface. Using his tail and wings to support his standing body as he took a more bi pedal stance. He still had an erection. His dick and balls swung about as he balanced. ''Hi cuties! Don't worry! Soon be your time to join in with the fun, with this big sexy boy!'' Laughed Tenebris as he addressed the humans. Of course all they heard was growls and snarls. He looked back at Umbra, who was still in the air. ''Hey babe, why not choose the first one for me?!'' He asked. She nodded and flew around the centre as she eyed up each skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tallest easily stood out. She landed on the street before it. Crushing several cars and humans. But she didn't notice or care. She walked up to the skyscraper, it towered over her and even Tenebris. ''Nice big and strong!'' She muttered as she peered in through the windows. Many humans ran about in terror. ''Hi cuties! Don' panic, just a bit of fun!'' She giggled as she turned around and showed off her backside. She backed up and grunted as her hot wet lips hit as did her puckering ring and fluffy cheeks. She dragged her backside sideways and up and down. The glass shattering under the pressure. Furniture and the unlucky human tumbled out. Tickling her two holes. She shivered with pleasure but she was about to get to watch the big stud nearby work his magic. She walked forwards and found a perfect sized building to sit on. The building groaned under her, she lifted up a little and used her wings to support her weight. She watched Tenebris as he made his approach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now my turn!'' He giggled as he walked on up to the skyscraper. His bigger girth meant he had to tear through several smaller buildings to reach his target. But he wasn't bothered. though debris hit his cock, which made him groan with pleasure. He lowered his head to sniff at the hole Umbra had made. He could smell humans and see them. ''Hi little ones!'' He laughed. His hot breath blasting furniture everywhere and creating a storm of loose paper. He lifted his head and studied the undamaged area before him. More humans ran about in terror. Below they piled out onto the streets. He grinned ''aww. No need to be scared, only a bit of fun!'' He giggled as he lifted onto his hind legs. His massive wings unfolded to balance him. They smashed into adjacent buildings with ease. He wrapped his forelegs around the building and sunk his talons in. Shattering the glass and spilling out more occupants and furniture. the falling debris struck fleeing people below. Killing many. His tail whipped about, tearing through dozens of buildings with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock, still erect juts out of it's sheath before him. He snarled and gave one big thrust forwards. His dick smashes into the scraper violently. Smashing through steel beams  with ease. Furniture was crushed or knocked aside as his cock burrows in deep. He pulled back and thrust again. His balls swung back and forth and like demolition balls they destroyed anything they slammed into. He had squished several humans, but he didn't care or notice. He held his head back and howled as he gave a third thrust and he blew his load. His rich thick seed engulfing several floors and then it began to flood down through the stairwells and lift shafts. Thousands of humans were engulfed and drowned in his thick hot love sauce. To him it had only been a 'small' ejaculation, as he was already heavily spent. But it was still thousands upon thousands of gallons. Floor by floor is flooded, the clear windows turning a murky white as his seed reaches the street and oozes out. By some miracle the building had so far withstood his penetration and filling. The windows epically held out against the pressure of his cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenebris backed out panting heavily. He looked back at Umbra, who had been watching intently. Her tail whipped about, destroying buildings and killing hundreds. ''I'm done! Enough sex for today!'' He panted. She grinned ''Aw, but what a show! I think the little one liked it!'' He grinned ''Aww. But we can still have fun with them!'' He laughed as he turned and took off into the sky. His wing beat violently blasted out the skyscrapers windows. His seed now oozed out and down all the sides. Umbra followed. Her wing beat demolishing the building that she had been sat on. Now they hovered high over the city. Giving them a good view of the sprawling metropolis and surrounding area. Their trail of destruction clearly visible from up here. Below a great cloud of dust was enveloping downtown, thanks to all the buildings they had demolished. The skyscraper still stood, though windowless and gutted. Tenebris's fat cock finally returned to it's sheath. Umbra's vagina drying as she came out of heat as quick as she came in. She was now pregnant thanks to the big male. They looked about as they looked for the next thing to interact with. This time their interaction would be non sexual. They set their eyes upon...  </span></div></div>",

Twenty platforms, it was a huge transport hub and used by hundreds of thousands daily. Now it was especially busy as people tried to fell the city. Dozens of trains were already moving away. At nearly every platform another train was being loaded up by the fleeing crowds. They packed in like sardines, discomfort of no issue they just wanted to get away! The two giant Dragon Wolves sensitive noses easily locating the large concentration of humans. ''There they are! Let's go say hello!'' Laughed Tenebris as he started to glide down to the station. Umbra quickly glided after him. At first nobody noticed them approach, as they were so silent now that their gigantic wings were not beating. But soon the two giants cast a large shadow that swallows the entire station. The hysteria increases as the people at the station realise that the two giants are coming right for them. Most of whom had witnessed first hand their previous lewd actions with the skyscraper and each other. People either turn to run away on foot or still try and board the trains. One by one the trains start to pull away. Slow due to their heavily overloaded carriages.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenebris is the first to land. He lands right beside the station, standing adjacent to the platforms.. Crushing buildings under his mighty paws. His talons tearing through steel and concrete with ease. Many humans were killed either under his paws or by falling debris. He didn't notice, he looked down and grinned ''Hi cuties! Were are you going?!'' He giggled. To him this was just a game. His tail whips about slightly. Smashing through even more buildings. On the opposite side Umbra lands. Crushing buildings under her paws. She grins at Tenebris ''Maybe we should show them we are just playing?'' The big male nods. ''Oh yes!'' He groaned and laid down partially on his side. His massive body crushing everything underneath. His great wings he left half folded as his legs sprawl out. His hind paws rip through even more buildings. But his forelegs and paws. slide onto several tracks. The trains on those lines bash harmlessly into him. They were only going slow, so all that happened was they derailed and the passengers were tossed into each other. They all scream when they see the beast grinning at them. His paw that had stopped them lifts and reaches for one of the locomotives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenebris grinned as he had his toys trapped. He reaches for the first locomotive. His fore paws toes were long and not webbed, so he could grip things. He grabs the locomotive and lifts it with ease. The coupling broke as he brought it to his face. He peeked in. Seeing the driver. ''Aww! Hi there little one. Want to see my mouth?!'' He teased as he brought the loco before his mouth and opened wide. His great fangs on display to the terrified driver who screamed and opens the door and leaps. He screamed as he fell but with a quick flick Tenebris catches the driver with his long forked tongue. He takes the man into his mouth and seals him in. He groaned and swished him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbra decided to join in with the fun. She walks forwards and sits on the tracks. She caught a few trains under her backside. She groaned as she felt them crunch under her butt. ''Oops!'' She laughed as she looked down at the many carriages before her. screams from within excited her. Her tail swished about behind. Swatting several other trains that had departed earlier. The carriages scatter across a wide area, smashing into buildings the locomotives explode on landing. She didn't notice or care about the death and destruction behind her. She had enough to focus on below! She licked her lips and lowered her head. She released her tongue and dragged it sloppily along the carriages. They groaned under the pressure and were left with a thick layer of saliva, which oozed down the windows. She spat ''Eurgh! Not very nice tasting!'' She whined. But the humans started to pile out and she laughed. ''Aww. So you want to be licked as well?!'' She eagerly lowered her head and thrust her tongue into the humans. Catching hundreds. She took them into her mouth and sealed them in. She moaned as they struggled about. 'ooh feels so good'... She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giants now had humans trapped in their mouths. Tenebris, the big male having only the one. Whilst Umbra has hundreds struggling about. They both moaned and wagged their tails with excitement. To them the humans struggles was almost as pleasurable as sex. Waves of pleasure fill their large bodies. Tenebris flopped fully onto his side as he continued to play with the human. His body pulverising more buildings. Umbra fell onto her back. Crushing the tracks. Her long tail whips forth into the station. It whipped about with wild abandon. Reducing the station to rubble and throwing the carriages everywhere. Thousands more die, but the two giants are once again lost in bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the question is, what fate awaits the humans within their gigantic maws? </span></div></div>",

She remembered having the humans in her anus, that had felt good and why shouldn't these humans get a go in there as well?! She groaned and rolled over. Pulverising several trackside buildings as she rolled onto them. Now the right way up she stood up and shook herself. All the debris that had became stuck to her fur and scales flies off. thousands of missiles fly far into the city. Laying waste to untouched areas and killing any human that were hit by debris. Which in most cases consisted of great chunks of concrete. She stretched her head back to her backside and she released her tongue with the humans stuck to it. The humans gasped at the fresh air. For like all canines her breath was hot, humid and stank. But their reprieve was only a slight one. Before they saw her great wrinkled ring. They scream and struggle to no avail. Umbra moaned then shoved her tongue deep into her anus. She shivered as it felt so good! She wiped all of the humans off within her slick poo tube. Withdrawing her tongue she sealed her ring, trapping the humans within. ''That's it, struggle cuties!'' She giggled. She looked over at Tenebris he had a look of shock upon his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dith yew real e justh do thath?'' He asked, His words slurred as he still had his human stuck upon his tongue. Umbra laughed and wriggled her but at him. ''Oh yeah! It feels so good! They seem to enjoy it to. Oh my are they ticklish!'' She lulled her tongue and drooled heavily. Tenebris pondered. Should he give it a go? He huffs. Just as well have a go... He stretched his head back to his butt. His long tongue slides out, the human stuck near the tip. The man screamed as the great ring puckered before him, blasting shitty air over him. He was just inches from the disgusting orifice when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKABOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA explosion erupts upon Tenebris's tongue. Instantly vaporising the man and stinging the great Beast. He yipped in surprise. There was a whistle then another explosion erupts on his belly scales. Umbra was yelping as three explosions went off over her body. She spread her wings and snarled. ''We're being attacked!'' Tenebris growled and looked up. In the sky coming at them were eight fighter jets. Already several missiles had been released and struck there mark, to no effect. The big male stood up, his hackles raised and ferocious fangs bared he unfolded his massive wings. With one powerful beat he took off. Sending a tsunami of debris back into the city. Causing ever more destruction. Umbra followed. Her wing beat kicking up nothing but dust. They both headed for the jets, ready to tear them apart. Nobody attacks them and gets away with it! Tenebris particularly was pissed as 'his' human had been blown to bits before he could have more fun with him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question is, is it just these jets to deal with or has the country's military finally responding on a large scale towards these two giants?  </span></div></div>",

The army was marching into the city and firing at them with guns, rocket launchers, tanks and artillery. Tenebris gave one loud growl and beat his wings furiously. Accelerating to Mach 2 his massive body punches through the sound barrier. Producing a extremely loud and powerful sonic boom along with a powerful gust of wind. Within ten miles every windows smashes, ear drums are burst, buildings crack and crumble. The army was blown over by the powerful blast. Briefly stopping their assault. His rapid acceleration catches the jets off guard. Desperately turning it was to late. His body smashes into them, destroying them instantly. He came to a stop, having dealt with the air threat. Umbra stops and hovers nearby. The two giants study the wrecked city below. The ships still fired on them as did the army in the city. Tenebris barked at Umbra. ''Take the floating things! I'll deal with these stinging green bugs below!'' Umbra nods and heads for the ships. Tenebris swoops down towards the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey land at the same time. Landing on their hind legs with tails resting on the ground they crush already wrecked buildings under them. They both stood up, using their wings to balance themselves. They glare down at their targets. The ships fire on, their shells harmlessly blasting against Umbra's belly scales. The army fire up at Tenebris. Again harmlessly blasting against his scales. Their thick fur and flesh easily protecting them just as well. They both bared their fangs angrily ''how dare you attack me?!'' They both snarl. Tenebris couldn't help grunt though every time his sheath and balls were tickled by explosions and bullets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Dragon Wolves have one very one very dangerous ability that Dragons are infamous for. They could fire flames from their mouths. At first it appears as a blue glow from their throats. Then blue flames start to flick from their mouths. Smoke billows from their nostrils as the both blast forth a cone of blue flames. Instantly reducing people to ash and melting metal. They continue to blast forth flames until all the ships, soldiers and vehicles are enveloped. They stop there breath attacks. The ships melting, engulfed in flames sink into the boiling sea. The whole area before Tenebris was alight. Thick black smoke fills the air. Both beasts snort and lift off into the sky. Hovering a mile over the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city was completely trashed. Most of it now consumed by flames and the rest blasted apart by their powerful wing beats. They were at least not being attacked any more. But now the place they had be playing with was wrecked! ''There's nothing left to play with or check out!'' Whined Umbra. Tenebris snorted ''Hmph, at least they got to see our power!'' He blasted out a short cone of fire to demonstrate this. Umbra sighed and looked for something else to check out. The city wasn't the only population centre. She could see several towns and villages. From the city were various roads and railway lines. The roads at near gridlock with fleeing people. She even saw an airport, planes leaving every few seconds. She giggled and dove down. Tenebris yipped ''Wait for me!'' He barked as he dove after her. Umbra flew at a slow pace, so to not cause to much damage below. She wanted to check the humans out, not kill them, though she'd already killed tens of thousands by accident.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Where are we going now?'' Tenebris asked her. Umbra giggled as she told him what had her attention...</span></div></div>",

The 'colourful metal things' being the thousands of vehicles trying to flee the now ruined and burning city. Their great forms cast long shadows over the motorway. People started to abandon their vehicles and run on foot from the approaching giants. Some chose to try and smash their way through. Causing even more chaos. People were run over, cars jammed together, completely blocking the motorway. And neither beasts had even landed yet. With eight heavy thumps that threw vehicles into the air and knocked people over Tenebris and Umbra land in the fields beside the motorway. Both beasts grin down at the humans beneath them. ''Hi cuties!'' Bellows Umbra happily. Her greeting was nothing but a thunderous snarl to the humans now ringing ears. People scramble away from the two beasts. Many were already in the field right under the two giants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbra moves forwards, lowering her head and releasing her forked tongue at the closest people. ''I just want a quick lick!'' She giggled as she curls her tongue around a group of people and wraps them up in it's wet and squishy embrace!  She swishes them out in her maw. Soaking them in liberal amounts of drool. Tenebris watches her intently. ''You aren't going to swallow them?!'' He asks she looks at him then lowers her head and spits the humans out. They were sat in a pool of saliva. Their clothes ripped, arms and legs broken on some but no fatalities. She giggled and smacked Tenebris with her tail. ''As if! They sure feel great though!'' She headed for the motorway. Politely stepping over the humans. Tenebris walked alongside her. Both looked at the motorway. ''So many metal things to play with!'' Tenebris said as they stopped right by the edge of the motorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbra lifts a paw over the motorway and uses her talons to skewer four cars. With ease her sharp talons pierce through the thin metal roofs. She lifts them up for a sniff and closer look. The occupants had already left the cars. All she could smell was the fuel and exhaust. ''Disgusting she snorts as she flicks her paw. The cars fly off and explode. Destroying many other vehicles and starting fires. Umbra snorted as she stepped onto the motorway. Her massive paws crushing cars and skewering many more with her talons. Her head dropped as she slurped up any humans she found. Tenebris left her to it, for further up ahead he saw something very interesting. A bus, Packed full of humans! He remembered the two he'd dropped of earlier. he was going to play with them but had left them when he found Umbra. He leapt into the air and gave one beat of his wings. The powerful gust blew hundreds of cars everywhere along with humans. Hundreds were killed by being crushed under cars or being smashed into them. Umbra growled ''Hey! I was going to stomp on them!'' He huffed as he reached out with his paw and grabbed the bus. Being careful not to pierce it with his powerful talons. He turned and landed in a field beside the motorway. The humans screamed hysterically within the bus in his paw. He shook it ''Quiet! I'm only going to play with you!'' He growled softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped onto his side and sprawled his legs and wings.  The bus was the perfect size for many uses. He licked his lips as he thought of how he was going to 'play' with the bus. He held it before his belly and massive genitals. the musk hitting the humans noses they grew more hysterical as he lifted it before his head. He grinned at them and licked his lips he had made up his mind on how to 'play' with the bus and its passengers...</span></div></div>",

He then remembered his bum fun was rudely interrupted by the military. He grinned, he would shove it into his anus! His wrinkled ring puckered with anticipation. But first he would have to lube the bus. He brought it before his muzzle. The humans within screamed with terror as his mouth opens revealing his massive fangs, that glistened thanks to the liberal amount of drool coating them. His breath, hot, humid and rank steams the windows. The foul stench made the humans gag and choke. His tongue slid out and with a wet slap he drags it all over the bus, coating it in saliva. But he also wanted to get the humans into his anus. He used a claw to rip the front of the bus. He accidently skewered three people on his talon. ''Woops!'' He giggled and with a quick flick the humans remains were flung a few miles away. The bus now lubed up and pierced open was ready for insertion. He lowered it down to his tailhole and briefly he let the humans study their destination. The wrinkled ring puckered and blew putrid shitty air into the bus. He giggled as he heard them choke on his potent scent. ''About to get stronger cuties! In you go!'' He snarled and with a strong thrust he pushed the bus pierced end first into his anus! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith ease he slides in. He groaned loudly as it tickled him. ''Fuck....'' He whined as he sucked and pushed the bus fully in. Within seconds it was fully inserted. His wrinkled ring sealed behind the bus, trapping the humans and bus within his poo tube. The humans scrambled out of the bus and beat on the shit covered walls. All this did was increase his pleasure. ''Ooh..Umm...Ah..'' Panted Tenebris his eyes closed and tongue lulled. He stood back up and dropped onto his forelegs. To make gravity help get the bus and humans in deeper. All the people on the bus tumbled out as the ground tipped beneath them. Helplessly they tumbled deeper into his rectum until landing against a turd. They struggled futilely until the bus slid forth and slammed into them. Crushing them all against it and the turd. Tenebris howled as he felt the final tumble within his rectum. After a few minutes he felt nothing, but now he had an urge to defecate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grumbled and walked over to some nearby trees as he squatted and squeezed out his logs. Creating a big steaming pile of shit. He wrinkled his nose and studied the mound. He could see the odd limb sticking out. ''Woops! What a shit way to go!'' He giggled and walked back to the motorway and Umbra. She was still walking along. Crushing vehicles under her massive paws whilst slurping up any human within range. Her cheeks were puffed and wriggling. She had clearly caught hundreds of humans. Her tail was wagging wildly as she was clearly enjoying herself. ''Does that feel good?!'' He asked her. She looked at him and nodded. He licked his lips as decided to...</span></div></div>",

There were several mangled vehicles under him thanks to Umbra passing through. With ease and without noticing his body easily crushed them into sheet metal. He partly lay on his side, splaying his legs out. His talons ripping up the tarmac and grass. Umbra was walking away from him, her tail lifted showing off her backside. He licked his lips at the sight. Her head was lowered as her tongue flicked out and slurped up more humans. 'how can she hold so many?!' he thought. Her cheeks bulged even more. From her lips appeared wriggling human limbs. She was dribbling slightly. Within her mouth the mass of humans struggled madly, bashing into each other and choking on the thin, hot and humid air. But now she was started to salivate heavily. Thick sticky saliva soaks them and starts to ooze out of her mouth in long strands. Many unlucky humans are taken with the flow and are left dangling in the air, within her drool. The odd drop splattered to the ground, any human unfortunate enough to fall was killed or left seriously injured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wagged her tail as she strolled on, slurping up more and more. Whilst crushing many vehicles. She couldn't resist much longer. The humans struggles, her full mouth were giving her a strong temptation to swallow. A few humans tumbled down the dark abyss that was her throat. That was all it took feeling their struggles as they fell to her stomach triggered her response. She tipped her head back and with several powerful gulps she swallowed all the humans! She licked her lips and burped loudly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenebris yipped in surprise as she swallowed and belched loudly. She stood still for a moment and groaned. The humans struggled madly in her stomach even as her powerful digestive juices flooded the chamber. The struggles reduced as her juices got to work. She looked back at Tenebris and grinned. ''Oooh that was good! And they tickled my belly!'' Tenebris stood back up and approached her. ''Did they taste good?'' He asked. She nodded. ''Very tasty! But I need so many for a good meal'' Tenebris's belly rumbled. ''I'm feeling a little peckish myself. Maybe we should...'' </span></div></div>",

And the other cows looked like bugs from her height. She moos loudly looking for other cows, but only ends up shattering glass in the tiny home. She looks off in the horizon and sees buildings her height and larger. That seemed correct to her so she walked over making divots in the ground from her hooves. When she gets on the tar road it cracks under her intense weight. One she gets to the city she moo's again in search of her owner. There seemed to be nobody here to her</span></div></div>",

The female Cows were usually too docile and gentle to defend themselves properly, so it was up to the Bull to protect them. For life in the herd was sometimes tough. In the Bulls eyes, if you weren't part of the herd you were an enemy, and enemies get kicked or trampled. So far, the day had been quite peaceful, with no predators causing them trouble. The herd simply kept happily chowing down on the grass in the field. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Bull's muscular body was covered in a thick, dark black hind. He stood slightly taller then the females. Between his hind legs hung impressive looking testicles, packed in a long scrotum. His ball sack reached all the way down to his knees and hung freely. The female cows were of the dairy variety, covered in the classic black and white spots. Each one of the females had large utters, which swayed as they walked. Despite their breed, the herd as been living in the wild without any farmer. Multiple flies were also buzzing around the herds smelly behinds and genitals, which was common for their species. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the great Bulls nostrils flared! A strange mysterious light suddenly engulfed the entire herd! The Cows start letting out stressful sounding \"Moos!\" as the light got brighter and brighter. Soon the panicking herd had their vision completely blocked out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe herds vision finally came back into focus as the light faded. The Bull looked around frantically! He noticed all nine Cows were accounted for and unharmed. Breathing a sigh of relief, the Bull then realized they were in a field very similar to the one from before, but something was very off. Everything around them seemed super flat. No trees, mountains or anything of that sort. Unbeknownst to the Bull and the Cows, they had entered a portal that teleported them to a new world where they were roughly 400ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe herd then sniffs the ground, its smells like grass, but there was nothing to bite down on! It also tore up super easily by just walking around, as their massive hoofs dug into the soft ground, leaving massive gashes. Annoyed, the Bull realized this new field was useless to them.

It was also the only interesting destination in sight, as everything else looked shorter then their hoofs. This mysterious area peaked the Bull's curiosity. He figured they could look for food later, since most of the herd was already full from eating before they were teleported. Wasting no more time, the Bull set off, with the Cows in his herd quick to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mighty Bull led his herd, stomping firmly and proudly. His long scrotum now gently swung from side to side as he walked. The Cows were all excited to see this new, unfamiliar area. To get the best unobscured view, they all opted to walk spread out, not directly behind the Bull. Many of them decided to walk adjacent to each other, creating somewhat of a \"V\" formation, with the Bull in the center of course. This inadvertently meant a lot more untouched area was going to be trampled under their hoofs. The herd was so interested in observing this strange, flat new land, that they were paying no attention to what was underneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir massive bovine hoofs dug deep into the soft ground. Hundreds of acres of forest and field were quickly laid to waste, becoming nothing more then muddy hoof tracks. Soon the herd was beginning to encounter man made objects. Roads, telephone poles, and the odd farm house were soon decimated by the herds onslaught. The herd didn't even realize the human's structures they were crushing were anything different then the natural landscape. Everything they passed through was so thoroughly destroyed, nothing man made looked remotely recognizable.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The herd then encountered a more substantial collection of humans, a small town. The tallest building was only up to the tops of their hoofs. Once again, the town was so insignificantly small to the massive Bull and Cows, that they just assumed it was a different kind of field. Soon everyone in the towns homes, shops and diners felt massive vibrations, as if a freight train was coming their way. The herd's hoofs crush the various buildings like they were tissue paper. Their massive hoof's dug deep, driving the human remains and debris into the dirt. The Bull and Cows didn't even take much notice, other then the crunching feeling. The herd payed no attention to it, figuring they were simply on top of some kind of crunchy moss. People in the town barely had time to react, before they were flattened under an unsuspecting dirty hoof. With a total of 40 hoofs stomping through, the town didn't stand a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for the herd to clear the town. No survivors remained from the herd simply passing through. What they left behind them looked barely recognizable. The once great town was transformed into a bunch of muddy hoof prints. The mucky mess of what was once the town looked no different then the remains of the empty fields they had previously stomped through. It was as if they had erased any signs of the human's existence and returned everything back to its natural state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe herd continued its march towards the city, still laying waste to everything in their path. Soon the herd realized the ground was getting increasingly crunchy. It started to remind the Cows of walking on fallen leaves on a peaceful autumn day. The crunching actually felt nice, and a few of the Cows let out a pleasurable \"Moo\". However, for the humans, the herds stroll was causing anything but peace and pleasure. The Herd was now stomping through more and more densely populated areas as they neared the city. Once again, the herd was oblivious that they were destroying millions of dollars worth of human infrastructure and ending many lives with each step. Those who survived the crushing power of a bovines front hoof, found themselves inexplicably mesmerized by the overhead sight of swaying utters or a pair of testicles, before they were squashed by a hind leg. The Bull and Cows carved a massively wide muddy path of destruction through the rows of shopping centers and homes. Soon the herd was almost through the outskirts and was finally nearing the edge of the city. The Bull sniffs the air, his nostrils taking in the scent of concrete and smog, but does he detect the scent of another animal?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His nostrils, while large, were only powerful enough to pick up animals of regularly sized proportions to him. So far, the Bull was impressed with this location the herd has found themselves in. Sure, they haven't found any grass to eat yet, but they also haven't found any threats to the herd! It was nice to relax a bit, having detected no predators whatsoever. Heck, they had yet to encounter any other animals or intelligent life at all. Of course, the Bull failed to realize the hundreds of crushed human bodies plastered under each one of his hoofs. Even if he had noticed the humans, to him and the herd, they were more like insects then animals. The Bull could definitely get use to living in a peaceful paradise that this world seemed to offer. He thought this as he continued to rip through the cities outskirts, smashing through yet another shopping complex full of people, unknowingly snuffing out their lives. Soon the amount of intact outskirts between the herd and the city was rapidly decreasing, as they neared their destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the herd now laid miles and miles of completely trampled roads and buildings. Besides decimating the human population, the herds romp had another unexpected effect. The now completely flattened outskirts allowed for the wind to naturally pick up speed and flow over the flat ground. This is similar to how wind can easily roll over smooth grassy plains. The fresh breeze felt nice, the Cows thought to themselves, as they felt it flowing through their short fur. This new wind blew from behind the herd and then flowed towards the city. However, it did not take long for the natural stench of their many giant bovine bodies to be picked up by the wind. The smell of their behinds and the hanging male genitals also added to its pungency. A few of the Cows also raised their tails, letting off the odd flatulence. Their nauseating odor soon rolled throughout the city, much to the humans dismay. It found its way through the streets, penetrating into every car and building, and up the nose of every citizen.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe snooty citizens were getting quite annoyed with the sudden assault on their nostrils. Many of them began to angrily plug their noses, all while complaining, whining and demanding that the source of the smell be found and stopped. Unlike the citizens in the town, those in the city had plenty of time to escape with their lives before the herd made their approach. Unfortunately, the city folk squandered their chance to evacuate. They were too focused on whining about the odor like children, that they all failed to even notice the colossal herd just outside the city. The stench kept getting stronger and peoples complaints louder! However, the citizens would soon be wishing the smell was all they had to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last remaining building of the outskirts that laid between the herd and the city was crushed flat. The herd was right at the edge of the cities perimeter. The Bull then stopped, with the rest of the Cows quickly coming to a halt as well. The herd took in the sight of the city. They could see countless tall looking structures, many of which were towering over them. The females thought the shiny buildings looked quite pretty. Once again, the humans were too small for the massive herd to notice. The Bull, on the other hand, was trying to work out a way to lead his herd to explore this strange new area. He could see multiple paths between the tall structures that he and his herd could walk through, although it would be quite a tight squeeze. Otherwise, he could just simply plow a path straight through for the weaker Cows to follow. How does the Bull guide the herd into the city:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was also tempted as it would feel satisfying to rip through the tall mounts with a simple forward charge. However, he also recognized that doing so would spoil the area for the herd. The Cows wanted to explore the city, not have it destroyed right away! He decided that squeezing in-between the tall objects was the best way to enter the city and keep it (mostly) intact. The Bull began to carefully place one hoof in front of the other, walking onto a street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bulls hoofs crashed deep into the asphalt. Spider web like cracks appeared all over the shattered surface and climbed up the front of buildings. Each hoof was roughly the width of the entire street! Anything on the roads surface, which was mainly vehicles and humans, were completely obliterated. Not only was the annoyingly thin pathway hard to walk on, but the buildings to the left and right of the bull seemed to be getting tighter! The sides of the buildings were soon rubbing against the Bulls muscular body. After only a few steps, the pressure of the structures poking the Bull grew more and more firm. Fortunately, this caused no pain to the Bull, at most it was a slight tickle. Predictably, the buildings \"lost\" against the Bulls belly. Entire sides of buildings were crushed inward, only to be torn off as the Bull made his way past. A few buildings even collapsed entirely! Even after the Bull had squeezed buy, many other structures were treated to a destructive blow by the Bovine's tail. It instinctively swung back and forth, smashing into unsuspecting buildings, as if it was a hairy wrecking ball.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe pretentious city folk were in absolute shock when they saw the big smelly animal, which was now defiling their beautiful city. In a mass panic, everyone started pushing, shoving and fighting each other to escape the oncoming Bull. Greedy people were even trying to use the chaos to their advantage, by stealing money and jewelry. This inadvertently made escaping the oncoming Bull much slower then if everyone hadn't acted so selfish. The citizens all poured out of nearby buildings. The streets were soon flooded with a carpet like mass of humanity. Despite the streets being completely coated with terrified humans, the Bull still took no notice. He had his head up high, trying to navigate this maze like environment of buildings. He did slightly feel that the ground had become more crunchy and slippery, as he crushed hundreds of tightly packed humans and smeared their remains. Despite all the death, it still wasn't enough to get the Bull to simply look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cows instinctively wanted to follow the Bull into the city. However, they decided it was best to squeeze through a different path instead of following right behind the Bull. They walked a few blocks over, then mashed their way down a different street. This allowed them to explore a \"fresher\" part of the city, that wasn't disturbed by the Bull's trotting. Soon each Cow was having a wonderful time exploring the interesting structures. All while leaving a massive trail of death and destruction behind them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Bull continued tearing his way through the tight city streets, still unknowingly stomping out the human species below him. He was happy to see his herd enjoying themselves in the city. Multiple Cows were looking at and sniffing the shiny structures. Many of them were a bit too curious and ended up accidentally knocking them down. The Bull of course didn't care if the Cows smashed up the buildings as they took a look, as it seemed like part of the fun! He just wanted to ensure their was enough to go around for each of the nine Cows to experience. Unfortunately, despite the Bulls best efforts, he was accidentally ripping up buildings at an alarming rate, much faster then any of the Cows. Being a Bull, he was naturally more bulky, which explained why the Cows were not having this issue. Most of the structures the Bull had damaged were still standing, but they weren't nearly as pretty looking with their shiny sides smashed off. The Bull was worried at this rate he would accidentally destroy too much, making some of the herd miss out. The Bull knew he had to get out of this tight path, in order to keep as many buildings as he could intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the Bull noticed a small clearing. A sports stadium lay in a deeper part of the city. The opened stadium looked like the perfect place for him to lay down and take a rest without knocking down any more buildings. He began to wade over to the stadium, leaving the rest of the cities core to be ravished by his herd. The Bull cringed as he felt more tall structures getting their sides sheered off from his belly. He also felt chunks getting smashed by his tail, he swore it had a mind of its own! He felt more and more destruction taking place as the path he was on got tighter and tighter. He was of course also still unaware of the thousands and thousands of fleeing humans he was unknowingly pulverizing into paste, driving their bodies deep into the ground with every hoof print. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically looking around, the Bull spotted exactly what he needed, a shortcut. Ahead, he could see a single condo building, which behind it, laid a street with a much shorter, less dense route to the stadium. The condo itself was much lower in height then the surrounding buildings, it was only up to the Bull's belly. This meant the Bull could simply pass over without crushing it, saving another building for his herd. Happy with his findings, the Bull quickly approached the small building, doing his best to ignore the destruction along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally making it to the said structure, the Bull began to position himself to carefully step over it. Giving that the building was on the side of the street, the Bull had to turn his body to face it head on. He felt his behind smash into the high rise on the opposite side of the street. The damage was so great that it caused the building to collapse, spilling debris everywhere, burying humans and damaging nearby buildings. Doing his best to pretend that didn't happen, the Bull began to carefully step over the small condo. Frustrated with his efforts so far, he was hoping to at least pass one building without completely ruining it. He spread out his front legs, gingerly stepping over the building. Happily, he felt both his hoofs pass the building without nicking it. He only felt the asphalt shatter as he successfully placed his front hoofs on the other side of the street, stomping out an unlucky group of fleeing citizens. With his small success, the Bull confidently continued forward, preparing to step over with his hind legs. As he did so, does he feel anything out of the ordinary? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Bulls eyes went wide as he felt a sudden tickle from his private area. Looking under his belly, the Bull realized his massive hanging testicles had smashed into the small condo building. The side of the building was mostly caved in by the impact, killing all the occupants who lived in those units. Humans in other parts of the building were spared from the collision. However, they where soon hit with another strong force, the Bulls musk. It was incredibly potent and strong, especially since they were right next to \"that\" part of his body. The humans inside started coughing and gagging violently! Their eyes began to water up, making it difficult for people to see and navigate, rendering escape nearly impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bull was expecting to feel great anger and frustration for ruining yet another structure, but curiously, he found the situation quite humorous. He found it funny, that even his genitals were destructive in this place. It did not take long for another feeling, to soon start to spread throughout his body, pleasure. Growing slightly excited, the Bull soon convinced himself that since the building was already damaged, their was no longer any need to try to be careful. He also figured he could make use of the building, no need for it to go to waste! The Bull then cheekily rocked his hips slightly from side to side. He was rubbing his balls deeper into the already mangled side of the building. More of the condo units were gutted. The last thing their occupants saw was a thick hairy scrotum filling their vision. People inside panicked louder as the odor got stronger still. The entire building also shook violently, causing things to crash to the ground, destroying many peoples possessions. The Bull simply let out a grunt as more pleasure filled his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had his bit of kinky fun, the Bull decided to finally move onward. With the rubbing stopped, the occupants who were still conscious, had a brief moment of hope that they were going to be spared. Suddenly, the Bull began to walk forward, and his balls followed. The heavy scrotum simply crashed through the building, ripping through as if it was tissue paper. The entire thing collapsed, putting the humans out of their musk filled misery. The Bull shamefully enjoyed that more then he wanted to admit. His long thin penis began to emerge from his loose sheath, but only just slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bull continued walking in the stadiums direction, still feeling his genitals gently throbbing. His mind was quite focused on the experience he just had, which was keeping him quite distracted. Unlike before, the Bull was paying little attention to the destruction he was still causing to the city. He was no longer being careful, which caused a lot more damage. As the Bull continued making his way to the stadium, he distractedly veered off the road he was following. He only noticed after he walked headfirst into a massive office building. The building stood no chance and was easily toppled over, adding millions more in damages to an already insurmountable total. He of course also caused yet more human population decline. The crashing was just enough to snap him out of his lustful daydream. The building was so massive, the Bull had to wait for the dust to clear as his vision was totally blocked. Once the annoying dust was gone, the Bull was able to see what lay passed the once great skyscraper. He could see much more of the city that was previously blocked, stretching out much further then he originally estimated. He realized there were actually more then enough tall rocky structures for his herd to enjoy! The Bull then suddenly felt a stronger throb from his member. This new discovery also meant he could use a chunk of city to quench his desires. Does the Bull get to indulge himself in a bit of stress relief or his he interrupted?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed like no matter where he and his herd went, those tiny pesky insects would follow. They would constantly be buzzing around their smelly behinds and cow pies, annoying them to no end!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Bulls massively, thick, hairy tail was suddenly heading right for the news helicopter! At that size, the thick hairs were stronger then steel wires. They had no problem instantly destroying the rotor blades. The force of the impact sent the ruined helicopter flying! It smashed itself into the side of a nearby office building, causing yet more destruction. Despite all the carnage, from the Bulls perspective, he was simply casually whipping his tail around. This was no different to what any other bovine would do to keep insects away from their behinds. Surprisingly, this technique had also worked perfectly on the incredibly advanced helicopter, as if it was a simple house fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for more news choppers to take their place. They were also all filled with similar attention hogging reporters. A few more simple swishes of the Bull's tail was all it took to send each one of them careening towards the earth. However, the Bull soon noticed something curious. Back in his world, whenever he whacked a fly with his tail, it only took a few seconds for the insect to recover and resume buzzing around his smelly butthole. But with these bugs, he noticed none of them seemed to be returning, even after a rather gentle hit from his tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bull looked back over to his herd. He could clearly see them, especially after they had leveled so many of the buildings, leaving a mostly destroyed landscape of city between them. The herd also seemed to be in a slightly different location then when he first left them. This was no doubt because they had moved on to a more \"intact\" part of the city after they wiped out the last section. The herd were also being bothered by the various flying \"insects\". The Cows were absentmindedly swinging their tails at the other helicopters around them. They were acting mostly out of instinct, since this was their normal behavior for dealing with flies back home. Although, in the tightly packed city, many Cows ended up gutting numerous buildings around them. Their tails inadvertently tore through the structures like tissue paper as they roughly aimed for the helicopters. The Bull could see that when a \"fly\" was hit by their tails, it was also not recovering and buzzing back. It simply went crashing into the ground or other buildings! \"I never thought I would meet anything more pathetic then flies, but the ones in this world have proven me wrong\" he said to himself slightly amused. The Bull is relieved that the insects of this world were so easily shooed away. The herd were of course totally unaware that it was in fact humans they had killed. Even so, they probably wouldn't of cared, they were all just worthless insects to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the news and military helicopters destroyed, the rest of the untouched parts of the city were still unaware of the threat they faced. Everyone was still waiting for the news to instruct them to evacuate. The citizens didn't dare leave otherwise, what if their homes were ransacked! This meant their were still many buildings brimming with humans in the city. Soon, the Bull was about to show those humans they should have been less concerned with their materialistic goods and more concerned with their lives, as he prepares to: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the herd first entered this world, they were very nervous and cautious. They didn't know just what sort of dangers might lie ahead. However, after walking along the country side, exploring the fun city and smashing down many buildings, the herd was now very much enjoying all that this place had to offer! In their fun, the herd finally began to relax, realizing their was nothing that could harm them in this world. As they became less tense, their bodies also became more lose and relaxed. This of course included all parts of their bodies, even their bowels. None of the herd had defecated since entering through the portal. Large amounts of shit were building up and soon their bodies were ready to unleash their slightly pent up loads. The recent tail swishing to shoo away the \"flies\" was the last stimulation they needed for their bowels to get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bull was the first to start to answer the call of nature. Although, he was not ready to release his load just yet. He felt various putrid gasses building up inside of him. Feeling the pressure quickly building up, the preoccupied Bull didn't bother to check what was behind him. He failed to notice a massive high rise building towering over his backside. The side of the building was only meters away from his behind. The Bull instinctively raised his tail, somehow avoiding smacking the building. His massive, dirty tailhole was on full display for the buildings occupants. The humans inside quickly began gawking and shuddering in the disgusting sight of it! People were screaming, yelling at the \"stupid dirty animal\" to leave their sights! However, the Bull wasn't just going to let his little audience only take in the sight of his impressive tailhole. With a slight grunt, his sphincter began to open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpossibly putrid, smelly gas was blasted out at great speed! The force was so strong, it had no problem shattering through the building's windows! It flowed through every crevice of the building, permanently staining everyone's belongings with his stench. The people inside screamed and cursed at the Bull, coughing and gagging at the intense odor of shit. However, he was just getting started! His anus spread open further, blasting away much stronger as the Bull actually began his fart! The putrid gas now tore through the building like a hurricane, blowing humans off their feet! The clusters of floors at the same height as the Bulls derriere were ripped apart from the force. A large chunk of the building's contents and occupants were jettisoned out the other side, raining down onto the opposite street below. Those who weren't shot out of the building soon found themselves growing faint, before passing out for good as they suffocated. The Bull was of course completely unaware of this destruction, he was more focused on just how strong the smell of his pent up fart was. \"Oh well, it's not like the smell is going to bother anyone\", he said to himself, once again failing to notice the plight of the humans.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe loud fart could be heard echoing throughout the entire city, almost serving as a warning to the humans of what was to come. Although, the sound also had another curious effect. One of the Cows in a different part of the city heard the Bull's flatulence. Without realizing it, the Cow simply raised her tail and let out a strong fart of her own, which had a similar detrimental effect to a building behind her bottom. Suddenly another Cow nearby did the same, her blast penetrating two buildings deep! Perhaps bovines farts are contagious like hiccups? The Cows and Bull continued happily farting away, blasting yet more buildings in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for the putrid odor of bovine flatulence to wash over the entire city. Many of the citizens who were too stubborn to evacuate were farted into oblivion. The humans who hadn't been given the pleasure of that experience were now trying to escape. This of course was mostly to do with the eye watering stench that now engulfed the entire city. The streets were now once again packed full of desperate humans. With that, what will the herd do next:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The odor of the herd's farts were throwing the humans into a frenzy. Every square inch of the city was now saturated with their stench. People, all while coughing and gagging, were desperately running into the streets, trying to escape on foot. They were too disoriented to attempt driving, not that it would have mattered since so many of the roads had been destroyed. It did not take long for the streets to once again become packed with people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe herd still failed to notice the tiny crowds of people running beneath them. They were much more focused on the sudden pressure that was once again building up inside of them. They instinctively raised their tails even higher, for what was about to come. Their anuses soon stretched open, allowing massive chunks of shit to easily flow out. It crashed onto the ground with a great \"plat\". The soft patties had no trouble working their way into every nook and cranny. Entire roads were completely engulfed with the nasty stuff, some plops were over 40 feet thick. The soft manure also had no trouble smashing its way through doors and windows, flooding the lower floors of buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese impressive clumps of waste were quite detrimental to the fleeing citizens. Humans were no longer only being trampled, but also buried alive. A single patty could easily engulf 100's of humans at once. The shit was so soft that it didn't kill the humans on contact. They were simply enveloped, left to futilely struggle until slowing down and stopping for good. Many humans lost their lives in this fashion, which was one of the most unpleasant and undignified ways to go.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs the herd was letting out their loads of crap, they continued to walk around the city, causing yet more destruction. They were still carelessly pushing out more steaming clumps, as they would have done normally in a field back in their world. As they continued their stroll, they were still leaving deep hoof prints on the roads and a few structures. This destruction would often expose the soil underneath, that had been covered by the humans. Many of these gashes in the road were then filled in with fresh manure. The herd also unknowingly trampled on top of their own mess, driving it into the ground. It also stuck to the bottom of their hoofs, causing them to indirectly track the dung all over the city, further adding to the spread of the odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the MUCH stronger stench flowed throughout the city, completely dwarfing the farts from earlier. Many of the humans trying to escape went from coughing to simply fainting out cold. Most of these people wouldn't be waking back up, as their unconscious bodies were simply crushed or buried by the herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels much better\" the Bull thought to himself, as he pushed out yet another healthy sized bowel movement. His massive testicles swayed side to side as he walked through and soiled yet another untouched part of the city. Soon the entire herd pushed out the last of their loads. With all their bowels emptied, the entire herd now felt a lot better. Unfortunately, the opposite was true for the city and humans. The entire metropolis was now looking like bits of shrunken city in a muddy field of cow pies. With what little remained of the humans and their structures, what does the herd do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The city was getting quite boring for the herd. When they first found the metropolis, it was a giant shiny maze filled with pretty looking objects. They had never seen anything so pristine! However, thanks to the herds somewhat careless actions, everything was almost completely wiped out. The city was so destroyed, it looked like a normal messy, smelly field from back home, which wasn't really out of the ordinary for the herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a dozen or so buildings remained and they were surrounded by muddy destruction. Inside them were the last of the citizens. The once proud humans had been reduced to simply shivering in fear or fainting from the smell that surrounded them. The Cows had already seen so many buildings, they were quite bored of them. One of the clever Cows thought of a new game to extract the last bit of fun the city had to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cow walked up to one of the surviving buildings and faced her backside to it. Her crap covered behind was in full view of the survivors, something the buried humans were all too familiar with. Then without warning, the Cow kicked its strong hind legs. The powerful force made the building explode into a shower of debris! The buildings contents went flying, raining down and landing in the soft piles of cow shit. The herd found it funny, seeing the structures explode like that. All the Cows joined in, even the Bull, who easily sent his debris flying the highest and furthest. However their fun game was short lived, as the last of the buildings was kicked into oblivion, bring the human population down to zero.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith the last of the city either wiped out or buried in shit, the Bull decided there was no point to stick around. His feral mind saw the city as if it was a type of grassy field his herd had consumed, and that it was time to move on to the next one, possibly returning once it had \"grown back\". The Bull began walking away from the smelly ruins of the city, leading his herd to a different location.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately for the humans, their was no chance the city would be recovering. Unbeknownst to the herd, their potent excrement was having quite the effect on the environment. The dung that was stomped into the ground was quickly nourishing the once poisoned and polluted soil. Not only were the Cow droppings acting like fertilizer, but they also contained a special gift. Just like regular animals, many plant life seeds were contained inside of their droppings. These seeds were from the herd's world, so they were also giant in size. It didn't take long for these massive plants to begin sprouting. Their roots easily working their way into the dirt exposed by the massive hoof prints. As the plant roots continued to worm their way around, they found yet another source of nourishment, the millions of crushed human remains!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe citizens squashed bodies were a perfect source of nutrients the plants needed to boost their growth. With so many of the humans having been mashed into paste or mixed in with the piles of manure, the plants had an abundance to absorb. The humans were reduced to nothing more then simple compost. With this new fuel and the natural size difference, the invading species of plants grew at an almost magical pace! Their roots were growing at about a foot per second. They continued to spread all throughout the city, seeking out the precious dung and dead human bodies. Any small remaining structures or vehicles were easily ripped and ground apart. Even the giant plant life was destructive! Soon, no sign of the city's existence remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around, giant wild grass grew as high as regularly sized trees. Dandelion type plants flowered as if they were massive canopies. However, the real star of the show was right in the center of the city. There, a great tree sprouted, which soon towered higher then even the biggest of skyscrapers (if there were any left that is). Soon, the entire land was reclaimed from the humans and set back to nature. This was much to the joy of the regularly sized animals of that world, who quickly moved in to the massive forest. Despite the plants being of giant size, the animals adapted and thrived. This land was also safe for years to come, as animals didn't mind, but the lingering scent of the herd's shit kept humans away. The herd didn't know it, but they had changed that region forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what was the herd up to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps they might find it later and eat a bit of regularly sized grass? Looking ahead, the Bull could only see an endless expanse of flat land. The ground had a few interesting patterns, but other then that, nothing interesting was insight. He looked back to this herd and noticed the Cows were looking tired. All the excitement of the city had tuckered them out. The Bull figured the open area just ahead would make a nice place to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that area was not as empty as the herd thought. Ahead of them lay miles and miles of homes, as a massive suburb spread all over the area. The homes were too small for the herd to even notice their existence, the area looked essentially flat to them. Each one of the homes was filled with the homeowners. They had heard reports of an attack and were told to stay indoors. Unfortunately, that was going to provide little protection for the threat they were about to face. The humans inside felt a sudden rumbling approaching, but that only made them hide more intensely in their homes and basements, not daring to look outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the herd trampled on to the populated area, they once again felt the satisfying \"crunch\" of man made structures getting squashed under hoof. A single hoof print completely decimated multiple homes with each step, compacting every floor into a deep crater. The feeling was so satisfying, the Cows took their time finding a place to rest, crushing much more homes then was necessary. After making it quite deep into the suburb, each of the Cows began to lay down, one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few brave souls looked outside when they noticed the pungent odor. The last thing they saw was a massive belly and great utters, descending towards them. Each cow that laid down crushed hundreds of homes. Luckily for the humans, the Cows belly was actually quite soft, so the many humans who had taken shelter inside their home's basement were spared. Sure, many were still crushed by falling debris, but a large percentage actually survived a Cow laying on their house. Of course those who were unfortunate enough to be under a rear end were treated to the appropriate odors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something was slightly bothering the Cows. They felt something \"prickling\" their soft underbellies. It turns out the debris of the crushed homes did not bother the Cows harden hooves, but it was annoying when laying on it. The Cows began absentmindedly rubbing themselves back and forth to grind whatever was making them uncomfortable. This proceeded to completely wipe out the surviving humans and their homes into a completely unrecognizable paste, making their victory short lived. The Cows also inadvertently crushed a few more homes around them from the gentle motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Bull saw each of his herd was comfortable, he too decided to lay down and rest. He oped to lay in a richer neighborhood, as the larger posh mansions wouldn't bother his thicker hide. Carving a trail of destruction through the wealthy area, he too laid down on a bunch of the inhabitants homes, flattening them. His massive testicles alone took out an entire mansion, destroying all kinds of expensive treasures. As one last unknown insult to the humans, the Bull lazily raised his tail and let out a massive fart. It ripped apart a few of the untouched mansions behind him. It also stunk up the entire area, much to the hiding humans dismay. Soon he, and the rest of the herd, fell into a deep sleep.  </span></div></div>",

It was buried in amongst the carriages. He howled and exploded. The carriages and people were engulfed in his thick hot cum. The liquid sent the wreckage and people flying forwards with the powerful flow. The Wolf had not cum for a good while due to his age, but he still had it in him well now in him anymore as his cum was now splattered all over the ground before him. Having ejaculated all over the train and people the Wolf sat panting heavily. He studied the scene below him. Most people had drowned in his thick cum. But some survived. He stood up and looked at his dick. the huge thing swung between his legs. It was almost like a fifth leg due to its size and length. He licked the cum left on the tip of his dick then the Wolf decided to deal with the humans below him by...</span></div></div>",

He releases the mostly wrecked sign. With a loud crash it land upon several vehicles, crushing them. The car alarms annoy him. He snarls and stamps on the cars.

Ignoring their screams and pleas he laps them up and swallows. He growls with dissatisfaction. They weren't that filling. But there were several more nearby. He stalks after the other occupants and within five minutes all are digesting in his belly. He burps, they were nice but his belly was hardly full. He likes the humans taste and wants more... Many more! He sniffs the air, hoping to find more. And his sensitive nose does pick up the scent of more humans. Eagerly he heads for the humans. His tongue lulled, tail lifted and wagging.

A feline with two long sabre like canines jutting out of his mouth. He was none other than a Smilodon Populator, or the sabre toothed tiger as many would call his kind. More robustly built than a modern Lion or Tiger. His shoulders huge and bulging with muscle. He had a spotted coat, to blend in with his usual habitat. Whilst back 'home' he was already a particularly large specimen of his kind. Now he stood close to 400ft tall and about 650ft long. His large paws, 60ft tall, 100 ft long and 80ft wide. Smash down into the forest. Trees being crushed under his thick pads. His claws tearing through trunks like a hot knife through butter. He looks about and snarls. This place doesn't smell, feel or look right. Why was everything so small? He strolled on carving a trail of destruction through the once pristine forest. Birds squawked and flew away in their droves. Other wildlife letting off cries of alarm as they fled from his approaching form.  His footsteps sounded like thunder as his mighty felid form carves its ever destructive way through the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe constantly sniffs at the air and looks about as he ploughs on. He could smell the wildlife and hear their cries of alarm. He snorted, so they should run from him. He was the predator, they the prey. But, right now he was more interested in working out where the hell he was. He walked for twenty minutes, nothing but constant forest filled his vision. But he smelt something... Different. Stopping he sniffed at the air powerfully. A scent, he'd never smelt it before, but it had his interest. He licked his lips and turned towards the scent, his curiosity piqued. The scent grew stronger and ever more interesting. Soon he could see little brightly coloured creatures within the forest. Just what where they?! He had to find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the hikers the walk through the forest had been uneventful and to be honest boring. But the 'thunder' had them confused. There was no clouds in the clear blue sky. The sound of crashing trees, squawking birds and when the ground started to shake they really panicked. When they saw the gigantic Smilodon coming right at him they screamed and ran...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creatures ran, but they was small and slow. The Smilodon growled and started to run. Ripping up the forest on a far more destructive scale. He caught the creatures in just a few steps. His heavy footsteps had knocked them over. He lowers his head and sniffs the creatures. His suction pulls them towards his nostrils. He exhales, blowing them away. They screamed and tried to run. He tips his head on its side and opens his mighty jaws wide. His tongue, a gigantic sandpaper like slug. Emerges from his mouth and curls around the creatures. He pulls them into his maw and seals his jaws. Levelling his head he swishes and licks them against his ridges. Tearing flesh from bone and coating his tongue with blood. He reduces the creatures to saliva soaked piles of mush. He swallows and burps... Tasty! He licks his lips and sniffs for more of these creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picks up more of these creatures, humans a few miles away (or dozen on the worlds scale). He makes his way for the humans. He finally comes across...  </span></div></div>",

He could smell the creatures and another strange smoky stench, diesel fumes. He saw the lights of the train in the distance. He stopped near the tracks and laid down. he was an ambush predator, he would wait for his prey to get close, then he would strike. His large from was still easy to see, it appeared like a giant furry mound to the approaching train...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver hadn't seen the Smilodon when he was approached. But now he could see a strange furry mound about a mile ahead and near the track. ''What is that?!'' He muttered. When he was half a mile away he could see it was an gigantic creature, a big cat! He panicked and slammed on the emergency brakes. With a loud screech the brakes apply, sending up sparks and throwing most of the passengers forwards. The train slows, the passengers look to see why the train has so violently braked. they couldn't believe what they could see lurking in the forest. Panic ensures as the train comes to a stop and the beast stands up, revealing itself as a gigantic Sabre toothed Tiger! The beast opened it's jaws and Roared. The horrific sound cracked the windows and blew out everybody's ear drums, leaving them wincing in agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis prey stops right before him! How easy and convenient! He stands up and lets off a mighty roar. He can smell the fear. It excites him. He stomps towards his prey eagerly. He lifts his left forepaw and slams it on the locomotive. Crushing it flat under his mighty pad. It exploded, but all it did was tickle his paw, much to his delight! He'd killed the head of the 'snake' within was the tasty little creatures. They started to pour out of the sides. Screaming in terror at him. He turned so that the train ran between his legs. He roared again down at the creatures, blowing them all over. He was in charge here and they were his food. But the thought of his dominance made him feel even hornier. His balls ached, his short fat barbed cock slipped from it's sheath. He had hunger in his belly and his genitals. What hunger to satisfy first?!</span></div></div>",

People in the carriage heard the roof and sides groan as a fleshy curtain smothered the windows. Outside those next to the carriage screamed as the giant orbs came down on them. With a wet squish his testicles crush dozens. His cock comes down on the carriage, crushing it under it's bulk. He groaned loudly and lulled his tongue. Feeling the people and carriage being crushed under his lovely big nuts and thick dick was so intoxicating!  He scoots forwards. Crushing more under his bulk. People flee before him and within the carriages. Those within fighting with other to get out or further up the train before the genitals reach them. Dozens were being squished every second. The giant predator didn't care. Killing was his life, these creature were nothing but toys... And food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving crushed a quarter of the train he lifts up. His dick and balls swaying about, coated in blood. The humans sighed in relief, thinking they wouldn't be crushed under the giants huge genitals but crushing wasn't the only thing he could use his dick for. A thick substance oozed from the tip. Peoples faces sunk when they saw the Cat's giant prick aiming itself at them. He grunted and his dick exploded forth a long, thick, hot and suffocating stream of cum! It splattered all over a carriage and surrounding people. It completely envelops them and floods the carriage. Those caught in the stream find themselves being suffocating in the thick love sauce. But the big cat wasn't going to let off one stream. Oh no big cats will fuck dozens of times in quick succession. His 'gun' was cocked and loaded. He walked forwards. Firing off load after load after load. The train was completely engulfed in the thick sauce, as were the passengers. It oozed outwards rapidly, catching the few that had managed to get away. The Smilodon snorted with triumph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched the creatures as they struggled futilely to escape his lovely cum. The struggles stopped as they suffocated one by one. He licks his lips. He now has creamy treats to slurp up! He lowers his head and eagerly laps up his treat of his own making. So creamy and delicious! He slurps up everybody and every drop of cum. Nothing was wasted. He finally sniffed the train. No food remained. Now it could be disposed of. Razor sharp claws slip out of his toes and the shredding begins. He reduces the train to ribbons and finally he squats and sprays a mist of piss. To mark it as his. His belly rumbles. Still not fully satisfied. He wants more! He follows the tracks, maybe they would lead him to more of these creatures! He started to run, wanting to find more to play with and eat! His genitals still ache, he's still not fully spent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic hungry and horny beast soon comes across...</span></div></div>",

More for him to play with and devour! He couldn't wait! His great rough tongue lulled with excitement. His paws ripped up the track and left deep prints. He didn't care, after all the train was ahead of him. It was heading away from him, but his great size meant he was catching up rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the train couldn't hear his footsteps due to the noise of the rails, radio's and conversations. Though they could feel the pounding of his paws. Which grew more violent as he came ever closer. Some looked out of the windows in confusion. But nobody looked back. He was just a few steps away when finally the passengers in the last carriage spotted his massive paws and thick muscular legs. They screamed and filed forwards up the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was over the rear of the train now. He was thinking of a way to stop it. Last time it stopped for him but this one had learnt its lesson it seems. He decided to go for the head, kill the head and the rest of the body will stop. His paws steps caused the trains wheels to lift off the track, but by some miracle it didn't derail. He was halfway up the train, not long to go before he could stop it. His dick slipping further out of his sheath as he knew he was about to catch his prey for some food and fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snarls and leaps onto the locomotive, paws fully outstretched with his razor sharp claws out of their sheaths. With a crunch his claws slice into the locomotive, destroying the motor and starting a fire. The flames lick his face. He yelps in alarm and trips. His legs splay out and with a crash his body slams down hard on the train. Crushing most of it under his bulk. The remaining carriages derail and pile up behind him. They smack into his balls and cock, which made him grunt with delight. The last carriage rode up on the piled up ones and actually enters his tail hole, which made him snarl with delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mishap whilst destroying most of his food and given him some unexpected pleasure. His powerful wrinkled ring squeezes and suck, pulling the carriage deeper. His cock, buried in the piled up coaches leaks pre. People in the wreckage struggle to escape, many inadvertently stroked his orbs or even touched his cock, which they found themselves stuck to thanks to it's stickiness. He couldn't believe this! It was so pleasurable he couldn't hold back. He snarled and blew his load. The piled up carriages are violently pushed aside by his powerful stream of cum. Many people are crushed by the carriages or like before smothered in his cum. He blew a few more loads then lifted up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks back at the mess his cum had made. Licking his lips he turns and eagerly lowers his head to feast. His tongue mercilessly slides around carriages to scoop up people. He groaned contently as he filled his belly some more. It was a shame he had killed so many by accident. But there would be more for him to eat, he was sure of it! Having devoured everybody. He focuses on the carriage in his butt. He grunted and squeezed, crushing it within. Finally he squats down and pushes the carriage out. It had caused him great pleasure but he now wants to focus on eating. He once again follows the track and it lead him right into:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The forest ended and started to turn into small hives, houses. He stopped before the first ones and roared. Announcing his presence to all the cities inhabitants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inhabitants of the city had no idea of who was approaching their city, the capital with a population of eight million. The suburbs closest to the beast. Were the first to find out. At first they thought a storm was coming, thanks to his thunderous footsteps. But when they went outside to investigate (the forecast didn't mention thunder storms?!) They saw him rapidly approaching. In shock at first they soon started to flee. Getting in their cars and speeding away. Gridlock ensured, cars crashed, people fought with each other and soon the shadow of the beast washed over them. They all looked up at him, looming over them. His legs thick and bulging with muscle. Two long shining sabres jutting out of his mouth. The beast eyes glaring down at them before its jaws part and ROAR! The beast roars, shattering windows and blowing out ear drums. The people cringe in agony. When they look up the beast is moving. A colossal paw lifts over the first house and hovers briefly. Toes wriggling then the beast snarled and slammed the paw down. The house was completely flattened, the shockwave blows people over and destroys several houses. The beast takes another step, causing more destruction. But then it lowered its head, jaws parting wide revealing his massive humid and saliva coated maw. The tongue slides out over the lethal incisors and thrusts itself into the closest crowd. Greedily it returns to the mouth, he doesn't even chew he swallows them whole and alive. To die in his digestive juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strolls on, smushing house after house with out care. His head lowered as he slurps up his food. Their screams of terror amuse him as he feats.

He doesn't care about the destruction he's causing, all he wants is to eat and have sex. though for now sex would have to be replaced with humping things to provide release. He reaches the first tall building, an office block. It was the perfect height, the roof just reaching his belly. But it was wider than his body, so he couldn't mount it like he would a female. He snorted and sniffed the building. He came up with an idea! He lifts a paw onto the roof, it groaned under his weight. Satisfied it would support his whole weight he leaps up to stand upon the roof. With a crash his paws slam down upon the roof, which partially collapses. The top three floors pancake onto each other, crushing dozens of people within. The Smilodon didn't care, he had a more pressing concern and it was aching under his tail. He laid down upon the roof. The building groaned in protest, another floor was lost as his weight pushed down.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the streets people pointed up at the titanic ancient big cat who having strolled through the city devouring people was now lying atop a office block. The building was struggling to hold the weight. Cracks formed from the top floors and slowly expanded downwards. Rubble  and dust rained down on the street around the building, knocking out many. The big question was what was the Smilodon doing?! They soon got there answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Smilodon had a hard on yet again. His thick barbed cock pointed downwards as he lifted his hind and with a grunt he slams his dick down <i>into</i> the building. With ease it penetrates the structure. His balls slap down loudly, kicking up clouds of dust. He snarls and thrusts over and over. The building groans louder as it was humped by the horny beast. Within office staff tried to flee. But the whole structure was shaking violently with every one of his thrusts. They fell on each other, or were knocked out by falling lights and fixtures. His dick oozed pre into the building, it began to flow down the corridors, lift shafts and stairways. Several were swept up in the flow. But his pre was the least of their worries. He gives one extra strong thrust. Penetrating deep and with a snarl he orgasms violently. The tsunami of cum violently blasts its way through the building. It smashes through doors, envelops people and office furniture. It smashes out of windows, carrying many to there deaths. It even forces its way through the ever expanding cracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building could take no more, with a roar it crumbles. The Smilodon growls in surprise as he falls down with the collapsing structure. With a thump he lands on the ground, laying atop a mound of cum soaked rubble. A large cloud of dust envelops him and the area. He sneezes violently several times. Quickly he gets up and runs away from the destroyed building. He sneezed one last time, coating a few people in his snot. He realises this and 'politely' cleans them with one lick and gulp. He looked back at the cloud of dust. He snarled. So weak and pathetic! He still needed release. He looks around for another stronger target to fuck..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles when he sees something that looks more suitable... </span></div></div>",

Hopefully strong enough to withstand his cock and balls. He made his way to the skyscraper. Head lowered and lapping up those in his path. His paws crushing dozens of cars with every step. His thick muscular legs bulldoze through smaller buildings. He doesn't care, these buildings aren't big enough for him to fuck. He soon reaches the skyscraper. He stops and snarls. Looking at him was another Smilodon! It snarled back at him! He couldn't believe that he hadn't already smelt this other Smilodon. He sniffs the air... He still smells no other Smilodon?! He walked forwards, closer to the building. The other Smilodon did the same. He bared his fangs, as did the other Smilodon. But then the beast finally recognises himself. It was a mere reflection in the skyscrapers glass sides. He snorts and gets ready to mount the skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople within the skyscraper desperately fled as the giant sabre tooth terrorising the city came this way. The beast snarled and bared it's mighty fangs at them several times as it approached. Further increasing the panic. The beast was just seconds way when he reared up onto his hind legs. His thick and powerful forelegs wrap around the skyscraper with a heavy thud. Many people were knocked over along with furniture. Lights flickered and several lifts jammed in the shafts. His forepaws grip the skyscraper tightly. His ferocious claws smash through the glass with ease. Many fell out of the holes made by his claws. A few were even skewered on the claws, coating them in blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLower down his genitals press against the building as he grips it tightly. He lifts back and thrusts. His balls smash windows, more people fall out to their deaths. His cock, fully erect penetrates deeper. Oozing pre once again down corridors. But after just three more thrusts he cums. With a snarl he blows his load. The tsunami of cum sweeping up all in its path. Unlike the small office building the skyscraper was more robustly built. The cum was contained by the windows and instead it had to travel to the ground via other routes. Stairwells, lifts shafts, ventilation shafts corridors... The cum fills them all, suffocating those who were in any level at or below his genitals. The cum finally reaches the ground floor and erupts out of the doors and onto the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Smilodon blows two more loads. Before he backs up. With a crash his paws land back on the ground. Crushing more cars and even a few people. He panted heavily. That had ben good and it held out this time! His sexual desires were fulfilled for now. His belly rumbled, this fucking and destroying was hungry work. He had a nice creamy treat below to devour. Eagerly he licks his cum and the humans who had been caught in the flow. He burped loudly as he finished his cum soaked treat. He was fairly satisfied for now. But he still wanted to eat more. He started to walk along with his head lowered yet again. His tongue constantly flicking back and forth as he devoured thousands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his feasting was about to be interrupted, by...              </span></div></div>",

He knew that there where more tasty food in the buildings but couldn't get them out without crushing them and covering everyone up. He thought about how the small building slowly collapsed and people ran out of it. <br>\r\nWith that in mind he ran off to find another fuckable building. Closing in on a gray colored brick building his fat dick started stiffening and leak pre all over the road catching the people for later that he didnt slurp up. He got to the building and jumped up and put his two front paws on the roof. Satisfied it would hold his weight and his dick he hustled up. A loud groan and a couple of crashes let everyone know that he was on the buildings again. Luckily people in the buildings saw him approaching and started running out.<br>\r\nHe smiled knowing his plan worked and started fucking the building. It groaned under his weight but held throwing chunks of bricks and other debris at people below killing them for easy food. After jumping for over 10 minutes straight and the 4 time unloading his love juice was spraying out of windows, and the cracks in the buildingss. He wanted to level the city though so he trusted extra hard making his barbed prick shoot through the building in 6 different spots. He was ready for ditch to collapse so he stood up and jumped off of it using his weight to cave it in. <br>\r\nThe city heard more loud groans and crashing and then a waterfall of rubble with a dust cloud. He stood waiting for the cloud to disappear and found his high amount of food either dead on the road or not far away.</span></div></div>",

His paws and thick shoulders smashes through buildings either side of the street. Killing just as many as he was devouring. His belly was getting fuller and fuller. But he wouldn't stop until he was literally bursting... Or something 'tastier' caught his attention. He had strolled right on down one long street, leaving a trail of destruction. At the end was a building nearly as tall as him. He lifted his head and snarled as he held his course. He stopped short however when he caught scent of something. Powerful nostrils flaring and sucking in the air... He grunts and licks his lips. He smells a female! He could tell she was almost right ahead. His attention is now focused on reaching her, rather than devouring all the creatures below. He walks on right into the building. With a horrific crash his legs crash into the building as he walks on through it. Hundreds being crushed within as the big cat's body barges on through. Many are crushed on the streets by falling debris. He still simply does not care or notice their plight for that matter. absently he shakes as he walks down the next street. Debris trapped in his fur flies off at high speed, damaging more structures and killing many unlucky people who were within range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scent grows stronger. He can tell she was in heat! Her potent pheromones fill the air. His balls and cock tingle once more. He was getting horny once again. He really wanted to reach her at any cost! He started to run. The destruction he caused was in the billions and thousands of lives lost. He tore apart buildings like tissue paper. Deep prints were covering many streets. Water pipes gushed out great fountains of water, Downed power lines sparked and crackled. Fires erupted in thousands of places. He wasn't the least bit concerned about his trail of death and destruction. His eyes were on the gorgeous female up ahead. He could see her now. She was in the suburbs, she was staring intently at the approaching male. She had a lighter build than the male and her coat was not as heavily spotted. Her fur was a pale yellow. Her eyes an unusual blue colour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon reached her. He stopped short and they stared at each other more closely. Sniffing and grunting. He starts to walk around to her backside. She turns and squats her fore legs, lifting her hind high into the air. She raises her tail to fully expose her backside. Her pussy swollen and moist. He released his tongue and eagerly licked her vagina. She grunted as his sloppy tongue coasted her pussy with his saliva. He forced his tongue in deep, for a real good taste. She grunted and squeezed on his tongue. She panted heavily, a house before her blasted apart by her humid and hot breath. He lifts his head away and mounts her. He snarls and bites onto the back of her neck as he thrusts into her. She roars as he orgasms, filling her pussy with his fertile seed. He pulls out, waits for a second and then plunges into her. Like all big cats he would mate multiple times in rapid succession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty orgasms and mating's the pair are done  He gets off her and they lay side by side. Lovingly they licks each others faces and nuzzle. Tired from his rampaging, fucking and full belly the male decides to have a nap. The female despite being a new arrival and not so full decides to sleep as well. The two giant felines snooze in the suburbs. Inhabitants fleeing whilst they had the chance. But the two cats peaceful slumber was to be rudely interrupted by... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They soon settle back to their 'old' and 'small' routine. Meanwhile the planet they had briefly visited had faced attacks all over before the giants vanished as abruptly as they arrived.

The driver and passengers gawped up at her. Getting a lewd view of her vagina and breasts. her head peering down at them with a look of confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What are you things?'' She gasped as she saw the humans in the bus. She'd never seen such odd creatures like this before! She couldn't help notice that they were staring at her exposed vagina. She giggled ''Oh, aren't I one big sexy Vixen?!'' She lifted her arms and gave her body a shake. The humans screams made her grin, she thought they were screaming with delight. And so they should, she was sexy and so big! She felt an urge from her vagina. ''Ooh... Let's have some fun!'' She dropped onto her knees and lowered herself onto the bus. With a squelch her wet lips come into contact with the roof. The vibrating engine sends waves of pleasure throughout her body. ''Fuck! That feels so good!'' She moaned and lulled her tongue. 'It sort of feels like a vibrator!' she thought as he pushed down on the bus. It groaned under her weight. The roof partially caved in and allowed her juices to pool. Within the bus the stench of her sex was over whelming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passengers started to pour off of the bus, running into the forest and away from the giant Fox pressing itself down on the bus. Scarlet was so lost in ecstasy she didn't spot this little exodus. She clenched her fists and gritted her teeth. ''Ooh so good!'' She hadn't had an sexual experience like this before! She couldn't hold back. She began to thrust up and down violently. The buses tyres popped loudly and the windows shattered as it caved in under her assault. She gave one final push and flattened it. She sat panting. The vibrations had stopped of course and she calmed down. She came back to her senses. Under her vagina was a crumped sheet of metal covered in her thick juices. ''Oops! She giggled and stood up. ''I think I got a bit to carried away little ones'' She yipped ''Oh dear! Have our squished them?!'' She sniffed at the wreckage. ''Hmm I think they all left. She sniffed the air and could smell the humans running in the forest. ''Hmm should I fetch them or follow this road? This place is so strange, but I like it already!'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet decides to</span></div></div>",

The truck's driver like the bus driver spotted her at the last minute and braked hard. The truck's brakes screeched loudly and the tyres locked up, smoking heavily. Scarlet cringed, the screech hurt her sensitive ears! The truck ended up jack knifing, she laughed and reached for the cab. The driver screamed as he jumped out and ran. ''Oh no you don't!'' She said as she pinched him between two fingers and lifted him before her face. She sniffed at him and studied him closely. ''How funny, no fur, but you wear clothes and have two arms and legs.'' The trucker struggled wildly and begged ''let me go!'' To her his words were nothing but gibberish and to him her words were vice versa. However she could smell that this was a male. Just used a claw to delicately tear off his trousers and underwear. She giggled at the sight of his genitals. ''So small... But not that I'm fussy!'' She used her free hand to finger her own vagina, she moaned contently and held out the human to let him see her fingering herself. ''How about you join in my fun?!'' She cooed. The poor trucker had no idea what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used her free hand to grab the trailer and rip it free of the tractor unit. Thanks to its flat ends she could stand it up. To her she was looking at a novel dildo now. Her free hand's fingers were still sticky from her lewd act. She grabbed the trucker with her sticky fingers, coating him in her sticky vaginal fluid and wipe him on the top of the trailer, which would usually be the end. The trucker was stuck on his back. He struggled to no avail. Over him Scarlet rose up to her full height. He was staring right into her glistening vagina, above was her breasts and head grinning down at him. ''Now the fun really begins!'' She laughed and dropped to her knees. The impact shook the trailer, but she used a hand to steady it as she lowered herself onto it. The trucker screamed and held up his arms as her large vagina came closer and closer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wet squelch her moist lips slide over the trailer and cover the trucker in darkness. The stench of her sex strong and over whelming. The trucker screamed and coughed. Scarlet moaned and held back her head. She could hear his muffled screams. But she didn't care about his plight. 'I've never had an interaction like this!' She thought as she pressed down. The trailer was longer than her vagina, so soon her cervix pushed down on the trucker. She growled and thrusted down. She lulled her tongue as each thrust sent waves of pleasure shooting through her body. The poor trucker was crushed into a fine paste by her thrusting. But she didn't care, she kept going until with a loud pop the trailer ruptured! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo just what was the tanker carrying?  </span></div></div>",

The truck bed contained the bodies of two bears they'd (illegally) shot covered in tarpaulin. Their rifles were in the cab with them. ''These will make us a small fortune!'' laughed the passenger rubbing his hands with glee. The driver nodded ''Just as long as no feds catch us! $1000 per Bear!'' Both were a little drunk, the half empty tins of beer in the cup holders and half dozen crushed cans on the floor confirming this. Little did they know they may have just shot two 'big' predators but were about to encounter a far bigger threat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet saw the pickup approaching. ''Ah! I thought it smelt and sounded smaller! Oh well, still I can have some fun!'' She giggled as she stopped and stood with the road running between her legs. She folded her arms and grinned. The pickup turned the corner and the two hunters set eyes upon her. ''Hi cuties! Wanna play?'' She giggled and waved. The hunters gasped and slammed on the brakes. The pickup stopped well short of her. The hunters gawp up. ''Oh fuck I've drunk to much!'' Whined the driver. ''I see it to! What the fuck is that thing?!'' Replied the passenger. ''I don't know, Let's get the fuck out of here!'' The driver slammed the pickup in reverse and went to turn around. ''Leaving so soon?!'' Laughed Scarlet as she crouched down and reached out. She grabbed the pickup by the gate and lifted its rear up. The wheels spun wildly, being rear wheel drive she had immobilised it. She could smell the Bears carcasses. Using her other hand she pulled off the tarpaulin. ''Ah, so even the animal are tiny!'' She muttered. ''It's got us!'' cried the passenger. ''Shoot it!'' yelled the driver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his rifle he aimed out of the window at her. ''That looks like a gun...'' Said Scarlet as the man shot her. The crack hurt her ears. The bullet however was stopped by her fur, though it still stung her. More like a bee sting than being shot. ''Fuck!'' She snarled and tossed the pickup aside. It violently rolled over. The two hunters were not wearing seatbelts. They were ejected from the rolling vehicles along with their guns, beer can, the Bear carcasses and so on. They scrambled to their feet and both grabbed their rifles. Scarlet growled ''Oh no you don't!'' She slammed a paw down, shaking the ground and knocking them both down. She lowered her hand and used her fingers to crush their guns. She grinded the guns under her fingers then lifted them up and looked at the hunters. ''So you're going to complete arseholes?! So shall I! She growled angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and positioned her backside over them. Lifting her tail she showed off her two fluffy butt cheeks. The hunters screamed and tried to run. But she was to quick and large. She slammed her butt down on them. The pickup and Bears being crushed but the hunters had a worse fate. Both were firmly wedged in her crack. Her cheeks firmly pinning them tightly. They struggled, which only tickled her. ''Ah... That's better!'' She groaned as their tickles pleasured her. She stood up and used one of her hands to push into her crack. ''How about going a little deeper?'' She cooed as she pushed the hunters up towards her wrinkled ring. She pushed them right into her anus. the fleshy ring parted as she inserted them both right up into her rectum. They still struggled the whole time. Much to her delight. The hunters soon stopped and passed out, thanks to the thin air and strong smell of shit. Already dried crap was smeared on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet's tail was wagging furiously and her tongue was lulled as she drooled with delight. ''Aww.... I'd been enjoying that!'' Realising her 'toys' were no longer pleasuring her she grinned as she thought of how to end this. ''Well, they wanted to shoot me, so I'll shoot them.... Out!'' She dropped onto all fours and held her butt up in the air she groaned and squeezed....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPHWARP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let off an ear splitting fart. Now normally all this would cause was a shitty smell but to the humans it was more like the blast of a cannon. Their bodies were blasted out at dizzying speeds and landed miles away in the forest. Scarlet stood up and huffed ''That dealt with those arseholes!'' She laughed as she strolled on once again. 'So much fun so far. I wonder what I'll find next?!' She thought as she walked. Soon her nose caught scent of more humans and civilisation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ahead of her was a small hill that obscured her view. Her tail wagged with excitement. ''Oh I do wonder what it is?'' she giggled. Her tongue lulling as she couldn't wait to have more 'fun'. Finally she can see over the hill and her eyes fix upon a small motel in the next valley. By now it was starting to get dark, the sun had gone down quarter of an hour ago. The motel had a great big neon sign, a small separate office and an L shaped single storey accommodation block of ten rooms. The car park had four cars, the owners and three belonged to guests. ''Time to check in!'' laughed Scarlet as she walked on towards the motel. She was going to be a very naught 'guest'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner was sat in the office looking out for customers. The waning light hid the giant Vixen heading right for his motel. The radio was reporting about strange portals and giant animals. Already cities were 'under attack' by the giants. ''Phhfttt... Shit story!'' Huffed the owner as he flicked the radio channel. But then he felt thumps. ''What the?!'' He gasped as his entire office shook with each thump. That grew louder and heavier. His radio fell off the desk as did pens, his cup of coffee and so on. The lights flickered. He grabbed his gun and ran to the door to look outside. His mouth dropped as he looked up into the face of a gigantic grinning Fox. Clearly a female, the slit between her legs and the two mounds on her chest giving her gender away. ''Hi cutie!'' Boomed the Fox, to him the words thunderous gibberish. His ears ringing and in a state of shock the owner lifted his gun at the beast ''oh fuck It can't be!'' He trembled as he raised his gun and pulled the trigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet grinned down at her new 'toy' he was trembling as she was just about to reach down for him when he lifted a gun at her and fired. The bullet went right into her vagina, sending a wave of pleasure through her as it was harmlessly trapped within her folds. ''Ooh... That was good, but I think you should just piss off!'' She grunted and squeezed. She began to piss down right on the man. Her hot golden shower smothering him instantly and burning his entire body. Her pee pooled out, flooding his office and nearly reaching her paws. She backed up so not to stain her fur. SHe stopped pissing and studied her stinky mess. The man lifeless body was dissolving in her highly corrosive urine. The office was in no better shape, the carpets and fixtures also started to dissolve in the liquid. Electrical items sparked and with a loud bang. The entire power supply for the motel went out. Scarlet laughed ''Stupid creature! Served you right!'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the motel and smelt more humans. There was three couples, all had seen her and at first they hid in their rooms. They all gasped as she pissed on the owner and then the lights went out. One couple snuck out to their car when she then looked there way. She grinned ''Aww! Leaving so soon?!'' She stood up and strolled on over. The couple screamed and entered their car. Before they could start it a massive paw slams down on them, instantly squishing them and blowing out the motel's windows. ''Woops! No early departures!'' said Scarlet as she lifted her paw back off the crushed car. The other couples screamed and ran. She squatted down and scooped them up in each hand. ''So easy! No escaping this big sexy Vixen!'' She dropped back onto her butt. The tarmac cracked under it's weight. She pondered briefly. What to do with her captives. She looked down at herself and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved one couples into her cleavage, holding both tightly in-between her breasts. They struggled, to no avail. ''That's it, stroke your goddess!'' She laughed as she then yawned. ''Oh my! All this fun sure if tiring. Well, at least I'm at a motel'' She stood up and lowered a hand to her vagina. With a wet squelch she shoved the other couple into her delicate folds. Groaning as they struggled madly within. ''Always like a bit of fun before bed!'' She strolled over to the motel and laid back on it. With an crash it crumbled beneath her far larger body. Her thick fur protected her. ''Hmm it's a free stay so I won't complain!'' She stared up the stars and thought of getting back home but also of the more fun to be had here. The struggles weakening as the couple in her breasts grew tired and the ones in her vagina pass out for good. She shut her eyes and nodded off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning she awakes to find...</span></div></div>",

Well, I won't be staying here again soon!'' She felt something between her breasts. ''Oh! Forgot about them!'' She reached in and plucked the couple out. They struggled and pleaded to be released. Her belly rumbled. She licked her lips and grinned. ''Hmm. I would like some breakfast;; she opened her mouth and let the humans gawp at her maw. Her teeth all in pristine condition, sharp and a brilliant white. Strands of saliva filled her mouth and her warm humid breath blasted over them. She only let them enjoy the view for a few seconds she tossed the humans in and sealed her jaws with a loud chomp. She swished them about roughly bashing them against her teeth and rubbing them along her hard roof ridges. 'What an unusual taste' she thought as she tipped her head back and with an loud gulp she swallowed them whole. She moaned as their flailing bodies tickled her gullet. She even felt them pounding on her stomach briefly before they passed out. She burped and patted her belly. ''I didn't know they could be so tasty and feel so good to devour! These little creatures sure are handy!'' She shoved a finger into her pussy and pulled out the other couples lifeless bodies. She sniffed them ''Ewww. I'm not that hungry!'' She tossed them aside and then she started to follow the road once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd walked for ages and encountered no vehicles or humans. ''Surely I should of come across one by now?'' She whined to herself. But ahead she caught scent of more humans and buildings. The scent growing stronger as she smelt more and more. ''Must be a town... More to play with and eat!'' She burst into a sprint but then the stench of smoke and fires also hit her nose. She could also smell other animals there ''Must be more on my scale!'' She panted. As she finally ran over the hill overlooking a sprawling metropolis. ''It's huge!'' She gasped. Plumes of smoke and fires raged in many places. She could see why the road was deserted, it was blocked by levelled buildings. She could also see the giants stomping about the city. It was...  </span></div></div>",

The bus shook with each thump of his paws. He kicked cars aside and crushed others under his thick pads. The surface shattering under each step. Worse of all the Fox's sheath was swelling as his cock began to slide out. ''The fuckers getting a boner!'' Yelled another passenger. As the Fox finally reached down and grabbed the bus. The passengers screamed as the bus lifted into the air and tipped forwards. They tumbled into a heap at the front, they struggled madly and once they had settled down their eyes set upon the Fox's eye glaring at them through the back window. ''Heh... Enjoy the ride!'' mocked the Fox, his words gibberish to the humans. He lowered the bus past his muscular white furred chest until it was level with the tip of his sheath. The passengers mouths drop at the sight. His tip was out and oozing pre. His cock was almost as big as the bus. With a loud grunt the male thrusted against the bus. The rear window shattered and metal sheared as the cock penetrated into the cabin. Glass rains on the passengers as does thick pre cum. The cock withdrew and then with another thrust it came back, penetrating deeper, due to the fact it was growing longer and fatter plus the bus's structure was being forced apart from the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet's tailed was wagging furiously, her tongue lulled and oozing and her fingers fondling her vagina as she watched the male fuck the bus. His cock was penetrating deeper and deeper with each thrust and it was growing in size as it erected. 'Oh fuck! What a beast!' She thought as she intently watched him continue. His cock was halfway in the bus, at full length it would probably be as long as the bus. It was already oozing pre and the passengers were all trapped in a heap at the front. ''Aww, They tinies get the best view!'' She whined. The male's head was lifted back and his fangs gritted as he thrust into the bus. His grunts and groans echoing throughout the city. ''I... I'm gonna blow...'' He whined as with one powerful buck of his hips his balls pulled into his scrotum as his cock erupted. The thick white fluid enveloped the passengers and flooded the interior with his seed. The force was so great the windows exploded and his cum gushed out of the sides. But worse was the front. The humans were shot out along with long strands of his cum onto the streets below. The male stood panting, he released the bus, that was now stuck to his cock. His cock stood in front of him with the ruined bus glued to it. After a few minutes he used his hand to pry off the bus and chucked it aside. His member now on full display knot and all.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''How was that babe?'' He panted as he looked at Scarlet. She licked her lips and removed her fingers from her vagina. ''Not bad big boy now I want you to show me more of what it can do!'' She grinned as the male sighed ''Is that not enough?!'' She shook her head ''No, show me what you really can do!'' She demanded she'd loved it really but watching him had got her going and she wanted to watch him again before she mated with him. ''Fine! I'll prove you I'm a big stud!'' He looked for something bigger to hump...</span></div></div>",

Just as he was about to head over a male Puma pounced over the train and began to tear it apart and eat the occupants. The Fox snorted and kept looking. He saw a great statue of one of the little creatures. This statue was about the same size. He giggled ''Not so small.. Maybe I should hump tha... Damn it!'' He was beaten yet again. This time it was a massive dog, a Saint Bernard. The massive dog sniffed the statue and licked it's face. It's powerful slobbering tongue pushed the head clean off and with a crash it hit the ground. Making the dog jump, right into the statue knocking it over and taking out many buildings. The Fox sighed and then saw something bigger and more plentiful. Skyscrapers, there were twelve of them in the centre. Ranging from 1500-2500ft tall. So far no other anthro had reached that deep into the city. The Fox grinned and headed towards the centre. Scarlet followed shortly behind. She'd been watching the other giants as they had their 'fun' in the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were wide enough for them to walk down and packed full of cars and fleeing humans. The two Foxes stomped on them without a care. All the humans saw was the male strolling towards them. His erection bobbing about before him and dripping the odd car sized drop of cum. Those not stomped on or smothered in his thick suffocating seed were finished off by Scarlet. Only those that ran aside into buildings or alleys survived. ''Oh aren't these buildings so shiny and tall! I'm sure they'll handle a big boy like me!'' Said the male to Scarlet. She laughed ''We'll see 'big boy''' The male grinned over his shoulder ''the name's Ignatius and yours sexy?'' Scarlet replied ''I'm Scarlet and yours if you please me enough!'' She still wanted to see him hump stuff. It excited her just as much as the thought of actually mating with him. She was always the tease with males, it was more fun that way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a short but destructive stroll Ignatius reached the closest skyscraper. It was 2500ft tall and had an glass exterior. To Ignatius it was around six times his height and wider than his body. Thanks to the clear glass he could see into the skyscraper. ''I can see the inside! Just like offices back home. Look at all that paperwork! Oh and the little creatures!'' He explained to Scarlet who stopped nearby and sat on a nearby office building that was the right height. Large cracks formed under her butt and many windows shattered, though she didn't spot this or care. ''I hate paperwork!'' He snorted. Scarlet laughed as she could see some of the creatures were looking out at him. Some were pointed at his erection that was level with them. ''You've got some admirers!'' She giggled and pointed the the cock level humans. Ignatius grinned ''So I have! Like what you see cuties. Here have a closer look!'' He thrust forwards violently. His fat cock easily smashed clean through the glass and ploughed over the humans, desks and chairs in its path. He pulled back and thrust again in a different section, crushing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock only went in half way. Scarlet snorted ''Now use it all!'' She called. Ignatius snarled as he stepped forwards to get in a closer position. He thrust again and stepped forwards so that with a heavy slap his cock went right in including the thick knot, which caused even more damage. His heavy fluffy balls smashed down below, taking out several floors. The whole skyscraper shuddered with each thrust. Humans trying to flee were tossed about violently. Those on the stairwells fell and knocked themselves out. Those in the lifts were in for a even more violent ride as the cables snapped and they plummeted to their deaths. The areas penetrated by the fox collapsed. Furniture and unlucky humans tumbled out of the large holes and fell to their demise. But worse was to come. Ignatius was still full of seed. each thrust brought him closer until he couldn't hold back. He snarled and ejaculated. The thick love sauce flooded the floor and entered the stairwell. Flooding lower floors as it journeyed downwards. Hundreds of humans were swept up and suffocated in the flow. Scarlet watched excitedly as she saw the cum, white in colour fill the building below Ignatius's cock. Her tail wagging violently yet again and her fingers found their way back into her vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatius panted as he calmed down. His cock, still deep in the skyscraper was smothered in his warm seed. ''Oh damn. That was good!'' He muttered as he backed up, pulling his cock out. Cum gushed out of the holes and pooled by his feet. He looked down at his mess. ''Oops! Sorry!'' He said sheepishly. He looked over at Scarlet who was fingering herself again. He was about to ask her if she enjoyed that when...</span></div></div>",

Both cats were smashing right through buildings with their massive paws. Their razor sharp claws were unsheathed and slicing through concrete like it was butter. ''Well what's going on here hmm?'' asked the black maned male. His companion laughed ''looks like somebody is trying to show off!'' The black maned male snickered. Scarlet stood up and her jaw dropped. She wasn't afraid to admire or mate with other species. The Lions rippling muscles and thick manes made her heart pound. Ignatius snorted and crossed his arms. He wasn't the least bit impressed by their superior size. ''Awww, looks like we need to teach these little Foxes a lesson!'' Mocked the black maned male. His companion licked his lips ''Oh yes!

Ordered the Brown maned Lion. Ignatius knew he was no match for them. He glared at them but moved aside. ''Heh! Let's do it!'' Snarled the black maned Lion as he stepped forwards and wrapped his arms around the skyscraper. His companion walked around to the other side and wrapped his arms around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the skyscraper the humans who had been above the floors humped by Ignatius were trapped. The lifts and stairwells ruined and blocked off by his cum. People within watched the giants as they continued to smash around the city. They had seen the Lions approach. Both felines being many times bigger than the two Foxes. The male had humped the building whilst the female was sat on an office building nearby and lewdly fingering herself as the male had humped their building and flooded the lower levels. Those not on the same side as the Lions could no longer see them until their thick limbs appeared and pressed against the glass on certain floors. On the sides with the Lions the view was different. Lower floors got to stare at the two beast's large genitals. Two massive balls sacks and a short sheath. Further up the view was of their muscular bodies. The highest view being of their heads. The thick short muzzles, golden mesmerising eyes and thick manes looming menacingly outside. With a  grunt the two Lions acted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing their arms tightly the glass shattered as their arms sunk in, demolishing floors with a loud crash. Furniture and humans tumbled out of the skyscraper but before they hit the ground the Lions stepped forwards, squishing the humans against their hard abs and the skyscraper as they hugged the structure. It groaned under the pressure as did both the Lions. Their genitals pushed against the building. The humans on those floors screamed and backed up as the orbs pressed against the cracking glass. The Lions pulled back then began to thrust their hips. Their balls smashing in violently. Crushing all in their path. ''ooh fuck this is good!'' Moaned the black maned Lion. His companion snarled ''Ooh Yes!'' Both their cocks slid out of their sheaths. Short, fat and barbed. Their cocks barbs spread the damage as they both thrusted back and forth. The skyscraper groaning in protest. The humans screams of terror excited the Lions further. Pre oozed from their cocks as they neared climax...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatius went over to Scarlet and they both watched the spectacle. ''So hot!'' Groaned Scarlet. Ignatius rolled his eyes ''But their dicks are so small!'' He snorted. Scarlet giggled and watched the Lions as their neared climax. They tipped their head backs and let off ear splitting roars. Shattering all the glass on the skyscraper and on the others surrounding them. Thick cum gushed out of the skyscraper as both cats blew at the same time. But the Lions climax was also the last straw for the damaged skyscraper. With a roar of it's own it started to collapse. The Lions gasped and fell back, smashing into the other skyscrapers and knocking them over. But the skyscraper was now coming down, right on Scarlet and Ignatius! ''Fuck! Run!''

Furniture, humans and various other types of debris rain down on the Foxes and surrounding area from the collapsing skyscraper. It's shadow washes ominously over both Foxes and the surrounding area. The shadow indicating the area to be hit. ''Faster!'' Panted Ignatius, who was following Scarlet. She yelped ''I'm going as fast as I can!'' Her paws teared up the street, largely devoid of humans. Abandoned cars were crushed by her paws or worse the became wedged in-between her toes, slowing her down as she had to shake them off. Ignatius snarled and shoved her violently. She tumbled forwards, smashing through a office building half her height. She rolled along, demolishing more buildings, coming to a rest on her back. Ignatius leapt over her as with a mighty crash the skyscraper smashes down less than a tails length away. ''Close your eyes and mouth!'' Ordered Ignatius as the cloud of dust envelops them and the surrounding area...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes the dust cloud dissipates. Both Foxes were now covered in dust. But most importantly, they had avoided the skyscraper. Looking aside they saw the mangled mess that was the structure. At what was it's base they see that many more skyscrapers have collapsed in a great pile. Within the mangled pile they could see the limbs of the two Lions, both Cats were out cold. ''Heh, serves them right!'' Laughed Ignatius who was standing on all fours over Scarlet. She giggled ''Oh yes'' both Foxes went silent as their eyes met and they realised they position they was in. Ignatius lowered his muzzle and released his tongue. Scarlet opened her mouth and released her tongue to meets his. They loudly slapped together in their equivalent of a kiss. Their tongues wrapped around each other and squeezed as they moaned contently. Releasing their tongues Ignatius stood up as did Scarlet. ''Better clean up first, then we'll have sex!'' Said Scarlet as she headed for a nearby pool. Ignatius eagerly followed. First of all they both shook, flinging off most of the dust. Then they used the water to clean there coats. Once cleaned it was time... ''But where to do it'' murmured Scarlet as she looked for the perfect spot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was almost as tall as her and several times her length.  So far it had been left alone by the other giants and so would be perfect. To lay on the pitch within out of sight of the other giants. She pointed to the stadium to Ignatius. ''There! We can have some privacy!'' She walked towards the stadium. Ignatius followed her closely. She drooled at the thought of sex, her drool oozed onto the street and buildings  below. She walked briskly, shattering the surface, crushing vehicles, blowing out windows and even caused the concrete on buildings to crack. Ignatius strolled down a parallel street. He was walking just as briskly but also he stayed back a little. So he could admire Scarlets butt and tail. 'So sexy' he thought as he admired her rear. Below the buildings damaged by Scarlet were finished off by his heavier footsteps. Humans within these buildings first sighed in relief when Scarlet stomped by. Thinking they were lucky to just to be crushed by the larger male stomping on after her. Dozens of buildings were levelled by the two Foxes heavy footsteps. Leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the large car park. It was fairly empty for no match was on. There was the odd car here and there. They walked across the car park with the same indifference as walking down the streets. The odd car being flattened under their pads. They stopped by the stadium. For Scarlet she could just see over the top. She stood on tip toes to look within. The pitch and seats were clear, apart from the odd cowering human. She giggled ''Aww. We'll have some spectators!'' Ignatius laughed ''Let's put on a good show!''  He pressed his hands on the stadium to lift himself him. But with a crash it partly collapsed under him. ''Fuck! So weak!'' He growled and instead he crouched down and with a grunt he jumped into the stadium. His paws tore up large chunks of tarmac that crushed any car they landed upon. He landed on the pitch, his paws leaving two deep prints in the turf. Scarlet grunted and leapt in as well. She tore up smaller chunks of tarmac and on landing left two shallower prints. But they was now both within the stadium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked around, they was out of sight of the other giants. Scarlet grinned ''Some privacy from the others at least!'' Ignatius pointed at the humans within. ''Just a few tinies to witness it!'' He licked his lips and fondled his balls. Scarlet moaned and laid back against the seats. Thousands of seats were crushed under her back as she laid right back. The stadium groaned but held her weight. Her spread legs stretched onto the pitch. Her pussy on full display. Ignatius dropped onto all fours before her. His hands coming down either side of her and crushing more seats. His balls and sheath swung about wildly under him. Scarlet reached for his sheath and stroked at it. His cock began to swell up as he got an erection. ''Ooh...'' They both groaned as she released his sheath. His sheath pulled back as his cock slipped out and grew to it's full length. It was hanging right down and touching the pitch. 'What a beast!' Thought Scarlet as she looked at his massive boner. Ignatius began to drag him self forwards. His member dragging along the turf, gouging out the turf and soaking the soil in pre cum. His boner reached the seats, crushing them under its sheer bulk as it headed for her awaiting vagina. A few people who had been trapped between her legs screamed in terror as his member came at them. Rather than crushing the humans they became stuck to his head as he reached her vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatius lifted his cock over Scarlet's vagina and as if to tease the humans and her he waited for a few moments. The humans on his tip struggled madly to no avail. His sticky cock had them firmly attached. He snarled and gave a powerful thrust with his hips. Scarlet screamed in ecstasy as his cock penetrated her vagina. He pulled back and thrust down again and again. The humans crushed against her smooth walls as he thrust right into her and with a squelch his knot tied him to her. He threw his head back and snarled as he blew his load into her. She groaned and gritted her teeth as he released his seed. Ignatius panted as he released several loads then as quick as it started the 'fun' part was over. They were tied together. ''Fuck that was good!'' Moaned Ignatius. Scarlet whined ''Ooh yes. So good and the tinies stadium held.'' Indeed somehow their sexual intercourse had not caused the stadium to collapse. Though beneath her great cracks had formed, water pipes had burst, wires were exposed, vending machines knocked over...  They of course couldn't see the interior devastation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now they was tied together for at least half an hour just like feral canines. So are they left in peace until Ignatius's knot deflates or does something happen?  </span></div></div>",

''Can you hear that?'' Said Scarlet as her ears picked up the noises from beneath. Ignatius nodded ''I can. I think... Argh!'' With a loud roar the stadium caved in beneath Scarlet. Both Foxes tumbled down. The rubble waterlogged and electrified by the wires. Scarlets thick fur was covered in the thick wet rubble. The electricity was enough to give her a mild shock. She screamed and leapt up. Ignatius tumbled back onto the pitch as she slammed into him. As they were still firmly tied Scarlet was pulled forwards and down onto Ignatius. The pitch at least provided a somewhat soft landing. Around them a chain reaction occurred. The stadium collapsed on it self in both directions.

His large five toes feet spread his weight to great effect, so he didn't sink into the ground. His sharp claws easily tearing through the tree trunks as effectively as his shoulders. He sniffed the air for prey. He couldn't smell any of the usual prey (who had all ran when he first arrived) but he smelt a new type of prey. His belly rumbled, he headed for this strange prey's scent. From what he could smell it was small, but high in number along with other strange scents. Curious and with a rumbling belly he headed for his new unencountered before prey. The strange prey of course being humans. His stroll carving a trail of destruction through the forest, scaring off other animals and alerted the humans to his approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first encounter with humans is...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Running along the edge of the forest was a busy motorway, the only one in the region. Cars, coaches, trucks and so on whizzing along the many lanes. The Wolverine smelt the vehicles, he had never encountered vehicles before on his world or roads. So the smells were new to him. He was wary, but also hungry and curious. As he neared the edge of the forest he could see the many colourful vehicles running along the great long grey ribbon that was the motorway. How strange, he could smell the prey within the vehicles. He would have to go and investigate this new prey. He walked on and finally emerged from the forest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost vehicles had not heard the constant crashing of trees from within the forest. They were completely oblivious. Apart from the bus that had broken down on the shoulder near to where he was approaching. The driver was out looking at the engine. He gazed into the forest wondering what was causing the crashing. Dismissing it as loggers working he continued to tinker with the engine. But when the crashing stopped and was replaced with thuds he looked and gasped as a gigantic Wolverine casually emerged from the forest and started to come right at him and his bus! He screamed and quickly ran back on board. The passengers panicked and screamed as well. Desperately he tried to start the engine. The beast continued to approach. Passengers fled into the motorway. Cars horns blared and brakes screeched as a pile up was caused by the fleeing passengers and sight of the gigantic Wolverine bearing down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolverine strolled on boldly. The prey looked so weak he was sure he could deal with them with ease. Out of the vehicles emerged his prey. Screaming and running about. He licked his lips. So small but so many! He jumped though when the horns blared and loud screeching of brakes followed by crashes. He didn't run but stopped and watched the pile up occur before his eyes. All lanes blocked by the pile up, making his prey immobile and easy to catch! On he walked, going for the bus that was closest. He stopped before the bus and stared down at it. He lowered his head for a sniff. Within he heard screaming prey and out of the doors emerged more. He groaned and swung his head towards the closest people. His tongue flicked out and he slurped them up. He didn't swish or chew. He tipped his head back and GULP! He swallowed them whole and alive. He groaned contently, tasty, but not so filling. But there were thousands more to fill his belly. Wolverines were known for their gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving seen the broad paw and sharp claws looming menacingly just inches from the bus made a couple snap and run out in fear. Even though the loud sniffs could be heard against the roof. They ran out of the bus and looked up. Screaming as over them was the giant Wolverine's head. His jaws opened and his great saliva coated tongue slid out. They ran on but it was futile the tongue slaps into them and with lightning speed it lifts and flicks them back into the beast's maw. With a thunderous gulp they were pulled into the throat and tumbled down into the stomach. Which was of course dark, smelly and yet to fill with digestive juices. Beating on the walls and begging to be released the couple unknowingly gave the great carnivore great pleasure. Digestive acids began to fill his stomach. Burning them from their feet up as the beast began to digest them. Splashes and more screams were the last thing they heard as the Wolverine snacked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolverine loved the sensation his live swallowed prey gave within his belly! More! He want more! He noticed they prey was hiding in the vehicles, he would have to get them out. He lifted one of his paws and looked at his claws. Great for digging, climbing and gripping prey usually. But now they could be used sort of like can openers. His broad feet could also be used to slowly crush the vehicles and spook his prey out...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to spook them out, not squish them after all. His paw contact the bus, he groaned as did the bus as he carefully pushed down. The roof started to cave in. The windows cracked loudly then shattered as the sides gave out. Passengers tumbled out of the door and where immediately slurped up and swallowed whole. He shivered in ecstasy, the humans flailing limbs tickling his throat and stomach. He couldn't believe he'd never eaten prey like this before! Delicious and pleasurable! In seconds the bus's passengers had fled right into his maw. He could tell the bus was now empty. He growled and pushed down with all his might. With ease his broad paw and thick muscular legs crushed the bus into sheet metal. He went for the closest vehicle, a car. It was small and he cautiously tried to place his paw upon it. He misjudged the pressure and immediately he crushed it before getting the prey out! The driver seeing nothing but a thick pad smothering his windows as the roof caved in and all went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growled, so flimsy these smaller vehicles!  He had another idea... The next car he reached for with a single claw. It easily tore through the windscreen and impaled the driver. He pulled with claw back and studied the impaled human. He sniffed at the lifeless body. The blood soaking his claw making it obvious the human was dead. Oh well, no pleasure this time! He licked the human up and swallowed. He'd try to be more careful. He went for the next car, but the human got out and ran. A quick flick of his tongue and another victim was pleasuring him and fulfilling his hunger. By now people were fleeing on foot or turning around and driving the wrong way, causing more accidents that trapped them. Making the Wolverine's 'hunt' so stupidly easy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strolled on, ripping open cars, crushing buses and batting aside trucks. His head lowered and tongue constantly flicking up people. Fires and smoke burned around him from the various wrecks. His paws crushing vehicles with ease. The trail behind him was of sheets of metal, his broad feet whilst great at crushing vehicles were also so efficient at spreading his weight he left no prints or even cracks for that matter. Both sides of the motorway suffered the same fate. Tens of thousands of people and vehicles crushed as he casually strolled along. Devouring and crushing on one of his easiest hunts ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon our big Wolverine encounters something else to investigate...</span></div></div>",

He'd already devoured a few hundred but now he could really stuff himself! He quickens his pace, still following the motorway and lapping up any human not within a vehicle. Now without much care for this small number below he happily crushed vehicles with human occupants. A few wasted here won't matter when there's so many more grouped up ahead! It didn't take long for him to come within sight of the city. He stopped and sniffed the air and studied it closely. The many buildings within the centre especially were as tall as the trees back home. But they were clearly not trees. How curious! He'd soon be able to go in to explore and feast. He walked on along the motorway until it approached the suburbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaid out like many large cities the outer area of course consisted of suburbs of houses. Then were the shops and small businesses, the taller apartments, factories, the sports stadium and so on. Whilst the centre had many tall office blocks and skyscrapers. The motorway went over the suburbs, as a great overpass with several on off ramps. The Wolverine was approaching the start of the over pass, which also marked the edge of the city's suburbs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolverine had became quite confident in waling on the motorway, but now it was about to seemingly hang in the air. He stopped short of the start of the overpass. He looked over the sides at the ground below with the houses and streets. Seeing that many vehicles were 'safely' using the overpass he was sure it was safe to walk on. He would use one of the ramps ahead to walk down, though he could so easily jump down. He walked on and once his body was fully on the overpass he heard loud cracks and groans coming from under him!? Before he could react with a loud roar and crash the overpass collapses under his weight! Whilst his broad paws were great on the ground his sheer bulk on the suspended road was just to much! The fall was not dangerous or even painful for the Wolverine. But the sudden noise and great cloud of dust made him jump. He turned and ran into the suburbs. His paws crushing houses with ease or slicing them apart with his claws. He was snuffing out many people without realising it. He carved a trail of destruction that went right through the suburbs. Already news had spread of the giant rampaging along the motorway. Many not believing the reports the few that did were already trying to flee. Though those fleeing in the Wolverines path were also now stains on his paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran right through the suburbs and only came to a halt when he reached the first apartment building, that was his height. He skidded to a halt, wrecking a few shops in the process.  He grunted and looked back at his trail of destruction with the cloud of dust from the overpass in the distance. He'd been spooked by a little fall?! He snorted. He'd crushed some humans but there was many more and right now in the building before him. Their screams from around and within filled his sensitive ears. They should be afraid, he was the predator in charge here and they were his food! He studied the apartment before him, it was as high and long as his body, he would have to get the humans out. But how would be the best way to do it? </span></div></div>",

Having rather potent scent anal glands he could mark this territory and stink the humans out! Eagerly he lifted his tail and turned around showing off his large backside. His dirty tailhole and balls on full display for the humans within the apartment building. Whilst some of the occupants had already fled or were away those remaining were left gawping at the massive mustelid's backside. With a grunt the Wolverine backed up, bringing his backside right at the apartment building. The humans screamed and ran, but it was to late for those on the side closest to the Wolverine. With a loud crash his backside slams into the building. Pushing in the walls and collapsing many floors.  His balls acting like demolition balls, they penetrated deep and crushed several humans under their bulk. The Wolverine groaned contently. He hadn't thought the building would cave in like that but he felt so good on his backside! He lulled his tongue and wriggled his backside. Demolishing more of the building and marking it with his potent scent. The stench flooded the whole building and started to spread outwards. Those within the building who hadn't been crushed were choking on the horrific stench. They ran for the exit whilst above the building was demolished by the Wolverines backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was enjoying this to much! He pushed back and even began to sit on the building. He pushed down, grunting and moaning as his balls were the first to smash through the floors followed by the rest of his backside. He'd forgotten that he was meant to only be marking it, he was lost in the sheer bliss of it all. Within a minute half the apartment was a pile of crushed rubble under his backside. He looked back at the mess. His own lovely scent filled his nostrils. This area was his now! Though he had demolished half the building there was still half left and many more surrounding him. The remaining half had humans pilling out. He stood up and gave his butt a shake, flinging off any stuck debris. The debris smashing into surrounding buildings and taking out several cars.  He lowered his head and slurped up the humans who were emerging from the apartment building. He soon had the apartments survivors in his belly. He walked away from the half demolished structure and looked for his next target.... </span></div></div>",

Cars crashed everywhere, blocking roads and starting fires. His marking not only secured his territory but trapped his food! This place was amazing for the Wolverine. He was soon approaching the tallest skyscraper. The roads narrowed as they were surrounded by the taller office buildings that were several times the Wolverines height. He easily forced his way through, his muscular shoulders tearing through the buildings with ease. Many were killed as they fell to their deaths or were crushed by debris and his massive paws. The Wolverine didn't notice, he was to focused on the skyscraper and his vantage point. He reached the base of the skyscraper, it was twenty times his height and wider than him. He lifted onto his hindlegs and gingerly placed his forepaws against the side. He then pushed inwards, his claws easily sliced through the glass exterior. Humans within the offices nearest the Wolverine were greeted with his gigantic paw pressing against the glass. Those on the floors were his claws came through were less fortunate. The sharp claws easily impaling them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolverine placed his second forepaw into the skyscraper and hauled himself upwards. His hind claws slicing into the skyscraper. Impaling more humans and spilling office furniture onto the street. To his amazement the building held, he slowly began to climb upwards. His claws easily ripping into the building and impaling dozens of humans as he climbed up. The floors bent under the pressure but didn't fully cave in, thanks to the skyscrapers strong structure. As he got higher the skyscraper narrowed, so he had to grip the sides but finally he reached the top. Along one side was a trail of smashed in windows. Though only by his claws, his broad feet of course spread his weight and caused no further damage. once as high up as possible the Wolverine looked about to study the city and surrounding area. Or his new territory. He growled when he spotted something that was a threat... </span></div></div>",

With a great flash that dazzled the Wolverine and many nearby residents it was replaced with a gigantic bull Moose. The huge beast was easily five times the Wolverines height, so about around 500ft. Nearby humans screamed and pointed up at the new arrival. The Moose, agitated by their screams lowered its head and with one flick of its tongue crushed them to silence them. But there was many humans around snorting the beast began to kick out with his sharp hooves. Demolishing homes, crushing vehicles and snuffing out hundreds of lives. But then the Moose's nostrils caught the Wolverines scent. Raising it's head the Moose looked at the centre and it's eyes set upon the Wolverine, clinging atop the tallest skyscraper. Raising his hackles and lowering his head the Moose intention was clear, he was going to charge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolverine stared at the Moose, he wasn't afraid of the far larger beast but usually he only ate them as carrion. He would wait for the Moose to charge, then he would pounce....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Moose roared and began his charge. Everything in his path was demolished, either stomped or kicked into oblivion. Fires started in many places, water mains burst spraying jets high into the air. The Moose's heavy footsteps shattered the road surfaces, caused mini quakes that shook nearby buildings and rumbled like thunder throughout the city. He tore through the office buildings as though they were made of paper. The Wolverine was ready to jump, the moose vanished in a cloud of dust. But with an almighty crash he smashed into the skyscraper. He had slid to a halt and used his massive horns to ram the building. The large structure lurched  to the side. People still in the structure along with furniture were violently ejected out of the holes caused by the Wolverine. But worse was to come. The skyscraper was going over! The Wolverine leapt off and aimed for the moose's back. With a loud crash the skyscraper completely crashed over creating a massive cloud of dust and debris. Several other office buildings were demolished in the collapse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the fight between the two beast was to begin...</span></div></div>",

The Moose bellowed once more and began to thrash about madly. Smashing into surrounding buildings and kicking up more dust and debris. The once pristine city centre now looked like a warzone. The Moose, was already getting weak from blood loss and it's mad thrashing. With a final toss of its head the Wolverine was ripped free, flying off and landing on all fours nearby. Demolishing several small shops. Unfortunately four great chunks of flesh were ripped off with the Wolverine, the great wounds soaking the Moose and ground below with it's own blood. The great beast stumbled then collapsed, taking out an office building in the process. Yet another cloud of dust formed, obscuring the Moose. The Wolverine stood and watched the cloud of debris, waiting to see if the Moose emerged or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the moose was dead, the cloud slowly dispersed revealing the lifeless body. The Wolverine immediately set upon the carcass. Tearing off great chunks and greedily swallowing. The Wolverine had never had fresh Moose before and it was so much more filling than the humans!

But then the tanks started to fire. A shell exploded against his flank. He was thrown on his side, smashing into a car dealership. Pain filled his body. The shell had burnt off his fur and left a small wound. He rose to his feet and snarled as another shell hit his leg. He reared back and let off a ferocious bellow but his exposed belly took two shots. He was thrown back again. Crushing several more business.

The giant carnivores stood up and looked around to see what had awoken them. All they could see was Savannah. But it was different... The trees that towered over them previously now barely reached past their paws. From up here they easily spot plenty of prey. But again the prey was smaller than it should be. Nearby was a road with some light traffic passing by. A few cars stopped and the people got out in disbelief to stare at the eleven giant Lions standing before them. In the distance was a city, the Lions noticed the city but had no idea what it was. though they could smell plenty of potential prey from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant males act first. They began to walk, shaking the ground, crushing trees like twigs, blowing up great clouds of dust and leaving large paw prints in their wake.

Cars crashed into each other to flee the approaching giants. Some were just damaged and still fully mobile. A few were immobilised, leaving the occupants trapped as the huge pride of Lions reaches them. People crawled out of the wrecked vehicles to be swallowed in darkness. The Lions casting long dark shadows over the road. The trapped people looked up into the faces of the huge Lions. All of whom had stopped before the road. The Lions had never seen anything like this before. They cautiously lowered their heads to study the people and vehicles. It was a tense moment for the people below, looking up at these immense predators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the male Lions uses his paw to prod a bus. The impact whilst gentle to him was enough to knock the vehicle over. The windows smashed and the occupants screamed. The Lion backed up with surprise at the smashes and screams.

Those in the bus were to busy squirming in his piss to noticed the giant clumps of earth flying overhead. The bus itself was untouched by the mud, but a few of the cars were buried.

They backed up, looking uncertain. The old female however grew some courage. She stepped over the road, straddling it between her legs. She had the bus positioned right under backside. She lifted her tail, showing off her dried arsehole and just as dry pussy. The passengers in the bus had managed to wipe of the males pee, that had already evaporated or flowed out of the heavily damaged vehicle.

But the peace was interrupted by a great swirling purple light. The animals fled from the strange light and just as well. Emerging from the light was hour gigantic paws. They landed on the ground with a thump. Kicking up a cloud of dust. The Paws owner a huge female Pachycrocuta studied the scene before her. The sight looked wrong but the scents were familiar. She grunted, this didn't feel right. Looking down she could see what appeared to be prey, but it was now not even bite sized?! Behind her the portal flickers as three more Pachycrocuta join her. They weren't quite as tall and were all males. She stood out by her greater size and pseudo-penis hanging between her hind legs. The portal flickered and vanished. Leaving the four giants towering over all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe males, hungrily eyed up the smaller creatures. They drooled and held up their tails as they started to whoop and chase down the prey. The ground shook violently under their heavy footsteps. They left deep paw prints that squished anything they came down on. Trees, rocks, animals. All ended up looking like pancakes within the prints. They lowered their heads and began greedily gobbling up all creatures with range. The Matriarch did not move, she watched the three males as the made quick work of devouring every living creature within a few mile radius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three males had finished she groaned, calling the them back. They obeyed, coming up to her. Flicking their tails and lowering themselves in submission. They all had erections, a sign of submission in Hyena's. She cocked her leg, one of the males came up parallel to her in the opposite direction and did the same. Lower each others head they licked at each others penises. Fat tongues curling and fondling each others penises, covering them both in drool. The male submissively backed away from his matriarch. She snapped at him with a loud CHOMP! Of Her bone crushing teeth. He giggled and ran a short distance away.   She stared at the next male, who approached her and again the two licked each others penises and then same with the third male. having shown deference to their Matriarch she leads the clan on.

Taking photos and selfies. Little did they now what was about to ruin their day. It started as distant thunder that grew louder and louder. The ground started to shake with each crack of thunder. Believing that it was due to a para military group they started to drive away. But the thunder continued to grow louder and the shakes grew in severity. looking around for the sight of explosions people scream as they see the true course merging over a small hill. Four gigantic Hyenas are running this way! The monsters where whooping, a sign of attack! The buses drove flat out but the beasts superior size meant they caught up with ease...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Matriarch led the attack. One of the males tried to overtake she snapped at him. He giggled and backed up. She made it clear. These were for her to eat! She reaches the first bus. She overestimated her speed. She plants a paw on the bus, instantly crushing it and the occupants. A few people had jumped out, but to late. They still ended up under her paw to be turned into paste. The impact made the next bus loose control. It skidded sideways and rolled over. The people screamed as they were tosses out or crushed under the vehicle. But worse was to come. A pair of ferocious jaws comes over them and SNAP! The jaws slam together, crushing many and trapping the rest in her maw. Her powerful tongue lurches and she chews. She's not fussy. She chewed up the bus and people and swallows. Her bone crushing jaws making easy work of the buses thin metal. She licked her lips, that was tasty and she still had two more to devour! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe males watched intently. But didn't dare interrupt their matriarch. She charged over the next bus. The driver struggled to remain in control, but he was fairly skilled unlike the last and didn't crash. People tried to jump, A large tongue politely caught them and took them into the awaiting jaws above. She lowers her head after the bus and opens her maw wide. Foul hot and humid breath assault the passengers. Her saliva coasted tongue lovingly slides out and stretches after the bus. It slaps down on the rear with a loud wet slurp she drags her tongue forwards. The bus violently stopped as its rear was crushed under her mighty muscle. The front lifts up, tossing the passengers to the rear. She dragged her tongue forwards. Crushing more of the bus and occupants. Within seconds it was bloody saliva soaked sheet metal. She pried it up and with a few chomps the bus was also in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne to go! She chased after it. Slowly and teasingly. The thought of being in so much power over these puny creatures excited her. She had an erection. Her penis flopped about wildly as she ran. The males also felt horny watching their beautiful and big matriarch make such quick work of the strange little creatures. their shells useless at stopping her. The males eagerly followed watching their matriarch's lovely penis swinging about. Oh would they love to have some sex. Maybe later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last bus was putting up more of a fight. It swerved every time she came in for a  crushing lick. Then it braked hard. Not so nice for the passengers but the Matriarch overshot the vehicle and tried to turn around. She yelped as she lost her footing and fell over. She kicked up a great cloud of dust and crushed many trees. She quickly got up and resumed the chase. Even more determined to catch her prey! But the bus had managed to reach a nearby abandoned mine. Realising it was going to enter a 'burrow' She gave one final burst of speed and opened her jaws in preparation of a chomp. But the bus reached the mine shaft It smashed through the gates and entered the long dark tunnel. Her jaws chomping shut just inches behind. The chomp echoed throughout the mine. The bus went in as deep as possible. Well out of range of the Hyena. She angrily growled after the bus. She wasn't just going to let it escape! Her belly still eager for more food. She looked at the males and their erect dicks. She thought of a plan to get at the bus... </span></div></div>",

Obeying their matriarch each male steps over one of the ventilation shafts and positions their dick over the opening. They squat down, lowering their cocks into the holes. Their cocks barely fitting in. But with a grunt they managed to push their cocks all the way in. One male had to thrust a few times to get in, his balls loudly slapping on the ground as he fully inserted himself. In position they groan and began to piss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThousands of gallons of hot, salty, stinking and corrosive urine thunders down into the mine. The humans intently listened to the Hyena's outside. Hearing and feeling the beasts heavy footsteps. They felt some rapid thumps, that was the one male's balls slamming into the ground above. They all thought they was safe, but an ominous rumble filled the mine. It sounded like a large waterfall. Their was loud splashes and the shattering of timbers echoed throughout the mine. The disgusting smell hit them first, making them all choke on it's overpowering scent. The humans ran when they saw a great torrent of green liquid thunder out of an overhead shaft and smash into the tunnel they was in.

Seeing her little snacks within. They were dead, partly burnt away and drenched in salty piss but she was not fussy. She lowers her head and licks up her treats. She didn't mind the piss like taste of her snacks. She chewed them up and swallowed greedily. Once she'd ate all the humans she turned and walked off. Looking for more. The males, still laying with their spent bladders and dicks shoved deep in the ground see her leave. They whined and quickly stood back up. Their erect dicks flopping about wildly as they chased after their matriarch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked on at a brisk pace. She wanted to devour more of the little creatures! She could smell them...

However, the Lions were annoyed that creatures decided to approach them in the first place. They decided to fix that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two males lifted their great tails. Under each tail were two mighty testicles. They sat loosely in a thick, musky pouch. Under that was his sheath, which held his feline barbed penis. The penis inside slid out slightly, making a small bit of pink visible. The humans in the city had been frozen. They were not sure why the Lions had stopped their assault, deeply hoping they were deciding to leave. Unfortunately for them, the Lions were about to make the human's home far more inviting for their pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, a blast of urine sprayed out of the males penis. The mist like liquid sprayed all throughout the city, covering many city blocks at a time. The males would then simply walk to a different location and spray again, ensuring they covered their entire new territory. Humans gagged and coughed at the disgusting smell, and were blinded if it got in their eyes. Indoors were also not safe, as if a Lion just so happened to have his genitals aimed at the side of a building, the blast would smash through windows, permanently staining everything inside. The Lionesses decided to join in. They walked to various parts of the city and squatted down. Out of their moist slits, they unleashed a torrent of pee. Unlike the males spray, the female streams could easily flood entire streets and buildings, drowning hundreds in their rancid liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the pride to have coated the city in their smelly urine. One by one the humans are knocked out by the stench, laying motionlessly on the ground. The Lions did take notice that the humans had stopped moving, but did not care why. They simply proceeded to continue the feast on the many lifeless bodies, as well as resuming with leveling the rest of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther away, the fleeing Hyena's picked up the now strong scent of the Lions markings.

Sure she had seen the Lions crushing these things under paw without issue, but she wanted to make sure it was safe for her and the males. She gingerly placed her paw on top of the roof and began to add pressure. She felt the structure crack and crumble as she added more of her weight. Before the humans inside could even think about evacuating, the female simply fully stomped the building, killing all within. The Matriarch noted the satisfying \"crunch\" under her paw, but more importantly felt no creatures biting or stinging her.

The female watched in amazement how the thin path she was on became flooded with those tasty creatures! Without hesitation the female began to lap up the humans. Her canine tongue was able to scoop up hundreds at a time, swallowing them whole without chewing. Any humans she had missed were simply crushed under her paws, but their were so many, she had no need to be careful. As she was just scooping up her sixth mouthful, she cunningly noticed it was the males who were stomping on the other buildings, that were scaring out the current humans she was feasting on. She just learned how to get these creatures out of hiding! She grinned as she swallowed, these human creatures sure aren't very intelligent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male Hyenas had been watching the female intently. They were completely unaware that with every step, they created millions of dollars in damages and ended the lives of many humans.

One of the males built up the courage and attempted to mount the female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female turned around and snapped her jaws at him, growling. She had definitely not had her fill, and even if she did, she was not in the mood for sex. The male cowered away in fear, giggling. The two males quite clearly got the message, lowering their heads in submission. The female then turned back around and resumed devouring the packed street. The males needed some form of relief! If only there was something else to mount. Just as that thought crossed their minds, they noticed the buildings around them were getting larger, taller, thicker, and about the size of a female Hyena. Those would do perfectly to release their sexual frustration! Walking ahead a little, the first male decides to hump: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many executives and other wealthy people used this hotel when visiting the bustling metropolis. And it just so happened that every room was booked and occupied. All of the guests had heard the news that disaster had struck a neighboring city, so they had all returned to their rooms. Suddenly, they felt the ground shake.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe first male Hyena decided that this structure would do. It reach just over his head, and about the same width and length as him. He quickly tore through all the small buildings in his way. His erection was completely at full mass, and dripping pre. Arriving at the building, the male sniffed around. He could tell it was chocked full of those human creatures, and no termites, meaning it should be safe to \"plunge in\" without getting bitten. He gave another deep whiff, shattering a bunch of the windows with his suction. He could hear the creatures inside scream in fear. This amused the male, as he knows they will be screaming a lot louder once he got started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male then proceeded to finally mount the building. He raised his front paws and rested them on the roof. The top floors began to cave in, leaving two very large indentations where he was resting each front leg. People in the top rooms were instantly killed. Guest began to rapidly flee down to the lower parts of the hotel, thinking it would be safer. Unfortunately for them, many ended up at the same floor level as the Hyenas throbbing genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with a grunt, he plunges his dick straight into the side of the building. The thick, bulbus tip easily tears through the luxury interiors and the pampered guests. With one thrust, the male was able to fully insert himself, reaching his penis all the way to the center of the hotel. With another satisfying grunt, the male then started twisting his hips to better position himself. Despite all the sounds of crashing and screaming, the Hyena was really enjoying himself! First off, the building was a lot easier to penetrate, when compared to lining up with the female Hyena's pseudo-penis. Secondly, he was initially worried the inside of the small creature's mount was going to be dry and chalky, but the combination of his precum and the crushed humans \"guts\" coating his penis actually kept him quite lubricated. It did not take long for the male to feel his orgasm building up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans inside were having a much less pleasurable experience then the Hyena. A large majority of the guests were crushed when the Hyena inserted his \"goods\". Those who were not killed were treated to a healthy dose of his male musk, which caused them all to gag violently, making escape even more difficult. Elevators where destroyed and the stairways had collapsed, further thwarting the humans escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final grunt, the male felt his twitching penis fire a load of hot, creamy goodness into the center of the building. The force was so strong it ripped through the rest of the rooms on the center levels. Humans in these rooms were instantly killed, snuffed out by the orgasm. The cumshot was so strong, it even broke the windows on the opposite side of the building! Unfortunately for the survivors, the male let out another, then another! His furry testicles contracting with every additional load of cum. The hot mucus flowed through the lower level, suffocating everyone in its path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid there motionless, still inserted in the building, feeling the warmth of his own cum enveloping his softening genitals. He definitely earned that release. After a few more moments of basking in post orgasmic bliss, the male finally pulled out of the ruined structure. With a squelch, his penis flopped out, leaving a massive dripping hole in the side of the defiled building. The males penis was completely covered in tiny red stains, prior humans that were used as nothing more then lubrication. A very small amount of people inside were still alive, and most of them were taking their last breaths as they suffocated in the males thick seed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other males had watched excitingly, they wanted to have some fun as well! There was no point having sloppy seconds, especially when there were so many other fresh buildings around! The second male looks around and decides to violate:</span></div></div>",

It was made of very strange abstract shapes. \"Hopefully the insides will feel as interesting as the outsides look\", the Hyena thought. He stomped his way over to the building, wiping out all the smaller ones that don't have his attention. In addition to the trail of destruction, he was also leaving a sticky trail of precum, which was leaking from his excited penis. Meanwhile, inside the art gallery, various people had gathered to see a new exhibit that was opening that day. The many rooms of the building were lined with various paintings and sculptures. Security was very tight, as many of the works ranged from tens of thousands to multi millions of dollars. Suddenly everything started to vibrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the male was up close, he was confused on how to mount this thing. Sniffing around the building, he noticed one section had two large columns of building jutting out. It looked a bit like the hind legs of a female! This must be the correct place to thrust in. But first, the male began to lick in between the sections, as he wanted to add some lubrication. His massive tongue tore through the windows with ease! Thick drool poured in, destroying all the artworks on that wall. People froze in shock, they could not believe what they were seeing! Soon the male was satisfied with the amount of licking, and proceeded to line up his throbbing dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyena penis tore through the side of the building and crashed into many nearby exhibits. Paintings were torn, sculptures smashed and people crushed. The strong musk of the males genitals quickly spread throughout the entire gallery. Unlike the hotel the other Hyena had enjoyed, the art gallery was quite hollow, with very large open areas. This meant there were fewer objects to stimulate his cock. To remedy this issue, the male rocked his hips side to side. This caused his member to tear through multiple walls inside the gallery. The male also raised his hind leg, resting in on the roof of the building. This allowed him to get a better angle and penetrate way further inside. This caused further destruction to the priceless artworks, as well as killed even more of the visitors, but gave him way more sexual pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople inside tried desperately to escape, but all the exits were blocked by falling debris. Some even tried to save various paintings, only to be struck by a certain sexual organ. Various artworks and humans got stuck to his dick, which was now coated in a generous amounts of precum. The humans couldn't take much more of this! But the Hyena knew it was about to be over soon, as he readied to unleash his pent up load. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the males penis began to twitch violently. Massive ropes of cum squirted from his tip! They flew through out the art gallery, giving all the paintings a fresh coat of white paint. He let out blast after blast, almost as if the male wasn't satisfied until he coated the entire gallery. Any humans survivors hit were instantly coated and many drowned. Finally, the male could feel each squirt becoming weaker and weaker, until the last one dribbled from his tip. All of the remaining artworks had been completely destroyed by is thick, sticky seed. The male just stood their silently, still enjoying the feeling of his intense orgasm, completely unaware of the untold amounts of damages he had caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff, the male finally pulled out of what was left of the violated building. Like the first male, he too left a gaping, dripping hole. He gave his dick a shake, sending various human limbs and other once beautiful pieces of artwork onto the streets below. \"These mounds are amazing!\" The Hyena thought to himself, looking forward to the next time he would mount one of these human structures. The third male was drooling at this point. He needed his release now! He quickly decided to fuck:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Frantically scanning the area, the Hyena quickly spotted the largest structure nearest to him. It was a massive warehouse, slightly outside the core of the city. He carelessly rushed over as fast as he could, leaving a much larger trail of destruction then the other two. His paw prints impacted much deeper into the ground, and smaller buildings were send flying, smashing into their neighboring structures. His penis couldn't be any harder! It flapped around wildly as the Hyena ran. His swollen testicles also flopped around in their tight sack, ready to blast out their load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warehouse he had picked was the cities main shipping facility. All of the various packages for the city were processed there before being sent off to get delivered to their respected owners. Inside contained endless rows of conveyor belts and heavy duty shelving. The building was chocked full of the citizens many online orders and other important mailed documents. Everything was being sorted with incredible accuracy, as even one misplaced parcel would bring everything to a screeching halt. Suddenly all of the packages began to vibrate, prompting the many workers to frantically try to keep them in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Hyena approached the building, he showed no signs of slowing down. He tore through the parking lot full of delivery vehicles and loaded trucks, spilling their contents everywhere as he smashed them with his paws. Still running, the Hyena used his forward momentum to shove this dick deep into the side of the building. His body flopping onto the roof, almost caving it in. Thousands of packages inside were instantly crushed by the males powerful tool. Many carefully placed and calibrated conveyor belts were sent flying as their bolts were torn from the ground. Various workers were crushed under falling shelving and heavy boxes. Those who survived had no choice but to witness all their organizational work go to waste as they tried to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't enough! The male needed more stimulation! Taking a page from his fellow clan-mate, he began to twist his hips, letting his dick flop around inside the structure. His penis tore through shelving unit after shelving unit, causing waves of pleasure to shoot through his entire body. The contents of the warehouse were either crushed under the Hyena's rod or sent flying in every direction. Precum was oozing rapidly, soaking any packages that had not been destroyed. His sexual fluids were so potent, that any packages touched by the precum had their contents permanently stained by his odor. The Hyena seemed hell bent on ensuring no citizen of the city would get their online orders. In reality, he had no idea of the magnitude of damage he was causing. Although, even if he knew, he had no reason to care about these insect's possessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male could finally feel his release approaching! Heavy amounts of drool started to drip from his mouth, leaking through the collapsing roof and onto the humans within trying to escape. The structure had sustained so much damage, it started to create moaning sounds, almost as if it was a female bracing itself for the males hot, sticky load! Edged on even further, the males mind was completely overtaken by pleasure. But, does something interrupt the males much needed release?: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She let out another whoop, signaling all the males to come join her. With great reluctance, the male pulls himself out of the defiled warehouse, having just missed his chance. He was desperate to have his orgasm, but he didn't dare ignore a order from the Matriarch. The male could feel his climax slightly fading as he walked over to the females location. His large erection bobbed side to side as he walked, still leaking potent pre on the buildings being crushed below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the female had finished having quite the fill of humans. Her belly was slightly swollen with the sheer number she had devoured. She could feel them wiggling within her, moving less and less as her digestive juices did their work. As the males made their way over to her, she sniffed the air. She was surprised to have noticed the strong sent of Hyena sperm. Looking at the start of the closest males current path of destruction, she noticed a building with a massive hole, leaking cum. \"Looks like the males found quite the use for the small creatures homes\", she amusingly thought to herself. This was quite handy for the female, as at times the horny males constant pestering did get annoying. She thought it was fantastic that the males could use the humans hives as a release to give her a break. Another reason to make this place their new home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the reason the Matriarch was calling the males over. She wanted them to help her claim this territory as theirs! There was no need to hunt or scavenge, as the millions of humans would provide an abundance of food. All they had to do was scare the humans out of a nearby hive, and then lap them all up. Sure the humans were small, but gobbling down a few thousand was roughly the same amount of meat as catching larger prey. Their insect like size also made her believe these creatures would repopulate fast enough to keep up with their appetites. \"I mean, ant eaters don't worry about running out of ants?\" the female thought to herself. In addition to the tasty humans, their was of course the added discovery that the males could use the buildings to release their sexual urges when she was not \"in the mood\". This place was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the males finally finished making their way to her, each leaving three fresh trails of devastation throughout the once pristine city. They lined up in front of the Matriarch, shoulder to shoulder, sitting obediently. Each Hyena casually crushing a different building under their behinds. She noticed two of the males had softening erections, but one male was still incredibly hard. He whined slightly as his penis drooled on the street below. This amused the female greatly. She walked over to his erection and began to sloppily lap at it. This increased the volume and pitch of the males whines significantly. The male felt his orgasm building up again, only to have her stop licking right as he was again on the cusp of cumming. She had purposely stopped to keep this male on edge. She could have pushed him over the finish, but she knew keeping the males slightly pent up like this, would provide her with bigger loads when they finally mated. She decided to save this males load for later, much to his displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the whining males saliva soaked boner, the female was about to instruct the males to start claiming this human city as their territory. What task does she give them:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The horny male following first, his eyes laser focused on the females pseudo-penis swinging between her legs. The path they were taking started to get tighter. They could feel the sides of buildings crumble as they squeezed by. Even their short, fluffy tails smashed into buildings as they were occasionally wagged. After many miles of crushed road later, the female stopped. She looked around to confirm she was perfectly in the center of the city. All around them were packed with tall skyscrapers, many of them double the height of the Hyenas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female then started to dig up the center of an intersection. Her paws easily tore through the asphalt. Having marked the area to dig, the males quickly took over. The three males surrounded the spot, each at a third interval to each other. The horny male was actually thankful for a monotonous task, as this would distract him from his lustful urges. The males started vigorously digging away, their paws ripping up massive chunks of road. The debris was sent flying under their bellies. It crashed into the surrounding buildings and killed anyone in its path. Offices, condos and stores all had massive chunks of debris lodged into them. It did not take long for the males to uncover an underground subway station, which they simply dug through without care. They sent chunks of the station and trains flying, not to mention ended the lives of all the riders. It only took moments for the once untouched section of city to look like a war zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happily watched the males continue their work. Being a clever and intelligent Hyena, the female had strategically picked this spot, and it was more then just easy access to food. She had noticed the small humans made a shrieking noise when a creature smashed into their homes or crushed them under paw. By placing their new burrow in the middle of the human's hive, they surrounded themselves with the humans structures. This meant if another creature was trying to sneak up and attack the Hyenas, the human's cries would alert the clan of the danger. For example, if a Lion decided to sneak up on their burrow, they would hear the humans cry out as they were crushed under the Lions paws. This would alert the group to the invaders presence, allowing them to counter attack. Humans, while not very smart, were sure useful, she thought to herself.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the female suddenly thought of an issue with her plan. These small insect creatures seem easily spooked and like to flee, even if it means into danger (or a hungry Hyena maw). Digging the den is sure to kill countless humans. What if that causes them all to run away from this hive and start another elsewhere? The Matriarch wouldn't stand for that! She decided to work on fixing this problem, leaving the males to continue digging the burrow. Her plan to stop the humans from escaping the city is:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The female began to casually stroll away from the males, leaving them to their work. She opted to walk along a different \"path\" in between the human structures, which led to a fresh part of the city. The Hyena found the roadways quite convenient, compared to slogging through the buildings. \"These trails must have been carved out by the past animals that fed on these creatures\", she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite walking along a road and taking a less destructive route then the males, the female still left quite an \"impact\" on the city. Road surfaces shattered, building's facades cracked and hundreds of cars as well as humans were flattened. Surprisingly, she wanted to keep the damage to the humans somewhat minimal, since they would be serving as the clans food source. But the destruction caused by simply walking around couldn't be helped, the humans would just have to deal with it. \"These creatures probably won't take long to adjust to our presence\" she said to herself, casually slicing an apartment building in half with her tail as she continued on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took quite a bit of walking, but the female finally noticed that the size and frequency of the human mounds were becoming smaller and fewer, giving way to more natural looking plant life and rock. She stopped and sat down, surveying the area. She had traversed to the outskirts of the city. Looking back, the Hyena could see smoke rising from her destruction, clearly marking the path she took. The paw prints the female left were very deep, rendering the entire road completely unusable for the humans. She could also just barely see the raised behinds of the three male Hyenas, still digging out the den in the cities core. A massive skyscraper near them suddenly started to crumble and collapse, killing hundreds and burying more. This was no doubt a result of the males somewhat messy antics. \"Oh well, at least the den will be completed by tonight\", she thought to herself. The female casually dismissed the destruction, they couldn't live without a den!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyena then looks to her side, seeing many different paths leading out of the city. She would need to somehow block these paths to prevent the humans from escaping. The female hadn't seen any humans with wings when she was gobbling them down, so she wouldn't have to worry about them \"flying away\". Looking at the nearest path, she could see it was full of those small colorful crunchy objects that seemed to litter the pathways. Except this time they were on the move! The highway ahead of her was packed with vehicles trying to evacuate the city, just as she had predicted. The female let out a giggle, how dare they try to escape! She raced over to the motorway, destroying all in her wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the road were desperate. They had seen and felt the destruction happening to their beloved city, and were fleeing for their lives. Suddenly, they felt the ground shake. The vibrations caused multiple cars to lose control, colliding with each other. The female Hyena leaped, diving her front paws onto the motorway. She instantly crushed multiple vehicles and their drivers. She continued to stomp the escapees mercilessly, growling as if trying to say \"Grr! I'm scary, time to go back and stay in your burrows\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people tried to floor it, thinking they could still manage their escape. Unfortunately, in their hasty actions, they failed to notice the ten foot deep paw print that lay ahead of them. Vehicles crashed head first into the pit the Hyena had made. Before they could even attempt climbing out, the female slammed back down, mushing them to paste. Predictably, the majority of the humans who hadn't been killed by the onslaught, turned around and raced back to the city. The Hyena was once again pleased with how easy it was to manipulate these dumb creatures. She was also happy to see those who tried to traverse her paw print get trapped in them, confirming this path was now blocked for the humans. She made sure to crush any of the survivors still trying to escape. The female didn't want any getting out and attracting other animals to the Hyena's territory. Once she ensured all survivors were killed, she trotted off to destroy the next roadway. Even her paw prints on the countryside between roads were deep enough to make escape impossible for even the best off road vehicles, or even on foot. She had also unknowingly crushed multiple railroad lines, not even feeling the tracks bend out of shape under her paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female continued on her way, ripping up the countryside, stomping out the roadways and scaring the humans back into the city. She always made sure to crush a healthy amount, using them as an example to scare back the other humans. Any stubborn humans that failed to turn around were quickly snuffed out. Does the female run into anything interesting as she lays waste to the cities perimeter? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She needed a rest, and possibly, a good fuck. The males should just be about done digging the den. The Hyena began to make her way back to the males, stomping through yet another untouched section of city. In her tired state, she was not in the mood to reduce her destructive impact on the humans. She had opted to simply cut through the odd building to shorten her path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the females work was not in vain. She had successfully destroyed all the cities escape routes!  Many people had  attempted escape again after the female moved on to the next motorway. These humans were thwarted once more, as they found the road covered in pawprints much deeper then their entire vehicle. Even traveling within the city itself was becoming more difficult. Any road the female or the other males had trotted on within the city was turned into a crater-y mess, and was completely undrivable. This sealed the fate of the humans, as escape was now impossible! Her work had also unknowingly knocked down all communication lines, so their was no way for the city to call for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight was just about approaching. To the females surprise, she noticed the human structures were glowing. \"Probably using some kind of bioluminescence\", she thought. The female did appreciate how this made it easier to navigate paths. Although it was annoying how the lights went out so easily once she stomped on them. After once again reducing the amount of untouched city, the female finally arrived back where she had left the males. Only a large clothing store stood in her way, which she lazily plowed through. The Hyena was too tired to find a way around at this point! Their was of course no harm in creating a few shortcuts. Looking forward the female could see the finished product of the males work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area had been devastated. Entire chunks of skyscraper had been sent crashing into other buildings. Hundreds of tons of debris had been flung, burying massive parts of the city. Tens of thousands of people ended up being killed, and many more were injured. Despite the damage to the local human ecology, the female was quite happy with the males work! The den consisted of a large opening in the ground. Inside, the males had hollowed out a small cave like structure, which was more then enough room for the entire clan to fit. Roughly a full city block was wiped out to create the entrance. Many of the once tall 100 story buildings were leveled to make room. The buildings that stood on the surface of the hollowed out area were mostly intact, only sustaining various cracks and fissures. However, the males digging had also unknowingly severed various underground water, electricity, phone and internet lines, which cut off those utilities for large chunks of the city. This further made life more unpleasant for the humans populous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clan lined up, ready to greet each other in the traditional Hyena fashion. The female, still standing in the ruins of the clothing store, raised a hind leg. The closest male quickly approached her, keeping his head down to show submission. He began to lick the females pseudo-penis, while also raising his hind leg for her. She also began to work over the males penis with her tongue. Both genitals were soon coated in drool. She whoops to call over the second male, repeating the same process. Sounds of their wet licks could be heard all throughout the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the third males turn. He quickly rushed over to her as soon has he was signaled. He lapped eagerly, loving every second of having the females scent and taste overwhelm his nose and mouth. His penis was far more erect then during the other two males greeting. She thoroughly worked his swollen penis over, giving it great sloppy licks from the base, all the way to the bulbous tip. She could feel it twitching greatly! Once again, she pushed him quite close to release, only to pull her tongue away. The male whined, he couldn't take much more of this teasing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whoop she told the three males to go ravish the city for food. She decided to instruct them about only walking on paths and keeping overall destruction to a minimum later. Tonight she will let them have their fun. They earned it after digging out such a nice den! She was still full from overeating before, so she was not interested in food. Two of the males instantly took off, ripping through multiple buildings. The destruction causes everyone in that area to evacuate into the streets, which made them easy pickings for the Hyenas to simply lap up. Despite scarfing down mouthful after mouthful, they actually ended up crushing more humans then they swallowed. The third male still stood in front of the Matriarch. He was also hungry, but a different hunger had overtaken him. His dick was still hard as a rock, drooling precum into the street below. He looked right at the female and whined in submission, hoping she would give in and finally have sex. Sighing, the female decides to: </span></div></div>",

She was purposely guiding him away from the area where the other two males were feasting. She wanted to avoid the other males trying to join in and mount her. She was in the mood for receiving just one load. Although, judging from the sounds of the pent up males whines, it is going to be extra large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male was completely infatuated. He could barely pay attention to anything around him. He almost tripped a couple of times as he trampled over various small structures without notice. The female could hear the heavy destruction behind her, but once again chose to ignore it. She still had to teach the males about keeping damage to the humans and their structures to a minimum. She did not care about helping the humans, she only wanted to keep them to use as a source of food. She looked behind her, just in time to see him smash through a shopping center, completely distracted. His eyes were still lazily focused on her backside. \"It's not like he's in any position to listen anyway\" she thought to herself slightly amused. She then continued onward, with the male quickly following, tearing through even more buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking a random area of the city, the female ended up leading the male to the untouched financial district. Tall, modern looking buildings stood all around them, coming up to about their heads. Each one representing a major bank or investment firm. The buildings were actually still decently full of humans. The employees were told not to leave, as their were reports of a disaster happening in the downtown core. The area was quiet, well it was, until a crashing sound filled the air. The male had run into one of the tall buildings, ripping through half of it like tissue paper. He didn't even break line of sight with the female as he tore through. He also didn't even notice the structure collapse behind him, killing all within.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTrying to ignore the mess the male was making, she looked around. They were both quite hidden by the buildings in the area. They were also a decent distance away from the other two male Hyenas. She could see great pillars of smoke rising from the region of city that the males were in. They were continuing to indulge on humans and laying waste to the city. She could just barely hear the human cries as they were gobbled up. The females observations were quickly interrupted as she felt a sloppy lick against her genitals. This caused her to snap back at the male, barring her jaws. She was the one in charge here! The male immediately backed down in submission. With the male put in his place, and the fact they were in the perfect location to mate, the female got things started. With a grunt the female proceeded to lower her head to the ground, feeling a few vehicles get crushed under her bottom jaw. She then raised her rump slightly, aimed right at the pent up male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the male finally get to mount her or are they interrupted?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sight and scent almost made his twitching shaft cum right then and there! He was so excited he quickly rushed to the female and attempted to mount her. But in his excitement and nervousness, the male quickly slipped off her side, crashing into another building. The humans inside screamed as their vision was filled with Hyena fur, seconds before it smashed into them. Quickly shaking off the rubble and dead humans of the now leveled building, the male had a second attempt. This time he was able to fully get in position and mount her. Unfortunately, the male was now struggling to get his penis inserted. Hyena sex was quite awkward, and this was no exception!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male began to thrust in hopes of inserting into her lovely pseudo-penis. These motions began to inadvertently push the female forward, causing them to both walk a few steps. The females mighty paws easily tore through a few more of the financial district buildings that stood in her way. At this point she was so horny, she couldn't care less. The males sharp and fidgety movements also caused heavy vibrations, collapsing a few more buildings. Finally after much crushing, thrusting, and lots of spilled pre, the male finally enters the females flaccid pseudo-penis. This causes both creatures to cry out loudly, shattering all nearby windows and human eardrums. Almost immediately after penetrating, he blasts load after load into her. The excess began to spill out, flooding streets with his creamy goodness. After a few more splurts, the male rested himself onto the females back and began to lovingly lick in between her shoulders. He was in absolute ecstasy. The female simply panted happily, it felt great getting filled up by such a pent up male! The female then wondered if she would be having pups soon. With so much easy to catch prey, offspring could learn to feed themselves in no time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male finally pulled himself free with a rather loud \"squelch\", causing both Hyenas to grunt. The entire area now reeked heavily of Hyena lovemaking. This was much to the dismay of the humans taking shelter in buildings with blasted out windows. Although they didn't have long to cough and gag. With a whoop the female gave permission to the male to finally eat. With his sex drive finally fulfilled, he realized just how hungry he was! The male opted to simply scarf down the remaining survivors of the financial district, leveling the remaining buildings in doing so. The female simply sprawled out, casually crushing many vehicles, and watched the male. She could see hoards of screaming humans get scared out of hiding in their pathetically weak structures, only to get lapped up and disappear down the male Hyenas throat. \"These creatures are truly the most stupid and pathetic I've ever seen\", the female thought to herself. \"Oh well, at least they taste good\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the male had his fill, both Hyenas left the area. The financial district was barely recognizable, all that remain were crushed debris, paw prints, and pools of cum. They both made their way back to the den, finding the other two males waiting at the entrance. Their mouths and paws were coated in the red remains of crushed humans. The three males follow the female into the den, where they all finally went to sleep. The day had been very fun and exciting for the Hyenas! On the other hand, it was a living nightmare for the humans. Sperm still leaked from buildings the males had violated, many sections of city had been laid to waste and a large chunk of the population was currently being digested alive in the Hyenas stomachs. But worst of all, their was no escape and the Hyenas were soon going to be ready for another exciting day! Do the Hyena sleep peacefully or are they interrupted?   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning sun rose over the city. It's warm rays shined onto the buildings, waking up the terrified humans within. The citizens had barely slept, many of them trying in vain to call for help outside the city or had been driving around all night to try and find an intact road to escape. Eventually all the humans realized their plans had been thwarted by the clever female Hyena. All they could do now is take shelter in various buildings and pray they would be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunlight eventually made its way into the Hyena's den. The female was the first to wake. She walked out and stood in what was once a main intersection of the city. She let out a whoop, which woke the three males. They quickly exited the den and joined the female outside. They were excited for another fun day! Still groggy, the males let out various stretches and yawns. One male stretched out in the typical canine fashion, letting his front legs rest flat onto the ground. His behind was also stretched outwards, right up against a nearby building! The humans inside screamed as his fluffy butt smashed into the side of their apartment building. People living on that side of the structure were instantly crushed. The Hyena stretched out further, destroying more units as he dug in deeper. Even his musky testicles caused destruction, as each one smash through the lower floors as if they were wrecking balls! With half the building caved in, the Hyena pulled back from his stretch. The damage was too great, the building moaned and collapsed, killing any survivors that the Hyena had not smothered. He wasn't even aware of the destruction and deaths he had caused, he was too focused on the nice feeling of stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Matriarch on the other hand had definitely taken notice. She yelped as she observed the building collapse. \"What a shame, another hive of tasty humans lost\", she thought to herself. She then decided now would be the perfect time to lay down the new rules to her clan about keeping the damage to the humans at a minimum. Otherwise, knowing the males rowdy antics, the city would be wiped out before the days end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whoop, she told the males to line up. The three males immediately stopped what they were doing and submissively sat in front of the female. With a series of whoops, grunts, snarls and whines, the female roughly communicated her new orders about not letting humans go to waste, to ensure they have a healthy stock to fill their bellies. The males would have to now only walk on the paths (roads) instead of plowing through blocks of city. They would also need to scare the humans out of the buildings to feed on them, not tear the whole thing down. The female figured the more of the hives they left in tact, the faster the humans would repopulate. She then gave a quick example of this, the female walked up to a nearby untouched building and rested her foreleg on it. She rubbed the top of the building, causing the entire thing to sway. Cracks formed and windows shattered all along the structure. The people inside had no choice but to evacuate, as they feared the building was going to crumble ontop of them. The female simply smirked as predictably, humans started to flee outside the entrance. She simply lapped up the group of people and swallowed them whole. She then removed her paw, saving the building and the remaining humans inside for later. The males observed her intently, taking the new information in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hyena animal language and examples can only go so far, as it was impossible for her to communicate specific details. She would simply reprimand the males if they mistakenly caused too much destruction. Sure that would mean many humans would die in the learning process, but the female saw this as necessary and was unbothered by it. With the males mostly caught up to speed, the clan decides to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The female let out a whoop. It was an instruction to the clan that they would soon scout out their new territory as a group. She wanted to get a \"lay of the land\". Making note where the largest deposits of buildings resided and getting an idea of the size of their human \"livestock\". Also giving the area a good marking wouldn't hurt. Gaining more information about the layout would also help them when it came to defending their territory from other giant animals. Although, the humans probably saw the Hyenas as anything but protectors!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female looked around for a direction to lead her clan. In one direction was the chard remains of city that the two males had left after their feast from the previous night. Looking elsewhere, she could see the large trail of destruction that the clan had carved out when they first entered the city. Everything appeared to be as wrecked as they had left it. \"These creatures are sure slow to repair the damage to their homes\" the Matriarch thought to herself, out of slight concern. She was starting to get worried that the food supply of these small creatures might run out much faster then she anticipated.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer brief thought was suddenly disrupted by a wet, squelching sound. She turned over to see one of the male sloppily licking himself as he was waiting for her command. A large, thick string of drool went from his mouth to his now drenched penis. Seeing this primal act helped interrupt her worry. The female simply shook her fur, almost as if to clear her mind of negative thoughts. The vast majority of the \"hives\" in this place were still untouched, and full of tasty morsels! She was an amazing leader and had nothing to worry about! She might even indulge one of the other males this evening, as she had done last night, as a slight reward to herself. With this new resolve, she excitingly picked an untarnished section of city, which had yet to have a single paw print stomped onto it. With a loud whoop she commanded the clan onward. The males quickly set off in that direction, with the female following closely behind. Seeing the view right in front of her, the female took a quick cheeky sniff of the testicles of whichever male happened to be ahead of her. The male grunted as she did so. The previous males little licking show had gotten her slightly in the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the females intentions of preserving the humans and their structures, the clan was still creating massive amounts of damage. Despite only sticking to roads as the female had commanded, simply passing through left the streets devastated. Similar to the females romp to the outskirts of the city, she was unconcerned with this \"small\" amount of destruction. Roads were made undrivable from the massive paw prints, vehicles were flattened into sheet metal. Streetlights were torn down and fire hydrants gushed water. Buildings, while still standing, were damaged by an occasional wagging tail or muscular leg, if the road became too tight. Even a flopping penis, pseudo or not, would occasionally smash itself against a building. Various belongings inside the humans homes were also ruined, as many fragile objects crashed onto the ground from the vibrations of the clans stomping paws.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe terrified citizens had no choice but to stay hidden, taking shelter in whatever buildings they had found themselves in. Some people were lucky enough to have been in their homes when the Hyenas first entered the city. However, many other citizens were stuck in various stores and businesses, not able to make it home. This essentially meant almost every building in the city had at least some amount of humans hiding inside.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe female had been slightly distracted by her renewed spirit, lewd thoughts and a few more quick naughty sniffs she had given to the male in front of her. She then realized something, she had to make sure the males stuck to her rules about not trashing buildings! Despite her personal confidence and her complete dominance as the Matriarch, she knew the males could be typical boneheads. Sometimes they would slack off and \"conveniently\" forget some of her orders. So far the males seemed to be acting in line. How do the males behave for the rest of their trip?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted! Something catches their attention and they begin plowing through buildings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are still trying to follow her orders, but not without a few innocent \"accidents\"</span></div></div>",

This now meant their destructive impact spread to a few blocks worth of roads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the males were actually causing slightly less destruction then the female! Usually at least one building or so received some form of damage as the female tried to carefully walk by. This of course was not the females fault.

While he didn't dare question the Matriarchs commands, he longed to go back to simply plowing through buildings, not carefully stepping around them! The crunch feeling they made underpaw was so satisfying and he wanted to feel it again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he tried to get the feeling back by purposefully stomping on every vehicle he came across. Sure they went crunch as he flattened them, but sadly it just wasn't the same. The humans watched in horror as the massive Hyena went out of his way to destroy their vehicular property. The male then tried to push his luck. He purposely rubbed his thigh against a nearby building as he walked by, in an attempt to get that \"crunch\" feeling back. The side of the building easily gave way and crumbled, causing the humans inside to flee deeper into the structure. Luckily for his sake, the female took no notice to this, only assuming it was just usual collateral damage of romping through. The feeling was better, but was still no where near as satisfying as he would have hoped. Plus if he did it too many times, the female might catch on to his \"purposeful\" accidents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to give up, the Hyena noticed something promising up ahead. There lay a few buildings that were much shorter in height then anything else he had seen in the city. They were small specialty shops towering only one story, about the height of a paw. To him, it looked as if those buildings were just \"sprouting\". The male easily convinced himself that the Matriarch must not care about these small, puny structures. Heck, they were barely as tall as the multiple buses he had crushed on the way there and she had no problems with that. The Hyena decided to indulge a bit.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs he approached, the male began to veer to that side of the street where the shops resided. He stopped and gingerly raised his paw over one of the shops. Dirt and other debris rained down on the buildings roof as he flexed his paw. With a grunt, the Hyena simply stomped down on the shop, destroying the entire thing under one paw. He then continued with the next one, then the one after that. The people hiding in each shop inside felt great vibrations, as well as dreadful crashing sounds. They didn't even have a chance to attempt escape as the roofs caved in on them, followed by a large dirty Hyena paw. With only a few steps, the Hyena left multiple stores gutted, including a hipster hair salon, coffee shop and a trendy clothing store. The male groaned quietly to himself, as the familiar feeling of crushing brick, metal and wood filled his paws. The male was quite pleased with the treat he gave himself. He happily spotted more small shops just ahead and prepared to use them in a similar manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing faint human screams and more destruction then usual, the female Matriarch looked over to the street that the male was on. She quickly took notice to the many small buildings that had been converted to nothing more then a pawprint. Contrary to the males assumption, the female DID care about those structures. Her feral mind had also imagined those small shops as some kind of budding growth, but she also envisioned them growing and blossoming into full blown buildings, chocked full of fresh tasty humans! Seeing this purposeful damage made the Matriarch quite pissed! She barged over to the road the guilty male was treading on. The female herself caused quite a bit of destruction as she rushed over, as she accidentally tore the entire side of a hotel off with her large body. However, she was too angry at the male to care. Once she was face to face with the male, she let out large angry snarls! The sound echoed around the city. The countless humans hiding in the nearby buildings cowered in fear as their windows vibrated! The male began to tremble and whimper greatly. He quickly scurried back to the center of the road. In his panic, he ended up sending the debris of the stomped out stores flying into other nearby buildings. The female continued to snarl in his direction, driving the point home. The male clearly got the message, he won't be trying to push his luck any time soon. He'll have to make due with just crushing vehicles. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs the Matriarch was reprimanding that clan mate, the second male was also getting himself into mischief.

He had heard some commotion and even jolted slightly when he heard the Matriarch snarl. The Hyena quickly realized a different male was being reprimanded. It was scary stuff and he was sure glad he wasn't the one in trouble!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe male turned himself to get a better view of what was happening. Sometimes it was hard to look away when a clam-mate was being punished. Depending on how pissed the Matriarch was, a decent sized fight might even break out! As he simply turned his body in the direction of the commotion, he felt the asphalt road, some streetlights and a few parked vehicles get decimated under his paws. As he did his best to aligned his body on the fairly straight road, he felt the flat edge of something tickle his backside.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nCurious, the male dropped his head and looked underneath his legs to see what it was. Behind his hanging cock and balls, he could see that it was the edge of an office building. The edge of its roof happened to be the exact height of his behind. It cracked slightly as he rubbed against it. The feeling reminded the Hyena of the nice warm rocks he would rest himself on back at his home on the savanna. The building behind him looked to be a perfectly sized substitute to rest on! He figured his fellow clam-mates reprimanding could take a while, he might as well take a seat and watch the show.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Hyena widened his hind legs as he began to back up over the building. Crashing could be heard from either side of the structure as the Hyenas thick paws widened the alleyways. Soon the top of the building was being covered with his fluffy behind. His greasy genitals began to drag across the top of the structure. Even the reinforced concrete was no match for his goods, as the roof began to crack and cave in slightly. His genitals finally came to a rest on the center of the roof.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA large rooftop air conditioning unit was also an unknown victim of the Hyenas actions. The large metal object was easily torn off the roof and flattened by the Hyenas left testicle. Apart from the expensive destruction, his actions also meant the ventilation shafts were now exposed. The cool refreshing air was quickly replaced with the odor of his privates and butt hole. The fragrance soon slipped into every part of the building, giving the occupance quite a \"treat\". The humans inside were left coughing and gagging. Their eyes watered so much that those trying to escape weren't even able to navigate their way outside the building!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHowever, its not like those humans had a chance to escape anyway. After a bit of shifting around, the Hyena soon felt his butt was comfortable. Suddenly, he began to fold his hind legs and carelessly apply the weight from his body onto the building below, as if he was sitting on a simple rock from back home. Unfortunately, despite the building looking and even feeling \"rock like\", it certainly was not as strong as one. The building crumbled as if it was made of sand and the sound of crashing could be heard all around. Floor after floor caved in, with the Hyenas penis and balls plowing through first. At least in those human's final moments, they got the answer to what was reeking. Before the Hyena could even react, his bottom was resting on the ground. The once untouched building was now completely flattened under his rump. All that remained was the unrecognizable debris under his butt and the cloud of dust that rose all around him. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe males entire body soon filled with dread.

Her eyes went wide as she took in the site of the male sitting on a flattened building! She furiously rushed over to his location, snarling loudly! She ripped right through the few buildings that stood in her way. In her fury, she actually ended up causing more destruction then the male just did, but she was too furious to care. She began to violently snarl at the male, snapping her jaws right in his face! The male Hyena began to shake and giggle in fear. He had really messed up! He quickly got up from his butt shaped crater and started running up the road. The angry Matriarch followed after him, continuing to snarl. She wasn\u2019t letting him off the hook that easily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male Hyena soon sensed he was being chased. This frightened him even further! In his fear, the Hyena completely lost control of his blatter! Hot, green stinking liquid rocketed out of the tip of his penis. It loudly landed with a splatter on the street below. As he continued running, his penis flopped around, spraying the urine everywhere! It was enough to flood the entire street! The stinking liquid quickly overloaded the streets sewers. The piss, having no where else to go, flowed inside the nearby apartments and condos. It crashed into the first floor and then flooded the basement levels. The corrosive properties of the piss easily dissolved all those it came into contact with, even before they had a chance to drown! Beyond the destruction to the first floor and basement units, the piss also had another effect that caused misery to those in the rest of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strong stench worked its way upwards, stinking up every suite. Every square inch of those buildings were now permanently stained with the putrid odor. The humans coughed and gagged, as all their homes were stunk up by his smelly liquid. The humans cursed, wanting the smell to stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for a few \u201cfortunate\u201d humans, they didn\u2019t have long to suffer with the smell. As the angry female stomped after the running male, her vibrations rocked the pissed logged buildings. That, along with the heavy damaged foundation caused a few not as well constructed buildings to collapse into a pile of pissed stained rubble! One after another, those weaker buildings collapsed as the female ran by. Although, once again, she was too focused on the males punishment to notice her destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down, the third male was watching the commotion of both his clanmates getting reprimanded. He couldn\u2019t believe how easily the other males had messed up! Now the Matriarch was going to be in a bad mood. Suddenly, he had a great idea! He would not only impress the Matriarch by following her orders perfectly, but go even beyond that and show off how skilled he could be without damaging anything! He bet she would be so impressed, she would allow him to mate with her again! Drooling onto the pavement as he imagined mounting her, what feat does he attempt?</span></div></div>",

It had to not only be an impressive trick, but also without seriously damaging any of the humans and their fragile hives. As he thought and continued walking, he spotted a tall building up ahead. It was twice his height and about the same thickness as his body. The building was the head office of a massive corporation. It was so large, the structure took up the entire width of the city block. It was chocked full of hundreds of employees, who had been taking shelter in their offices since the Hyena clan had invaded. Upon seeing the massive glass structure surrounded by two paths, an idea soon formulated in the Hyenas mind. He would jump from one path, over the human \u201cmound\u201d and then land safely on the other side without damaging anything! If he timed it right, he could preform this trick right as the female was walking on the opposite path, he would impressively land right in front of her! He excitingly ran down the road to get into position, creating all kinds of destruction as he rushed over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the rest of the clan had walked much further ahead as the third male was briefly formulating his plan. The first male had his head down, still slightly on edge from the females snarls. The second male was finally able to slow down from running as the female had given up her chase. He too was still tense after his punishment, but at least he felt nice with an empty bladder. Every little bit of unavoidable damage the two males caused as they walked along, made them flinch slightly. They kept bracing, thinking the female was going to come barrelling down at them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBy this point, the female was quite in a sour mood. Sure these human mounds were fragile, but was it so hard not to wreck everything insight! Sometimes males can be so hard headed! She hoped she didn't have to deal with any more of their \"accidents\". She walked along her own road, almost to keep the other males out of her mind. She didn't realize it, but her mood actually caused her to create more damage then usual. Entire facades of structures caved in, the asphalt road shattered and vehicles were kicked and lodged into buildings as she angrily stomped along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally catching up with the clan, the third male had made it right in front of the building in question. Getting ready for his jump, the Hyena turned perpendicular to the opposite road. He felt his fluffy tail rip through the restaurant behind him. He felt the front store windows shatter as his tail ripped through and crushed everything and everyone inside. Scared, he frantically looked around, but luckily the Matriarch was not on his street to notice his little mishap. Relieved, he then looked up at the tall structure. It seemed a lot bigger close up! He started to get nervous, not sure if he could jump that high! He stood there worrying for a bit. His thoughts were then interrupted by the feeling of heavy stomps... THE FEMALE! He realized he was supposed to be timing this trick perfectly and he had no idea were she was! Luckily, the first males tail had smashed a hole into a neighboring building has he had previously walked by. This gave the third male a view of the opposite road. Through it, he could see the female was already in position! He had to jump right now! Having no more time to second guess himself, the Hyena focused and jumped upwards with all his might!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the outcome of his little impressive stunt?</span></div></div>",

The Hyena was soon sailing through the air! His jump carried him higher and higher until his body was over the tall building! He looked like he was going to make it! Unfortunately, the Hyena was about to learn just how little grip shattered asphalt has to offer. With no more momentum to carry him, the Hyena soon felt himself falling back towards the earth, with the building squarely underneath him! His eyes went wide as he realized he was about to completely belly flop on top of the fragile structure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe occupants inside the building were frightened at the massive creature as it stared at them. They had no idea all their lives were being risked, for the simple act of impressing a female Hyena. Since they had backed away from the windows in fear, the humans only heard what was happening. They listened to a massive crashing sound, followed by a great \"whoosh\" outside the building. After a few short seconds of silence, a devastating sound of destruction was heard at the top of the building. The top brass CEO was the first to go, followed by the other executives and then eventually the office workers. Each level's occupants saw their roof collapsing in on them, before everything went black. The destruction then continued its way to the next floor, repeating the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyena could only yelp as he felt everything getting crushed under him. He heard more and more crashing until finally he landed on the ground with a great \"thud\". His legs lay sprawled out and he was laying on his belly. Great dust clouds were kicked up everywhere! As the dust cleared, the male just laid there, in complete horrific shock of what just happened. He looked down under his belly and whined as he realized the entire building and all its humans had been completely pancaked under him. He couldn't even feel any survivors squirming! His trick was a complete failure... and he had ruined such a healthy looking hive full of juicy humans... So much for impressing the Matriarch! The Hyena suddenly felt a chill travel down his spine. He also sensed the presents of a piercing stare looking right at him. Slowly, he looked upwards, only to lock eyes with the Matriarch staring down at him!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe was in the exact position on the opposite road like he was expecting. Although instead of being impressed, she was standing over him, staring with a complete shocked, rage filled gaze! The other two males had looked over when they heard the loud crashing noise. Both were slightly giddy when they saw what had happened. A mess up that bad and the female would forget about being angry at them! They both continued looking at the Matriarch and third male, they were like siblings waiting to see how a family member would get punished. Both males took this brief opportunity to settle down and watch, while also causing a bit of purposeful destruction. They knew the Matriarch was going to be too pissed at their third clan mate to notice. The first male got the chance to give a decent sized looking supermarket a good stomp. He savored the moment, as he very much knew his actions were not allowed. He ended up ruining multiple tons of food supply that the nearby humans were hoping to eat. The second male was once again crushing a tall building with his behind, only this time it was on purpose. He ground his butt and genitals on the flattened wreckage, almost as if to get some kind of revenge on the humans for the punishment he had received from the Matriarch. \"That's what you get for not holding my weight\" the second Hyena thought to himself, as his rubbing butt carelessly smashed into the sides of neighboring buildings. Lucky for them both, the Matriarch did not notice their naughty antics.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Matriarch continued simply looking right into the third males eyes, giving him a good stare down. Part of her was completely furious, wanting to rough him up right then and there as punishment! However, another part of her recognize that he had been at least trying to follow her orders, unlike the other two. She had seen him making an effort to jump over the building instead of plowing through it. Meanwhile the third male simply kept lying there, frozen in fear, almost dousing the remains of the humans and structure with his urine. She took a deep breath and made her decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, all the female did was let out a weak snarl. This caused the male to quickly jump up to his feet. He slowly backed away from the mighty Matriarch, all while whining and giggling in submission. He could tell he was getting off the hook easily and didn't dare do anything to further upset her. He quickly ran back onto the road, not even bothering to shake off the debris from the building he had crushed. Chunks of concrete and dead humans fell from his body, leaving a trail behind him. The female scoffed slightly, she knew something that simple was all it took to reprimand the third clanmate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two males were in shock just how easily he was let off the hook! They then broke into a slight panic, realizing the Matriarch was now coming their way! They assumed she was going to take a lot longer with the punishment, and now both males had to quickly hide their recent naughty destruction to the city. The first male used his paws to bury the stomped remains of the supermarket. He ended up greatly damaging the nearby stores as he did so. The second male quickly got up from his \"seat\". His behind and privates were covered in the debris of the building he had just crushed. He knew doing the traditional canine shake would make too much noise, as he would be scattering the chunks of building that were stuck to his fur. Thinking quickly, he decided to wipe off his behind on the building across the street. The action was successful in cleaning his behind and balls, but he ended up inadvertently ripping the entire front facade off that building. Luckily for both Hyena's, despite their hastened and messy actions to cover up the evidence, the Matriarch ended up not noticing their bad behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of the female's reprimanding, there were no more major \"accidents\" along the way to their destination. Nothing more then the usual crashing of tarmac, flattening of cars and smashing of windows with tails. This put the Matriarch in a much better mood, as she felt the males finally got the message through their thick skulls. After a bit more stomping, the clan arrived at a new district of the city. In what state do they find the area in?</span></div></div>",

She didn't notice any pawprints or knocked down buildings. That was one positive thing about the humans fragile structures, it was very easy to tell if an animal had passed through. However, looking upwards, she noticed something different. There were multiple birds flying around the area. They were of various types of species you would find on a Savanna, some were quite colorful while others were only dark shades. To the Hyenas, these birds were regularly sized, but to the humans they were giant flying monsters! The birds had come through a portal earlier that day and were trying to adapt to their new environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Matriarch looked up and observed the birds. Quite a few of the flying creatures were landing on the tops and sides of skyscrapers. Their talons easily dug into the faces of the buildings as if they were made of sand. The birds then proceeded to pick at the windows, smashing their beaks inward. After a bit of digging and crashing around, they would pull out a human! The small human struggled and cried out within the bird's grasp. The bird simply flicked its head backwards, sending the human down in-between its beak. Once the bird gobbled them down, they repeated the process, leaving a trail of massive gashes in the buildings. They were picking the humans out as if they were bugs hiding in trees! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans inside the buildings tried their best to run away from the areas that the birds were pecking on. However, the birds were smart and quick enough to change pecking locations to where the humans had moved to. To the birds, the humans were way easier to feed on then any bugs they had encountered in the past! A few male birds were even grabbing multiple humans at a time. They held them firmly in their beaks as they flew off to an awaiting female, who was sitting on top of a nearby building. The male bird would then lovingly drop the flailing group of humans into the females beak, where she would swallow them down. The Matriarch knew those bird couples would be creating a nest soon and then get to mating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans who were swallowed by the birds, ended up dying a very painful death. Those who survived the bird's stomach were grounded up alive within the birds gizzard. Besides causing the humans pain and suffering, the bird's digestive system was also very effective at digesting the humans quite quickly. Despite only starting to snack on the humans a short while ago, many birds were already raising their tails and squirting out what was once humans as white liquidy bird poop. The waste was strong enough to shatter through windows. The poo also left massive white streaks all over the entire length of some buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the birds feasting on the humans and nesting in their territory, what does the Matriarch decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Back in their home on the Savanna, the clan would often see birds nesting in the trees within their territory. If they weren't a problem back then, why should it be any different now? Besides even if they scared the birds away, they would just flock back after the Hyenas left this section of city. The Matriarch also realized, if the Hyena clan did end up consuming all the humans in the hive, they could turn to eating these birds instead! This made her feel more at ease, at least she had a back-up plan if their human supply ran dry. This was extra important, especially after all the destruction the males had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyena was grateful it was only harmless birds the clan had found in this section of city. However, seeing how easily the birds had showed up, she was getting worried at other, more dangerous, animal's would soon start making their way in. The humans were easy pickings and she was sure any animal that wandered close wouldn't hesitate to make a meal of them. The Matriarch then thought back to the Lion pride the clan had briefly encountered the previous day. At the rate those Lions were eating and destroying, they would have definitely finished \"consuming\" their human hive and would be on a hunt for another! They needed to get scent marking ASAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female knew she had to command the males to get those anal glands ready! They would have this whole place stunk up in no time! Right as she was about to open her mouth, a slight bit of debris sprinkled onto her head. This of course didn't hurt, but it was enough to distract her to look upwards. There, she saw a rather large bird smash into an office building, pluck roughly a dozen screaming humans and then fly off. \"At least they don't eat much\", she thought to herself, slightly amused. She figured only one of her mouthfuls was more humans then multiple birds could ever hope to eat! She then imagined herself swallowing a maw full of tasty humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Matriarch felt her stomach growl. Seeing the birds snacking on the humans made her realize just how hungry she was! She knew the rest of the clan would also be in a similar state of hunger, given that none of them have had a full meal since the previous night. However, she knew delaying the marking further would be risky. Every moment they waited would simply increase the chance of other animals wandering into the many different parts of their city. Should the clan get to marking the area right away or have a snack first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the Matriarch command them to do:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides, she had to make sure the clan was nourished, so they were alert and ready for anything. The Matriarch told herself this, trying to help her conscience feel at ease, when really she was just very hungry! With a whoop, she commanded the males to go hunt down some food. The males excitingly broke into a dash, shattering the road surfaces under them, ready to feast! The female quickly followed up her whoop with a fairly angry sounding growl. The males quickly slow down and began walking more cautiously. The first and second males had almost completely forgot about the Matriarch's instructions in their excitement. The clan then split up to go feed on some humans, with the males being sure to copy the females technique she had showed them earlier. Since all the tall skyscrapers were so high up, and infested with birds, all the Hyenas decided to try their luck with a few mid-rise buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Matriarch was the first to find her building to feed on, which was comprised of luxury condos. The female was impressed how shiny and \"pretty\" the building looked when compared to others in the city, as it had a fancy modern design. She figured the humans inside must be of high quality then, like they were a premium cut of meat! Wasting no time, she placed her front leg on the buildings roof and began to rub it side to side. This caused the entire building to sway, cracks formed all over as the structure was put under heavy load. Internally, furniture, fragile objects and other human's belongings were going crashing everywhere. The wealthy occupance were in a panic, desperately trying to escape this \"earthquake\" before the building collapsed! Pushing and shoving, they all ran to the front entrance to escape, just like the Matriarch had planned. She had her maw right at the front doors, greedily slurping and gulping anyone trying to escape. The rich folks expensive perfume and cologne did give them a slightly different taste to the female Hyena, which she enjoyed. It was like they were given some kind of marinade! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the humans inside soon caught on, that their was some kind of pink, slimy, smelly monster grabbing people from the front doors! Still in a panic, the humans soon rushed themselves to the side fire exits of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Matriarch soon grunted angrily. The flow of humans had stopped, but she could still hear them shuffling about inside. She gave the building another strong shake, causing more damage, but not producing more humans. Looking around the building, she soon realized the humans had made extra exits, that they were now using to escape! The Matriarch thought to herself, \"I guess these creatures are a bit more clever then I thought. Good thing us Hyena's are still smarter!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then used her front paws to crush the fire exit! The humans currently in the doorway were flattened with a sickening \"crunch\". Debry fell from the upper wall and blocked the exit! Ensuring that it was fully sealed, she also dragged over a bit of shattered debris from another building as well as a few vehicles. She crushed them against the fire exit, completely sealing it off. She repeated the same for the other exits she found. Satisfied with her work, she proceeded to place her maw back to the only exit available to the humans, continuing to send them to a one way trip to her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the males also had a similar experience to the female. They quickly found and plugged the extra exits of the buildings they had chosen to feast on. Soon about four buildings worth of humans were being digested alive in the four different Hyenas stomachs.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFeeling herself fully stuffed, the female let out a large burp, shattering a few windows. She could still hear a few small groups of humans within the heavily damaged structure. They were cowering in fear, unsure what to do! The Matriarch did not want to eat/kill these last remaining humans, in fact she wanted the exact opposite! She then giggled directly at the group, as if talking to them, \"Ok little ones, make sure you have lots and lots and lots of SEX! Breed those numbers back up! I would hate for this to be the last of your flavorful kind\". She assumed the rich people with their slightly different flavor from their perfume and cologne were a slight subset of the human species. She definitely would like to taste them again! She just had to wait for them to breed back up so she could have another fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that all the Hyenas hunger was satisfied, what do they decide to do next?</span></div></div>",

The humans that laid in her wake had no chance to react, they simply felt massive vibrations before a Hyena paw descended on top of them. She was sure the humans that didn't end up as stains on her paws would appreciate the clan defending the territory. The males quickly raced after the Matriarch, also ripping through everything in their paths. They ran slightly abreast, as if creating a \"V\" formation. All of the Hyenas dicks flopped greatly as they ran, one of which was growing slightly erect. It was the first male, who loved to crash through buildings. He was having a wonderful time feeling them crumble under paw. He even took this rare opportunity to cheekily aim and stomp the biggest structures that laid in his path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running many many miles, the Hyenas started to approached the residential area. The clan dropped onto their bellies and skidded to a stop, turning any humans that were under them into a red smear. Behind them lay miles and miles of complete destruction. Hundreds of buildings were reduced to nothing more then Hyena pawprints along with hundreds of thousands of humans that were now dead. Although, the Matriarch was unworried by all the death and destruction the clan just created. If they didn't stop these invading animals and the clan lost control of their new territory, what good are the human lives then? The Hyenas were hiding behind a few buildings to stay out of sight from the other giant animals. The scent was quite strong, meaning their was a group of the creatures! The Matriarch peeked over the buildings and finally saw what they were dealing with. What was currently in the suburbs?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A flock of about ten Ostriches had wandered in to the cities residential area. The massive birds were about three times taller then the male Hyenas. They each had tall skinny legs and very fluffy, feather covered bodies. The colors of their feathers ranged from a dark black to gray, as the flock had a decent mix of males and females. The heads of the Ostriches looked around, taking in this new and strange environment. Thankfully, it seemed that none of the flock had detected the watching Hyenas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flock simply treaded carelessly onto the mass of homes, seemingly ignoring their existence. Each one of the Ostrich's massive talons crushed multiple homes with every step, leaving deep prints. Predictably, the humans who lived in that area were all running around aimlessly in a panic. A few of the Ostriches noticed the tiny running creatures and were casually picking off a few from the crowds. They simply swallowed the humans alive, treating them no differently then simple insects. Most Ostriches just ignored the mass of screaming humans, uncaringly stomping them all out underfoot. The potent odor of the Ostriches bodies caused many of the humans below to cough and gag. The humans were so distracted by the smell, that they were unable to focus on more important things, like dodging incoming Ostrich feet.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith the twenty stomping talons, it was not long before the flock had created a massive amount of destruction to the suburb. The Ostriches were quite spread out from each other, walking over the entire width of the area. As they made their way across the suburbs, the flock wasn't carving a trail of destruction, they were wiping everything out! What lay behind the Ostriches was completely devastated, all that remained of the once lovely neighborhood was exposed earth mixed in with bits of debris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Matriarch watched the Ostrich flock intently as they wrecked the suburbs. She was not sure what to do! On one paw, it seemed like the massive birds were only passing through the clans territory. This meant the Hyenas could avoid a potentially painful conflict if they just stayed hidden. Plus, since the city's humans gave the clan plenty of nourishment, it wasn't necessary to hunt down the Ostriches for food.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHowever, at the rate the Ostriches were going, the entire area of tiny human hives was going to be completely leveled! Every second that passed, more and more of the area was wiped off the map. She watched anxiously for a few more moments, before she finally made her decision. Does she command the clan to save the suburbs or do they simply leave them to the Ostriches?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Little did they know they was about to meet a 'new' species. The Fox could see the tents atop a ridge ahead. Curious he walked right on toward s them, slowly. His foot steps let off loud booms that echoed throughout the valley. the camera crew were roused by the Foxes footsteps. They left their tents and gasped at the sight in the valley. ''Quick! Get the camera rolling!'' Yelled the presenter. Who was excited rather than frightened to see a giant anthro Fox walking towards him. The crew, despite their fear obeyed and filmed the presenter and approaching giant anthro Fox. The presenter excitedly going on about this amazing discovery and so on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fox meanwhile saw little two legged creatures emerge from the tents. He was amazed and curious at what these creature were. They didn't resemble prey, who walked on four legs. They looked more like his kind if anything... How curious.  He continued his approach. The crew and presenter stayed put, filming and talking excitedly about the Fox who was now walking up the ridge. He towered over the people. He carefully walked beside the crew and sat down. His two legs going down into both valleys. He looked down between his thighs at the humans. He grinned softly. They weren't running from him. One was pointing up at him and talking to the others. Another pointed an object at the talking one. Two others held sticks into the air. The Fox was amazed at what was happening to him. The people were no bigger than one of his eyes, he could easily crush them but he wasn't going to. Not yet anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fox reached down for the presenter and picked him up between two fingers. He was careful not to squeeze to hard, for he might injure or kill him. The Fox lifted the man before his face and studied him intently. ''Keep filming! Easy there big fella!'' Said the presenter to the Fox and his filming crew below. The Fox could not understand him. But the Fox did realise that the people were talking. He became even more curious. Just what to do with these creatures? He thought briefly then decided what to do with them...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

''Not in there!'' cried the presenter to no avail. He was shoved feet first into the cock's slit. The Fox moaned in pleasure. He released the presenter, who was gripped up to his waist in the Fox's Cock. Stroking his balls with the one hand he used his free hand to pump his member. The camera crew still staying put filming the lewd seen before and above them. The Fox's erection grew to its full length, knot and all. Pre oozed out, smothering the presenter. He was sliding into the lubricated urethra, His struggles giving the Fox untold pleasure and quickening his descent into the abyss below...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fox felt himself getting close to orgasm.

With a physical barrier and Wolf towering over them the humans....</span></div></div>",

Not that way back to your village!'' He pointed at the village, trying to guide the humans. But all they would of heard was yips, growls and barks from the giant canine looming over them and blocking the only road out of the village. He sighed, he was going to have to get a little more hands on it seems. He dropped his hand before a group, blocking their path. they turned and headed back into the village. He had to do this a few times to get people heading the right way. But soon there were dozens of lone humans, getting further away. The old male came over ''I'll help you out!'' He said as he started after the closest human. ''Be gentle!'' Said the young male over his shoulder. The old Wolf snorted ''I will! Now come here cuties!'' He said happily at the humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lone woman screamed as a Wolf shaped shadow washed over her. She looked up just in time to see the old naked Wolf dropping onto all fours over her. Two large hands come down either side of her. The Wolf looks down at her, grinning. She faints when his tongue flicks out and laps her up into his maw. He sealed her in his jaws and murred softly. ''Nice and warm in there!'' He moaned. He sat up and swished the woman about in his mouth to get a good taste. The young male spotted this. ''What the heck?! Are you going to eat her?!'' He gasped. The old male moaned ''nah, just having a taste'' he then spat the woman unconmcious out into his palm. He stood up and took her to the cloest building. Gently laying her by the door. Then he turned and headed after more people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young male meanwhile was now resorting to picking people up and placing them in his free hand. Despite his size he was quite gentle and had hurt nobody. In a few minuters he'd caught everybody in this direction. He had fifteen people sat in his hand. He grinned at them. ''All safe! Aren't I friendly?'' He said happily, lulling his tongue and wagging his tail. The humans just screamed and cowered in fear. He whined ''Ah don't be frightened!'' He lifted them upto his face he smiled again then it occured to him. 'My fangs are bigger than this creatures. When I grin or talk all they must see is fangs. I don't think they understand me either' he thought, rather correctly. ''So, how am I to reassure you cuties that am friendly, hmm?!... Ah! I know! I'll _______.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how does the young Wolf show he's friendly to the humans? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young male nodded. ''Oh it does!'' he replied. He looked down at his hand and spoke to the humans. ''Aren't I so soft and warm?'' He asked. Obviously they could not understand him. the people in his hand were thoroughly trapped between his padded palm and chest. But he didn't press to hard and his soft thick fur acted as a cushion. He walked along towards the village with the humans still held against his chest. His tongue lulled and tail wagging furiously. ''Oh I'm so enjoying this!'' he howled out. The old male meanwhile was copying him. He'd caught some people and had them pushed against his chest. ''Oh! Your right, it does feel god to hug them against my chest!'' He called over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young male laughed and walked to the closest building. He crouched down and took his hand off of his chest. He looked at the humans in his palm. ''See?

He looked at the old male who was still hugging the people he'd caught. But the old male was clearly getting a little carried away. His dick was started to emerge from his old grizzled sheath! ''ooh... So nice!'' He moaned out aloud as his dick grew longer and thicker. The young male yipped in surprise. He'd also got slightly aroused, but kept himself in check.

Their view being of either his heavy old balls or thick fluffy butt cheeks.  His tongue lulled out of mouth and oozed saliva onto the ground. His free hand he used to fondle his balls. ''Fuck...

Pre covering the thick shaft and oozing around them. He was close to release, very close... He bucked his hips and snarled. ''No!'' Cried the young male as the old male ejaculated. A long thick stream of cum blasted out of his cock and arced up over the village. People on the streets screamed and scrambled as they saw the incoming cum. It arced down and splattered loudly over several buildings. Caving in roofs and flooding the interiors with his thick love sauce! Cars were blasted over and countless people were enveloped in the thick gloop. By some luck nobody was killed outright but they were in danger of suffocating in the suffocating fluid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fuck!'' Panted the old male and gasped the young male. The young male placed a hand on his head in disbelief. The old male was coming back to his senses. His cock oozing cum as his eyes widened. ''Woops!'' He said sheepishly on observing his mess. He stood back up, his dick flopped about flinging blobs of cum around himself. Nearby humans had to dive to avoid these blobs. ''Sorry!'' He said to the humans. But they was to busy running or trying to escape from his cum. ''Quick! We have to get them out before they drown!'' Cried the young male as he headed for the closest group of trapped humans.

They had to rip open buildings to get at those trapped within. Meanwhile a large percentage of the population was fleeing in all directions. ''What a mess you've made!'' Growled the young male as he looked at all the humans fleeing from them. The old male sighed ''I couldn't help it. You try containing yourself when your my age!'' He cleaned off the last group of humans then stood up. ''There! All cleaned up and no fatalities!'' He said happily. His tail wagged. ''Let's play round up!'' He giggled and headed out of the village. The young male followed him ''Keep your cock in this time!'' The old male snorted at his suggestion.

Not only had the massive two legged Wolves invaded their humble community, but they also sprayed them with disgusting cum! Hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages were created when the anthros had ripped open the cum soaked buildings. The humans were in too much of a panic to notice that the anthros were actually trying to save those trapped within. Fearing for their lives, the populous was fleeing on foot! The stench of the Wolves cum which now lingered throughout the entire town, also helped drive them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling guilty, both anthros left the village to collect the fleeing humans. They were scattering all over the open tundra. To make matters even more difficult, a large blizzard started to blow into the area. This greatly reduced their visibility and even their sense of smell. They did their best to track down the humans and gather them, making sure not to crush any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany many miles away, a new portal opened up. Flashing into existence was a massive western style feral Dragon. The creature was male and over a colossal 3000 ft tall. The Wolf anthros were about the size of a human compared to a traditionally sized Dragon. He could easily tower over the 1000 ft Wolves. He was covered in vibrant red colored scales. He had great wings that could stretch out far from his body. He stood on four thick pads accompanied with razor sharp claws. Behind him lay a massively long tail. Equally massive was his set of genitalia, hanging loose between his hind legs was a hefty set of testicles and scaly sheath. Of course the cold did cause some shrinkage. He was a proud creature, back in his world he was second to none!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon was not accustomed to the cold environment. He much rather suited the warm grassy planes of his world. He was in no danger of dying as he was fire based, but the environment was still quite unpleasant. The blizzard also made it impossible for him to see! He could only pick up one thing with his powerful senses. That was of course the very potent scent from the older anthro Wolves ejaculation. The smell was like a blazing arrow amongst the frozen wasteland. Sure he wasn't sexually attracted to it, but at this point he didn't care what the smell was, as long as it wasn't more frozen ice. The Dragon's feral mind began to naturally follow it, leaving massive tracks in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the humans that had been saved by the Wolf anthros had stayed behind in the village. Unfortunately, this turned out to be an unwise decision. The saliva soaked humans suddenly felt everything shake again. At first they thought the giant Wolves were back, but they soon realized the vibrations were much stronger then before. It did not take long for the Dragon to find the small village. Due to his colossal size, the village looked like nothing more then a different colored patch of dirt to him. Not a single structure was even taller then his claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout care, the Dragon continued walking towards the scent. His massive claws decimated multiple buildings with each step. Crunch after crunch he waded into the village, unknowingly snuffing out countless people. He soon found the source of the scent. One of the many strings of cum still laid splattered in the village, it was even still warm! The massive Dragon lowered his head and gingerly sniffed it. The suction was strong enough to pull a few people upwards into his nostrils! Despite humans literally trapped inside his nose and reeking of fear, their scent was still too minuscule for him to detect. Upon smelling the Wolves cum, the Dragon snorted, blowing out all the windows in the area. He recognized the scent as another male's essence. However, the Dragon knew he could easily overpower whoever this creature was and take the area as his territory. How does the Dragon assert his dominance?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If that creature return to challenge him and take their territory back, it would be <i>their</i> grave mistake. The Dragon knew that he was so mighty, none would dare approach him, so marking wouldn't be necessary. Besides, the natural scent of his body should keep creatures away in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince his curiosity of the Wolves spunk had been satisfied, the Dragon quickly took notice to something else about this strange patch of ground. The structures he had smushed had a faint, but wonderful warmth to them. It was the heat from the various furnaces and fireplaces of the human's homes, that was now flowing outwards because of the Dragon's destruction. He quickly figured this warm patch would be a perfect place for a nap. An excellent use of his new territory! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive Dragon decided the very center of the village would logically be the warmest. The creature took a few more destructive steps to get into place. As he stomped, a few \"lucky\" humans avoided being crushed by getting stuck in the various small crevices of his soles. These still alive humans were given a brief trip upwards along with the claw, before slamming back down and mashing into paste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in position, the massive red Dragon began to fold his legs. Any survivors left in the village were treated to the view of his massive scaly belly descending upon them. Size difference wise, the village was almost the size of a dog bed to him. With a crash he laid on top of the village, flattening the vast majority under his body. It took a bit of shifting to get comfortable, rendering all underneath him into a fine paste. His massive tail then curled inward, to tuck under his hind legs from the cold. This had the unfortunate effect of tearing through almost every building behind the dragon. His testicles, which were still tight in their sack from the cold, began to loosen a bit, smothering multiple buildings. The Dragon was still completely oblivious to the death and destruction he just caused. He simply settled down, closed his eyes, and drifted into a peaceful sleep. As he slept, he also let out a small bit of innocent flatulence, as any sleeping creature would do. This further fowled up the area, although there were very few survivors left to choke on it.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMeanwhile, the two Wolf anthros had been busy catching the fleeing humans. They had surprisingly traveled quite a bit of distance away from the village. The blizzard had helped veil the village from the Wolves both in terms of sight and smell, meaning they were completely oblivious to the Dragon and what he had done to the town! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Wolves did their round up, did they encounter a different hungry animal looking to snack on the humans?</span></div></div>",

Despite the added difficulty the blizzard had caused, both anthros had made good progress rounding up the fleeing humans and as far as they could tell, they hadn't crushed a single one! Soon both males had their paws full, reaching the limit of what they could carry. They were using their arms to tightly press the humans against their muscular chests. Luckily, since the older male had just had a release, he was able to keep himself under control.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Alright, I think we got a good chunk of 'em\" said the older male, struggling to keep holding onto the various squirming humans. \"It seems like this blizzard is clearing up, lets drop these ones off first and then come back for the rest of them.\" The older male then giggled slightly as he continued speaking, \"Unless we start shoving them in our sheaths, I don't think I can hold anymore\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, we will have none of that, please. I think your dick did quite enough\". The younger male said in annoyance, still guilty of the mess and destruction they had caused when the older male ejaculated over the human's homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, I was only joking, you need to lighten up a little\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-... Alright I guess you have a point\". The Wolf let out a deep sigh. \"OK, lets head back quickly before the others scatter too far\".<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe two Wolf anthros then left the remaining fleeing humans and headed back toward the town. All while tightly holding multiple groups of captured humans sandwiched between their arms and muscular chests. The humans weren't in pain, but they weren't exactly comfortable as the Wolves held them a bit too tight. Both Wolves ran through the tundra back to the village, making the humans quite dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the blizzard continued to fade, the Wolves powerful noses began to pick up a curious new pungent odor emanating from the village. Soon they were able to make out the outline of a titanic red creature sprawling on top of the humans homes! Once the blizzard faded completely, they could clearly see the beast in all his massive glory! They could also see that most of the village have been crushed flat under the behemoth's scaly belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WH-WHAT'S THIS!\" The younger male exclaimed, almost dropping all the humans he was carrying. \"That creature is invading their territory! It's destroyed their little home mounds! We need to do something!\". Furious at what the Dragon had done, the younger male snarled greatly! The humans he was holding whimpered and stunk of fear! Knowing that younger males can be hot headed, the elder knew the younger Wolf was about to recklessly charge in! The elder's paws were full of humans, so he wouldn't be able to hold his young friend back! He desperately elbowed the younger anthro in the side to get his attention before he ran off in a blind rage. This had the unfortunate consequence of \"rolling\" the humans the old Wolf was holding along his chest, gaining a few more cries of discomfort from them. Luckily, it was worth it, as he got the younger male to snap back to reality.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Wait, it's unwise to just rush in! Lets think this through!\" The older male said in a panic, all while trying to be quiet enough not to wake this mysterious new creature. The younger Wolf, while still angry, took a deep breath and obeyed the elders instructions. He knew it was tribe rules to listen to an elders wisdom. The older male then motioned to crouch down, to stay hidden from the massive beast. The elder looked upon the Dragon, studying it. Both anthros stood crouched for some time, as their privates swung freely in the air. They continued to hold the humans tightly against their chests and the Dragon continued to slumber. After some time the elder finally made up his mind and spoke. His wisdom told them to:</span></div></div>",

He was still enjoying the heat from the wrecked village and had no intention of waking up anytime soon. As he stirred, the Dragons massive front paw tore through a few more homes. There was almost no intact structures left throughout the entire village. As if to add insult to injury, the dragon also passed yet more gas from his massive tailhole. Aside from the Dragon and all his scents, both Wolves were unable to pick up even the faintest scent of humans from the village, meaning there were little to no survivors. However, their noses did miss the few humans still alive and trapped in the crevices of the Dragon's soles, but its not like they had long to live anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger male was angry, but he knew not to argue with an elders wisdom. At least the younger male felt less guilty about the destruction him and the elder had caused earlier, as it was nothing compared to what the Dragon did! He of course had no idea they were in fact the ones who accidentally attracted the Dragon to the village! The younger male thought quietly to himself for a moment, if only their was some way to still to some good for these poor creatures. His thoughts were interrupted as the humans he was holding tightly against his chest grabbed his attention. Half of them were still shivering in fear and the others were trying to break free from his grasp. His eyes went wide as he realized both Wolves still had so many humans safely with them! Maybe they could still do some good after all! He gave the humans a slight (from his perspective) hug to let them know it was going to be alright. As they were compressed further, all the humans cried out, in what the anthro assumed was happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about the creatures we still have with us! Maybe we can still help them!\", the young anthro said enthusiastically, his tail wagging furiously behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older male pondered as he looked down at his group of squirming humans, still tightly trapped and being forced to take in his scent with every breath.

Their homes are ruined! That massive creature has settled in on their territory! They have nowhere to go! We can't just abandoned them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand what you are saying\", the elder spoke up in a more firm voice, to show his dominance. \"But remember, sometimes its best to leave nature as is. These small creatures have instincts to follow.\" He said, giving the humans he was holding a small innocent squeeze, which earned him more audible squeals. \"These creatures were probably trying to run to a nearby burrow or something... Heck! I bet they had sensed that massive beast approaching before we even arrived! I bet that's why these creatures were all agitated and wanted to flee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger male started to ease up as he heard the elders explanation. \"Wait...you think these tiny creatures were scared this entire time not from us, but because they sensed that massive red creature on its way to wreck their homes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust my wisdom, over the years I've witnessed incredibly ingenious ways that nature keeps things in balance. These small creatures probably sniffed that beast far down wind before we could.\" The anthro continued explaining, trying his best to understand the humans as if they had feral behaviors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger male let out a deep sigh as his ears started to fold back. \"Hmmm I see...\", the young Wolf said, all while looking at the group of the small humans still struggling to get away from his grasp. He began to feel relieved to learn \"why\" the humans acted so spooked around them, both Wolves were being so gentle after all! He just wanted to help these little creatures, but it seemed like he was going about it all wrong.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Your right... I'm sure these creatures are fine without us, no need to mess with nature and her ways\". The younger Wolf said calmly, yet sadly. He then bent down and started to gently place the frightened humans on the soft snowy ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" said the older Wolf as he began doing the same. \"I bet these small creatures deal with those types of massive red beasts all the time, I'm sure they know what to do\", he continued confidently, assuming the Dragon was actually a native creature to the human's world. \"I bet they'll have that hive of theirs built back up in no time\", he then gave a reassuring grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the humans, the elders wisdom wasn't exactly on point. As the humans were placed on the ground, they finally got a chance to see something other then the wall of fur on the anthros chests. They looked in complete horror at the massive sleeping Dragon who had ruined their homes, vehicles and all their belongings. The humans were left with no choice but to turn and continue running aimlessly into the tundra, just as they were when the anthro Wolves first showed up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSeeing the humans resume their scattering helped put the younger Wolves heart at ease, as the humans were behaving exactly like the older anthro's explanation said they would. The younger male simply smiled and waved as the group of humans scattered and ran off into the distance. Unfortunately, the Wolves were totally unaware they had indirectly doomed those humans. Having nowhere to take refuge, all the humans eventually ended up freezing to death in the tundra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Wolves then left the Dragon and the humans they \"rescued\". Feeling good about their deeds, they began to walk to a new area. They both wanted to explore this land further and help any creatures they found in need. In what direction do they travel next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two Wolves walked southward. Before them lay thousands of miles of white snowy wilderness. They both sniffed the air, but could not detect the scent of anything, no other \"regularly\" sized creatures or little humans. Hours pass as they walked, with nothing of interest seeming to popup. Eventually the icy cold snow gave way to soft feeling earth and crunchy forests. Their massive size meant they had been covering quite a lot of ground. The small trees looked like moss to them, which easily splintered under their thick paws. The dense forests blocked their view of the ground, meaning neither Wolf noticed stomping out the occasional remote building or roadway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Wolves chatted with each other as they walked along. They spoke about a variety of different topics, such as hunting strategies, claimed territories, their different clans etc. Eventually the conversation found itself on the topic of the fine females in each of their clans. That topic of conversation happened to get the older male slightly excited again, his red rocket unashamedly poked itself out of this sheath. The younger male, upon picking up the scent of the other anthros arousal, quickly tried to change the subject. Given that he was quite keen on the small creatures of this world, he figured he would ask the elder for more information, perhaps his wisdom could shed more light on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er.. elder, I've been meaning to ask, what else can you tell me about those tiny creatures we saw? You seemed quite knowledgeable back when that red beast invaded their territory\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older male thought for a moment before speaking. \"hmph... well... what I can say is they are some kind of hivemind species, who build great nests, like the one we saw...\". The elder continued talking as he unknowingly stomped out a small lodge. \"I remember the woodland tribes told me about creatures like these\", he continued, referring to forest dwelling anthro Wolves from their world, who had been describing ants to their artic brethren. \"I can also tell you with quite a bit of confidence, that they are a prey species, given their high numbers and how easily they are stomped and eaten. That red creature we saw was probably one of their many natural predators\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" the younger male said sadly, not exactly ecstatic to hear about how easily the small creatures perish. He wanted to help the poor defenseless things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the younger males sorrowful tone, the older male figured he could try to comfort him. \"Now now, no need to be upset! We are not ones to question the natural order of things. However, I am surprised how the creatures built their nest above ground where they are so susceptible to predators. Perhaps they breed like crazy, or something of that sort, to keep their numbers up\". The elder male continued with his explanation, not doing the best of job at cheering up the younger male. \"Erm...You also need to remember, those creatures are definitely not intelligent like us, so you don't need to feel too bad\". He said, all while assuming the humans were no more intelligent then your average ant or mouse.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ya... I guess...\" the younger male responded, still sounding bumped out. \"Well...I just hope we can find more of those creatures...\". He didn't care if the creatures were nothing more then just feral bugs, he still wanted to help them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not! A species such as that must have plenty of different hives scattered around! I'm sure we can track some more down. Creatures that small can be tricky to find, but we just need to sniff them out and hunt them down\"!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe younger Wolf felt his spirits get lifted as his tail started to wag. Sure, he was sad to have abandoned the humans from before and now to hear how easily they were preyed upon, but the thought of finding more of those creatures cheered him up! This time he would not only show his love to the humans, but also defend them if they were attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, darkness was about to fall upon the land. They both decided to turn in for the night. They stopped at an area with a small stream (which was actually a large river) and took many nice refreshing gulps. Not being able to find any caves in this seemingly flat world, the two anthros resorted to simply sleeping out in the open, which neither of them minded. As they laid down many acres of forest were completely crushed. A few cottages were also flattened, along with their owners. After such an exciting day, it did not take long for the two Wolves to fall into a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre they interrupted throughout the night?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had no idea where he was! Suddenly, out of seemingly nowhere, he heard the sounds of weak cries. He recognized them as the sounds of tiny humans! He quickly rushed in the direction of the sound. Annoyingly, it felt like he was moving in slow motion, but he did his best to hurry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly found himself in a small clearing. In the center were three tall anthill like mounds, which stood to about his shoulders in height. They appeared to be made of mud, sand and dirt, similar to a termite mound. \"Those must be the nests the elder was talking about? But wait, am I back home?\" he said to himself confused. On the ground, he could see many crowds of humans! They were running around in seemingly every direction, crying out in a panic! He soon realized why, a group of feral Foxes were attacking them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three of the Foxes. Each one of them was terrorizing a different human mound. The first female Fox was chasing down the groups of humans and greedily lapping them up! She was also carelessly crushing as many of the small creatures as she was eating. The next Fox was definitely male, as he had his leg cocked high in the air and was peeing on their mound! The urine was easily eroding away the sandy structure. The Fox snickered as he drowned the humans in his piss. The last Fox was also undoubtedly a male, as he was happily humping away at the third human mound. He panted heavily as he thrusted deeply into the hive. His full knot was inserted, he was about to blow his load on the humans inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to watch anymore of this, the large anthro Wolf charged towards the Foxes. He was yelling loudly, trying to scare the wild animals away. The three feral's eyes shot towards the charging anthro. They immediately ceased their naughty actions and began to high tail it out of there! The second Fox was still pissing as he ran, unable to stop the flow. The other male's erection was bobbing greatly with every step, he was frustrated at his ruined release. Seeing the Foxes retreat, the Wolf simply shouted, \"Serves you right for picking on someone so weak! You better not come back here again!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved they were gone, the Wolf then walked up to the human hives to assess the damage. Amazingly, he noticed that thousands and thousands of humans began to pour out of the anthill like structures. At first the Wolf thought they were fleeing away from him, like the previous humans he met. However, these humans seemed to be doing the exact opposite! They were heading towards him, and seemingly cheering!?! Feeling the excitement building inside of him, the Wolf quickly sat down on his behind, hoping to hear the humans better. He gasped as he couldn't believe his ears! The humans appeared to be speaking intelligently! They were letting out growls, yips and barks that the anthro Wolf could understand! What were the tiny creatures telling him?</span></div></div>",

Not able to hold off any longer, he stretched his massive arms out and grabbed large armfuls of the crowd. He began to snuggle them against his furry chest. Unlike the humans he had held before which struggled to get away, these ones stroked his fur and cuddle him back! The Wolf couldn't believe what was happening! He was overwhelmed with joy. He then heard the small ones he was holding speak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! I would have turned into Fox poop if it wasn't for you!\" said one of the humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to you, only a small amount of our brethren drowned in the Fox urine! We can breed back replacements in no time! I don't think we could have recovered if the Fox had emptied their entire bladder!\" said another human, who reeked of the Fox's piss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to die in Fox cum! Thank you! Thank you!\", another human said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, not a problem! H-Happy to help!\". The younger Wolf simply giggled, barely able to contain his excitement. At this point, he didn't bother to question how the humans could talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you deserve a reward\", \"Yes! We will hug and cuddle you and rub you all over!\" the humans shouted excitingly. The humans on his chest doubled down with their petting. The ones on the ground also joined in by rubbing and petting his legs and bottom. It felt so nice to get pets! The Wolf panted heavily with his tongue out. Some of the humans on his chest got wet from his dripping saliva, but it didn't seem to faze them. His tail also wagged furiously, unknowingly sending a few humans on the ground flying. However. they didn't seemed to mind, as they simply dusted themselves off and ran right back to petting. What else do the humans do to show their appreciation?</span></div></div>",

His relaxed body was soon filled with dread as he felt a \"crunch\"! He had accidently laid on a massive group of humans! He hadn't noticed them gathering behind him! Scared of what he had done, he instantly sat upwards and looked over his shoulder at the humans he just smooshed. Amazingly, those humans had not been crushed! They were just a bit \"imbedded' in the soft ground and slightly dazed, but otherwise unharmed. Those humans even motioned with their arms for him to lay back down on them! Others even poured in where is back just was, as if wanting to be crushed!?! \"Yes, lay down on us!\", \"Yes, you will love it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolf was confused and in shock! Apparently the humans didn't mind getting squashed under him? He wasn't one to argue, responding, \"Well, if you say so cuties\".  He then laid again on the same spot, slamming his back down on those humans. After he settled down, he felt their tiny bodies begin to struggle and squirm underneath him. They were massaging his back! It felt great and was so relaxing! The Wolf instinctually rolled the weight of his body to get more comfortable. His action unknowingly compressed the humans further, but seemingly did not injure them. He once again did not bother to question how any of this was possible. \"Wow, that fee-els great! Don't tucker yourselves out- OH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolf then felt another group of humans getting to work on a different part of his body.</span></div></div>",

Truth be told, he was quite sore after walking all day over such new terrain. He definitely wouldn't mind if the humans got to work petting his paw pads! The Wolf was slightly embarrassed however, wishing he could have gotten a chance to wipe them off on the grass. His paws, in addition to being sore, were quite smelly and filthy. However, as if reading his thoughts, the humans had a similar idea in mind for his paws. \"Yes, we will clean you nice and clean\", \"Yes, your paws will feel good as new\", those near his feet said out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe droves of tiny creatures began to clime his ankle fur. Once they made it upwards, they began to spread out all over his impressive paws. Some began to worm their way in-between his toes. Others lowered themselves onto his toe beans. Some climbed up high to the tops of his razor sharp nails and others stayed on the ground to turned their attention to his heels. Just feeling them crawling around felt quite nice, but the anthro then gasped as the humans finally got to work. All at once the humans began to clean out the filth, guck and sweat trapped in every crevasse of his paws! The Wolf could feel their small arms and even tongues cleaning him up! The humans themselves were getting completely coated in the nastiness! Once a human was covered, they simply left to let a fresh human take their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as cleaning, the humans were also sure to massage his paw pads, adding yet more pleasurable stimulation. The Wolf moaned heavily, as the tiny creatures did their best to give him a pedicure. He couldn't resist to scrunch his toes a bit. Once again, the humans seemingly didn't mind, even though the ones between his toes were getting smothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, th-thank you little ones, I-I'm surprised you aren't bothered by the smell-AH! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolf felt yet another sensation as more of the friendly humans worked their way to a new part of his body.

In droves, they began to march in-between his legs. They soon made there way to his massive sheath and balls. Like with his feet, the humans had to use his fur to scale the massive organ. The feeling of their small bodies was already beginning to send waves of pleasure throughout the Wolf. However, that feeling was nothing compared to what the humans had in store for him. Soon his entire genitals were coated in a mass of hundreds of humans. All in unison they began to use their tiny arms, legs and even tongues to pleasure the Wolf. Every single one of them was rubbing, massaging and otherwise stimulating him, sending pleasure all over his body. His penis was soon poking out of his sheath, and growing fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! That isn't-ha realllly OH, NEcessary!\", the Wolf said, barely able to speak out. \"But VERY appreciated\", he continued, as he spread his legs slightly, to give the crowds better access. He simply began to relax, letting them work their magic. The humans didn't seem to mind his strong musk, if anything it made them rub even harder! Some humans were pulling themselves inside of his sheath and started squirming around with all their might, ensuring that his penis would be at full mass. His erection soon grew and grew, with his mighty knot popping out with a loud \"squelch\". This ended up trapping those who were in the sheath, but those humans were seemingly unbothered, as they simply just kept squirming away! The other humans outside worked over every part of his now towering erection. Not seeming to mind getting a bit \"moist\", they happily covered themselves in his pre and were rubbing their tiny bodies up and down his towering shaft. There seemed to be no shortage of the stuff, as the Wolf's penis was happy to douse them in more. The group near his balls were busy rubbing his scrotum. They gave a gentle massage to the massive testicles within. His sac soon relaxed from the wonderful treatment, smothering a few humans under its weight. A few skilled humans were even able to make it to the top of his throbbing penis. Seemingly not caring about their own safety, they plunged themselves into his urethra. They then pulled their bodies deeper into the leaking hole, and got to work stimulating the Wolf from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of getting stroked on his chest, legs, back, feet and now genitals was giving the Wolf a euphoric like state. Feeling himself approaching one of the biggest orgasms in his life, he simply closed his eyes and lulled his tongue. Who knew humans could be this \"friendly\"! Suddenly the humans on his balls were given quite the jolt, as his testicles began to twitch profusely. The Wolves eyes shot open as he:</span></div></div>",

Looking down he realized his loin cloth was tented, with a small moist blotch in the middle. It seemed that he also had quite the case of morning wood, especially after his... exciting dream. \"Hehe, maybe I'm not one to talk\", he sheepishly said to himself, scratching the back of his head.

Even if they were half as \"friendly\" as the ones from his dream, saving his current urges for them would be quite worth while! He decided to ignore his naughty feelings for now and use the time to hunt out a human colony. The younger Wolf then got to tracking, letting his erection subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked a few paces away from the old male. Despite the rude awakening, the older male did not wake him on purpose, so he wanted to let him continue his rest. The younger Wolf then entered hunting mode. First he started sniffing westward, but only picked up the scent of nothingness. Unfazed, he turned his attention to a different direction, the east. Sniffing once again provided him with no leads. He felt his frustration growing, but then realized he had been tracking all wrong! The little creatures he was looking for would be close to the ground, he had to search on their level! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro instantly dropped on all fours, sniffing the ground expectantly. All he could smell was the scent of pine, but at least it was a start. He crawled around, continuing to sniff and crush hundreds of trees. His balls and sheath swayed side to side with the motion of his movements. Before long, the Wolf finally found something unexpected. Before him laid a paved road, that seemingly cut through the forest. He cocked his head, then used his two front paws to dig at the road, easily ripping up the surface. With the road unknowingly ruined, the Wolf got a whiff of the shattered asphalt. He remembered that scent from the last human hive he was in! The town's road surfaces had been damaged when both of the Wolves large paws stomped around, exposing the asphalt smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These must be the creature's paths...perhaps it's made from their compacted droppings?\", he thought to himself, unable to comprehend how else the road could be made. He figured the small human creatures would simply defecate as they walked along, while their other fellow brethren would end up flattening the waste underfoot. He grinned, this would make them super easy to track! He just had to follow this strip of their droppings. Still on all fours, the anthro looked down the seemingly endless strip. The flat road allowed for far off scents to easily travel along without being defused by the forest. What was he able to smell?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he felt a breeze blowing in from the south, the younger male gingerly sniffed the air. Amazingly, he was finally able to detect the scent of something other then asphalt! It was humans! Lots and lots of humans! Much more then what was in his dream! The Wolf could tell they were all down wind, further south!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to contain his excitement, the younger Wolf jumped up from all fours and ran back to his sleeping companion. Not wanting to wait any longer, he shook the still sleeping elder Wolf. He soon awoke, and was quite grumpy from the sudden wake-up call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big idea- HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Wolf did not have a chance to voice his frustrations as the younger Wolf was already running ahead! Not wanting to get left behind, the older anthro quickly ran after him! He was still sporting an erection from his naughty dream, quietly cursing at the other Wolf for not letting him rub one out. The younger Wolf ran along the road he had found and the older Wolf followed behind, doing his best to keep up. Their great massive paws hit the ground hard, completely decimating the road, blowing over many trees and flattening rural homes. The younger Wolf was so excited, he didn't notice the damage he was causing. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAfter many miles, and stomped out homes later, the younger male could just see the shimmering of something in the distance. Tall hives! They were the same height as those in his dream! He was about to double down in his running speed, when he heard something wheezing behind him. The older male was calling out, begging him to stop. Sure the older anthro was still in tip top shape, but having to run that fast for that long so quickly was proving to be too much for him. Feeling slightly guilty of how he acted, the younger male slowed down his pace to a walk, allowing the older one to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is wrong with you! Why did you suddenly go running off like that!\" The older Wolf barked out angrily.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sorry elder, when I woke I was able to track down the small creatures so easily! Look up ahead, there is a massive hive of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the older Wolf sounded impressed, \"How did you hunt them down? I didn't smell any scents on the way here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this path they made\", he quickly snatched up one of the many broken sections of road and handed it to the other Wolf, \"It's made from their droppings\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I see\", the older Wolf pondered, giving the chunk of asphalt a sniff, \"Ha! I'm surprised how easily they were able to lead you then! Usually prey animals spread their droppings, as not to lead other creatures to their dens. The predators in this world must have it so easy!\". He said, almost mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, the younger Wolf was no longer fazed by the thoughts of humans being preyed upon. It didn't matter how easily predators could find the humans. He knew he would protect and save them from any incoming dangers! Just like he did in his dream! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Wolf then piped up with a question, \"Wait, how are you even sure the hives that lie ahead are from the same species? Maybe they are from a different type of small creature?\". The older Wolf wanted to make sure they weren't wasting a trip hunting the wrong prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well... I saw something very similar to them in my dream from last night\". The younger Wolf then went on to explained his dream experience to the older anthro in great detail. This made the other Wolf quite intrigued, as well as excited, as he secretly gave his sheath a few rubs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My My, that was quite the dream you had! I'm almost thinking these small creatures might be your spirit animal! Come! Let see if you can get them to give me- err- you, a similar treatment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both Wolves quite excited, they were finally nearing the metropolis. Being one of the largest northern cities, it would be the first heavily populated area any giant arctic dwelling creatures would come into contact with. That being said, is the city already being visited by another animal that the Wolves need to \"protect\" it from? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The younger Wolf was quite happy to see that the city was completely untouched. Nothing but the scent of happy humans emanated from it. Both the Wolves eyes went wide as they approached the city. Many of the tall structures were up to their shoulders in height. This was a stark contrast from the small town they had first encountered. The younger male panted heavily. They were so pretty looking! Unlike from his dream, these \"mounds\" were so shiny and sparkly. Did the creatures make them look extra nice because they sensed he was coming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Wolves continued forward at a brisk pace. They were very excited, which was quite evident by their growing erections, which bobbed as they walked. They were so enamored with the excitement of the city and its many buildings, that they completely failed to notice what was directly underpaw. They were inadvertently leveling the cities outskirts. Even as they progressed to increasingly populated areas, they still failed to noticed the many small buildings and humans being crushed flat under them. Much of the outlying districts were left in ruin as the two anthros excitingly walked through.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter many crunchy footsteps, both anthros soon reached the proper edge of the city. Both Wolves were amazed at what they saw and tried to make sense of it. \"Crazy they make all of this with just their poo and spit\", said the older male, still a bit too confident in his understanding of the human creatures. They then both saw that the sides of the hives were full of small grid like segments, \"I bet that's where they keep their food and lay their larva\", the older male continued to explain. They then saw many little colorful shells littered on the ground. They made the dull gray paths look quite pretty! \"I wonder where they collect these shells from?\" inquired the younger male. \"They're probably hollowed out exoskeletons of whatever insects these small creatures prey on\", the older male answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth anthros then grinded wildly as they saw thousands upon thousands upon thousands of humans pouring out of the various bases of the tall mounds! The older male groaned and gave his sheath a few strokes, he wanted to feel their small bodies rub his sensitive areas! Unfortunately, that did not seem to be the case. Unlike what was described by the younger male, the crowds were moving in the opposite direction, running further into the city!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older male grunted. \"Hmm, I guess their not coming out to give us that 'treatment'\", he said slightly annoyed. He was hoping for the same service that the younger male had described from his dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No don't you see! They're leading us! They want us to go deeper into their hive...maybe they have a surprise waiting!\", the younger male said excitingly. The various tall buildings ended up blocking the scent of fear the humans were producing, as they desperately ran from the invading monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of a surprise didn't take long to convince the older male. Soon both Wolves were walking along the streets of the city. Both anthros were definitely not going to fit on one road, so they split up and walked on two parallel streets. They walked slowly, allowing the hordes of humans to run ahead before they placed their titanic paws down. The tall buildings gently swayed side to side as the behemoths made their way deeper into the city. They left massive prints in the pavement and crushed all kinds of vehicles. Both Wolves were unconcerned however, they were sure the humans didn't care if those colorful shell things got crushed. Besides, like the older male said, they were just discarded shells from the humans prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked along, what happens?</span></div></div>",

He was only awakened by a loud whooshing sound and when he could feel water on his legs. What the hell?!'' He gasped as he sat up and looked around. The beach was a lot smaller, so small in fact barely his rump could fit upon the sand. ''Why is everything small and where are my clothes?!'' Asked the Sitatunga. It was at this point he saw the people, to him they were the size of beetles. ''What are these creatures?'' He muttered as he reached for them with his hand. He easily caught several people and lifted them up to his face. He studied them intently. ''oh, they have two legs, two arms and hands. Ooh is that clothes they're wearing?'' He said to himself as he looked the people over. ''Aw you're all so small! How amazing!'' He laughed. The little people ran about his large hand, looking for a way off. Swampy groaned ''I wouldn't jump! Actually I better do something''. He sealed his hand, trapping the people within. He did not crush them however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned stood up to his full height. He towered over everything in the area. The trees were more like really small bonsai trees to him. His horns were exceptionally long ones even by Sitatunga standards, now they were hundreds of feet long. He could see little ships in the sea, just like back home. Inland he could see roads and buildings. 'I must be on a planet like mine, just everything is smaller!' He thought. He looked down at himself, he was of course completely naked he remembered the little people he still had sealed in his hand. ''Oh well. I'd better do something'' he sighed. He opened up his hand to study the people once more. They reeked of fear. They seemed to speak, but he couldn't understand a word of it. ''Ooh mm I scary?'' He asked. ''Well maybe I should let you go'' he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets the people go by...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You think nothing of it but some of the other passengers seem to be pointing out the windows and the volume in the cabin starts to rise as many people start to talk, first at a whisper but soon growing louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as these conditions are not conductive of sleep, you take a look outside of the window yourself and gasp at what you see. A massive bird is hovering in the air not too far off from the plane. It looks confused and is turning it's head from left to right as if it is trying to gain back it's bearings. It is impossible to judge how big the bird is from your point of view but from the looks of it, it is at least large enough that it would make you have a pretty bad time should it notice the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that is exactly what it does. The bird locks eyes on the plane and it seems to look at your in particular, though that could be a mere coincidence. The canary starts to fly towards the plane at a rapid pace. It looks like it would easily able to outstrip all but the fastest fighter jets, though even those could be hard pressed to beat the massive bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volume in the cabin continues to rise as the canary gets closer to the plane, first starting at a curious whisper and soon growing to shocked yelling. The canary quickly catches up to the plane and catches it in it's claws, the hull of the plane denting heavily and the wings being crushed under the powerful talons of the far to big to exist bird. You can see where the canary's talons are as there are huge portions of the metal protruding a good foot inwards. But strangely enough the bird, despite being more than capable of it, does not crush the plane any more than it had already done so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canary starts to fly off with the plane and it's screaming passengers in it's claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does it take the plane?</span></div></div>",

Looking back she saw she had left a trail of fire. Her attention was then drawn to the ground as she saw little insect type creatures running around in a panic. She cocked her head, \"Could these mounds be their homes?\" she thought. She sniffed a few of them and their clothes lit ablaze, making them run faster in various directions. Seeing this amused her greatly, \"it's almost like these creatures have never been on fire before\", she thought to herself. Unfortunately, she failed to notice the humans collapsing once they burned to death, as she lost interest by the time they began to slow down running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hellhound continued her romp around the suburb, crushing/burning homes under paw and making sure to sniff any of those strange insect to see them do their little funny dance when on fire.

The asphalt road cracked and burned underneath each step. Many abandoned cars simply melted and exploded from her intense heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at a building that was slightly taller than her head. She sniffed it, only to have the side windows explode from her heat. Through the broken glass she could see more of those creatures inside! She took her two front paws and began to dig out the side of the building. Debris fell down as violent flames shot upwards. Her glowing eyes widened as she realized these small creatures were everywhere inside this thing. She let out a grin and barked, almost trying to say \"hello cuties!\". She then opened her maw and let her rancid, impossibly hot breath into the building, lighting everything and everyone ablaze. She giggled as she saw the humans running around, jumping and falling. She turned away from the inferno, not noticing it collapse behind her, killing everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued this for the next five or so buildings, setting them all ablaze. She was happy that all the humans got to experience the heat of her flames. It must be hard living in this environment, she thought, no smoke in the air, no glowing charcoal to rest on, no lava pools to lay in. That's it! She can dig up a lava pool, that would sure make things better for everyone. Back home, all it involves is a bit of digging to expose an underground lava stream.

She had stepped on multiple of these things before on the paths, but she was amazed at such a large gathering of them. They do feel quite nice \"popping\" under her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon gets a fun idea! She walked over to the edge of the packed parking lot. Without warning she suddenly dropped onto her belly and began to roll on top of all the vehicles! She was like a dog rolling around in the fall leaves! The cars were not only instantly crushed, but the fuel in the tanks ignited, this gave her a wonderful massage type feeling as it exploded. The vehicles all continued to explode like popcorn. She started moaning greatly, and even drooled a bit whenever a car exploded near her \"private area\". It did not take her long to reduce hundreds of cars into thin sheets of molten metal.

Metric tons of molten asphalt crashed into the high end clothing store behind her, setting it ablaze. This of course did not concern the Hellhound, who was in fact worried at the fact the ground underneath grew moist. She expected it to be rough, dry and hot, like back in her world. Luckily her paws quickly evaporated any water on her, but that still didn't solve the problem at hand. \"Just what kind of ground is this?\" the Hellhound thought to herself. \"Maybe...\" her feral mind tried to process the information \"maybe the insects have built these mounds where it's the warmest, meaning that's where the underground lava streams must flow!\" She yelped happily with excitement.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWithout wasting any more time, she walked over to the nearest mound, an electronic store, and began to unceremoniously dig on the roof. She was able to tear through it with ease, followed by the second floor. Incredibly expensive TV's, computers and other technology was not only burned, but send flying through the air, damaging more of the shopping center when it landed. Finally with all that \"junk\" out of the way, the Hellhound could get to the good stuff, the dirt underneath! With the base of the store ripped away she was finally able to dig into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to her disappointment, it was still just more moist dirt. She backed up a bit and sat down, her rump crushing the store front of a Jewelry store. Her intense heat inadvertently caused all the necklaces, rings, and bracelets to melt inside.

Furniture, appliances, bicycles, artwork, nothing was safe from her digging paws. Every swipe of her paw created tens of thousands of dollars in damages, yet the Hellhound showed no sign of slowing down. She didn't notice, but many humans were also sent flying in the air to their doom. Anyone unfortunate enough to still be alive after getting flung and burned by the Hellhound were treated to death by violent impact. They had no choice but to continue hiding in the stores as their vehicles were destroyed when the Hellhound rolled in them earlier. All they could do is hope that the Hellhound skipped the store they are hiding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff the Hellhound cleared away the last of the stores, a luxury watch boutique. She had dug up so many buildings she had lost count. Despite her turning everything into a flaming ruin, she still could not find a lava stream. Discouraged, she left the once beautiful shopping district to look elsewhere. She walked down another crunchy path. All that digging left her exhausted and a bit sore. \"Hopefully all the small insects appreciate my hard work\" she thought to herself. She stopped walking and stretched out, with her behind pressing against a fine dining restaurant, setting the insides aflame. Her canine vulva actually left a molten imprint onto the cracked brick, which was quite visible as she pulled away. It seems that she is starting to enter heat, causing her genitals to begin to swell. The Hellhound had been so enthralled with this new world, she had yet to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stretched upwards, she noticed something in the distance:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, digging up the mall was going to be a considerably large task for her and she was already quite worn out.

The Hellhound once again did not seem to care about the destruction as she put 100% of her attention to her female genitals. Stretching her head below, she extended her warm, slobbering tongue and gave herself a lick. She continued to push her tongue deep within her folds, getting a strong taste of her feminine juices. Pleasure shot through her entire body, making her pant heavily. Her \"lips\" were starting to get very swollen, making the distinct shape like a fortune cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, going into heat again\", she said to herself as she pulled her tongue away. A large glob of both saliva and female juices flew off her tongue and landed on the cell phone store across the street, instantly igniting it. \"How the heck am I suppose to find a male around here\" she thought angrily. Her fiery eyes then settled back on the mall in the distance. The last stores she dug up had a nice \"crunchy\" feeling to them. Rubbing her behind over such a large structure could probably satisfy her, for now. Or she could try to find something longer and thicker, resembling what a male keeps in his sheath.

She once again made a beeline to her destination, simply plowing through anything standing in her way. The quicker pace also meant every paw impact created considerably more damage, but she was getting hornier by the second and had to hurry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from the office building she just tore through, the Hellhound reached the mall parking lot. It was also packed with vehicles like the shopping center was. Although this time she was not interested in the cars and simply let her paws take care of flattening them. The flames from the burning gas tanks rose up and licked her body, giving her quite a tease as the flames passed between her legs. She couldn't take much more of this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the mall itself, she was surprised how short it was. It was about as tall as the first mounts she stomped through when she first entered this world. The main difference to her was that it was all one massive interconnected chunk. The Hellhound licked her chops and raised her tail, \"this thing should do nicely\" she thought to herself. She lowered her behind, crushing the asphalt and a few cars she had missed. With her puffy slit sitting against the ground, she began to pull herself forward. Her front paws crashed into the side of the mall as she dragged herself in the classic canine fashion. She made sure to keep her front paws to the side, as not to disturb the section of mall that was headed for her sensitive rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of thousands of dollars worth of products were rubbed up against her drooling vagina. Her juices were like lava, everything not crushed was incinerated. But not before giving her a satisfying sensation. Her tongue lulled out of her mouth, she was really enjoying herself. To her surprise, each time she dragged herself forward she felt a slightly different kind of pleasure, this was of course because she was smothering a different type of store. Clothing stores had all the fabric flame up, giving a warm feeling to her pussy while something like a camera store felt more firm on her snatch. Regardless, each section offered its own unique way of satisfying her genitals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of humans were hiding in the center of the mall. They heard crazy amounts of crashing and then smelled a particularly musky odor? Before they even had a chance to react, the scooting Hellhound was right on top of them. She didn't even notice that she \"ran over\" something different compared to the many other stores in the mall. Only charred husks remained after her pussy was done with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got to the end of the mall, she simply rotated herself to do another \"lap\" on the untouched areas. She ensured every square inch of mall was used to the fullest. Eventually, the entire mall was leveled, converted into a burning pit. With damages reaching the hundred's of million's and the death toll off the chart, she finally lifted herself off what use to be the mall. She gave her behind a shake, trying to get the last few pieces of debris off of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything reeked of burning, not to mention a healthy amount of musk. Her tongue lay out of her mouth as she panted and drooled heavily. \"Ahhh, that felt so goooood! That should hopefully keep me satisfied until I fine a mate, for a little while at least!\" she said to herself, as she trotted absentmindedly through a adjacent parking lot, igniting all the parked cars with each step.

She took a deep breath of the smoke and growled happily. Sure, she didn't end up finding any lava, but she still felt happy that her flames had helped fix such a gross and inhospitable moist environment. She hoped the small creatures appreciated her work in improving their home. Of course she had no idea not a single one survived her little visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sky growing dark, she decided to leave what was left of the burning town. With most of the structures destroyed, she wanted to explore some place new and untouched. She noticed another flat smooth path, but this one was much wider and leading away from the town. She began to walk along the highway with her paws digging into the asphalt. She liked how this path was illuminated by these small twigs, it made it much easier to see where she was going! Of course she failed to realize all the streetlights were collapsing behind her from the heat of her body. She also left massive molten craters with her paws, making the road impossible for cars to drive on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn either side of the path were no longer human made hives, but rather strange green plant things.

She did occasionally see a vehicle coming her way, which she excitingly chased down and squashed with her front paws. It offered a bit of excitement on this otherwise boring journey.

The Hellhound noticed more structures and figured she could use them for shelter. She ran off the highway, stepping on the muddy grass that further hurt her paws! Luckily, it was just a few short steps until she was back onto a hard surface, the runway. To her surprise she noticed that there where bird-like creatures laying about. One of these creatures seemed to be approaching her, letting out a loud screech! Her predator instincts suddenly went into overdrive, \"How dare this creature try to challenge me!!!\" She ran full force at the \"bird\" and it did the same to her. Fangs bearing, she grabbed the bird by the neck, tearing into the fuselage. The massive airliner came to a halt as the Hellhound bit into it. To her surprise, she was able to rip off the creatures \"head\" with ease, killing it. She almost wondered why something this weak would have challenged her in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, she noticed humans falling out of the wound. \"I guess this bird creature feeds on the humans\" she thought to herself. Which made sense as the human insect creatures seemed very much like a prey species, so it was only natural they are meant to be a food source for larger creatures, she figured. Tossing the carcass aside (which killed the planes passengers), she eyed a massive airplane hanger. It should be big enough to take shelter in! The \"battle\" that had taken place had distracted her from the pain as she ran over to the entrance of this den. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed another metallic bird like creature was inside. Knowing how weak the last one was, she bared her fangs and barked, as if saying \"This is my den now!\". She then proceeded to grab the plane by its \"neck\" and rip it apart. Tossing the now dead creature aside, she began to squeeze herself into the hanger. Various different pieces of equipment and smaller aircraft lit aflame. Despite the roof of the hanger heating up, the rain on the outside was actually able to cool it back down, keeping the entire structure intact. The Hellhound lay down, stretching her legs out, crushing more of the equipment inside. She laid her head on top of her front paws as she looked out the opening \"hopefully the sky stops peeing soon\" she said with a whine, not knowing what rain was. Soon after she fell into a deep sleep. She is then woken up by:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She walked outside and stretched, digging her paws into the pavement. It felt nice to feel the warmth of the sun on her fur after that rough night. She sat and gazed around the airport, unknowingly crushing a line of luggage carts with her behind.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe looked around and saw all of the bird like creatures were sleeping, they simply laid in the sun motionless. She also noticed none of those human insect creatures were around. \"I guess the bird's gobbled them all up\", the Hellhound thought to herself. She felt a bit sad, thinking about just how many humans these metallic birds must devour, especially judging from how many were in the gullet of the bird she killed yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her fiery eyes went wide. She could help the small humans by killing off a few of the bird predators who feed on them! She knew it's not her place to mess with the natural order of things, but she wanted to help the adorable insect creatures out.  She sees the airplanes in question were sitting there, still motionlessly asleep, now would be the perfect time to strike!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hellhound gingerly walked over to the closest aircraft and sank her burning fangs in the planes \"neck\", killing it. The weak metal tore open with ease, splitting the fuselage into two. She sniffed inside and noticed no humans, she figured they have all been digested and the birds haven't woken to eat yet. The Hellhound moved from airplane to airplane, ripping open the fuselage, crushing the wings and leaving a burning carcass. She was surprised none of the bird creatures woke up during her assault. Finally she finish ripping apart the last airplane in the airport. The Hellhound is happy to have killed off all of the human's predators, but in reality, she created hundreds of millions in damages and cut off an escape root many were hoping to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds and hundreds of people were watching the Hellhound in terror as she destroyed all the airplanes. They were all hiding in the airport's terminals, and were hoping to catch a flight to escape as they heard a disaster had struck the nearby town. Of course they never imagined the disaster would be stomping around right in front of them. They were all told by the airport's security to stay hidden in the terminal and not to leave.

Looking around, she noticed a tall control tower sticking out from the center of the airport's terminals. \"That looks perfect to mark!\" she happily barked to herself. She walked over to the edge of the terminals, casually crushing various airport vehicles along the way. Once she reached the edge of the buildings, she turned around and lifted her tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrine sprayed out of her swollen canine vagina. The fowl burning liquid was lava hot, it immediately set anything it touched ablaze. The stream of urine arced and perfectly hit the control tower, it then flowed downward and flooded all the terminals. The force alone cut massive grooves into the control tower and the urine burned all the humans alive. People further away from the center tried to run, but collapsed gagging at the strong smell until the expanding puddle of liquid enveloped them. The Hellhound just kept peeing away, completely unaware of the death and destruction she was causing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter emptying only a portion of her bladder, the Hellhound lowered her tail and turned around. She stretched her head over and took a deep whiff of the blazing control tower, knocking it over.

She could not smell/notice any of the humans, only the deep scent of her urine, which she was happy to confirm was enough to mark the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had her fun in the airport, she decides to move onward.

She can clearly smell the smoke emanating from the various crushed buildings. Sniffing further she can make out the distinct scent of not only another Hellhound, but the fragrance of musky male genitals! Her eyes light up and her backside pulsates, a male is just what she needs to help satisfy her heat! Without delay she sets off from the remains of the airport toward the human hive at full speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have time to find and follow another crunchy road like before, so she was opting to just run straight through the country side. Luckily the ground was less \"green\" and more brown and dry. Hundreds of acres of ready to harvest crops were set ablaze as she passed through them. As she got closer to the city, she noticed that the ground was starting to feel more \"crunchy\". The soft fields gave way to more human made structures that she was trampling over. Various suburbs were destroyed as she carved her own trail of fiery destruction, similar to the other Hellhounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she started to slow down as the buildings around her became taller, this forced her to walk along the paths as trying to plow through these buildings would have just slowed her down. She began to walk deeper into the the city, crushing various vehicles under her paws. The glass on the sides of the buildings began to crack from her intense heat. Her excited tail also crashed around, taking out huge chunks of buildings it impacted. Usually she would be very interested in the various human hives around her, but right now the nearby male was the only thing on her mind. Walking deeper still, the buildings around her now stood just past her head. She couldn't see the male, but she could definitely smell him nearby. She began to heavily drool as she took another deep whiff of his musk. She could also feel her genitals starting to moisten.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole place was like a maze! To get a better view, she began to use her paws and dig out the side of a building to collapse it. Cracks spread their way from where she was digging. Eventually the building moaned and fell over, killing all the humans within. Once the dust settled, she realized her view was blocked by even more buildings behind it. Changing tactics, she then tried to climb a different building to get a higher view. Her paws dug deeply into the side of the structure, killing many humans who were on that side of the building. Despite the destruction, it appeared like the building was going to hold her weight. Just as she was about to poke her head over the top, she felt everything crumble underneath her. This caused her to yelp as she fell backwards! Humans in a nearby building screamed in horror as the last thing they saw was the moist backside of the Hellhound. She toppled backwards onto two other buildings, completely leveling them. \"At least those hives softened my fall\" she thought to herself as she got up from the crushed remains of the buildings. She then shook off the rubble. Burning chunks of building went flying and impacted the nearby structures as she shook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, she needed to pick a way to get the other Hellhounds attention and get him to come to her. She had two in mind, but unbeknownst to her, both methods would be heavily lowering the local human population numbers: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew the one thing males could not get enough of, the wonderful scent of a female in heat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid down (while also unknowingly flattening a few buses full of people) and began to lick her private area. The smell of her heat was quite strong, but not strong enough to travel around all these tall \"hives\". \"They must be blocking the smell\" she thought to herself. This was quite true, her potent odor of her heat was getting trapped filtering inside the buildings, which caused people inside to gag at her stench. She looked again at the tall structures. She began to realize how they looked like perfect objects to mark. But with so many around, which one should she choose... \"I know!\" she barked happily as she got up, \"I'll just mark them all, that will get the males attention for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, she turned her behind to the closest building, raised her tail, and peed away. The powerful stream ripped through the building and instantly drenched everything inside. The fowl liquid quickly made its way to the lower floors, soaking everything until the ground level. She quickly cut off her stream, as she didn't want to empty her entire bladder. She looked back at the building to see a massive gaping hole carved out where her urine sprayed. The entire structure was also ablaze from the intense heat of her liquid. \"I'm sure these small creatures don't mind a little pee\", she said to herself reassuringly, as she walked over and began to casually drench another building with similar destructive results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long the entire street's buildings were soaked and aflame. The Hellhound shook her backside as she squirted out the last bit of urine she could muster. Truthfully, she didn't have to mark so many buildings, but she wanted to be more safe then sorry when it came to attracting the male Hellhound. Humans poured out onto the streets as they tried to escape the hellish inferno (and smell) the Hellhound had caused. \"Hehe, helping me find the male little ones?\" she barked softly, only to unknowingly crush dozens under each paw as she walked along the street. Satisfied with her work, she laid down, turning a large chunk of the packed street into a fine red paste under her belly. She looked up at the pheromone infused burning structures, quietly whining to herself \"Please show up. Please show Up. Please show up.\" Does her plan work? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The structures the Hellhound had marked started to collapse, burying the humans in the street trying to escape. Ignoring the humans, the Hellhound got to her feet and started looking around anxiously. She noticed a large smoke plume approaching from the distance. Excitingly, she took another whiff of the air. The males scent was as strong as its ever been! Around her, the sides of the unmarked hives now began to crack, with various vehicles making loud high pitch noises. \"It's as if the entire insect colony is excited as well!\" she thought to herself. Looking at the path of the smoke, it was going to appear in the next street over. She quickly scrambled to that relatively untouched street, which quickly lost its untouched status as the female entered it. She crushed various vehicles and small structures under her paws as she made her way over. At the end of this street, sat a massive skyscraper, twice as tall as the other ones she had urinated on. It was blocking her view of the approaching smoke plume. She stood there watching intently, frozen in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the massive structure ahead of her began to collapse, with chunks falling into the streets below. With a crash the entire thing came down. Destroying a hive that large would be very difficult for the female Hellhound, and she just saw it get taken down with such ease! She could make out two glowing eyes from the massive cloud of dust. Finally, the male revealed himself. He was massive, considerably larger then the female. He had jet black fur all over his body. Like the female he was fire based, which was quite apparent from the burning trail of destruction behind him, and the lava hot saliva leaking from his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He look's amazing!\" the female said to herself. She then lowered her head and caught sight of the males package. Two massive testicles swayed lazily from side to side as he walked. In front of them was a thick looking sheath, with a tip of pink peaking out. At this point the female could not contain herself any longer. She got up and raced towards the male, instantly putting her head in-between his legs and started sloppily licking his sheath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught the male by surprise, but he was definitely not going to argue. He simply spread his legs more and panted heavily, letting out the occasional grown. The female was in heaven, her senses were doused with the overwhelming power of the males musk and flavor. More of the males penis began to slide out of his sheath, and she was happy to coat it in her saliva as well. She thought things couldn't get any better, until she felt a long, thick, sloppy lick against her swollen, now dripping pussy. She let out a long whine as the male worked her over with his tongue. Both their tails where furiously wagging, slicing deeply into any buildings they hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious both creatures wanted sex, but where should they do it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These instincts told them to go find a roughly hidden place to mate, so they are not attacked by another animal during the process. The female looked around. Looking down the males trail of destruction gave her a much better view of the hive. She could make out what looks like the center of the hive, as well as an easy path to get there. At this location, she could see massive insect mounds that would tower over both of them. That place would be perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, the female saw the male lazily raise his hind leg. Out of the tip of his penis sprayed a thick stream of urine that drenched a nearby building. The stream was so strong it eroded away most of the structure, spilling piss out into the street below. The flow of the liquid crashed into other buildings and vehicles, burning the humans inside alive. The smell was so strong it covered up all of the females various markings. \"Males\", she said to herself almost rolling her eyes. He couldn't have an area smell like a creature other then himself! The female raised her tail high in the air and walked down the road towards her destination. Catching another sight of her swollen, wet lips, the male quickly followed, infatuated. He quickly grew a massive erection that bobbed side to side as he walked, leaking lava hot pre. The female laughed to herself, she knew who was really in charge! Although that didn't stop her from letting out a whine whenever the male gave her an occasional lick on her private area. Despite her desire to have another taste of the males genitals or to check out all the new insect mounts she was passing by, she was hard set on getting both of them to their destination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrations of both incoming Hellhounds had some humans trying to evacuate, meaning the roads were now completely clogged with traffic. The female simply trampled on-top of hundreds of stuck vehicles packed with humans without issue or care. Any survivors she had missed with her paws were quickly finished off by the larger male following her. Only paw prints with thin sheets of metal were left after the Hellhounds passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stomped further into the hive, the roads began to narrow. Since the female was smaller, she was able to squeeze by most of the buildings with just the glass cracking from her fiery heat. The larger male on the other hand, ended up fully ripping out the sides of the buildings with his larger girth. Humans trying to hide in the buildings would breathe a sigh of relief after the female walked by, only to have their lives ended by the following horny male. His massive shoulders dug into the sides of the buildings like they were tissue paper, crushing and then spilling the buildings contents onto the street. The male groaned deeply when chunks of debris would hit his erection, sending waves of pleasure throughout his body. By now he would have happily plunged his penis into any one of the surrounding buildings and humped away (something he had already done to other parts of the city earlier that day), but he had is eye on the moist, female prize in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for them to get to the epicenter of the human colony. The buildings all around them were reaching far beyond the heights of either Hellhounds. Usually the female would be very interested in checking out all of these cool insect creations, but she was far from caring about that. She only had one thing on her mind and she wanted it plunged DEEP into her pussy. They then decided to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The male didn't need any more of an invitation then that! He quickly gave her a few more wet licks in her folds for good measure, then proceeded to mount her. It took a few tries to get his penis in, with precum dripping everywhere. A few of the stray strands of cum landed on nearby luxury cars and limos, causing them to instantly explode. He eventually got himself lined up and penetrated her throbbing pussy, with a satisfying \"squelch\". Wasting no time, he started humping away vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the Hellhounds began panting and drooling heavily. \"This is way better then those crumbly things\", the male thought to himself, briefly remembering the buildings he had humped earlier that day in attempt to relieve his arousal. While he had barely been able to work up an orgasm with even the biggest of the buildings, he could barely hold back his load inside the females wet, warm, musky insides. The female on the other hand could barely think, she was in such need of this relief, her mind was completely lost in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans could not believe what they were seeing! The two massive dogs were now doing such a vile act right in the center of their precious city! Unfortunately for the humans, they were about to get a first hand lesson on the Hellhound mating process. Suddenly, the heat of the Hellhound's bodies began to increased by 10 fold. Everything within a 100 meter radius started to ignite from the intense heat. Vehicles melted/exploded, buildings were set aflame, humans suddenly found themselves on fire and burning to death. Unfortunately for the city, the Hellhounds were just getting started. The male began to hump faster, causing both their bodies to now glow a fiery red. More of the city started to crumble/burn, with humans desperately trying to escape. The vibration from the humping also caused various burning buildings to prematurely collapse, killing all within. Completely oblivious to the destruction and death around them, the two kept on mating, with the male increasing speed yet again. With all nearby humans burned up, only the sound of the males ballsack slapping his thigh could be heard as fires raged on. Both Hellhounds could now feel they were very close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final thrust, the male knotted the female, causing them both to orgasm. Impossibly hot shots of cum were squirted deep into the female. Simultaneously, a massive blast of heat emanated from both of their genitals, sending out a shock wave. This blast tore through the city, leveling anything in a 10 km radius. All the humans in that range were instantly turned to dust, and others were burned to death as the blast kept going on further. Both Hellhounds were so caught up in there mating they didn't even notice they completely wiped out the city. After some time, the male turned himself over and both Hellhounds stood behind to behind, still tied. The male was still sending squirts of hot love juice inside the female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female looked around, finally coming down from her intense orgasm, \"I thought there were big hives around here?...oh well I guess we can try to find more once the knot is out\" she said, trying to remember if the city had even existed at all. Her heat had greatly clouded her mind. Eventually the males knot shrunk enough that his dick plopped out with a wet squelch. The male walked over and nuzzled next to the female. Both fell into a deep sleep, surrounded by the charred remains of what use to be the metropolis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, both Hellhounds awoke to find:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Scanning around she noticed what was making the noise that woke her. In front of her was the male, who was very much awake, licking his private area. Slobbering sounds could be heard as he intently licked his sheath and balls, coating them in saliva. The female laughed quietly to herself, \"I guess he didn't get a chance to lick himself after we mated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the fires around them had finish burning. The female was surprised how the area they were in looked very much like the rocky, chard environment that was their home. She of course didn't realize everything once was human structures, that they had destroyed in their mating process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female let out a large stretch and walked over to the male. Suddenly, the females stomach let out a large rumbling sound. She wined softly as the feeling of hunger was finally hitting her, she hadn't eaten since entering this world and was starving! The male immediately took notice and began to sniff the air. He was more then ready and willing to provide for his new mate! He suddenly caught whiff of what he had been searching for, and set off at full speed. The female quickly followed, her instincts telling her to join the hunt for food. With that, both Hellhounds set off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after their journey started, the female was quite disappointed that their little oasis of \"chard ground\" soon ended. Her paws were back to stepping in that dreaded soft, moist, green stuff. The burned remains of the city felt great crunching under her paws. But luckily for her, the male was leading the way, and his paw prints were instantly drying out the ground before she stepped on it. Also not to mention, she had a great view of the males orbs, which she gave the occasional sniff as they ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey traveled for quite a while without encountering any of the humans. Sure, they saw the occasional small, lone hive, but the female didn't really care for them. She barely took noticed as they tore through a few of them that were in their path. Despite her view being blocked by the male, and his goods, the female Hellhound could tell they were approaching another city. She could feel the number of small hives she was crushing under her paws was increasing, meaning the humans structures were becoming more concentrated. She figured the male was bringing her to a colony so they could hunt regular sized creatures that prey on the small human insects. With how easy it is to stomp through their hives, surely their is a large number of local fauna (and maybe even flora) that use the humans as nourishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was interrupted as she noticed that she was stepping on solely small hives. At this point she opted to run alongside the male, as stepping on the untouched hives was more fun. The humans inside these homes had no time to react. One minute it sounded like a freight train was approaching, and the next they found themselves, and all their possessions, as stains on the Hellhounds paws. Those who were spared becoming paw prints found themselves caught in a blazing inferno, spreading from their trail of destruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this clearer view of the approaching city, the female realized: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Hellhounds suddenly skidded to a stop. Roughly 20 homes where flattened as they ran out of momentum. Ahead of them was a city, just like the female had predicted. It was smaller then the last one they mated in, but was still a considerable size. What was also a considerable size was the creature that was stomping around in the middle of it! A male Warthog, roughly twice the size as the male Hellhound, was just visible over the tallest skyscrapers. Crashing and faint humans screams could be heard from the city as he ravaged it. He was creating millions of dollars in damages by the minute! Smoke was billowing from multiple different areas, suggesting he had already been their quite a while and had definitely lowered the local human population numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female became quite curious as she watched the creature lay waste to the city. This was the first time they ran into a regularly sized creature of this world that wasn't made of that strange metallic flesh. The female had always been quite curious of the humans, and to extend to their predators. How could these creatures, with no natural defenses, survive against regular sized animals? At least ants live underground and wasps have stingers. Perhaps they breed a lot and have very short life spans, she thought to herself. She sniffed the air, picking up a very pungent odor from the city. The Warthog had DEFINITELY marked the city multiple times with his urine, as well as had a couple of healthy sized bowel movements. Strange that none of the other colonies they had explored were marked with these odors, perhaps the humans had cleared up the animal waste by feeding on it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes then widened. Could the humans be purposely attracting animals with their easy to ravage hives, only to hope that the creature will relieve itself, so the human insects could feed on the droppings? These creatures were insects after all, and insects love animal feces! Her behind then pulsated, she would definitely test this theory next time they found an untouched colony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her deep thought was interrupted as her stomach growled again, reminding her of her hunger. She then realized that the birds (airliners) she had encountered at the airport were made of inedible flesh, but this Warthog was something they could EAT! She crouched down, to be more stealthy, crushing a large luxury home with her behind. The male had already been in a crouched position, crushing a garage full of sport cars under his sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the female didn't realize, is that the Warthog was of course not native to this world. It had also come through a portal and had been spending his time exploring around, much to the human's dismay. Unlike the Hellhound's fire based world, this creature hailed from a very moist, jungle type environment. This also explains why he was slightly larger then even the mighty male Hellhound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hellhounds continue to observe the Warthog. The male Hellhound was trying to calculate a plan of attack, while the female, despite being the hungry one, was still curious how exactly it was plundering the human hives. Suddenly, a massive skyscraper shifted and fell over, knocking down two others with it. Happy with the better view, both Hellhounds could see what the Warthog was doing to wreck the city. He was:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From what they could tell, he was covered in thin brown hairs. The reason it was hard to tell the Warthog's color, was the fact that he was mostly coated in some kind of grey mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange, why would the humans build a hive around a puddle of mud?\" The female thought to herself. \"Usually, humans liked their hives to be very dry and clean.\" The female then got her answer, as she saw the Warthog slash a building of luxury condos with his tusk, bringing it crashing down. He then appeared to be stomping on the wrecked structure? \"Oh I get it!\" The female thought to herself, \"He's converting the human habitat into his own!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the female Hellhound was quite correct in her assumptions. The Warthog had been quite busy transforming the human's sprawling city into nothing more then a mud pit. In the Warthog's world, he would wallow in piles of mud to protect himself from insects and the harsh sun. After stomping around a bit, the Warthog discovered the human city. The inhabitants of this city were getting ready to enjoy a fun day by the lake that sat at the cities edge. Unfortunately for them, the Warthog saw their city's buildings as nothing more then dry dirt deposits. Once the Warthog noticed the \"puddle\" next to them, his instincts told him what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Warthog had waded into the shallow puddle. The stench of the Warthogs body alone started to get the citizens attention, as they began to plug their noses. Suddenly the Warthog began to splash great waves of water onto the city. Streets flooded and many people outside drowned, but overall the city was unscathed. Well, it didn't stay that way for long, as the mighty Warthog then trotted his way into the city. He used his mighty tusks, snout and feet, to crush and ground up the buildings, an inadvertently, their occupants. The Warthog was also happy to see with a bit of digging, natural springs spurt out more water, as he broke various water mains. Once he started mixing the crumbling debris of the buildings with the water from the lake, it didn't take long for him to create the consistency of mud he was looking for. With that, he got started on wiping out the rest of the city, doing his best to ignore the annoying human cries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hellhounds now felt confident enough to begin their approach. They started to crawl forward, still crouched down, towards the Warthog. They could feel the homes of the residential area getting crushed beneath them. Despite their best effort to crawl carefully, they were still leaving a large trail of burning flattened homes. They had to be very careful as the smoke could easily give their position away to the Warthog. The males predatory mind had an idea. Looking around, he spotted a massive 500ft tall Ferris wheel. It was part of a huge amusement park on the other edge of the city. The male stood up, facing the area. Suddenly the flames in his eyes grew more intense, and a fierce glow could be seen from his opened mouth! A massive ball of fire shot out of the males chops and silently went flying toward the Ferris wheel, hitting it right in the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball of fire exploded, covering the entire area with flame! Thousands of humans in the park screamed in pain as they were all brutally burned to death. The male Hellhound then saw the Ferris wheel buckle and collapse from the heat. He looked over to the female Hellhound. He was happy to see she looked impressed, as she wagged her tail, wrecking more homes. Roller coasters, rides and other attractions all burned to create a massive, thick, dark, smoke plume. Does the burning amusement park work as a distraction for the Warthog?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Warthog suddenly stopped demolishing a multilevel car park and looked intently at the fire. He wanted to make sure whatever creature was razing the area didn't notice or approach him. Both Hellhounds took notice that the Warthogs attention was drawn away and continued on their approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Hellhounds made it into the city, they could get a good view of the fruit of the Warthog's labor. Most of the center part of the city had been leveled and grounded into moist looking mud. The colony was barely recognizable. Only a thin layer of skyscrapers around the edge of the city remained, and they reeked of the Warthog's urine. \"He is definitely trying to mark the human's hives as his!\" the female thought. She then looked at the soup of mud and cringed, not only would it be painful for the fire based Hellhounds to get the mud on them, but it would also be hard to get out of their fur!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then looked directly at the Warthog itself, finally getting a full unobstructed view. By now he had lost interest in the amusement park, no longer seeing it as a threat. The Warthog had gone back to his destructive work, grunting happily. He was so focused on smashing up a bank, that he did not notice the two Hellhounds. He used his large tusks and snout to tear the building down. Money and gold bars spilled out as the Warthog tore open the vault, only to have him stomp it down into his muddy concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer, the Hellhounds could see the mud coating on the Warthog. They could easily see that it was made up of chunks of building, flattened vehicles, sections of road and many MANY other human made objects. These were all stuck to the Warthogs back, sides, face and genitals. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of human creations, all turned into a simple mud coating. The Warthog was also dotted with thousands and thousands of small red stains, crushed humans. \"How interesting that this creature evolved to use the humans in this way\", the female Hellhound thinks to herself. She is sad to see so many of them die, but she knows she can't get upset as it must be the natural order of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of natural order, the Hellhound's had their own part to keep, as they proceeded with hunting the Warthog. With a grunt from the male, both Hellhounds separated and began to surround the Warthog. They walked on the outskirts of the city, hidden behind a few of the remaining skyscrapers, and avoiding the wet mud. They walk softly and slowly with their paws. They were so deep in concentration, they didn't even feel the many humans trying to flee the city, getting trampled under them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hellhound's stealthily position themselves to the left and right of the Warthog, with only an office building hiding each of them from view. The Hellhounds peered through the building's windows. They see humans inside shivering in fear, as well as the Warthog through the windows on the other side. The female grunts quietly, as if to say \"Wish me luck humans\". She then crouches down, ready to pounce. On the males mark, both Hellhounds leap, ripping through the buildings hiding them. The Warthog squeals in surprise! The male has his jaws open, going for the Warthog's neck! The female aims for his back! Do their attacks land?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Industrial buildings and smokestacks that emitted great plumes of smoke drew her attention so she wandered nearer to investigate. The acrid air around the area reminded her of her original habitat and she figured that this would be the best spot to dig. Just to make sure, she stuck her noise against the ground and took a deep whiff, her heated presence creating volatile reactions in the buildings below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a surprised yelp when one of the buildings suddenly exploded, coating her in a plume of powerful fire, the flames wrapping around her in a strange mixture of yellow and green before dispersing into a sickly grey cloud. Taking another step, a similar event happened as a bunch of cylindrical containers near her paw began to violently combust. This must be the place, she thought. With this much smoke and fire bursting from the ground, magma had to be just below the surface!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling over the district and leaning down, she began to dig her paws into the ground. The crunchy buildings were instantly demolished and the topsoil was flung off to the far side of the city as she rapidly battered the ground with her front paws.

She moved from one spot to another, eliciting more extravagant explosions from the chemicals stored below while she searched for a good spot to bring heat to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was determined to bring warmth to this cold world.

The humans had entertained him and provided him with some nourishment. But still he need more. Sniffing the air the Hellhound sensed more humans in the distance. He grinned and headed for them.

Curious giants enter such portals to find themselves on a planet of a smaller scale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is from a <span class=\"cgreen\"><b><i>third person perspective - He/She/They</i></b></span>. <span class=\"clred\"><u>Not</u> first (I) or second (You) perspectives.</span>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo giant humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny giant animal of any species, real, extinct, mythological or fictional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny body type Feral, Anthro or even Taurs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight can vary from a few hundred feet to five thousand feet. However, the size scale needs to stay the same for a storyline. <br>\r\nUnless of course there is a 'normal' size difference A 3ft Feral Wolf to a 8ft anthro Lion. But no 200ft Wolves with a 2500ft one in<br>\r\nthe same storyline! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Anthros &amp; Taurs can be from any time period/culture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeral animals maybe either wild, pet/companions for the anthros/Taurs or sentient. <br>\r\nPets/companions may have collars, harnesses saddles etc. Whilst wild of course won't have anything artificial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanguage - For simplicity <i>all</i> characters 'speak' English. Though in reality the giants have their own languages it will<br>\r\nbe difficult to make up several new languages. Humans won't understand a giant and vice versa though to us they would both<br>\r\nbe talking clear English <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'small' planet is basically modern Earth with humans but it's not Earth Itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal places, landmarks, buildings etc. Can be used as a reference in the story though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew portals may open up to remove/add giants, for some reason humans can't be transported through the portals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story can change to follow a new giant instead, but try to leave an option to still follow the previous giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny theme allowed. The giants can be harmed/ killed by each other or by humans, they aren't invincible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and 'attack' isn't always accurate. The giants could be friendly or curious but a 500ft tall giant is going to cause some damage even if it's unintentional. </td>",
