And, odds are, you've never met anyone like me before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my story began, I was 17, a senior at Pierce High. I was the oldest of three children, all girls. Sam was 14, and Becca was 12. A lot of people just meeting the family mistook Sam for the oldest, and Becca for my twin sister. That's because I was so short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't believe I was ever short? Well, I was: 5', 0\". Not only was I the shortest girl in my senior class, I was the shortest girl in Pierce High, quite possibly the shortest ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing short was a pain. Always having to show my ID to prove I was old enough. And <i>constantly</i> being overlooked (\"Oh, sorry, didn't see you there.\" Repeat to infinity.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all that changed, forever, because of a class trip... </span></div></div>",

As it was, I couldn't see anything that the guide was pointing out, because I was surrounded by my fellow students. Shortest one in the class, remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there,\" said the guide, \"we are working on a revolutionary new fertilizer. We hope to be able to grow fruits and vegetables much larger than normally, and in a fraction of the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sounds interesting,</i> I thought. <i>Too bad I don't have a chance in hell of seeing it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, we kept going for a while longer, until my purse strap came undone. \"Hold up,\" I called, as I put it back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I had done so, however, I looked up to find no sign of the rest of the class. <i>They don't notice when I'm </i>there,<i> why would they notice when I'm</i> not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wandered around, trying to find some sign of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy wandering took me into what looked like a greenhouse. Aisle after aisle of fruits and veggies. <i>This is as good a place to wait as anywhere else,</i> I thought, helping myself to a strawberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, I was sprayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't think of what it could possibly be. All I knew was that it reeked to high heaven, and it felt simultaneously hot and cold as it soaked through my clothes. \"Help!\" I screamed, and discovered that it tasted even worse than it smelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how long I was sprayed for, but somebody finally shut it off, and I was grabbed by people in hazmat suits. I couldn't hear much, with my ears full of that stuff, but I picked up \"untested on animal life,\" and assorted questions about why the doors weren't locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was carried off to the showers, where three of the hazmat team stripped me naked and scrubbed me, under water that was so hot that it felt like I was being scalded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end of the shower was no relief, as they immediately poured something down my throat. \"It's an emetic,\" said a woman. Before I could ask what an emetic was, I found out, by immediately puking my guts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was finally dressed in some scrubs, with the cuffs rolled up. \"You should be alright,\" said the same woman who gave me the emetic, a woman Mom's age. \"If you notice anything out of the ordinary, contact us immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was finally reunited with the tour group, and got to hear endless variations on \"Nice outfit, Short Stuff.\"</span></div></div>",

That's how my whole body felt on the third day after the accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was glad it was the weekend; that meant I could maybe take a long, warm bath (the chemical plant had altered my definition of <i>hot</i>, as well as souring me on showers for the foreseeable future). I threw off the covers and sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I noticed it: my pajamas were tight. And I mean <i>tight</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked in my full-length mirror, and I couldn't believe it. My top was straining to contain my boobs, and my bottoms were riding up on my calves like I thought a flood was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had my pajamas shrunk while I was wearing them? Or could it be... ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed a pencil and went to the door frame, where Mom had marked off my height until it became clear that I had stopped growing. Standing against the door frame, I marked off where I stood, then turned to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt about it, I had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking out a ruler, I measured the difference. \"Three inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now 5', 3\" tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran downstairs to tell Mom and Dad.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, I did not receive the response I was hoping for. Most of the girls my age merely giggled, telling me that I got lucky. The boys were not impressed at all, telling me that i was still the shortest kid in school. Apparently, three inches was only a big deal to me. I was approached by one of the teachers, Ms. Swanson, who pulled me aside to talk to me. She was beautiful, with long flowing auburn hair and gentle blue eyes. Standing at seven feet even, she was the tallest woman I had ever met. She taught world history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not, I, too, was the shortest kid in my class, Summer.\" Softly, she said. \"A lot of people called me Short Stuff, and Half Pint...\" She sighed, maintaining her smile. \"It did hurt, so I understand your excitement, growing a whole three inches overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad told me not to get my hopes up in getting much taller, but I have hope...\" Tearfully, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't hurt to dream, Summer.\" Smiling, Ms. Swanson said. \"Being tall in height is not as important as being big at heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Swanson and I shared a hug, making me feel better. As we broke the hug, she whispered to me, \"I have a feeling your growth spurts are just beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made me feel a lot better, though I wondered how she possibly could know for certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up the next morning to discover...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was when i lost it, crying and shivering from the betrayal and fear. I only stopped when Ms Swanson spoke. \"When your parents told me that you were going on a date with Kyle, I knew that you would need some help.\" Serious, she said. \"Kyle is known for leaving girls hanging after the first date. Had I known he asked you out, I would have warned you.\" She paused. \"Did you and he make love...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, I nodded. \"How- How did you know?\" Shivering, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents and I have been friends for years.\" Smiling, Ms Swanson replied. \"When they are concerned, they call me for advice, and I do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"How did you know about Kyle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Swanson sighed. \"A lot of girls come to me when they are distraught, because of my size.\" Calmly, she replied. \"They feel safe with me, as most of the boys and men fear me.\" She let out a low giggle. \"If they only knew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they only knew what?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was the runt of my family.\" Honestly, Ms Swanson said. \"If they think I'm tall,...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say I was surprised would have been an understatement. \"Do- Do you know why I'm growing so fast, Ms Swanson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hesitate to even guess, Summer.\" Serious, Ms Swanson replied. \"I'm a history teacher, not a doctor, I suggest you seek professional help.\" She then handed me a small bag. \"These are some clothes I used to wear when I was around your age, they should fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clothes, I blushed slightly, seeing that they were all custom made to stretch to fit several sizes bigger than myself. \"Thank- thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Swanson smiled kindly. \"You are welcome, and don't worry about Kyle.\" Softly, she said. \"First, he's sterile, so there is no chance of you being pregnant. Also, I have already notified his parents of his latest stunt. He is on thin ice with them as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was scared...\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make excuses for those who wrong you.\" Scolding, Ms Swanson said. \"It only makes you more of a victim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to get dressed in the new clothing Ms Swanson gave me before she got me home, and was carried by her into the house. There, Mom and Dad were both concerned and angry after she told them what had happened. \"Don't blame your daughter for this.\" Serious, Ms Swanson said. \"Kyle has a way to sort of hypnotize his victims with a silver tongue. She was victimized, just like a lot of other girls were by him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least he's sterile.\" Angry, Mom said. She turned to me. \"You need to be more careful with your choice of dates, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom...\" Crying, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of that.\" Serious, Dad said. \"Summer is the victim here, and we need to take steps to see that it does not happen again.\" He then turned to me. \"If Kyle ever gives you any trouble, you call me right away, is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, though still crying. \"Yes, Dad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded, satisfied. \"I'll make you some hot chocolate, with extra marshmallows, and then you are going straight to the emergency room.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Then I got this horrible pain all over my body, and I grew another three inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where is he now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"He left me on Old Town Road with nothing but a ratty blanket. I don't care where he is right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse brought Dr. Phillips a sheet of paper. \"Well, that can't be right. I'm going to have to redo this, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave her another blood sample.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dr. Phillips got the results from this second test, she called Mom and Dad back in. \"I'm admitting Summer,\" she said. \"There's a hormone in her system that I've never seen before, and the levels are... astronomical.

I couldn't use the bathroom, because they wanted to study my pee and my poo. (Seriously, they did that.) They looked at everything I ate and drank, and, if I left something, they studied it. And they made me exercise, and you can bet your ass they observed that, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you looking for?\" I asked during one session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you know when I see it,\" the nurse observing me replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been two days,\" I said. \"I promise, if this thing had an on/off switch, I would have duct taped it down before Friday night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad picked that moment to visit. \"How are you doing, sweetie?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I don't go stir crazy,\" I answered, \"I'll go crazy from paranoia.\" I took a sip from a water bottle. \"You wouldn't believe what people here find inter-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was interrupted by an explosion of agony all over my body, and I cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse sprang into action. \"Summer?

This time, I could feel my body swelling to its new proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I could stand, my nurse put me against the wall and measured me.

There, she was doused in a revolutionary new hormone designed to stimulate growth in plants. We thought we had taken sufficient steps to prevent any negative effects. Unfortunately, we were wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the hormone we found in your system Friday night, Summer,\" added Dr. Phillips. \"And it's that hormone that's driving your growth now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Mom said. \"So it's this hormone that's causing my daughter problems.

However, the front door took up two stories, which gave a hint of the true nature of the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon walking in, I was awestruck to find the house was a single story, with three story high painted ceilings.

Everyone began to relax as Grandma turned to me. \"What Grandpa is trying to say is that you are welcome to stay here with us when you outgrow your parent's house.\" Calmly, she said. \"We have a spare bedroom for guests we can make to accommodate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI teared up, smiling. \"It's a beautiful house, Grandma and Grandpa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear you say that.\" Smiling, grandpa said. \"When my siblings come to visit, they always ask me, <i>Couldn't you have found anything bigger, half-pint?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your siblings call you half-pint?\" Surprised, I asked. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa motioned to a large framed photograph on the wall. \"The same reason your siblings call you short-stuff.\" Simply, he said. \"My father is nearly one hundred feet tall, with my older brother close to fifty feet.\" He sighed. \"The 'giant gene' skips a generation here and there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you're a Guinness Book of World Records holder...\" Feeling faint, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa shook his head. \"Nominated for the book, not added.\" Serious, he countered. \"That rumor was a joke from my younger brother, who stood at forty feet the last time I saw him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the photograph of Grandpa literally being dwarfed by his parents and siblings became too much for me.

And still I grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to tower over skyscrapers, knocking them over with every move. I just kept growing, destroying more and more under my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, there was no longer a planet Earth. Instead, the new third planet from the sun was Summer Roberts. And I was still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes, not wanting to see any more of the destruction wreaked by my growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes. Mom was standing over me. I was in my bedroom. It was just a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled Mom to me. \"Don't go,\" I begged, \"don't go, don't go, don't go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I destroyed everything, I grew so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom ran her fingers through my hair. \"You know you won't grow like that. It was just a dream, Summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked into Mom's eyes. \"I don't think I want to take those pills anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bad, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any pain is better than dreams like... oh, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll give the pills this much, all I felt was the swelling as I grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I could stand, I marked my height myself, and I measured myself: 6', 6\". \"I still don't want to take those pills anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Summer, we'll find something else. Now, since you've stopped growing again, how about I go get us lunch? Six cheeseburgers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight. Alright, I'll be back.\"</span></div></div>",

Second, he or she will grow up seeing you as however tall you will become, and find it natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be a different story if your child was adopted.\" Serious, Grandma added. \"However, in this case, you have nothing to dread, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam breathed a slight sigh of relief, though she was still worried. Grandpa chuckled, seeing it. \"There are a lot of giants in your family, Sam.\" Kindly, he said. \"I'll give a few a call, and maybe one will pay you a visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, we tend to stay out of the spotlight.\" Grinning, Grandma said. \"Too much attention can be a bad thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough about that.\" Smiling, Grandpa said.

I thanked Ms. Swanson for the ride and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I closed the door, I had a growth spurt. However, this one was bigger than previous spurts had been. My clothes were a wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went straight to my room and measured myself. \"Seven and a half feet!\" I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI double-checked it.

Mom, Dad, Becca, and Sam all cried with me here and there, as we hugged each other more than a few times, as we filled my bags to leave the house. \"Will you visit me here and there?\" Tearfully, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we will.\" With a tearful smile, Mom said. \"I'll also call you every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll likely be with you in a few weeks.\" Tearfully, Sam added. \"With a little one on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, we heard a loud horn outside. I peered through the window to receive another surprise. There was a huge silver truck in the road in front of my house! It looked like it had come straight out of a science fiction novel. The cab was five times bigger than any pickup truck I had ever seen, and it was a four door. The wheels were enormous, and it had a hitch in the back for a camper, which i could only imagine what it looked like. Mom and I walked out, with luggage in hand, where Grandpa stepped out to greet us. I giggled seeing the license plate, <i>Big Boy</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like her?\" Smiling, Grandpa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's beautiful.\" Smiling, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa grinned before tossing me the keys.... another surprise. \"You- You want me to drive?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have your license, don't you?\" Still smiling, Grandpa countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Well, yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the truck is all yours, for as long as you can fit in it.\" Smiling, Grandpa said. \"You need a way to get around without having to cram yourself into tight places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI teared up and hugged Grandpa before he helped load the back seat with the luggage. After giving everyone one last hug goodbye, I got behind the wheel of the big pickup. There was plenty of room, in fact, I had to adjust the seat to reach the pedals. \"I thought I would never drive again.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa laughed. \"You should see my brother's truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I drove the truck away from home to Grandma and Grandpa's.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I ordered a dozen of the biggest sandwiches they had to offer, along with a dozen large beverages. After paying for and getting them, I drove to a park and made a sort of picnic of it. I took off my shoes, and let my toes play in the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little girl, maybe about 4 or 5, came up to me. \"You're a big lady,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, indeed,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I come from a big family.

Supposedly, it would create an optical illusion that others would interpret as you being taller. Well, I tried it, with a belly shirt and a thigh-high skirt, and I didn't even dare to leave the house. I thought I looked like a little kid who decided to put on her slutty sister's clothes for a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo imagine my surprise when, among my clothes for when I was twice as tall as when I made that experiment, I found a belly shirt and a thigh-high skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I tried them on, and, to my surprise, I felt comfortable in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mentioned this to Grandma, and she said, \"Well, Summer, there are those girls in your grandfather's family who, as they grew, felt more comfortable wearing proportionally less clothing. It looks like you're taking after them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the bigger I got, the less of me that I would want covered up. I thought of the movie, <i>Attack of the 50 Foot Woman</i>, where the title character went from wearing full-length dresses at her normal height to wearing almost a bed sheet bikini when it was time for the titular attack. \"Do they ever get so big that they just say 'Forget it' and walk around in their birthday suits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few of them do, yes,\" Grandpa replied.</span></div></div>",

He Hi Ho Hum, Fee Fie Foe Fum, feast and be merry with friendship and rum...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, he had Joey, Ashley, Cathy and even me singing along with him.

Joey was smiling ear to ear as Grandpa put him back down. Not only for getting his balloon back, for being picked up by a real giant. \"It must be awesome to be a giant!\" Happily, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa sighed. \"It has some advantages.\" Softly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed a gentle hand onto his shoulder, knowing he was short among his family of giants. \"You are the greatest giant in my book, Grandpa.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa smiled, a tear forming. \"Thank you, pumpkin.\" Hugging me, he said. \"That means more than you realize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you had a change in fashion sense.\" Smiling, Cathy said. \"Trying to attract a certain giant boy we haven't met yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, while grandpa laughed. \"If she is, I haven't met him yet, either.\" Nudging me, he teased. \"I guess we will have to wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa...\" Blushing, I protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better move along before we embarrass her further.\" Smiling, Cathy said. \"It was nice to meet you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, my dear.\" Smiling back, Grandpa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Grandpa and I finished our walk in the park where, to my surprise, we saw Mom...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It no longer looked like an airplane hangar, but an actual house! Grandpa chuckled as I stepped out of the truck with my jaw half open. \"How...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave my brothers a call.\" Smiling, Grandpa said. \"They and their kids renovated the place into a real workable home for you.\" He motioned to the house. \"Take a look at your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith family and friends following, I first walked up onto an open patio by the front door, where I found furniture both my size and normal size for guests.

Further in was a giant kitchen with a stove that was actually my size!  In even further, I spotted a door that led into a bedroom, which I assumed had an en suite. It was like a sequence in a dream. I felt... <i>normal.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Grandpa, giving him a hug. \"Thank you so much!\" Crying, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't you start.\" Lightly scolding, Grandpa said. \"You'll get me started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like it, Summer?\" Startling me, a booming voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find my great uncles, Ron and Don. Both stood at a good fifty feet tall, towering over even me. \"It's been a while since I had to look up to someone.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon chuckled. \"I have a feeling that won't last.\" Kindly, he said. \"Your grandfather may not be the tallest of giants, but believe me,... he is among the strongest, he'll outlive us all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa blushed slightly at that. \"I do try not to brag...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had a laugh at that before I took notice of a second living space above me, for family and friends who may come to visit. \"You did all of this for me?\" Tearing up again, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We giants stick together, kiddo.\" Roughing up my hair, Ron said. \"Everything custom built by us and others like us, to lead a normal life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be surprised how much certain people would pay to have a giant as a bodyguard, or to help with heavy lifting at a construction site or lumber yard.\" Smiling, Don added. \"That, and it does not take much persuasion to keep us a closely guarded secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect!\" Tears falling, I said. \"Thank you, all of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our pleasure, little lady.\" Kindly, Ron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I walked up Old Town Road, I was struck by the beautiful view. <i>No wonder kids choose this place for their first time,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though, I knew that it could all go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as I approached the spot where I had lost my virginity to Kyle Dennis, I saw a girl who couldn't have been a day over 16. She was walking toward the safety barrier, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned, not expecting anybody in particular. Then her eyes went wide, taking in all of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time, she was silent, as if questioning if she could possibly have heard me right. Then, she said, \"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I decided to have lunch up here. Since you're already here, you're welcome to join me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, that uncomprehending look. Then, she stepped away from the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I laid out my lunch, she came closer. \"Are you real?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better be,\" I replied, \"or what am I doing eating so much? Have a seat. Help yourself, if you want. Builds bodies twelve ways, I heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed at the ham, then nibbled some of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" I asked, \"why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So's my younger sister. Four months along, now. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom's gonna kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds harsh. Did she say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... But she didn't want this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my folks didn't want for my sister to get pregnant. But she did, and now they're all waiting for the big day together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't kick her out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Well, she doesn't live with them anymore, but that's because she grew too tall for the house. I can relate. It's okay, though, she lives with our grandparents now. Grandpa's got a big place. I lived there, myself, until I outgrew it, too. Don't worry, though, my sister's not going to be this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good question. I used to hang out at the park in town, and I would talk to people there. Now, though, it's a little far away. So, I came here, and I saw you, so I guess I figured, Maybe I can re-create that here. How's it working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"You are such a big dork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to be, don't I? Okay, maybe I don't have to be a dork, but I have to be a big one, right? My name's Summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to meet you, Alex. Glad you came away from the ledge, too. See, I didn't just happen to be here. I'm with Search and Rescue, and they needed someone who could get here easier than they could. How's my first day going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was back to uncomprehending silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" I said, \"if somebody asked you yesterday, you'd have sworn there was no way you were going to meet a 25-foot-tall teenage girl. And you'd have been wrong. So maybe your mom won't really kill you. Maybe she won't even yell at you. Maybe she'll be a little sad that it happened this way, but she'll be glad you came to her about it. Like meeting a giantess, the only way to find out is if you're alive to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't say anything. She just picked up some food, took it to her car, and drove to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think my first day started off well.</span></div></div>",

I took off toward the sound, not caring if I triggered a growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got closer, I could see a spot where it looked like a car had gone off the cliff. Looking down, I saw the car. I heard someone calling 911, so it looked like at least one person might not be seriously hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, I climbed down, next to the car. \"Hi,\" I said. \"You guys okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy riding shotgun said, \"Send help soon. I thought I was okay, but I'm looking at this babe, and she's 30 feet tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only 25 feet tall, last I checked,\" I replied. \"Summer Roberts. I'm with Search and Rescue?  You, on the phone, are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm going to hold out my hand, and you climb into it, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did, and I lifted him to the edge of the cliff. \"Now, as long as you're on the horn, ask them to walk me through rescuing your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's unconscious, and bleeding from the head. Okay, they say he needs to be taken out of there gently, so have whatever you're going to use to lift him under his body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the driver's side door, and let him fall into my hand. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the count of three, get him all the way on, as smoothly as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn three, I pulled him all the way onto my hand. \"So far, so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, <i>gently</i> bring him up where the ground is flat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed back up. I could hear sirens approaching. \"Okay,\" I said, \"here come the others. I'll just sit tight until they're ready to take him off my hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ambulance came, and so did a TV news crew. They were less interested in the fact that people had survived an accident, than in the giant woman who had just saved them. I politely answered a few questions, then left for home. When I got there, I found that the stress of the situation had actually put me through enough that I had shot up two whole feet.</span></div></div>",

An all-you-can-eat buffet could certainly feed me, but it seemed cruel to the owners. Besides, where would I sit? Mr. Franklin and his identical brothers might smooth some things over, but they can't make a place accommodate Hugh Jass, if you know what I mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, inspiration struck Jason. He told me to take him to a supermarket, where he emerged with several shopping bags. Then, he directed me to the beach.

I was more than a bit surprised, though, when I got to Old Town Road and found Ms. Swanson waiting for me. \"What's going on?\" I asked. \"I thought you had school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"It's summer, Summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start, I realized she was right. Since outgrowing the school, I realized that the days just seemed to run together. I set out my lunch, and we decided to eat while I waited for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we ate, I asked, \"What made Jason grow? He had given up on reaching giant size; next thing you know, he's almost doubled in size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When giants start out at a more conventional size,\" Ms. Swanson explained, \"it takes a catalyst to get them growing. For you, it was being doused in a fertilizer made from the fermented fruits that made the first giants grow. For Sam, it was getting pregnant, and finding a grown-up responsibility on her shoulders. I haven't met Jason yet, but, from what you've said about him, I think I can make an educated guess what's spurred his growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't keep me in suspense, ma'am. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best and most powerful of all catalysts, Summer: true love. He has found the one, and his body is growing to contain his love and happiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt like I had left the ground. It's one thing to realize you love someone: it's quite another to find out that they love you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur lunch was interrupted by a cry for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like we've got another amateur climber,\" I said, getting up. \"They hear about how dangerous the cliff is, and they all think they're Tom Cruise or somebody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hunkered down at the cliff and asked the man, \"Would you prefer to be up or down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked down, so I climbed down, collected him, and put him on the ground, not far from his car. Then I climbed back up: I was hardly an experienced climber, but I had an advantage: at my size, the 80-foot drop would not be fatal.</span></div></div>",

Your grandpa's teaching Becca how to handle her new strength. And she'll need new clothes: she's got a body like a weightlifter, now. Anyway , what's new with you? Did Jason call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I got so worked up about the message, I actually forgot about that.

It was to be held in an isolated valley, the southern side of which was only viewable from Old Town Road. This was a place cut off to all most of the year, due to its being a treasured national monument known as Chapel Mountain. It was called this because of the tiny church one minister had built at the top, with an insane view of the northern end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison Hayes had to have something to do with this.\" Smiling slightly, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out to the valley, where I met Grandma waiting for me at the impressively large entrance to Faith Cave in Chapel Mountain. It was over a hundred feet tall and thirty feet wide, making it easy for me to enter. \"No one is allowed in here during the winter season, as ice sheets from the mountain have been known to seal the entrance until spring thaw.\" Serious, she said. \"Only, because it is summer, we were given permission to hold the bridal shower here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been in here.\" Curious, I said. \"What makes this place so...\" Then I saw what was inside the cave and, with a shaking voice, finished, \"... special...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith Cave was a huge crystal cave that looked much like the inside of an ice castle straight out of a fantasy novel. The light from the entrance and various tunnels leading to the outside made the air inside sparkle like magic. \"This is where your grandfather proposed to me.\" Smiling, Grandma said. \"How could I say no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the bridal shower began with fun games, mostly aimed at poking fun of boys in general, as well as celebrating our lives as independent women and girls. Of course, we had to keep it kid-friendly due to Ashley and Joey, but that did not stop Aunt Marge from throwing in a joke that was over the kids' heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how Jason will handle the exotic dancers I hired for his bachelor party?\" Teasing, she stated. She giggled when I turned to her, startled. \"Just kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all laughed at that, though Ashley and Joey were fortunately confused. \"What's exotic mean...?\" Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all laughed harder and replied, in unison, \"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the gifts. Mom got me a number of 'big baby' blankets, booties, baby bottles, etc in both blue and pink. Seeing my questioning look, Mom smiled. \"It's a mother's dream, dear.\" Softly, she said. She then winked. \"It's also a mother's revenge, as I get to spoil them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma giggled. \"I know this from experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that as Holly, Melodie, and Cathy approached me with a gift from the three of them and it took the three of them to lift it. \"We know the owner of the local candy store, and gave him a challenge.\" Grinning, Cathy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hope you like it.\" Smiling, Holly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to go through all that trouble...\" Tearing up, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the gift and let out a low gasp before tearing up... It was all of my favorite chocolates... in my size! I chose one and popped it into my mouth. It was like a piece of heaven to my taste buds. \"It's delicious!\" Cooing, I chirped. \"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly and Melodie giggled, happy that I loved their present. Cathy smiled. \"They could think of no better present than something you miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Grandma, who gave me the recipe for the ointment, and a beautiful multi-symbol necklace. \"Our family is ancient and has many religions.\" Calmly, she explained. \"When a giant woman gets married, she gets one of these necklaces to wear on her wedding day, to remind her, us all, our family knows no bounds, and that includes religion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Grandma.\" Tearing up, I said. \"I love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Allison Hayes, who gave me a huge patchwork crochet blanket. \"There are a lot of mothers in this town who owe you their sons' and daughters' lives because of your gallant work.\" Serious, she said. \"I started knitting this blanket, not knowing how I was going to get it done in time, when they came over and began to help with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.\" Tearfully, I said. \"Thank you, and thank the ladies of the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Becca went together and got me a number of stuffed animals for my bedroom. \"In case you miss your old ones.\" Smiling, Becca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made them with Aunt Marge's help.\" also smiling, Sam added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, I believe it's my turn.\" grinning, Aunt Marge said. She pushed a huge oak chest in my direction, with a heart-shaped lock on the lid. Marge smiled more as she handed me the key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge giggled. \"Open it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I unlocked the chest and opened it, only to blush profusely. It was filled with sexy lingerie, love toys, wrapped plates with hearts on them, and other intimate items. i closed the lid, then turned to Marge, who laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know when that will come in handy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help laugh myself. \"Subtlety is definitely not your strong point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower carried on well into the night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And, every time, they promised me that I would still want to marry Jason once I got through this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they weren't the only positive reinforcement I got. In the days before, the postal service had to send more than one letter carrier to deliver the well wishes I got from people whose names I didn't always recognize, but who I'd saved at one time or another. They usually included updates on how they were doing since I showed up in their lives, from ultrasounds to gallery showings. There were also well wishes put on the chain link fence around the airfield. I spent the nights before my wedding crying myself to sleep with tears of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the big day (couldn't resist, sorry/not sorry) arrived. My gown may have been shorter than the average wedding dress, but it was positively demure compared to my usual attire of a strapless two-piece. Jason was well turned out, too, and I was glad I listened to my family instead of my nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMammoth Stadium was built to hold thousands, but it wasn't enough for all the people who showed up. It seemed like half the city was there for my special day. The mayor took the opportunity to give me the key to the city that I had politely declined on so many occasions. Ah, well, add it to the wedding gifts. I was glad to see Trish was there, and that she had found clothes that would fit her, at least for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marching band struck up \"Here Comes The Bride\", and I carried Dad down the aisle. Well, he insisted that he'd dreamed of giving me away at my wedding since the day I was born, and this was the only way we could do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minister was lifted skyward on a cherry-picker, so we could all look each other in the eye. The Jumbotrons showed everyone a first-class view of the proceedings. And the crowd went wild when the minister said, \"You may kiss the bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had to call on more than one caterer, but we got everybody, even all the giants in both our families, fed.</span></div></div>",

On the other hand, if they went to this much trouble for a joke, then they deserve to have their laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sentiments exactly. Let's get some clothes and be on our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe directions took us out of California into Colorado, up into the Rocky Mountains.

A 30-foot man in a ranger's outfit waved to us. \"Welcome to Colossal Valley,\" he said. \"What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're on our honeymoon,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ranger nodded. \"In that case, you'll be wanting the bridal suite. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led us to a magnificent cabin, almost as big as my house. Inside, it was sumptuously appointed. \"As we were promised,\" Jason said, \"it's the perfect place. Thank you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we had freshened up and put some of our things away, Jason gave a sigh of satisfaction. \"We couldn't ask for a better bed and breakfast,\" he said. \"What do you want to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the trunk Aunt Marge gave me. \"How about we skip breakfast?\"</span></div></div>",

I decided to start with the simple one first. \"I'm constantly stuffed up,\" I said. \"I've had this for a week, with no change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" he said. He took a look up my nose. \"Have you experienced anything other than stuffy nose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my mouth to speak, but a rather loud belch came out instead (and I'm 50 feet tall, so factor that in). I covered my mouth. \"Sorry,\" I said, \"that just came out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you get a lot of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sad part is, that's not the most embarrassing noise to come out of my body. I've been known to shake the trees recently. Sometimes, I try to blame it on someone else, but I'm sure nobody believes it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Is there anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, uh, sex drive has taken a tumble lately. I've gone from barely being able to keep my hands off of Jason to not wanting him to touch me sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lately, I've been feeling... underdressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are a few things that might cause these symptoms. I'd like to do a simple blood test, if I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI agreed to the test, and Dr. Bunyan took a sample of my blood. Thanks to my being so big, he didn't need to take much, proportionately speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, he returned. \"Do you know what it is?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of two things,\" he replied. \"A boy or a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure if I heard him right. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this announcement, I fainted.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant,\" I said, still processing it. \"I can't believe it. I haven't thrown up once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giantesses don't get morning sickness, Summer. You know this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now</i> I remembered Grandpa saying that when we found out Sam was pregnant. Like I said, slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for your other symptoms,\" he continued, \"most of them are quite common among women of all sizes, including fainting and fuzzy thinking. The desire to cover up more is mainly found in bigger women like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt better, knowing that what I was feeling was all just part of pregnancy, including my sudden slowness. \"Thank you so much, Doctor. Now, how do I tell Jason the good news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's entirely up to you. I'll refer you to an OB/GYN for the rest of your pregnancy. She'll contact you for your first appointment. Goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to break the news to Jason slowly, starting with fixing his favorite meal for supper. He was thrilled when he came home and that familiar aroma greeted him. \"You didn't,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, you shouldn't have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the meal, I asked, \"How was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the job. I'm a forest ranger now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, congratulations.\" I ran around the table and kissed him. \"You've been looking forward to this for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, how do you think we should celebrate? Or is this it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw Dr. Bunyan today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What did he say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped eating. \"Pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"That's why I've been stuffed up, why I have such terrible gas, why it seems like I'm in a perpetual fog,... and why I've lost interest in... you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Jason's turn to run around the table. When he did, he picked me up and kissed me. \"How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could get used to it. Too bad I'll be too heavy for it in a few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently set me down. \"I've got to tell my folks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, can we not? I'd like to keep this our little secret for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until I'm three months along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"I guess I can do that. Our little secret.\" He put his hand on my belly, even though it was perfectly flat. \"Should we be hoping for a boy or a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just hope it's happy and healthy, and worry about the rest later.\"</span></div></div>",

My brother blabbed that I had a thing for Sam, because he was afraid she would hurt me, being so big. But my folks gave me the boot because Sam isn't short for Samuel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry your parents feel that way,\" I told her, \"but you're welcome in our home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, I was fixing supper, when Grandma and Grandpa came up to me. \"So when were you planning to tell us?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer,\" Grandpa said, \"I've been around giants my whole life.

I'm afraid I don't have an ointment for it, but I can tell you those feelings will return in a few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed with relief. \"I was a little worried.

I couldn't catch the whole thing, but the words \"barn door\" and \" horses\" came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished, Dad cleared his throat. \"I guess what I meant to ask,\" he said, \"was, Are you sure you're ready?

We had started talking about maybe having children someday, unaware that I had already conceived. But it's not the worst example. Is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I suppose not,\" Dad said, subtly reminded of how many months there were between my parents' anniversary and my birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, congratulations, Summer,\" Sam said. \"I'm sure our kids will have lots of fun playing together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Becca said, \"a second babysitting gig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't mind being an alternate,\" Trish said, \"if either of you need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All your offers are deeply appreciated,\" I said. Turning to Trish, I asked, \"Have you given any thought to what you'll do once you're out on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, I hadn't,\" she replied. \"Do you think I should?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're interested, I could recommend you for Search and Rescue. Maybe even train you. After all, they won't want me to handle too many risky jobs, once I tell them what condition I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me. When do I start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first, I have to clear it with my higher-ups. But I don't foresee a problem. I'll call you with details afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with that, the meal became more genial, more festive.

With it, you won't feel any pain from your growth spurts. But, unlike other pain meds, this won't make you loopy, or give you nightmares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish returned, and we all helped her and Joy get settled in. If the sparks they were giving off were more than metaphorical, they would have burned the place down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of things I want to tell you,\" I said to Trish. \"First, your first visitors will be Ashley and Joey. Joy's a little insecure about her growth, and the fastest antidote I can think of for that is two kids who love giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm inclined to agree. What's the other thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before your relationship gets physical, wait and make sure she's using the ointment. You see, exertion can cause a growth spurt, and so can orgasm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh! Oh.\"</span></div></div>",

I was jumping out of my skin, with nothing to do other than watch television and read books sent by my giant relatives. What made it worse was that I was having trouble making up my mind what I wanted to snack on when the cravings hit. I would literally spend minutes at a time, staring in the cupboards, refrigerator, and freezer, trying to decide. It came to the point where I was screaming and crying, due to not being able to make a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason came home early on the seventh day of my maternity leave, to find me in the middle of one of these fits. \"Honey!\" running to me, he gasped. \"What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going insane!\" Crying, I wailed. \"I can't make up my mind what I was to snack on, and I am so hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason winced and called Grandma on speaker, who answered on the third ring. \"Hey, Summer, how are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Jason, and Summer is in trouble.\" Worried, Jason said. \"She can't decide what to eat, and, from what I understand, it has caused her not to eat all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma giggled, surprising Jason. \"Let me guess, she has the munchies, but is torn between one snack and another, no matter where she turns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it exactly.\" Crying, I said. \"What is wrong with me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is wrong with you, sweetie.\" Cooing, she said. \"Only you may want to look into purchasing two cribs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a moment to get what Grandma was hinting at, but, when it hit, my jaw dropped before I teared up. \"Twins?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Grandma giggled. \"Congratulations, honey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we solve her craving issues?\" Worried, Jason pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much, dear.\" Lightly, Grandma said. \"When the cravings hit, take both choices before you, one for each baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a strange way, it made sense. I moved to the refrigerator, loaded my hands with every snack that caught my eye, and took them to a chair to enjoy them. Watching me, Jason sighed, then turned to the phone. \"Any other surprises I should know about?\" Curious, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma gave a chuckle. \"They wouldn't be surprises if I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help giggle, hearing that. \"You need to ask the right question to get the right answer, Jason.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was the wrongness of putting me on bed rest when there was a new mother in the house to tend to. Or maybe it was the cold, hard fact that Jason Finnegan was a bad cook. Whatever the case, I had to get back on my feet sooner rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, Dad, and Becca had moved in to help tend to Sam, but they were having little success. \"I don't care about traditions,\" she shouted, \"I'm going stir crazy in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it out the bedroom door, but not much farther. Luckily, I had a decent set of reflexes, and I caught her before she fell on her face. \"I've got you, little sister,\" I said. \"Let's get you back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I put her in bed again, she said, \"You understand me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"You're used to doing things for yourself. But you just had a baby a few days ago. I suggest you use this time as a chance to get to know little Matt as more than just the one who made you go to the bathroom every five minutes. I've taken myself off bed rest, so I can start pulling my weight in this house again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason touched my arm. \"Honey, we discussed this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to him. \"Dear husband, light of my life: I suggest you study cooking over the next six months. If I must leave my kitchen in your care, I want to know that it's in better hands than the ones that have been fixing my meals recently. Do I make my position clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Besides, there's something I almost missed, lying on my back all day, every day.\" I brought his hands to my abdomen. \"I am officially rocking a baby bump.\" I gave him a kiss.</span></div></div>",

Knowing it had to be important, I answered on the second ring. \"Summer Roberts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer, we have reports of another climber on Old Town Road.\" Worried, dispatch said. \"We have rescue crews on the way, but we are hoping you can get there faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already there!\" Running to the door, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing fifty feet tall, running a mile to Old Town Road only took me a few minutes across country. Upon arriving, I saw a young girl falling from the road, screaming in terror. With my heart in my throat, I jumped forward and caught her just in the nick of time. The poor girl was crying, trembling... <i>What happened to you?</i> Feeling pity, I thought. Then I gently said, \"Easy there, I have you. You are safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nearly screamed looking at me... I guessed she had never seen a giant girl before only she screamed, \"Help me! I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped as the girl then screamed again in utter terror before vanishing from my hand. Startled, I looked around, searching for the girl as her horrified scream echoed into the distance. Not seeing anything, I shuddered and turned to the top of the cliff, where I spotted a young policewoman who had the same startled look I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are tales of ghosts reliving their last moments here on Old Town Road, Summer.\" Sadly, she said with a shrug. \"You and I may have just witnessed one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuddered at the thought, and returned home, feeling as if I had failed that young girl. \"She felt so real in my hand...\" Tearing up, I muttered. I then knotted my jaws in decision. \"I am not losing anyone else on the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI again jumped as my cellphone rang again and I answered right away. \"Summer Roberts... what is the emergency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, pumpkin.\" Gently, grandma said. \"I apologize if I had startled you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, grandma...\" With a sigh, I said. \"I had a bit of a scare earlier... Tell you about it later. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I pulled a few strings, and managed to book the perfect place for you and Jason to get married.\" She giggled. \"It is where your great-uncles got married...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't keep me in suspense, Grandma.\" Lightly scolding, I said. \"Where is this perfect place you booked for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Garden Rose Stadium, home of my college alma mater, Mammoth University, home of the Valley City Goliath football team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A football stadium, Grandma... really?\" Cracking a grin, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about this, honey.\" Cooing, Grandma said. \"The security will be tight, there will be plenty of places for friends and family to sit, the Jumbotrons will capture every moment, and you will have the best band in the valley playing 'Here Comes The Bride'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at the image Grandma's descriptions gave me. \"We- We'll think about it.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be happy to give you a tour.\" Calmly, Grandma said. \"Expect me at your house tomorrow morning... I know it's your day off. Good night, Summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she ended the call. I sighed, then called Jason. \"Jason... honey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer?\" Worried, Jason asked. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI teared up. \"I need you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already there.\" Firmly, Jason said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
