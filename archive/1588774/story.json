Clark Kent, adopted son of Jonathan and Martha Kent, and secretly the last son of the destroyed planet of Krypton - made his way out of the Kent family home, and headed into the barn on the farm his family owned. To everyone else, Clark was just an ordinary high school kid, only his parents knew the truth about his origins and amazing powers...powers that came in handy on a farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo anyone else, heavy lifting on a farm might have seemed like a rather extreme chore, but to Clark, it was a pretty easy, and sometimes relaxing, way to start the day. In fact, Clark never really considered them to be 'chores' at all - he was happy to help his father out on the farm in whatever way he could, and considering he possessed super strength, speed and agility, he could hardly complain that it would eat up his free time. He usually finished things up pretty quick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark grabbed a large bail of hay with one arm - it was about twice his size, but seemed light as a feather in his hands. He slung it over his shoulder and carried it out of the barn and into the vast field that his family owned. He placed the bail of hay down on the ground, and headed back for another one, passing by his father on the way back into the barn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning son,\" Jonathan Kent said, yawning tiredly and walking beside Clark as they headed into the barn. \"Your up early today, usually I'm the first one out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early bird catches the worm Dad,\" Clark smiled. \"At least, that's what Lex always says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure the <i>Luthors</i> catch plenty of worms...\" Jonathan mumbled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark decided to change the subject. \"Any chance I can get a lift into school Dad?\" Clark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan shook his head. \"Sorry son,\" he said. \"No can do. I have to head into Metropolis early...in fact, I'm late already, but you know what your mothers like - she thinks I need my sleep after the heart attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right,\" said Clark. \"You should still be taking it easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't you start,\" Jonathan said, pulling out his keys and walking towards his large, red truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan clambered into the Kent family truck, and drove off down the dusty field road, waving a quick goodbye to Clark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark lifted another bail of hay, possibly even larger than the last one, and continued doing this until he had carried out about a dozen hay bails into the field. It was all pretty simple work for him, and he barely even caught a sweat doing it. Clark checked the time, and realized he was going to be late for school if he didn't hurry - despite getting up early, he had still managed to wind up late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark pulled on his red jacket, hastily gathered up his school books and loaded them into his rucksack, and set off down the road, at which point he decided to avoid being late by using his super speed to run into town - while his parents did not like him using his powers in broad daylight, his super speed was so fast that nobody would ever see him anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to speed away, Clark spotted something at the of the road...</span></div></div>",

Clark knew instantly what it was, he had seen it's like many times before, albeit in different colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kryptonite...\" Clark murmured, as he carefully approached the rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, even being within a few feet on the deadly Kryptonite would cause him excessive pain, but right now he couldn't feel a thing. Perhaps it wasn't Kryptonite after all? Or perhaps this particular type of Kryptonite didn't cause a bad reaction? It would certainly be a stroke of luck to come across some of the rock that {i{didn't nearly end up killing him. It was his only weakness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to ere on the side of caution, Clark moved slowly towards the yellow rock - he still couldn't feel anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be harmless...\" Clark told himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knelt down beside the rock. \"So far so good...\" Clark said out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark looked around, checking nobody was watching him, and then scooped up the meteor rock in his hand. Immediately after he had the rock in his palm, it began to glow, dimly at first, but getting brighter by the second. Hesitantly, Clark dropped the rock to the floor, not sure what had just happened. He had experienced other side effects from Kryptonite before, including a complete loss of control over his own actions...and he didn't want that to happen again. But he couldn't just leave the Kryptonite here for anyone to find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark put his hand in his pocket, forming a protective layer around it. He then lent back down and picked up the Kryptonite in his hand, and quickly placed it in his pocket. This time, it did not glow, which lead Clark to think that it only reacted to contact with his skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going any further, Clark decided to...</span></div></div>",

He clutched the rock in his hand and pulled it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far, so good...\" Clark mused, looking at the Kryptonite in his open hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the yellow rock began to glow once more in Clark's hand, he could feel a strange warmth spread throughout his body, but couldn't bring himself to let go of the Kryptonite.

Perhaps touching the Kryptonite hadn't been such a good idea after all? But then again, Clark wasn't exactly feeling any pain, if anything, he was currently feeling a little better than normal, almost...powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark began to feel a tightness in his chest, and glanced down at his body instinctively. Everything seemed normal, then he noticed something strange, his red T-shirt appeared to be moving, as though someone were pulling it tight across his chest. Puzzled, Clark stared down at his shirt, and, suddenly, heard a tear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Clark said out loud as he stared at his chest, which seemed to be where the noise had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, there was now a tear forming across the upper part of his shirt, as though as it was shrinking. A sudden tightness also started coming from the arms of Clark's blue jacket - not wanting anything else to rip, Clark quickly pulled his jacket off and threw it to the floor. As he tossed his jacket away, Clark caught sight of his arms, were they...bigger? He had always been tall and well built, but he wasn't sure his biceps bulged quite as much as this usually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realised he was still holding the Kryptonite, and let it fall from his hand to the floor, deciding it was best to let it go for now. As the rock hit the floor with a light thud, Clark heard another tear - he quickly looked down, and saw another tear had spread across his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be good...\" Clark thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his chest in confusion, and was surprised to see his red shirt stretching even more across his chest, he could even see the outline of his pectorals and six pack abs as his shirt tightened, and they seemed to be growing more prominent with each passing moment. He looked at his arms again, and saw them bulging before his very eyes, his biceps swelling and straining the materials of his T-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth suddenly dawned on Clark - that Kryptonite had made his muscles grow...</span></div></div>",

Clark stared in amazement at his biceps as they continued to swell, growing thicker, swelling upwards like rising dough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark didn't know what to think - was this a good thing? Was this a bad thing? He had already been pretty muscled as it was, and he wasn't sure he needed to go past his athletes physique into a full blown body-builder. Before Clark could consider it any further, he was distracted by the sound of fabric tearing once again, and turned his attention from his bulging arms to his chest, where the noise seemed to have emanated from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfirming his suspicions, Clark now saw that his pecs were growing too large for his tight T-shirt, which was stretched so thinly across his muscled torso that it looked ready to explode. His pectorals were even bigger than before, looking almost like a shelf on his chest, so large and firm that his nipples threatened to rip through his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark winced as he felt his shirt tighten once more, and, without warning, he felt the fabric reach it's limit. Several increasingly noisy ripping noises came from his shirt, which stretched ridiculously across his new, bigger stomach, and finally exploded off of his body. Clark exhaled slowly as he stared at his exposed chest, his abs and pecs glistening in the sunlight. Clark had to admit, he looked pretty amazing...his body was like that of a Greek God, not a single imperfection could be seen across his naked, exposed chest. He ran a hand over his eight pack abs and smiled to himself. Perhaps this wasn't so bad after all...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding he needed a better look at himself Clark bounded up to the loft. His increased muscle mass had unexpectedly increased his strength. So now each step was 3 times longer than before. Something that people would notice very quickly. Clark had decided to look for an old full-length mirror stored up there. Several minutes later, after having found the mirror and then standing it up Clark admired his new physique so intently he didn't hear when Lana entered the barn... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first called out his name Clark didn't notice THAT either. Lana then noticed the yellow kryptonite sitting on the barn floor. It's translucent yellow color attracts her curiosity so she knelt down and picked it up. Wearing only her swimsuit and having no where else to put it, Lana decided for the time being, to put it inside her swimsuit. Seconds later, it begins flattening itself against her warm body unnoticed by her. Which caused her to begin experiencing a feeling of well-being and inner pleasure that grew in intensity as its contact with her skin increased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a one-piece very stretchable Lycra-like swimsuit that looks like she was poured into it when she put it on. Now currently wearing size 8 dresses, Lana is an exquisitely well-rounded 33B complemented by her 23 inch waist, the new suit she's wearing is a 36C. Chloe was with her when she shopped at a new sporting/swimwear store in Metropolis looking for a new swimsuit. All of her then existing bikinis were 31B or 32B. Lana had grown enough to make them all very uncomfortable and way to dangerous to wear. They all were 100% cotton and had shrunk some from being washed, Lana had become very concerned that any day now, when she dived into a pool one of her tops would snap off from the pressure greatly embarrassing her. So when she found this swimsuit shimmering on a rack, Lana at first put it back thinking that it was to large for her. Which it would definitely have been were it a cotton swimsuit. She was worried that she would look desperate wearing a suit that clearly was to big for her. Noticing just how stretchable and malleable it felt, Chloe said she would buy an identically sized swimsuit which convinced Lana that she should also buy one. Lana also bought some several flattering bikinis in various colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Jonathan had told Lana that Clark was in the barn she was surprised that he wasn't answering her. Having decided to leave, Lana yelled for Clark one last time this time mentioning that she was wearing her brand new swim-suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat snapped Clark out of his daze. He immediately leaps down from the loft landing right in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his new improved body, Lana is speechless for a few seconds. Then with very labored breathing and panting between each word Lana managed to say, \" Oh ...... my ...... God ...... Clark ...... you're ...... even ...... bigger ...... than ...... Hercules ...... I ...... love ...... it ...... AND ...... YOU! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast semester Lana had taken a class on Classical Mythology. She was comparing his new size to what she had seen as traditional depictions of Hercules in her textbook. The blood rushed out of her head so fast when her entire body blushes Lana fainted. So Clark gallantly caught her as she collapsed to the ground.</span></div></div>",

When it got late, he went in the house he fixed himself some dinner since his parents were already asleep. He prepared some leftover spaghetti and juice and watched TV on the couch. Finally, he played a game on his laptop before he crawled on his bed in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was great, until the following morning, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything seemed normal, then he noticed something strange, his red T-shirt appeared to be moving, as though someone were pulling it tight across his chest, he felt his stomach begin to press against his shirt as it pulled tight across his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Clark said out loud as he stared at his chest. \"Is my...stomach moving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clark watched, his suspicions were confirmed. Slowly but surely, his T-shirt stretched across his stomach as it began to expand. It was unlike anything Clark had ever seen, his six pack abs were steadily bulging out, his stomach gradually bloating and bulging into a round ball. Shocked, Clark reached down and touched his formerly flat stomach, only to find his hand sinking into what appeared to be a layer of flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impossible...\" Clark said, staring in disbelief at his growing swelling midsection. \"The Kryptonite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his confusion, Clark had forgotten he was still holding the yellow rock. It was obvious at this point that it had caused the strange change in his body, and he dropped it instantly. As the rock hit the floor, Clark saw his shirt ride up, as his once perfect, muscled abs expanded outwards into a ball of flab. He began to feel his jeans tighten, as his belly bulged over his waistband, and he reached down and undid the top button to allow himself some room to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened up his pants, Clark breathed a sigh of relief as his belly bulged forward, no longer constricted by his tight jeans.

Of course, the stairs were old and wooden, and probably always did this when he ascended them, but he was feeling particularly paranoid about their creaking today, almost feeling as though he might fall through them due to his increase in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark got to the top of the stairs and walked over his the full length mirror he kept on his wall.

He couldn't really tell if he had gained any weight in other parts of his body, and decided to take that as a good sign, if he couldn't see any difference, then it must not have been nearly as bad as he first suspected.

Despite his slight increase in size, he was still quick on his feet, even without the use of his super speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark practically charged into the kitchen, slamming the front door behind him. Luckily, both of his parents were out - so he didn't have to worry about being seen. However, Clark did begin to wonder how exactly he was going to expain his new figure to his family, he doubted they would believe he had just put on weight...and he didn't really want to mention that he had touched another piece of Kryptonite, as they would be furious. Clark knew he would need to tell them something...but before he could figure out what, his stomach rumbled louder than ever - and suddenly the only thought in his mind was 'food'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark began pulling open the cupboards in the kitchen looking for something to eat - it seemed as though his Mom hadn't been to the store this week, because the cupboards were pretty bare. Only the basic food stuffs remained, and Clark didn't really fancy eating a bag of flour or downing a bottle of soy sauce. As his stomach continued to rumble, Clark yanked open another cupboard, nearly pulling the door of it's hinges in his haste - inside this cupboard was the breakfast cereal's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the first good food he had found, Clark couldn't wait to get them into his mouth. Tearing open the bag, Clark tilted his head back and tipped the box up. Crunchy, dry cereal fell from the box into his mouth, and he began chomping down, swallowing each mouth full of cereal as quickly as he could. He soon realised that cereal wasn't really going to fill him up, so he put the box pack, wiped the crumbs from around his mouth, and continued his search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something caught Clark's eye. On top of the grill was a saucepan with a note attached to it, Clark snatched the note up and read it - <i>Leftover sausages and bacon, help yourselves.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot...\" Clark said out loud, grabbing the pan and opening it up to find a large batch of sausages and bacon his Mom must have left from this morning, they were still a little warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark pulled a chair out from the table and placed the pan down. As he sat down, he felt his stomach bulge out further, he had almost forgotten that he had unbuttoned his pants earlier. He would have worried about his girth, but right now, he just wanted to eat. And so, he began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark ate like he had never eaten before, grabbing sausages from the pan with his bare hands, devouring each one in a few bites, pushing them into his mouth and gulping them down greedily. Every time he finished one sausage, Clark's now greasy fingers reached for another, and pushed it into his mouth - he barely even had time to enjoy the taste of the food, all he cared about was satisfying his hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn about ten minutes, Clark had devoured everything in the pan, and it seemed as though his binge had satisfied his rumbling stomach. He no longer felt starving, and his stomach was not in any pain - his mission had been accomplished. However, his feeling of hunger had now been replaced with one of bloating - Clark didn't know how many sausages had been in the pan, but he knew there had been a lot, much more than any one person should eat in one sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRP!\" A loud belch escaped Clark's mouth, and he gave a groan of discomfort as he felt his bloated stomach press against his jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark looked down, and saw that his stomach was even larger than it had been earlier. He gave an annoyed groan, as he realised what a pig he had made of himself. His T shirt had ridden up even further, well above his belly button, to just underneath his pecs, exposing his large, bloated, perfectly round belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark placed a hand on his stomach, and found that it was no longer feeling flabby, but very hard. It was a more enjoyable feeling, making him feel just bloated, instead of flabby. As he continued to rub his swollen gut, he realised his pants were still unbuttoned, though he couldn't actually see anything past his protruding stomach at this point. None the less, despite knowing he had overdone it with the food, and that he must now look like a complete pig, Clark was completely satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Clark heard a noise...</span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure he wanted to go near it again, and he didn't think Chloe going near it was such a good idea either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dropped it outside where I found it,\" Clark told Chloe. \"Got kind of distracted when my stomach started blowing up 'like a balloon'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded. \"I should go and get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Clark exclaimed. \"You shouldn't go near it, the second I touched it I started changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you got this big after touching it just once?\" Chloe asked in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...actually...\" Clark looked down at the remains of his meal on the table. \"I got a little hungry and got carried away down here.

Chloe was right of course, though he didn't want to touch the Kryptonite again. It was best to take precautions this time round. Clark walked across the room and pulled open a draw, and reached in to take out one of his Dad's work gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Chloe said, seeing Clark put the glove on. \"You don't want to get any fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark turned to Chloe and raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, didn't mean to call you...you know,\" Chloe apologized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark, accepting the apology silently, headed outside to the spot where he had dropped the Kryptonite. He saw it, on the floor, glistening in the sunlight, and bent down to pick it up. His whole center of gravity shifted as he bent over, his belly nearly dragging him down. It was, by far the biggest part of his body now. Despite the difficulty imposed on him by his new size, Clark picked up the rock and headed back inside, where he placed it down on the table as quickly as he could, fearing that it might start affecting him if he held it for any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe peered in for a closer look. \"Hmm, definitely a meteor rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too close,\" Clark said. \"We don't know how it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe backed away, and case a sideways glance at Clark. Clark knew she was looking at his lower half, but tried to act like everything was normal. However, he could hear Chloe trying to stop herself from laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Clark sighed. \"I know, it's funny, I've got a pot belly. Can we get serious already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that,\" Chloe giggled. \"Clark...did you know your pants were open?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark went bright red once again. He had completely forgotten that his pants were open, mainly because he couldn't see past his belly anymore. He had unbuttoned them himself to relieve some of pressure around his waist, which had seemed like a good idea at the time, but he doubted buttoning them up was a possibility at this point. None the less, he gave it a go, reaching down and trying to re button his pants. He quickly realized that it was no use, his stomach was too big and bloated to allow it. He could try and suck it in, but right now, with his stomach stuffed full of food, he doubted it would make much difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get to work on a solution,\" Clark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark and Chloe leaned in to look at the rock, when suddenly, Clark began to feel strange...</span></div></div>",

He touched the sides of his engorged belly, and rubbed them absent mindedly. \"I'm getting that feeling again,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh,\" Chloe muttered, fixated on Clark's exposed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Clark gave a grunt as he felt a tingling in his stomach, and suddenly, his stomach began to feel much lighter. The bloated feeling he had gotten from his feast seemed to disappear all at once, and suddenly, Clark felt a lot lighter. \"Hey...that wasn't so bad!\" Clark said excitedly, smiling across at Chloe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...Clark...maybe you should pay closer attention to your stomach?\" Chloe said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark looked down, and staggered back a little as he saw his stomach growing even <i>larger</i>. He backed away from the table, and propped himself up against the fridge door, arching his back slightly in order to get a better view of his swelling stomach. His hands were still clutching the sides of his rapidly inflating gut, feeling the quick and steady bulging of flesh beneath his fingertrips as his stomach pushed out further and further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't only his belly that was growing; Clark could feel his legs thickening within his jeans, which were becoming incredibly tight across his widening legs. His arms also seemed to be gaining weight, and the sleeves of his T shirt stretched to constrain his biceps. Biceps which, Clark was sure, were swelling with fat, rather than muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Clark...your blowing up like a balloon!\" Chloe gasped in shock and awe as she watched Clark's transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark blushed, having almost forgotten that Chloe was in the room with him. Getting fat was embarrassing enough without it happening instantly with his best friend looking at him like he was a freak. Luckily, the growth now seemed to be slowing down. While Clark felt as though his clothes were dangerously close to ripping off his body, he couldn't feel his arms and legs pushing against the material of his clothing anymore, and his stomach didn't seem to be getting any bigger. It looked as though his latest growth spurt was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's stopped,\" Clark sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded. \"Yeah...I think so too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark pushed himself away from the fridge, and felt his fat jiggle as his body moved forward. The weight he had just gained had made his body a lot more flabby. He might have passed himself off as simply being incredibly bloated before, but nobody would buy that story now - his stomach had developed several rolls of fat, which shook when he walked. His belly sagged down, bulging over the rim of his jeans like the top of a giant muffin. His thighs rubbed together as he walked, and he could feel a slight jiggle beneath his now completely useless T shirt. His pecs had fattened up too, he guessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark, you must have gained about fifty pounds just now!\" Chloe exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark waddled towards her, still adjusting to his new size, and the strain it was putting on his body. He could barely walk in his skin tight jeans. \"Chloe, I need to get away from that rock, do you think you could hide it somewhere for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Chloe gasped, looking at the rock fearfully. \"What if I start growing too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark sighed, but he knew Chloe was right. He had already been exposed, and he didn't know what effect the Kryptonite might have on Chloe. He grabbed the garden glove again, and waddled out of the room, taking his steps slowly and carefully, so as to not damage his clothes, or cause too much jiggling of his chubby belly. Chloe followed him into the barn, where Clark pulled out a small, secure metal box, and popped the rock inside, closing it up and hiding it in a drawer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Chloe asked. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clark had to take a moment to stop and breathe, at which point he leant up against one of the wooden columns in the barn and sighed, wondering what he was going to do. He wasn't exactly comfortable around Chloe, so he knew he wasn't going to go to Lana or Lois about this, and he wasn't ready to face his parents yet (he had no doubt they would be furious he had even gone <i>near</i> that Kryptonite). That left him with pretty much one choice: Lex Luthor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, I think I'm going to need to go to Lex with this,\" Clark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe shook her head dubiously. \"I don't know about this Clark,\" she said. \"Are you really sure you can trust him? What if he makes you into some lab experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark shook his head. \"He's not some mad scientist Chloe,\" he said. \"He might have something that can help to reverse this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe still looked concerned. \"Well, if your going to do this, then I'm going with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, you don't have to if you don't want to,\" Clark assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark,\" Chloe said firmly, looking him straight in the eye. \"I'm coming, whether you like it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark nodded. Once Chloe made up her mind, there was no way of changing it. \"Right, we better get going,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark pushed his chubby body off of the wooden pole and began to slowly make his way out of the barn. With each step, his round, bloated middle shook gently, and his undersized clothes strained against his new physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Clark?\" Chloe said from behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark twisted his neck around to face her, feeling how some fat had become to accumulate under his chin. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should change into something...different...\" Chloe said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark blushed, and stared down at his bulging belly. He looked completely ridiculous; if he went out like this then he might wind up on Chloe's 'wall of weird'. \"Okay, I'll see if I've got something bigger. Why don't you go wait outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded and made her way out of the barn, as Clark walked up the stairs to his room. The stairs creaked with each step he took, and he certain they were going to give in at any moment and send him crashing to the floor...but, by some miracle, they held out. After checking Chloe was out of sight, Clark began to undress. It took little effort to remove his T-shirt, which had only served to cover his now flabby pecs. He pictured Lois taunting him about having 'man boobs' when he next saw her. He knew she would not go easy on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants presented more of a challenge. With the growth of his legs, they had become plastered onto his body, and as he tried to pull them down, he couldn't get them to move a muscle. He would have had no trouble with this normally - but for some reason, it seemed as though he had gotten weaker. Perhaps the fat he had gained had begun to make his muscles disappear completely? Clark began to worry, but he was distracted by a loud tearing noise from below his waist. In his struggle to remove his pants, he had torn them completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark sighed as the tattered remains of his jeans fell to the ground, and he removed the last remnants of his once perfect fitting pants. Now dressed only in his boxer shorts, which had also grown incredibly tight around his flabbier ass, Clark shuffled into view of the mirror and stared at his reflection. Even he was surprised at how big he looked. His stomach was his largest attribute, sticking out a good foot from his body like the belly of a heavily pregnant woman. It sagged down slightly, but otherwise seemed quite round and firm, all things considered. His once muscled biceps had melted into chubby, flabby arms, and his legs had thickened like small tree trunks. Surprisingly, his face didn't seem to have changed at all, aside from a little fullness around his cheeks. He was grateful for that at least, he still looked like himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem now was finding some clothes that would fit him. He waddled over to his wardrobe and pulled it open, everything looked far too small for him, but he spotted a large football jersey his Dad had given him a few years back, which had been about ten sizes too big for him at the time, and was still pretty big looking now by the looks of it. Clark pulled out the jersey, which had a large number '8' on the front, and pulled it on over his head. It hid his girth pretty well, far better than he had expected. Even now, the football jersey fit him loosely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a pair of sweat pants and pulled them on, their elastic wasitband was stretched to it's limit, but it would have to do. At least he was covered up. He straightened his clothes, and carefully went back downstairs, and outside to Chloe...</span></div></div>",

It was a completely new sensation for him, having been in good shape all his life. He was also aware of the fact that he was walking much slower than normal, and he was certain that Chloe was having to slow her pace in order to walk alongside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how does it feel?\" Chloe suddenly asked, breaking the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does what feel?\" Clark asked, feeling his thighs rub together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...having a different...uh...body shape...\" Chloe replied awkwardly, trying to avoid staring at Clark's plump middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark sighed. \"You mean, what's it like being fat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe blushed. \"Sorry, guess that was kinda blunt, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark managed a smile. \"It's okay Chloe,\" he said softly. \"It feels weird, that much I know...it's hard to get used to, all this weight doesn't exactly stay still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you're coping with it really well Clark,\" Chloe smiled. \"I know I'd be having a major freak out right now if it was me. I wouldn't even leave my room, let alone walk to Lex Luthor's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark smiled back, and tried to stay positive as he and Chloe continued the walk to the Luthor mansion. As his weight gain had been caused by exposure to Kryptonite, Clark was sure that it could be reversed somehow, after all, none of the other Kryptonite he had encountered, even red, had ever had irreversible effects...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity for Clark - who was used to racing around town faster than a speeding bullet - he and Chloe finally reached the Mansion. Clark walked up to the security guards at the front gates, who usually let him go in straight away, but today, they blocked his path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your business here?\" The first security guard asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to see Lex,\" Clark replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mister Luthor</i> doesn't just see anybody, kid,\" the second security guard snapped, looking Clark up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, it's me, Clark, you've never stopped me going in before,\" Clark protested, but he suspected that he knew the cause of their reluctance - they didn't recognise him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards leaned in to get a closer look at Clark, and their eyes opened in realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" The first guard said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" said the second. \"I...uh...didn't recognise you for a second...go on in, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark, who was more than a little embarrassed, pushed past the two guards, with Chloe hurrying after him. Obviously, they hadn't recognised him with the extra weight. Suddenly, Clark felt a lot more concerned about his appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! That kid has piled on the pounds!\" One of the guards exclaimed from behind Clark and Chloe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it, how did he let himself go like that?\" Said the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might at least have waited until we were out of earshot! Jerks...\" Chloe said angrily. \"You okay Clark?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark sighed. \"Yeah, I'm fine...come on, it's this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned a corner, and walked into Lex's office. Clark felt his belly brush against the doors as he pushed them open. As he and Chloe entered the room, Lex rose from his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark, Chloe, security told me you were on your way...\" Lex trailed off as he saw Clark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lex, I have a problem,\" Clark said, deciding to cut to the chase, and avoid anymore awkwardness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Lex said, still staring at Clark in confusion. \"Forgive me for stating the obvious Clark, but does your problem have anything to do with the fact that you've put on about one hundred pounds since I saw you last week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark exchanged a nervous look with Chloe. He knew it was a little risky coming to Lex with this, but it wasn't like he could hide it for much longer anyway. He would have to tell Lex what happened, although he might have to leave out a few details...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lex, I touched this strange rock...\" Clark began, trying to sound as ignorant as possible. \"And I started swelling up...I think it might have been one of the meteor rocks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex suddenly looked a lot more intrigued. \"Really? Where's this rock now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark shifted awkwardly, and decided to change the subject. \"I put it some place safe...Lex, the reason I came to you was that I was wondering if Luthorcorp might have anything that could reverse this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex considered for a moment, and the beginnings of a smile crossed his face. \"You know Clark, I might just have something...Luthorcorp have been working on a way to eliminate the fat within a persons body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda like an instant weight loss?\" Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Lex said. \"Purely for health purposes, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...\" Chloe muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it work?\" Clark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hasn't been tested yet, but if you want to be our first test subject, you're welcome,\" Lex said. \"Aside from that, there's nothing I can do, except recommend a good dietician.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark considered the offer...</span></div></div>",

My lab assistant will be notified and will be waiting for you in the lab when we arrive there. The machine should be prepped by then.\" With that, Lex took out his cell phone and promptly barked orders to his scientists working in the lab at LutherCorp. After that, it only took a few minutes of very rapid driving in one of Lex's muscle cars to get them to the laboratory,,,where the machine awaited Clark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head technician rushed to greet Lex, and his two guests. He did not want to mess up the PR with the fat reducing machine's first test subject, especially when the boss was around. He took one look at Clark and told Mr. Luthor, \"The machine's max power setting is to be used for morbidly obese, bed bound patients, so we will just use the medium setting for your...\", His voice trailed off in uncertainty,\"friend here, if that's alright with you Mr. Luthor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex smirked at his underling's nervousness, \"That will be fine, is the machine ready for my friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, but I'm afraid you can't be in the same room with him while he goes in for the procedure. He'll have to take off his clothes for that, and...privacy laws right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex nodded, \"I'll be waiting in the next room with Miss Sullivan then.

He explained that he had to be in the room to make sure noting went wrong, though. Clark reluctantly complied. Unfortunately, the tech forgot to close the door between the waiting area and testing center until a few seconds after Clark had taken off his clothes. Fortunately, the tech remembered to close the door before Lex could notice. However, Chloe, quite accidentally, saw EVERYTHING. Embarrassed for her friend, and shocked at the sight of the front of Clark's enlarged naked body, she decided to say nothing. However, despite her shock at the sight of Clark's fat body, Chloe still felt strangely attracted to him. Apparently, her not-so-secret feelings for Clark would not go away even he was fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A few minute's later,Chloe's strange thought were cut off by the sound of Clark's screams from within the test area! Lex and Chloe quickly rushed in to find an even larger Clark Kent, whose fat thankfully covered all of his private areas.

Let me make it up to you Clark, I can get you anything you want from a Big and Tall Catalogue, and a limo, with reservations to any restaurant in Smallville. That might help her take her mind off, well, you know.\" Lex made a nervous gesture toward Clark's fat form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark sighed, \"Thanks Lex, but I think I'll just...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before he knew it, Clark's form began to get fatter and fatter, until his body had outgrown his new clothes, which were left in ruins at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the site of Clark's large naked body, Lana freaked out! \"I'm sorry! I can't deal with this! Call me when this..\" She gestured wildly at Clark's huge body, \"wears off! Until then, I don't want to see you!\" With that, Lana raced off, despite protests from Clark, who was using the door to hide his naked frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Lana left, Clark realized he needed new clothes AGAIN, and decided to call Chloe, he couldn't take any more jokes from Lex right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe quickly answered the phone. \"Hi Clark, I thought you were supposed to be on your date! How is that going?\" \"Not so great.\" Clark grumbled, then preceded to tell Chloe about that night's events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause, Chloe responded, \"I'm so sorry Clark! This is my fault! I should have told you to cancel. I'll be right over!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could hang up the phone, Clark quickly added, \"could you please bring some bigger clothes with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           WITHIN 30 MINUTES...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe raced through the front door of the Kent house that Clark had forgotten to lock after Lana left, with a very large outfit in tow. \"I'm sorry I took so long, I had to borrow some of my Dad's old clothes! He's lost a lot of weight since then..\" Chloe's voice trailed off when she caught sight of Clark's even bigger naked form, and she couldn't help but stare for a few moments. Chloe was suddenly reminded of the time a similar situation had occurred at the LutherCorp facility earlier that day. For some reason, Chloe still found  Clark very attractive, even at his current size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Chloe, could you stop staring and hand me the clothes?\" Clark replied, mistaking Chloe's admiring glances for shock or disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Chloe replied, handing Clark his new clothes. She then promptly ran out of the room before Clark could notice she was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Clark said it was okay for her to come in, Chloe tried to act like nothing had happened and said in a sympathetic tone, \"I'm really sorry Lana freaked out on you, I thought she would be more mature about this, I guess I was wrong.\" But she quickly added, \"At least you two will be able to start again once your body goes back to normal, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, Chloe. I mean, what if this doesn't wear off and I end up fat permanently? Even you were disgusted by what you saw a few minutes ago, and you're my best friend! Besides, I'm not so sure I want to be with Lana if she's really this shallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was a little hurt by Clark's remark, \"First of all, I was not disgusted with you, I was just...shocked, that's all.\" She ignored the feeling that she was also trying to convince herself that's all it was. \"Second, it's not my place to judge Lana, but you're right, looks are not a good foundation for a relationship.\" She leaned in closer to Clark for emphasis,\" Finally, you WILL get back to normal, and even if you did stay big, any girl would be LUCKY to have you!\" Chloe was shocked at what she had just said. That last part had seemed to come out of her mouth unbidden. Clark, whose mouth was now only inches from hers, looked shocked as well. The two of them had made it clear they were just friends, so why had Chloe said something that sounded suspiciously like a come on? After a moment's hesitation, Clark...</span></div></div>",

He clutched at his huge gut, and felt it begin to expand beneath his fingers. Clark's body was growing even larger, bulging out at all sides, his bloating flesh threatening to consume the entire couch. Clark felt some major growth in his butt, and could feel it spreading across the length of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe, who was still sitting beside him, watch in a mixture of shock, awe and, she had to admit, attraction, as her friend ballooned before her very eyes. As Clark's body grew to even greater sizes, Chloe began to feel his flesh squeezing up against her. Clark's flabby belly was spilling out onto her lap, trapping her in her seat on the couch. She tried to move, but felt Clark's enormous arm pushing into the side of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark...I'm getting kinda crushed here!\" Chloe said in a muffled voice as Clark's body began to cover her tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark looked at Chloe, and saw she was struggling to escape his growing fat. He grabbed a roll of flab from his enormous belly and pulled it back, and Chloe leapt from the couch and onto the floor. Clark felt even more embarrassed than before - his obese body had nearly crushed Chloe! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe!\" Clark exclaimed, as he felt the growth stopping. \"I'm so sorry, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Fine,\" Chloe said. \"Really, don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark looked down at his massive, naked body and sighed sadly. He could hardly believe he was the same person he had been a few days ago. Now, his body covered the entire couch, his giant form squeezing into it like jello. He was enormous, and, if he had to guess, probably weighed about five hundred pounds right now. Clark tried to stand up, but as he attempted to pull himself off of the sofa...</span></div></div>",

Finally, after his third call attempt, Lana finally answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What is this about Clark? I told you I didn't want to see you until this...thing wore off. It hasn't yet, has it?\" Clark angrily replied, \"No, it hasn't, but I think I deserve some explanation for you running out on me. Is the fact that I'm....bigger now disgust you so much you can't even stick around for a couple days until my condition wears off?\" There was dead silence on the line for almost a minute before Lana replied, \"No, that's not it at all. It's just...this meteor rock stuff. I mean, those things killed my parents. Clark! Everything even remotely related to those things, even your present condition, just....scares me, I guess. I'm sorry., but until this mutation wears off, I'm just to freaked out to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark almost dropped the phone right then and there. He supposed he should have been glad that Lana's outburst was not caused by any shallowness on her part, but to Clark, this was even worse. If Lana hated EVERYTHING related to those meteor rocks, she would never be able to love him if he told her he was an alien from the same planet those meteor rocks were from. Chloe, on the other hand, seemed to be handling the shock of Clark's transformation QUITE WELL. Clark thought she just might be able to handle the truth about his origins, when and if he decided to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So...you won't see me like this, even thought you know I'm freaking out too and could really use your support right about now?\" \".....I'm sorry. Clark, I just...can't.\"<br>\r\nClark sighed, \"I'm sorry too. Look, I didn't want to do this, but you are not leaving me much choice. When you ran, just when I needed you most, Chloe was here for me. Whenever I have had to talk about some wild meteor related theory, and you wouldn't believe me, Chloe did. And while you have been so indecisive about how you felt about me, Chloe has been my best friend  the whole time..\" Lana started to get very upset, and it started to show in the rising volume of her voice, \"Clark what are you saying? Are you dumping me for Chloe?\" \"....Yeah, I guess I am. Sorry, but you just kept leaving me hanging, and she never has.\" \" Oh...\" Lana thought she should have been angry, but it was hard to deny that her prejudices against anything meteor related, and her lack of ability to make up her mind about her feelings, had been driving Clark away from her for awhile now. Then another thought popped into Lana's head. \"Does Chloe know about this?!\" Chloe motioned for Clark to hand her the phone, which he did with some reluctance. then replied to Lana. \"Yes, I do. We made this decision together. I'm sorry Lana, I know we are (were?) good friends, but you weren't there for Clark when he needed you most....and I was. You shouldn't have made him go through this alone, so I made sure he didn't have too.\" By this point. Lana was VERY upset at what both Clark and Chloe, two of her best friends in the world, had done. But she also recognized that she had a large part of the blame for what had happened, and she was mostly angry at herself. \"I,,,,need to process all this, I'll call one of you. WHEN I'M READY TO TALK to either one of you again. I'm.. just.very upset right now. Bye.\" With that, Lana quickly hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Clark and Chloe looked at each other. Both of them felt more then a little guilty for what had just happened, but they still thought it had been the best course of action for everyone. Even Clark, who was surprised he had been welling to dump Lana, who he had liked since he was five, so quickly, was starting to realize that Chloe was a better long term option for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Finally, after several awkward minutes, Chloe said, \"I'm sure she will get over this. Lana is a strong girl and she has survived much worse.\" Clark nodded, he knew Chloe was right about that.  Chloe continued, \"And you know, just because she is not dealing with this well doesn't mean we have to be miserable. We have both had a REALLY rough day...especially you. So...don't you think we deserve to enjoy ourselves just a little bit?\" With that Chloe slowly brought her lips toward Clark's, arching her body into position above Clark's now massive gut. giving him time to pull away if he wanted to. Clark didn't. But before their lips could connect Clark began to expand again! His belly. already huge, was growing at the greatest rate, nearly pushing Chloe, who was fast enough to move away, right off the couch. But the rest of Clark was also getting allot bigger, especially his butt, which now took up the entire couch! Finally, the growth stopped, and Chloe was left looking at a mortified, jumbo sized Clark Kent! ... Who she was still strangely attracted to even though he had outgrown another pair of clothes and had gained another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most of it had gone to his already enormous belly, which had gotten so large it had actually begun to push onto Chloe's lap, not that Chloe minded...there was something strangely arousing about Clark's naked gut rubbing against her legs. Chloe had to confess, she had often pictured what Clark's naked body would look like - sculpted, muscled and toned...she never would have dreamt that the first time she saw Clark Kent naked he would be about five times his old size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhh...\" Clark groaned, his hands sinking into his vast stomach. \"I'm getting so big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark trailed off as he stared down at his gigantic body. His hands, which had also begun to grow quite chubby, were caressing his bulging stomach. Chloe could only stare at Clark's exposed form, not really sure what to say. She was afraid that if she lent in to kiss him again, he might outgrow the couch! Chloe had to guess he weighed about three hundred pounds at this point. Certain parts of his body had grown larger than others, namely his belly and his butt, while others, such as his legs and arms, seemed to be taking longer to expand, which Chloe guessed was due to all the muscle he had there. His face had changed very little as well, but it was definitely chubbier, and he was sporting the beginnings of a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite all this, Chloe had absolutely no problem with Clark's body. She had never really been into big guys, but there was something very sexy about the fat Clark. That vulnerable look on his face, the way his belly jiggled when he moved...Chloe was actually starting to like him even more this way, and that was a thought shocked her quite a bit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you think I weigh?\" Clark asked, breaking the silence that had fallen since his last growth spurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe didn't want to make Clark feel bad; she knew he wasn't enjoying this one bit. \"Oh...you're probably not as big as you think you are...I dunno...two hundred pounds? But I bet most of that's just muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a terrible liar,\" Clark smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe grinned. \"Well, it doesn't matter how much you weigh anyway. You look great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...thanks,\" Clark said, looking completely shocked. \"Maybe I should move from this couch, before I get stuck here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might be an idea,\" Chloe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe stood up with ease, but Clark was having a little more difficulty, he was trying to pull himself out of the couch, but it was like he was wedged in there! He struggled and struggled, grunting and groaning, his face red with colour as he propelled himself forward. Finally, he managed to get to the edge of the seat, but he had to rest and catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...this is harder than I thought it would be,\" Clark sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need any help?\" Chloe asked extended her hand towards the flustered Clark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark looked up at her and smiled, then took her hand. He struggled once more, using his other hand to propel himself up off the couch. Shakily, Clark got to his feet, and Chloe tried her best to help him up, though she got the feeling she wasn't exactly of much use. Clark gave a groan as he finally stood up, a good hundred pounds heavier than he had been when he first sat down with Lana earlier that evening. As he got to his feet, his belly dropped, completely obscuring his private parts, and for a moment it looked as though he might fall over. Chloe held onto his hand, trying to steady him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think so...\" Clark said. \"I'm not used to all this weight...it's difficult to keep my balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want to go?\" Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd rather find somewhere to sleep that I know I won't outgrow in the morning,\" Clark said. \"So the barn's out of the question. If I even try to get up to my bed I'll probably fall through the floorboards, that's if I don't break the ladder first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your parents won't be back for two days, you could always sleep in their room?

I don't think my body will break that any time soon!\" Chloe nodded at Clark's plan and suppressed a smile. Clark's decision had let loose a wonderful, crazy idea! \"Sounds good Clark. I'll help you get set up in there. I'm afraid I don't have any clothes big enough for you now though, and all the clothing stores are closed, so you'll have to sleep naked tonight, okay?\" Clark nodded in embarrassment. If Chloe hadn't just begun to date him, Clark would have made her leave after his clothes ripped, but under the circumstances, he was willing to let his new girlfriend help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After Chloe lowered him onto the Kent's' sturdy, old fashioned bed (which looked big enough to fit six normal-sized people) and covering his body with the bed-sheets and comforter, Chloe asked him if she could stay at \"here\" overnight. After all, her dad was at a Luthercorp seminar in Topeka all weekend, and wouldn't miss her. Clark answered \"yes\". assuming Chloe was asking if she could stay in the guest bedroom. However, what Chloe had was ACTUALLY asking was if it was okay for her to share the bed with Clark, and sleep was not the first thing on Chloe's mind! After making a quick run by her house to pick up some clothes and toiletry items, Chloe quickly returned to Clark's house and got ready for bed. As Chloe began to change into her sexiest pair of underwear, Chloe secretly hoped Clark hadn't fallen asleep yet, and thought about the craziness of the plan she was about to execute. On the one hand, things were already moving REALLY fast in her new relationship with Clark; faster than she would ever allowed in a relationship with any other guy. Furthermore, she was a little worried that Clark would reject her advances, putting her new-found status as Clark's \"girlfriend\" in jeopardy. On the other hand,...let's face it, Chloe had been in love withe Clark since the day they met, over five years ago, and she felt like that was more than an adequate amount of preparation for this moment on her part! What's more, Chloe admitted to herself that, although she would be in love with Clark at any size, she found \"fat Clark\" to be the sexiest model of her boyfriend she had ever seen! Chloe shrugged at that though, unconcerned by its implications. 'I guess I just like that there's just so...MUCH of him to love now!', Chloe thought to herself while blushing a deep shade of red. She was turned on just thinking about joining Clark in bed now, and couldn't help but wonder if his belly was the only part of Clark's body that  jiggled in that almost hypnotic way that Chloe found so sexy and captivating! That made the decision for her. Although Chloe knew she would continue to love Clark when he \"inevitably\" returned to his normal size, Chloe knew she would never forgive herself for not taking the chance to fully enjoy Clark when he was at his biggest. 'Here goes nothing then!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Chloe entered into the room and was glad to see that Clark was still awake on his parent's bed. Chloe felt very naughty for what she was about to do, and knew that she would probably have trouble looking the Kent's in the eye for awhile if her plan went off without a hitch, but it would be worth it! \"Oh, Clark...\" Chloe whispered in the sexiest voice she could manage once she was standing right beside the bed, \"your girlfriend's got a present for you!\" Clark was about to ask Chloe what she was talking about when he turned around and saw Chloe, dressed only in a lingerie set that left very little to the imagination. Chloe's intentions could not be any clearer! Before Clark could find the words to reply to Chloe, she had already thrown herself on top of him and begun to make out with Clark on his parents' bed! Clark was caught in the moment for several minuted, kissing Chloe fervently back before his head cleared enough to say something. \"Are you sure you want to do this now. Chloe? I mean, we just got together, and I'm enormous right now!\" \"So?!\" Chloe shrugged him off, making it clear to Clark she had absolutely no problem with him being fat, or the speed their relationship was progressing! \"Besides, I've taken...precautions.\", Chloe added as she placed a balloon-like object on the bedside table. Clark knew what that was, and it became clear just how far Chloe wanted to take her relationship with him tonight. Clark was excited, but tried to be level-headed about his current situation. \"But what if I...start expanding again?\" Clark managed to mutter in between Chloe kisses. \"This bed is pretty big Clark. If that happens, I'll just shift to the side until it stops, then we'll start up again!\" Clark nodded and was about to leave at that, before an obvious thought finally crossed his mind. In his excitement, and his worry over his expanding body, Clark had almost forgotten that he was an alien, who, despite his current weakness, probably still had superpowers; like heat vision, for example... Clark tried to roll away just before Chloe started to further unclothe herself, but Chloe held on to her boyfriend's enormous body, preventing him from getting away. \"What's the matter, Clark? Don't you want this?!\" Clark could see from the distressed look on Chloe's face that she was worried he didn't want her. Or worse, she might be thinking he was thinking of going back to Lana and calling his new relationship with Chloe off. Chloe immediately got out of the bed, and was about to storm off, labeling her move on Clark a \"big mistake\" before Clark panicked and said the first thing that he thought off. Given Clark's compromised emotional state. he wasn't thinking clearly and immediately blurted out, \"I'm an alien, Chloe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Chloe immediately stopped walking out the door, and turned around to look at Clark. She could see from the look in his eyes that he was being completely truthful, and, given the strange events that always surrounded him, she saw no reason to doubt her new boyfriend. Chloe raised her eyebrow. \"Continue.\" Clark gulped. He hadn't meant to reveal his lineage to Chloe so soon, but he was glad she was taking it so well! \"I was sent in a spaceship to earth by my parents as a baby before their planet exploded. Unfortunately, my ship's engine caught some of my planet's remains in it's wake, causing the meteor shower when I crash-landed in Smallville...\" Clark looked down in shame at this point, but Chloe took his hand, and with a look of pure trust, replied. \"It still wasn't your fault Clark. You were a baby at the time for crying out loud! What else?\" She gently prodded. Clark smiled at his understanding girlfriend, sure now that he had made the right choice: picking her over Lana.\"There's a bunch of other stuff, but the main issue here is that I have powers which I've used to defend this town. like the ability to shoot beams off pure heat out of my eyes. That ability sometimes goes off without my consent though, when I get...excited.\" Clark looked away in embarrassment, and Chloe smile in amusement, immediately getting Clark's point. \" I think I have the hang of it now, but I've never done this...before, and I don't want to hurt you!\" Chloe nodded in understanding. \"Thank you for your honesty Clark. Now I'm going to be honest with you. I've cared about you since the day we met...\"Chloe thought it might be to early to tell Clark she was in love with him. \"and I wouldn't care if you were from mars. I trust you, and I KNOW you won't hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  To prove her point, Chloe immediately climbed back on top of Clark belly, took of her bra, and resumed kissing him passionately. Suddenly..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   ( chapter author's note: more mature content ahead, but nothing too extreme)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Clark started expanding again! Once more, Clark's belly and butt began to grow, right underneath Chloe this time! However, that was not the only area of Clark that was becoming noticeably plumper, as the alien's hips, thighs, waist and (for the first time) arms and face underwent an extreme transformation! In fact, the new couple noted that this may have been Clark's biggest expansion so far! Somewhat freaked out by the newest changes to his body; Clark was nevertheless consoled by the fact that he had been through this before, as well as Chloe's apparent  lack of panic or disgust at the sight of Clark's new body. During the expansion, Chloe appeared the very embodiment of calm and serenity, merely shifting her weight on top of Clark's growing gut while somehow managing to stay on top of her increasingly rotund new boyfriend from another planet.This was just a facade though. In actuality, Clark's new girl was extremely excited by the transformation of the Kryptonian's body, and was letting her mind wander as she thought about what she was going to do with \"so MUCH man [Kryptonian]!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Eventually, the transformation ceased, and Chloe was left laying on top of a whole new, at least quarter-ton, Clark Kent! She couldn't help but stare at the sight of her beau's new body, completely covered in a thick layer of fat: from his swollen ankles, to his beefy legs and thighs, his rotund belly, large moobs, and moon like face, complete with big cherubic cheeks, and a large double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally, Chloe couldn't suppress her feeling any longer, and let out a moan of appreciation and approval at the sight of the morbidly obese alien. She knew that she should have been worried, that Clark probably should be losing weight by now, instead of setting a new personal  record, but she was too turned on to care. After all, there was only one thing Chloe's normally analyzing mind couldn't seem to be rational about, and that was Clark Kent! Alien or not, muscular or hugely obese, Chloe Sullivan loved the farm boy, and always would. In her heart, the blond young woman couldn't understand how having more Clark around to love could possibly be a bad thing. It just meant there was more of him around for her to enjoy with her eyes and...other sensory organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Finally starting to calm down, Clark took note of Chloe's involuntary expression of approval and his wind wandered for a thousand of a second(he could still think at super speed). He was finally beginning to notice that; not only was Chloe not repulsed by Clark's fatter form, she actually preferred his current fat body to his previous muscular one! After taking several nano-seconds to absorb that shocking revelation, the alien briefly wondered if his new girl would still want him after he went back to his old form. However, Clark quickly found the answer in Chloe's eyes, which held the same look of love and devotion he had seen on her several times before while she looked at him. Most of those looks had been shot in his direction long before he had gotten fat. It was clear that Chloe would love him regardless of his weight (or planet of origin for that matter)! Even so, Chloe obviously REALLY liked \"fat Clark\",  and he wasn't about to disappoint his new flame by not giving her a \"good time\" while he was still a \"big boy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver an hour later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After Clark and Chloe's \"intimate time\" was over. Clark and Chloe quickly changed the sheets of the Kent's bed (just in case) and Chloe put on more appropriate sleeping attire. Unbeknownst to the two love-struck teenagers, one of Chloe's earrings had fallen off the bed while they were changing the sheets, and was now on the floor next to Martha's bed-side table!  Afterwards, Chloe quickly fell asleep with her head on Clark's chest, still absent-mindedly rubbing Clark's huge belly as she slept. Clark, who was still wide awake and,strangely, felt more energized then he had since the expansions had started, let his thought wander once more. Sure, he was on cloud nine right now, but he still worried about whether or not he would be back to normal by the time his parents got home. What if his condition was permanent after all? What would he tell them then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  By the time the weekend was over, Clark had told Chloe as much about his alien biology: abilities, weaknesses, etc., as he knew. He even told her about the various kinds of kryptonite he had encountered, and how he had discovered what he knew about his origins. When they went to dispose of the yellow k, the couple noticed it had no effect on Chloe, and no additional effect on Clark, for reasons they could not determine. Also, Clark noticed that, to his pleasant surprise, his body had gotten used to its new size, and his abilities were at full strength again. However, his hunger did not diminish one bit, and Chloe had to go shopping for more food (as well as bigger clothes) more than once to fill Clark's ravenous appetite. Not that Chloe minded feeding her\"big man\"! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  By the time Clark's parents arrived later than expected on Monday night, Clark was...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Of course, by this point, it had already been determined that Dr. Crusher's machine was not working on Clark Kent at all, although it strangely worked on all of the human subjects that it had been tested with. Clark believed his \"anomalous test results\" were probably the result of his alien biology, the effects of the yellow K, or both. Regardless, the failure of the machine to cure Clark yielded two important results: Lex became even more suspicious that Clark was somehow \"special\", and it became apparent that Clark was stuck like this. After all, exercise seemed to have no effect, and no liposuction equipment would ever be able to pierce Clark's skin. Clark was terrified about how his parent's would react to the news! So far, no one except for Chloe and Lex and co. had seen Clark fat (it had been a 3-day weekend), but now his parents were coming home, and Clark would have some explaining to do. Chloe, on the other hand, was secretly glad the effects of the yellow k were permanent. She knew that was selfish, but she really enjoyed how Clark Kent looked and felt while fat, even though she would still have loved him even if he had become muscular again!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Predictably, when Clark's parents got home and saw their now heavy adoptive son holding Chloe Sullivan's hand, they were both shocked and confused. \"Clark! What happened to you?!\" Martha Kent exclaimed at the site of the \"new Clark\". Thankfully, Clark and Chloe had prepared for this obvious question, and told the Kent's the tale they had invented to keep Clark out of trouble: Clark had been running to school when some jerk tossed the yellow K out of his car right in front of Clark, who had immediately begun to get fat. Luckily, Chloe had been driving to school in her vehicle, saw Clark in dire straits and helped him to dispose of the yellow rock. Unfortunately, Clark had to use his super speed to get home, since he had outgrown his clothes and was too big to fit in Chloe's vehicle, making it necessary for Clark to tell Chloe about his alien origins (Johnathon raised his eyebrow at this point, but  let Clark continue his story). Chloe had, of course, sworn to tell no one about Clark's secret! Lana had come over for her date with Clark that night, and had freaked out over his appearance, telling him not to see her again till the effects of the rock had worn off (there was SOME truth to this story). Since Clark and Chloe had discovered the effects of the rock were permanent, that meant Clark and Lana were broken up now. Martha would have expressed sympathy at this point, but she could tell by Clark's apparent lack of sadness, and the way he kept holding Chloe's hand, that Clark already had a new girl in his life! Martha had a feeling those two would eventually get together, but never that it would be under such weird circumstances!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After the shock had worn off for the elder Kent's, Clark helped them get the heavier luggage from the truck, while Johnathan noted that Clark's strength seemed undiminished, despite the large amount of flab now present on his body! Chloe helped out with some of the lighter items, and the Kent's insisted that Clark's new girlfriend  have dinner with them afterwards, Chloe, of course, accepted. Over dinner, it was decided that Clark would return to school tomorrow, as normal, and would tell the other students he had undergone a meteor-rock related mutation (which was an all to common occurrence in Smallville, and happened to be the truth).Clark reluctantly agreed, and Chloe assured Clark she would support him no matter how the other students reacted. The Kent's smiled, the were glad Clark had such chosen to date someone who would support him unconditionally. However, Martha still had one piece of business to take care of with Chloe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Asking Chloe to help her with the dishes while Clark and Johnathon watched TV after dinner, Martha finally got the chance to talk to Chloe alone, and confront her with something she had discovered. \"Chloe, when I was unpacking in Johnathon's and my room, I found something by the bedside table. I think it might be yours. Must have slipped off your ear while you were getting Clark set up in our room the other night!\" Without another word, Martha placed Chloe's missing earring on the kitchen counter in front of Chloe as the blonde teen's eyes went wide in shock. The panicked look on Chloe's face was enough to confirm Martha's suspicions about what had already happened between Chloe and her son! Martha sighed, she supposed she should have been mad at the new couple for breaking the house rules (and in their bedroom no less!), but she figured Clark had been through enough traumatic experiences in the past few days, and didn't need to be punished for this as well, which was why she had not shared her suspicions with her husband. Furthermore, although she would never admit it, she was glad Chloe obviously \"cared about\" her son a great deal, through \"thick or thin\", and was being so supportive of Clark throughout his ordeal. Still, with a meaningful look, Martha spoke in a calm, but firm voice, \"Just don't let it happen again!\" Chloe nodded, glad that Martha was letting her and Clark off the hook so easily this time. Although she had no intention of putting her and Clark's physical relationship on hold (she still found his fat, jiggling body very HOT), she would be sure that they would have their \"intimate encounters\" outside the Kent home from now on! After all, that technically wouldn't break any of the Kent's rules (not under THEIR roof!) and besides, her dad's job kept him out of the house a lot anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once Chloe had left to go home, the Kent's set Clark up a makeshift bed on the barn floor, just until they could make Clark something a little more permanent the next day. Clark was wide awake for most of the night though. Although he was glad Chloe (who he was already comfortable with referring to as his \"girlfriend\" in his mind) was more than supportive about his transformation, he doubted the other kids at Smallville High would be so understanding! Even so, the alien eventually drifter off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The next morning at school, the other teens at Smallville High were...</span></div></div>",

Also, it will feature another character gaining weight, although the focus of the gains will still be on Clark.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not very understanding! Thankfully, when Clark first  arrived at school, most of his peers didn't recognize him. However, Clark's classmates quickly caught on, and then the harassment began. \"You blew up like the Goodyear blimp!\" \"There goes our football season!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Clark's attempts to explain his predicament (as he had already done for  faculty) did not help . Many didn't care why Clark was fat, just that he was a target for ridicule. Although some students stopped taunting  him, their pity and whispers were almost worse. One such exclamation, made under the breathe of another Senior, caught his attention. \"Dang! It's like a reverse Jodi!\" The mention of Jodi, a fat girl that had been Clark's former classmate, really took the Clark back.Jodi had been harassed by classmates because of her weight. The similarities to Clark's situation were not lost on him. Clark and his friends had never taken part in the taunting, and had tried to defend her. Clark  wondered if he had tried hard enough to help her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lost in his thoughts, and without Chloe's direction (she was busy giving a taunting Senior a tongue lashing), Clark walked right into Lois, knocking her to the floor. Clark apologized and helped her up. During the weekend his parents had been away, Lois had been with some of her friends. She had not yet seen Clark's new body, and the alien knew Lois would have some  insult for him. She didn't disappoint. \"Wow, Clark! I heard the rumors, but...You better watch yourself LARGEville, you're can't just wander aimlessly. You're an obstacle the size of a mack...\" Before Lois could finish, she stopped  while looking  behind Clark. There stood Chloe, glaring, and she was mad! Taking Clark's hand, Chloe spoke. \"Stop making fun of my boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lois's eyes went wide.  She hadn't heard that Chloe was dating Clark now! She turned to Clark, \"Are you two?!\" \"Yes.\" Clark replied. \"But I thought you and Lana...\"Chloe rolled her eyes as Clark replied. \"We broke up. I think, under the circumstances, it was the best thing.\" Lois nodded, this was a lot to take in. First, Clark blimps out. Then Smallville High's \"dream couple\" breaks up, and now, her cousin was dating Clark! Lois had thought for sure that Chloe's feeling for Clark had just been infatuation. Watching Chloe now, defending her heavy boyfriend from her wrath, Lois realized that Chloe's feeling for the boy scout were much deeper. \"I'm...sorry, Clark.\" Lois reluctantly muttered. \"But you better watch yourself! If you break her heart, I'll break you!\" Clark just smirked as Lois stormed off, looking embarrassed at the recent turn of events. For the rest of the year, and most of the time in the Kent home, Lois refrained from commenting on Clark's weight or appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The situation with Lana was worse. Throughout Clark's first day back ,Lana had avoided Clark and Chloe.This would have bothered them,but they had enough to worry about. Lana only saw them once that day, at lunch.There, Clark wolfed down two large trays of  food while casually sitting next to Chloe, who was talking and laughing with her boyfriend,unfazed by his eating habits. Lana was freaked out by this scene, and ran away before her ex could see her. It would be another week before she could work up the nerve to apologize to Clark for how she had treated him. Another month before her, Clark, and Chloe were comfortable enough with each other to be friends again. Lana's relationship with Clark would never be the same, and she still feel guilty for how she had treated him . Only after Lana formed a support group for the meteor infected did she begin to feel like a good person again, despite Clark and Chloe's protests that her reaction had been understandable, given her traumatic past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 years later...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Clark and Chloe's relationship continued. With Chloe, Clark found the Kryptonian stones in time to stop Zod and his lackeys from invading. They had also managed to get Lex sent to prison, and Doomsday to the Phantom Zone, after separating the beast from Davis Bloome, who got psychiatric help. Clark asked Chloe to marry him, but she told him to wait till their careers were on track. Now, she was an assistant editor at the Daily Planet, and Clark was the paper's star reporter, and Chloe had finally said \"yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    So, here Chloe was.Lois once again tried to help Chloe fit in the dress she was going to marry Clark in. But it wouldn't fit anymore, and she would need to have it adjusted! \"I told you.\" Lois teased playfully.  \"Date a big guy, and before you know it, you'll pack on the pounds!\" \"It's not Clark's fault..\" \"I know!\" Lois interrupted, holding up her hand. She had heard Chloe's defense of Clark.\"But his size has effected his appetite, that guy eats like an elephant!\" Chloe shrugged, \"I don't care, I love him, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him!\"  Lois replied, \"I know that, and I'm happy for you. Clark's a great guy that makes you happy. But honestly, some of his eating habits have rubbed off on you...\" Chloe nodded. Clark's increased appetite had caused him to eat large amounts of  fatty foods on a daily basis. At first, Chloe had resisted any change in her own eating habits,but eventually, she found herself eating like Clark on occasion. Despite her fast metabolism and hectic schedule. Chloe had gained 10 pounds in 4 years, but next to Clark's large figure, it seemed like nothing, so Chloe hadn't worried. However, her first year as an editor had been stressful, and the workload caused her to \"stress eat\" large quantities of food often. The sedentary nature of the job didn't help. Clark had said nothing while Chloe had gained another 10 pounds in a year. She knew this from her bathroom scale that morning. \"I know.You're not saying I shouldn't marry him?\" Lois shook her head. \"That's up to you. I'm only pointing out that if you stay with him, you might put on  more weight.\" Chloe thought about this a moment. She knew Lois was right, but didn't care. \"Well, that's not what I want, but Clark's worth the risk.\" Lois just nodded and took the dress away to be altered. She knew better than to push the issue with Chloe.Chloe just hoped that, if she did get fat, Clark would be ok with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Chloe stepped on the scale. It was the day after her honeymoon, and she had been so happy,she had forgotten to watch her eating . As a consequence, she had been more gluttonous than usual,eating almost as much as Clark! Now Chloe realized she had gained another 5 pounds in the last week, more than 30 pounds heavier than when she had started dating Clark. As she stepped off the scale with a look of shock , Clark came up behind her and enveloped her in a hug, which always made her happy.Clark was now about 700 pounds, the weight he had stabilized at since becoming a sophomore in college; a result of his huge appetite, not that Chloe minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Is something wrong?\" Chloe sighed and pulled away from Clark. \"I've gained a lot of weight since we've started dating.\" Clark nodded, he had noticed Chloe had put on some pounds since then. 'Does it bother her? Does she want to leave me, since my eating habits contributed to that?' Clark thought. Chloe elaborated, \"I know my healing power will keep me healthy,but it bothers me. I don't want to become your fat, unattractive wife.\" Before Chloe could protest, Chloe added, \"I know you're fat, and it looks really good on YOU. But that wasn't your fault. This is my fault.\" Chloe shook her potbelly to emphasize her point. \"I  don't want it to get out of hand.\" Clark had to keep himself from laughing, he couldn't believe Chloe had missed something so obvious. \"Chloe, have I ever told you to control your eating habits,or go to a gym?\" \"No, but I thought that's because you would have felt like a hypocrite...\" \"No, it was because I kind of enjoyed you gaining weight.It's like you always said to me, 'It's nice  to have more of you love.' I feel the same way about you! Besides, I think you potbelly is sexy!\" Chloe smiled, \"And you really don't mind if I get fat?!\" \"Let's put it this way, even if you got bigger than me, you would be my dream girl! I would like you to stay mobile though, so you can continue to enjoy life.\" Chloe let out a sigh of relief. \"I think I can manage that. In the mean time, I have to go to work, and I hear that donut place next door calling my name!\" Clark smiled, gave Chloe a kiss, and let his wife head out the door. He would meet her at work later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   When Chloe arrived at work  with a dozen donuts, Lois (the Planet's newest reporter) was already there early. \"Are you having a party or something?\" \"No, these donuts are for me. You can have one if you want though.\" Lois blinked in surprise. \"No thanks. Um, Chloe? Do you remember that conversation we had?\" \"The one were you implied I was getting fat because of Clark and needed to slow down on my eating? \"Yeah. Well about those donuts..\" \"Lois, I know you are trying to help, but Clark and I already had a talk about that.\" \"And?\" \"We decided I could just get fat!\" \"Are you serious!?\" \"Yep. And you know what? I'm happier than I've been in a long time. Really takes the pressure off, you know? Anyway, I would appreciate it if you would let me worry about my weight from now on.\" Lois nodded and walked away in bewilderment as Chloe began munching on her first donut with a smile on her face. At this rate, Chloe knew she would at least surpass the 300 pound mark, but she didn't mind anymore. It looked like her and Clark would live happily, and fatter, ever after!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lana looked at Clark with a new appreciation. She had realized just how difficult it was for Clark, to let her see him this way. Excusing herself she goes to the bathroom to gather her thoughts. She's possessed by a deep sadness for Clark. When he had originally asked her out, she had deeply hoped that after they had eaten together in public Clark would ask her to the school dance on Saturday night. Since she was certain that Clark wanted no one else to see him this way, that idea was now moot. Or maybe not, she then thought. With a renewed sense of confidence Lana returned to the living room. She then asked Clark, \"Once you realized what the meteor rock was doing to you, where did you put that rock?\" Now very uncomfortable talking to Lana about it Clark said, \"It's in a box out in the barn. I think we should leave it there. Like I already told you Lex's doctor said, in probably 2 or 3 days I'll return to my normal size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana then said, \"Clark I just remembered something I left in the car. I'll be right back.\" Lana then dashed outside immediately turning towards the barn. Seconds later, Clark realized where Lana REALLY was going to and as fast as he could waddle Clark went out to stop her. When he stepped outside he felt another fattening growth spurt occur that severely tightened all of his clothes. Arriving at the open barn door, Clark heard Lana triumphantly yell out, \"I've found it.\" Holding it up in her hand, Lana is fascinated by its sparkling in the moonlight. Clutching it with both hands next to her bust, Lana suddenly shivers. Her entire body felt like the temperature had instantly dropped below freezing. When Clark loudly tells Lana to, \"please put it down before it affects you like me.\" She turned and saw Clark's shadow. Lana immediately realized that he had again grown bigger. It also confirmed to her what she had suspected happened to Clark when he told her about the rock in the house. Clark had been so focused on how much fatter he grew, he hadn't noticed that he was now several inches taller. At 4 feet 11 inches tall, Lana had been exactly one foot shorter than Clark. So she instinctively knew how much she tilted her head to look up at Clark. In addition to his newly enlarged stomach, Clark definitely looked a couple inches taller than when she arrived less than an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds, unable to stand the cold Lana placed the rock back in the box. Which really pleased Clark. Descending the stairs Lana is very, very disappointed that nothing happened to her. With a very worried voice Clark asked her, \"Why on Earth would you do such a dangerous action ?\" Lana replied, \"I had an idea, but I guess it's not going to work out.\" Clark was quite relieved to see that Lana was still the same petite size. He figured that the Kryptonite only affected him because he's Kryptonian. As they slowly walk back to the house Lana said, \"Clark, I suddenly feel very thirsty.\" She then ran towards an outside standpipe, turned the water hose on and drank deeply for several minutes.\" Seconds after she stopped Lana became very nauseous and bloated. Her stomach was now visibly much larger than before, which understandably now worried Clark. Carefully she sat down, all the water that she had just drunk was now sloshing around inside of her. The freezing chill returns and Lana again starts shivering. That motion however causes the water to slosh even more inside of her and even worse since water expands when it freezes, so does all of Lana. In addition to seeing her waist grow over a foot larger, and along with becoming a very solid D cup, Lana's bust gained several inches. She even grows over 4 inches taller before her shivering stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark is torn up inside about what to do now. It's seeming less and less likely that the treatment Clark received will fix his problem and now Lana (who means more to him than anyone else other than the Kent's is also going to soon become a lot fatter. When she's feeling a little better all Lana has to say is, \"Wow. I feel like an ice cream cone being stuffed with too much ice cream. It's wonderful.\" Clark is totally perplexed by her statement. Asking her, \"Why did you touch that rock after I warned you how dangerous it is.\" She replied, \"Clark, no matter how long this (pointing at his now much larger body) lasts. I didn't want you to go through this alone. [Now emboldened] How about we go to tomorrow night's dance together? You gotta admit, we'll definitely be the BIGGEST couple there?\" Seconds later while they're both laughing hysterically Clark told Lana, \"Sure, why not. And if the other kids aren't BIG enough to accept us the way we are, it's their loss.\" A little later during dinner Clark has a worried look on his face. Lana asks, \"What are you thinking about?\" Clark said, \"I was wondering if Lex can afford to outfit both of us for the dance?\" Lana blushed over a dozen shades of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lex was confused about how Lana could have gotten herself into the same predicament as Clark, but he had Lana put through the same treatment(with more privacy and full disclosure this time), and gave her and Clark new clothes for the dance Once they had arrived, they were greeted by Chloe and Lois, who were surprised (but happy) to see them there. Surprisingly, no one at the dance (even Lois!) teased Clark and Lana about their recent weight gain. After they had been dancing for over an hour, Clark's curiosity got the better of him and, after excusing himself for a moment, pulled Chloe aside and asked, \"Not that I'm not relieved or anything, but why isn't anyone saying anything about my sudden...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yours and Lana's sudden horizontal growth?\" She quietly added for him. Clark just nodded.In truth, he hadn't even though about the possibility that someone would make fun of Lana (who had gotten even bigger since last night) for her weight gain. He supposed that was because he still thought of Lana as being beautiful, and would think that even if she got bigger or stayed this way permanently... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I MIGHT have let it slip that there was another meteor-related problem in our town, which make people suddenly gain weight. You know, just in case your condition didn't wear off by Monday. Word travels fast in a small town! I'm glad you decided to go to the dance after all, Clark, but I was wondering...how did Lana get infected too?\" Clark quickly explained the situation to Chloe, who nodded her head in understanding and said,\" Wow, that was a really brave and thoughtful thing for Lana to do for you. I told you she would understand! Well, a slow dance number is coming on , you might want to go back to your date now!\" Clark thanked Chloe, and quickly headed back to where Lana was waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe watched the (now) large couple dancing and thought to herself, \" I wish it was me dancing with Clark, but I'm happy for him and Lana. They go really well together, and they stick by each other through thick or thin, in this case very THICK. I'm just glad Clark has someone that makes him happy.\" With that though in mind, Chloe went back to dance with her date for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy Monday...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I believe it is fine, but if he or she disagrees and deletes this entry, that will be fine. Just know I have no intent to screw up this story)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy Monday, Clark and Lana were back to their normal sizes, although they could not decide whether that was because of Lex's \"treatment\" or if the the effects of the yellow rock (which Lex had safely disposed of) were temporary to begin with. Strangely, the effects of the rock wore off faster for Clark than for Lana, even taking into account the amount of time Clark had been infected and Lana had not. Clark supposed it had something to do with him being a Kryptonian. He knew that now that he and Lana were closer, he would have to tell her about his secret pretty soon. In any case, Clark was relieved that they didn't have to tell his parents about the latest meteor rock fiasco, he just hoped they would not find out about it from someone else. Lana was just as happy her aunt Nell had not found out about the situation. However, something was still bothering her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark and Lana's relationship had grown over the last couple months, and Clark had even told her Lana about his alien origins a few weeks ago. Although this shocked Lana, she decided that she liked Clark enough to date him despite their ...differences. To everyone at Smallville High, it looked like everything was perfect for the couple. But, as far as Lana was concerned, there was still something missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was happy to be with Clark, and that he had finally told her his secret, she had a secret of her own, and it was tearing her up inside to hide it from Clark. The truth was...she had really enjoyed being fat. Even though it had mostly been water weight, she had liked how it felt to be 350 pounds (at her heaviest). All though she had tried to push such thoughts out of her head, they would not let her go, and she had recently resorted to secret bouts of binge eating to make some of that feeling come back, at least temporarily. To her surprise, being stuffed with her favorite foods felt even better than being stuffed with water, and it tasted better too. However, her new eating habits were starting to show up on her figure, and Lana knew Clark would take notice soon. Therefore, one Saturday, alone with Clark at the top floor of Clark's loft, Lana decided to come clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark, did you still like me when I was fat?\" Lana had not intended to be so forward, but she decided the direct approach was as good as any other with a subject like this. Clark, not quite getting her drift, replied, \"Of course, Lana, I still loved you. Besides, I was even bigger than you at the time, so I don't see why you would want to worry about this.\" Lana sighed, she would just have to spell things out for Clark, \"I know, and I know this is a weird question but, did you still find me...attractive?\" Clark was rather perplexed by the question, but he had to admit he had still found Lana attractive at her heaviest, maybe even more so. He replied, \"Well, actually yes, I still thought you were sexy.\" He paused awkwardly, \"Why are your asking me this?\" Lana looked REALLY nervous now, but decided to just come out with it. \"Because, well...I enjoyed being fat, ok?\" She decided to finish before Clark could interrupt. \"I know it's weird but I really enjoyed being heavy and I have recently started overeating,on purpose, and it feels really good. Clark, I don't know what's come over me, but I really want to be fat again!\" By this point, Lana, who just KNEW Clark would reject her now, was in tears. She added, \"I mean, is that so wrong? If if I can date an alien...from another planet, couldn't you bring yourself to date a fat girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark didn't even have to think about it. Lana was his dream girl, he had loved her since he was five. \"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lana didn't understand Clark's reaction, did he think she was joking? Before she could say another word, Clark elaborated. \" I love you Lana, and I would be attracted to you at any size. If you think eating and getting fat will make you happy, then you should go with that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana smiled, \"That's...just amazing!\" After a few moments of taking the situation in, Lana replied with a grin on her face\" Well, I bet you Mom still has plenty of those delicious apple and cherry pies in the fridge, would you mind getting me one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark returned her smile and replied, \"An apple or cherry pie?\" Lana, giving him a naughty, seductive look, just replied, \"Yes, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Clark dashed of to fetch Lana her two desserts. He still didn't now what the future held, but he was sure of one thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBIG changes would soon be in store for Lana Lang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since their business ended unexpectedly early on Sunday, Jonathan suggested that rather than staying another night at the hotel they leave for Smallville right away. Because she was anxious to return home, Martha volunteered to trade shifts driving. So it was a little before 7 a.m. when they drove up the County lane to their farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT SUNDAY DOWN ON THE FARM:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dance on Saturday night, Clark had suggested to Lana that it would probably be better if she stayed at the farm until she shrunk back to her normal size on Sunday or Monday. He felt that it would be better for both of them. With so many kids seeing them at their new jumbo size, no one would be surprised if they didn't show up for school. Lana readily accepted Clark's offer. After all, she thought, this sure is a different way for me to see a whole LOT more of Clark. Lana came up with a surprisingly large number of things for them to do and talk about while they both grew much bigger on Sunday. Surprisingly, while Lana's appetite seemed to be increasing even faster than her new body's growth, Clark's stayed the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking things even worse for Clark's sanity, nosey Lois showed up bright and early Sunday morning. Being new to Smallville, she still couldn't get over actually SEEING one of Chloe's meteor freak stories in person. Lois had always assumed that Chloe had been exaggerating when she told Lois about all of the strange events in and around Smallville. While Clark was out doing his morning chores, Lois convinced Lana to show her the box containing the yellow rock, which of course Lois just HAD to hold. Although she put some gloves on, just to be safe, Lois dropped it almost immediately due to the intense cold it radiated. So she would soon be affected differently by it than Clark and Lana had been. When she didn't start plumping up with a few minutes Lois totally dismissed their story. Thoroughly stumped Lana then said, \"Well Lois, I guess the rock decided that you're already BIG enough.\" That drew a strange look from Lois and she left the farm. Lana decided to not tell Clark about Lois' visit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark grew increasingly anxious about how quickly his body would return to normal. Later Sunday morning after Lois had left, Clark noticed that Lana for some unknown reason seemed to be really enjoying her still expanding frontier. Surprisingly he hadn't noticed that they were both growing a little taller every time they grew fatter. He thought that every girl's biggest worry was GAINING too much weight, yet it seemed to him that Lana wouldn't be at all unhappy if her body ended up staying at this new size. Which worried him even more every time her body again expanded. By Sunday night, while Lana still had a couple inches clearance entering the house, but Clark now could BARELY squeeze through the front door. So he suggested that they should both sleep out in the barn. \"To be on the safe side,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana then started laughing SO hard she fell down in the living room. It was almost 10 minutes later before Lana had calmed down enough to tell Clark what was so funny. Wearing a very impish grin, Lana told Clark, \"For the past couple of years, I've wanted to get you to roll in the hay with me, Clark and it seems that I only had to gain a couple hundred pounds for you to ask me. Isn't that just delicious?\" Clark doesn't see the humor in the situation so he's not at all thrilled about Lana's happiness. While he can still get to the house telephone to double check about things, Clark called Lex. Lex assured him again that both of them WOULD be returning to normal in the next 12 to 18 hours. Since Clark had been affected first, he should shrink back first. Clark thanked Lex for his encouraging news. He then went out to the barn to sleep with Lana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he didn't mention THAT to Lex. Mind you, they did sleep in separate horse stalls. Something Lana was perfectly content to do, which was really a relief to Clark. Which was far more than he would EVER admit to Lana. After all, she figured that technically she would be sleeping in the same room (so to speak) with Clark so she was happy with that. Since Clark wanted to get whatever chores done that he could Monday morning, Lana was alone in the barn when the Kent's unexpectedly returned early. When they drove up Martha noticed Lana's car parked by the barn and said to Jonathan, \"Well I guess we should have called Clark to tell him we would be coming home early after all.\" Jonathan asked why and she pointed out Lana's car to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Lana waddled out of the barn, Martha gasped at how big she had ballooned. By then, Lana had already gained nearly 250 pounds, she was now nearly 3 inches taller and Lana was happier than she had ever been in her life. Clark was still out in the fields and he had gained over 300 pounds and 4 inches. Once Martha had recovered from the shock of Lana's new size, Lana told the Kent's about the pretty yellow rock that had caused her sudden growth to start on Friday afternoon. Knowing everything that they knew about Kryptonite they just pretended to be as surprised as they should. Shortly after Lana had finished, Clark returned from his early morning rounds. He wore a very nervous smile and having used his super-hearing to hear everything Lana told them he just nodded, yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the size that they had both become, it seemed reasonable that Clark and Lana should stay at the farm until this whole event was over with. The Kent's went inside for some well needed sleep. Everyone figured that by sunset both kids should be back to normal. To be helpful, Lana made breakfast and lunch for everyone. Considering how much food she had eaten that weekend, Lana figured that was only fair. Had she not been so tired, Martha would have more strenuously disagreed with Lana than she did that morning. When the Kent's went outside late that afternoon, had either or both of them finally returned to their normal size AND has anything happened to Lois yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Lana and Clark sat down for lunch he shrank, just a little, for the first time. Not wanting to wake his parents, they both quietly cheered the good news. Clark ate his usual lunch but Lana ate over twice her normal amount. Looking at how much food Lana was comfortably putting away at every meal really worried Clark. He was stumped over why the Kryptonite seemed to be having such an extreme effect on only Lana. He was fervently hoping that when she returned back to her normal size, her appetite would follow. Clark would be beside himself, if Lana ended up ANY heavier than before her encounter with the Kryptonite. Clark now deeply regretted that Lana had even SEEN him fat in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before dinner-time the Kent's came downstairs. They had both been bone-tired and really needed the rest. Lana was sitting outside because she had not fit through the front door since shortly after she finished making the meals. By then, Clark had shrunk enough to MAYBE squeeze through but he told Lana that he would wait to go inside. He felt that they should go through the front door together for the first time. Clark was stunned that Lana then wrapped her arms, as much as she could, around Clark giving him the longest, sexiest kiss she could. When she FINALLY came up for air Lana immediately said, \"Why, thank you Clark, it'll be just like we've just married and you're carrying me over the threshold.\" Taken aback by Lana's statement, Clark saw absolutely NOTHING wrong with what she had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the kids still sitting outside, Jonathan asked, \"Well, any good news yet?\" Lana yelled back in reply, \"Clark's shrinking, but I'm still growing bigger Mr. Kent. Considering how much time it was between when we each touched the rock, I should begin shrinking soon.\" Lana was right. About half an hour later a pop came from inside her and Lana felt the pressure inside lessen ever so slightly. It wasn't apparent to anyone else that Lana was shrinking for another couple of hours. It was late that evening when Lana could again fit through the front door and true to his word Clark very gingerly lifted Lana (he needed to pretend that he could barely pick her up) and then carried her inside. After carefully putting Lana down on her feet, Clark enthusiastically returned the kiss Lana had given him earlier. The look on Martha Kent's face seeing THAT was worth everything they had been through the past 3 days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha then made up the guest bed for Lana. She still didn't fit in her car and it WAS quite late. So for THREE nights in a row, Lana was thrilled to have slept under the same roof as Clark. This great achievement was something she wasn't about to tell Chloe or anyone else. Lana never did and other than the Kent's, the only people to EVER learn about this were SOME of the Legionnaires from the 31st Century. Clark let it slip out when he visited them in the future. Waking up the next morning, Lana and Clark hadn't fully shrunk back but the were now small enough to go to school. Jonathan drove them into town and they sat in the pickups bed. That day between classes they dashed to the nearest restroom to tighten up their clothes whenever they shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana was far more pleased than Clark with all the complements they received that day from their classmates. So although Clark knew how Chloe had smoothed things over for him at the school dance, he just couldn't bring himself to thank Chloe when he saw her at lunch. She was disappointed and hurt by his seemingly snubbing her. His feelings for Lana had grown over the weekend and he felt that they should BOTH thank Chloe for her help. So after the last class bell rang. Clark searched out Lana and together they went to the Torch. Chloe displeasure with Clark melted when they quietly and privately thanked her. Sitting in a chair next to where they stood, Chloe noticed something odd about them and asked, \"Say, how much longer do you two think it'll be, before you return to normal? I would swear both of you are now taller than you were.\" Before Clark can say anything Lana jumps in saying, \"I know Chloe, we're both taller than before. Isn't it wonderful. For once these meteor rocks have done something good for someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing Chloe's right, Clark now realizes why all day things have seemed out of place. He's still 75 pounds heavier than usual but his clothes are growing more comfortable every hour. Even though Lana has now also shrunk a lot, her appetite hasn't. Clark noticed that at breakfast that morning and very delicately asked Lana about it. Lana wasn't bothered one bit about Clark's question and truthfully answered that she's still as hungry as she was over the weekend. Since her car was still at his farm, Chloe offered to drive both of them out there. It wasn't that tight of a squeeze because by now they both could fit in a normal sized car. Compacts were still out of bounds, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the drive out to the Kent farm, Lana asked Chloe if she had seen Lois at school. Chloe said, \"now that you mention it, I haven't seen her since the dance. Why are you asking Lana? Do you think she has gotten herself into something?\" Lana replied, \"No, not anything off hand. It's just that on Sunday morning, Lois showed up at Clark's and before I knew it, she had talked me into showing her the pretty yellow rock that made Clark and I grow fat.\" Clark than jumps in, \"Oh no Lana, you didn't let her touch it, did you?\" Lana then replied, \"She did put some gloves on and Lois dropped it immediately after she had picked it up. She didn't start growing fatter like we had right away so she left not believing me. I was just wondering why I hadn't seen her at school today.\" Chloe then said that she would go looking for Lois when she returned to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Lois was new to Smallville, Chloe figured that it wouldn't take her long to find Lois. It was just past sunset, when Chloe finally found Lois' car wrecked on a little used road, a couple of miles out of town with a flat tire. Knowing the General had raised Lois pretty much as a tom-boy she couldn't figure out why Lois hadn't fixed the flat herself. She saw Lois' purse lying on the front seat, her clothes in the back but no sign of Lois anywhere near the car. Now worried about what's happened to her cousin, Chloe called the Sheriff's Office from her mobile telling them about the accident. In less than 10 minutes, a Deputy drove up with the County Crime Scene Unit. They were treating this as a possible crime location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Deputy took her statement, Chloe went back to her car. She called Lana (who was still at Clark) and told them about the accident, Chloe the plugged in her IPOD and drove home. Turning it off when she arrives home, Chloe was surprised to hear SQUEAKING coming from the floor of her back seat. Looking to see what it was, Chloe just couldn't keep herself from laughing out loud when she saw Lois sitting there glaring at her naked, all SEVEN inches of her. Chloe then said, \"Well Lois, I suppose next time you won't touch something when someone tells you not to.\" \"Ya, Ya, Ya.\" Lois replied, just as sarcastic as she could. Chloe then locked Lois in her car. An hour later, Chloe returned with a dozen outfits from her Barbie dolls. Tossing them on the back seat, Chloe told Lois, \"get dressed, I'm taking you to the Sheriff.\" Lois unhappily did as she was told.</span></div></div>",

Even though the Sheriff WAS a woman, Lois was terribly embarrassed when Chloe had shown her Lois. Chloe further compounded Lois' embarrassment when she said, \"I found the answer to our little problem outside town.\" Although she wasn't full-size, seeing Lois was safe the Sheriff called off the search. Lois was grateful that the Sheriff only told the Deputies that Lois was safe and sound sitting in her office. Chloe giggled loudly at that statement. About 2 1/2 hours after finding Lois, Chloe arrived at the Kent farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drove up the lane, Chloe beeped her horn. Hearing it, the Kent's immediately came outside with Clark and Lana. Except for still being 20 pounds heavier and just a little over 2 inches taller than a few days ago, Clark had returned to his old size. On the other hand, along with still being nearly 2 1/2 inches taller, Lana was still 20(!) dress sizes to big. She also seemed to be shrinking at least twice as slow as Clark. Lana tackled Chloe after she had gotten out of her car. She wanted to again thank Chloe for all of her help at the dance. During the resulting confusion, Chloe dropped her surprise package. Seeing her chance to avoid more embarrassment, Lois first ran under Chloe's car and then towards the open barn door. She had no intention for anyone else to see her in her current REDUCED circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow only 6 1/4 inches tall, Lois was grateful that she had chosen to wear a skirt rather than pants. They would've now been dragging on the ground slowing her escape. Lois made it inside before Chloe realized she had escaped. The surprise now spoiled, Chloe told everyone about Lois so they all fanned out looking for her. Lana was the first to notice the really, really small human footprints heading towards the barn. Not bothering to tell the others Lana went inside alone. Locking the door behind her, Lana KNEW that she had trapped Lois in there. She planned to really gloat, when she found her diminished classmate. Remembering where the box with the yellow Kryptonite was stashed, Lois had taken a bee-line there. She had figured that touching it now at her present size would be the only way Lois could return to her normal size. If Lana hadn't found her when she did, things might have worked out alright for Lois.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since had Lois climbed up from underneath, they both arrived at the box at virtually the same time. Now seeing how comical Lois looked, Lana quickly whipped out her camera phone and told Lois, \"Say, cheese.\" The expression on Lois' face that Lana caught on her phone was priceless. Putting her mobile phone back in its pocket, Lana decided to tease Lois some more with the box. Holding it JUST out of the still barely 6-inch tall Lois reach, Lana shook the box a couple of times. She then proceeded to open the box just a little saying, \"Something in here you're looking for, Lois?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, someone momentarily opened the barn door distracting Lana. Lois took advantage of her unexpected opportunity and leaped towards the still open box. Unfortunately for her, Lana noticed the movement out of the corner of her eye so she reached for the box and closed it. Lois succeeded in barely getting one hand inside, thereby making Lana reopen the box to pull it out. While Lois had wanted to touch the stone, Lana didn't. She was already quite happy with what she expected her bodies new size would end up becoming when she finished shrinking. When Lana pulled Lois' hand out of the box the pinkie finger on her right hand brushed up against the stone a couple of times. Lana felt a slight shiver from the contact. She also stopped shrinking while still a size 16. Standing 5' 1\" and with a now undersized waist, Lana sported a surprisingly sexy figure. Unhappy with not being able to touch the stone, Lois lets go with a real blue streak of words. So Lana angrily threw Lois into the box saying, \"If you're so set on becoming the BIG girl in town Lois, your welcome to it.\" Lana then closed the box with Lois squirming inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds of that, Lois started pleading with Lana to let her out because now she was freezing in there. After Lois at been in there half a minute, Lana turned the box upside down and unceremoniously dumped Lois out, along with the yellow Kryptonite. In that short period of time inside the box Lois had turned a very dark shade of blue which worried Lana. After she had quickly picked up and returned the stone to its box, Lana took Lois inside Clark's house to get her warmed up. Lana didn't mention to Clark anything about what had happened in the barn. Out of embarrassment, Lois also kept quiet about everything that had  happened there. Now small enough to fit comfortably inside her car, Lana drove home to her apartment at the Talon. She had greatly enjoyed spending the weekend with Clark but Lana had really missed not sleeping in her antique 4-poster bed for several days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning right after they both woke up, Lana and Lois immediately realized that they had both grown bigger overnight. While Lana was now even TALLER than she had been before her shrinking started, not all of Lois' body had grown proportionally bigger and boy was she letting EVERYONE within earshot of the Kent house know it! Rolling out of bed, Lana flopped to the floor from the unexpected extra weight now centered firmly on her chest. It took several minutes of fruitless searching before Lana realized that the only shirt big enough to contain ALL of her chest NOW was one of Clark's XL-size sweat shirts. He had left it there, one day after school when he had walked Lana home. Lois was now WAY out of balance because only her legs grew during the night. She was apoplectic over NOW being just 16 inches tall with nearly a 10-inch in-seam.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was over a week later when Lana realized that like Lois, she wasn't growing larger evenly. For some strange reason that really didn't bother Lana at all, while every other part of her body was slowly increasing in all 3 dimensions and now was from 30-40% bigger and longer including her hair, her waist hadn't changed from the 22-inches it had been for nearly 2 years. Something else happened after Lana touched the yellow kryptonite the second time. Five days after the incident when Lana went to bed (absolutely dead-tired and stuffed) her dreams turned to horses. It might have been triggered by several people around town commenting to Lana that since she had started growing bigger she was now eating as much as a horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's dreams became increasingly vivid as every night, Lana dreamed about when she used to ride her favorite mare, Sasha. Lana had ridden as often as she could when she was younger and now she started wondering WHY she had stopped doing so, so abruptly. Since it had been a VERY long time since she had gone riding, a couple of weeks after the dreams had started Lana decided to go out on the next Saturday, to the stables where her favorite mare was boarded and spend the whole day with her riding. Lana became so enthusiastic thinking about riding again, Lois found out and started plotting. By the time Saturday morning came a now over 10 foot tall Lana with silky hair almost as long was giddy with anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, absolutely all of Lois's body had grown visibly bigger but her legs were still WAY out of proportion with the rest of her body. Now that Lois was FINALLY over 3 feet tall, she was getting around Smallville without too much difficulty. Still having not learned her lesson about touching the yellow kryptonite and now quite determined to become the BIGGEST reporter in Kansas, Lois convinced Lana to take her with her on Saturday when she drove out to the riding stables. Lois's real reason for tagging along was she would now be fairly close to the Kent farm and she intended to touch that yellow kryptonite AGAIN. Lois' impatience would soon cause her and Lana more trouble that Saturday morning. It had been so long since Lana had gone riding she hadn't known that her favorite mare, Sasha, had had a foal. Her name was Marylou and she had recently been weaned. Since Marylou was about the right height for Lois' current size, Lana teased Lois into riding her. Lois then surprised Lana with just how good a rider she really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did take Lois a while to get used to riding a pony-sized horse. However, she quickly realized that it would be more comfortable for her to ride bareback. Not to be out-done by Lois, Lana then returned to the stable and removed Sasha's saddle. So after spending about half an hour preparing for their ride the 2 high-school girls went out on to the riding paths. Everything went along smoothly until Lois noticed that they were nearing the Kent farm turn-off. Lana stopped for a moment to look at something along the path and Lois saw her chance. Spurring Marylou on, Lois was over halfway to the Kent's barn before Lana realized it and rode off after her. Figuring that it would be easier to get to the box with the yellow kryptonite in it from horseback Lois stayed on Marylou when she arrived at the barn. She had just picked up the box when Lana arrived inside the barn. Staying on Marylou, Lois then escaped out the open barn door with Lana running after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois then did something she would almost immediately regret doing. She stopped the pony to taunt Lana with the yellow kryptonite. It gave Lana just enough time to get to her and grab for the box. Lois held it up just out of Lana's reach, so Lana quickly mounted Sasha and the 2 girls started frantically wrestling for the box on horseback. After a couple minutes of this tussling the box suddenly flew out of both their grasp soaring over 25 feet up in the air. Opening up when it reached the highest point in its arc, the yellow kryptonite came down to Earth between them and shattered on the gravel pathway. When the yellow kryptonite shattered on the ground there was a blinding flash and accompanying bang that knocked both girls and the horses unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShattering, the yellow kryptonite disintegrated into an extremely fine dust that coated both girls bodies along with the mares. Also all four of them inhaled this ultra-fine yellow kryptonite dust very deeply into their lungs. Nearly 10 minutes later after the dust had been completely absorbed by both the girls AND horses bodies, Lana finally woke up. Now standing exactly 6 feet tall, Lois was looking down at Lana. Lois also had a strange look on her face. Spending a few seconds to survey the scene around her, Lana then screamed at the top of her lungs, \"Lois, what have you done to us now?\" Hearing Lana's voice sounding so loud, different AND very HUSKILY sexy, Clark ran at super-speed from where he was working in the South field. When he came around the still open barn door and saw both girls, Clark smiled very broadly and gave Lana 2 thumbs up. He then said, \"Let me guess Lana, this is all Lois' doing, right?\" There were enormous tears flowing from her eyes as Lana nodded yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he turned his attention to Lois, Clark could immediately see that Lois was very happy with her now IMPROVED height of 6 feet even. The silly grin on her face was absolutely nothing compared to her now 3 1/2 foot long, jet-black tail merrily swishing around behind her. Clark asked Lois, \"Lois, are you _REALLY_ happy with how you _LOOK_ now?\" Lois snapped at Clark saying, \"Of course, I do Smallville. No girl in her right mind wouldn't want to have a body just like this.\" (To emphasize her statement, Lois then pointed at her now gloriously spherical 44E bust) With a very puzzled look on his face Clark then said, \"Alright Lois, I won't say anything else, except I thought most girls didn't like to have a big behind like you do now.\" Now incensed Lois quickly replied, \"How dare you go and insult my tight ass like that, Clark. I thought you were more of a gentleman than that. I'm very proud to admit that I spend a lot of time maintaining it's perfect curve, thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the direction that the conversation was quickly going, the now 12 /2 foot tall Lana very gingerly stood up. Lois and Clark's attention immediately turned to her. With no difficulty at all, Lana then picked Clark up saying, \"Clark dear, why don't we go riding before Lois says something, that I'll _make sure_ she'll REGRET having said to us.\" A little surprised with the ease Lana had lifted him onto her back, Clark was speechless. After all, it's not everyday that your girl friend transforms into an absolutely gorgeous 12 1/2 foot tall Centauress. Just before she gallops off with Clark, Lana said over her shoulder to Lois, \"Oh Lois, I totally agree with Clark. I don't think ANY girl who would _EVER_ willingly want a rear-end like yours.\" More incensed than before, Lois angrily stamped her left foot on the ground. Her newly grown tail then swished right up into her face. Which elicited from Lois, a whole slew of words unsuitable for children OR mixed company. (Until THAT very moment, Lois hadn't even realized that SHE had grown a tail). Lois had assumed that only Lana had transformed into an equine body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding his girl friend like none has ever been RIDDEN before, Clark quietly took in the scenery as Lana trotted off towards the field Clark had come from a few minutes earlier. Arriving at where his equipment was still standing, Lana further surprised Clark saying, \"Clark dear, I'm sure that the TWO of us can clear this field before sunset.\" Stuttering at her statement Clark finally blurts out, \"Lana, are you sure about this? Shouldn't we first look for some way to return you to your normal human body? After all, it's just not right that you stay like you are.\" Lana testily replied \"Not on your life Clark, I love my new body. I know that it's a little different, but if we were the same height my new body would be perfect.\" (being very pragmatic about her current situation) Lana then said, \"Oh come on now Clark. Haven't you thought some about us getting married someday and working on the farm together?\" Clark now growing concerned about Lana' mental state replied, \"Welllll, yes Lana but not like THIS! Several times now, my parents have mentioned how happy they would be having you as a daughter-in-law.\" Hearing that, Lana very loudly whinnied her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Lana was very determined about helping him with his chores, Clark started his work where he left off with Lana happily toiling at his side. Now unable use any of his powers in front of Lana, it WAS about half a hour before sunset when the two teens finished clearing the field. Clark only took 3 steps towards the house before Lana again grabbed him and placed him on her back. When he started to protest the treatment, Lana started crying. Through her tears Lana said, \"Clark dear PLEASE let me carry you. For some reason that I can't explain, I feel compelled to do this. It's almost as if my soul would be incomplete if you didn't ride on my back.\" Seeing the pain Lana was now in Clark agreed saying, \"Alright Lana, I'll ride you but JUST for today.\" As fast as she could, Lana happily galloped back to the Kent farmhouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving there, instead of walking towards the house when Clark jumped off her back, Lana walked towards the barn. Seeing the look on his face and before Clark could get a word out Lana said, \"Clark let's be practical about this. The barn IS the only building big enough for me to be comfortable in now. I'll stay dry when it rains and after dinner tonight, I'll talk to your mother about getting a few of my things from my apartment.\" Just before Clark opened the now closed barn door his parents walked out of the house. Seeing Lana in her new form was a bit of a shock, but they got over it fairly quickly. Asking Lana what she wanted for dinner, Martha Kent wasn't too surprised to hear her say, \"whatever you cook will be alright with me, Mrs. Kent. Only could we have some apple pie for dessert? For some strange reason, that's the one food that I'm really hungry for now.\" Martha chuckled saying, \"Alright Lana how about if I bake TWO apple pies just for you.\" Lana whinnied her appreciation to Martha. Both parents looked at Clark with puzzled looks and he said, \"Apparently, instead of squealing for joy, Lana now whinnies to show that she's really happy about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little after 9:00 with dinner done and the dishes washed, Martha left to collect the items that Lana had asked for from her apartment, it was time she got ready for bed. The four of them had discussed what to do in the morning without agreeing on anything. At the end of the discussion, Lana did say that she should call Lois about her little problem. Clark really laughed hard about that saying to his parents, \"Lana you should explain to my parents about that. I'm going out to the barn now to retrieve a couple of spare horse blankets stored in the loft.\" When he entered the barn, Clark saw a couple of beady eyes staring at him form one of the horse stalls. It was Lois who had entered earlier to get in from the cold but she didn't say anything. Assuming that it was a barn owl that had flown in Clark ignored it when the eyes quickly disappeared. He spent a few minutes searching for the blankets before he found several of them scattered about in a different place in the loft than he had expected to find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot worrying why they were not where he expected, Clark took the two warmest ones there for Lana. He then left closing and latching the barn door. Approaching Lana who with his parents were standing just inside the front porch, Clark saw the worried look on Lana's face. She had tried calling Lois but she hadn't answered her mobile. Lana was worried about Lois and implored Clark to go looking for her right away. Even though Clark was sure that nothing serious had happened to Lois, after nearly 10 minutes of pleading Clark finally relented and agreed to go looking for her right after Lana had bedded down for the night. He promised to wake her when he found Lois. Returning to the barn and opening the door, Clark saw those eyes again and decided to chase that barn owl out of the barn for Lana's sake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a broom to shoo the owl out Clark was really surprised to here, \"Hey, watch it Smallville.\" Clark then asked, \"Lois, what are you doing here hiding in a horse stall ?\" \"Why do you think, Clark.\" Lois then walked out into the moonlight, all 6 foot 8 inches of her with a nearly identical body to Lana's. Other than her blue eyes, the main difference between the 2 girls transformations was, in every measurement, Lois was proportionally much smaller than Lana. Triumphantly, Clark returned to the porch saying, \"Oh, Lana. You don't have to worry about Lois, I found her.\" Lana said, \"Gee Clark, that was fast. Where did you find her? Is she safe?\" Putting his arm around her neck (as best he could) Clark walked with Lana towards the barn saying \"Judge for yourself, Lana.\" When Clark opened the door, Lana literally fell down laughing hysterically when she saw Lois standing there, munching on a couple of carrots. When she finally calmed down the first thing Lana said was, \"Clark, you just have to take a picture of the two of us. It'll be the best one yet for Chloe's wall of weird.\" Clark wasn't successful hiding his own smile when Lana continued on saying, \"Alrighty now, since I'm the BIG sister here, I get to choose where I WANT to sleep FIRST\". At this point, Lois wasn't about to argue about anything with anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just after 7 the next morning, Clark was awakened by shouting coming from the barn. Lana had woken up before Lois and being as hungry as a horse (so to speak) she started rummaging through the barn looking for something for breakfast. She whinnied real loud waking Lois when she found a bushel of apples nearly half full. Being ravenous and not knowing or even caring WHY Lana started munching away. Before Lois could even get to where Lana was standing she had already eaten several apples. The fight started when Lois tried to get Lana to slow down and leave some for her. Lana strangely became highly territorial saying, \"Lois if your so hungry, go find your own breakfast. These apples are MINE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so much taller than Lois, Lana thought that would've been the end of it but Lois is a girl who doesn't back down. Even when it would be the prudent thing to do. When Clark entered the barn he immediately realized that he could only separate the girls by using his powers. Which, of course, he did not do. Instead, he said, \"Lois why don't you come inside with me, I'm sure I can find nice oatmeal for you.\" Lois unhappily went with Clark. To get back at Lana, Lois talked Clark into riding HER to school that morning. Lana was so intent on consuming the apples, even though she ran all the way there when she was finally satisfied, she ended up missing first period entirely. If Lex hadn't been so generous in providing Lana with an unlimited supply of apples, her sudden intense craving for them would have quickly caused her to go bankrupt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite surprising just how fast the whole town adapted to Lana and Lois new equine bodies. Still being short enough to go to school with little difficulty, Lois quickly learned just how advantageous it was to be a Centauress. A couple days after her transformation, a couple of boys made some very CRUDE comments about Lois new body behind her back. Without realizing or seeing that she was doing it, she mule-kicked both boys directly in the family jewels. When she turned around to see what the commotion was all about Lois just grinned saying, \"Anybody else want to make a comment?\" All the students there and even a couple of teachers standing near her immediately mumbled their acquiescence to her new status. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon, Lois was EVEN asked to join the girls soccer team. Hearing what had happened in the hall the team's Captain thought that with a little training, Lois could probably accurately kick a soccer ball at least 50 or 60 yards. After all now, she now DID have one whale of a mule-kick. It would've provided a whole new set of strategies for the team. Thanking her for the offer, Lois politely turned her down. Now that she was well over 12 feet tall, Lana had to listen to her class assignments from just outside a classroom window. Which really made things interesting when the weather turned bad. It wasn't long before a private stall was set up for Lana in the gymnasium with a web camera set-up to her classrooms. The next few weeks went by without any new problems for either Centauress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of months after their transformation into Centauresses, both girls began complaining that their new equine designed clothes were already getting too tight to comfortably wear. A checkup with the tailor found they had both definitely grown bigger. They were very surprised however to learn that they were growing bigger differently. Lois was really pleased to learn that she was growing taller and bigger all around. She started thinking that maybe someday, SHE\"LL be the bigger Centauress so Lois THEN planned to put Lana down a peg or two. Which shouldn't have been at all surprising given her body had merged with a young and still growing filly. Lana's increasingly distended belly, which everyone assumed was from eating so apples all the time was only partly the answer. The vet who was checking them out was not that surprised when she gave Lana the good news, \"Congratulations Lana, you're pregnant. I know this is quite unexpected, and even better it looks like twins.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill being a virgin, Lana immediately fainted at the news. Once Lana woke up, Dr. Veronika Johnson explained that obviously Sasha had been pregnant when their bodies had merged. Sasha's owner confirmed that a couple of weeks before the incident, he had tried breeding Sasha and obviously he had succeeded. Lana then started crying about being way to young to be a Mother. Lois started laughing her head off. When Lana snapped at her Lois just said, \"Well look at it this way Lana, if Clark decides to marry you now, before too long, he'll have an instant family on his hands.\" The vet told Lana that she should deliver in about 7 months. Hearing the news of Lana's pregnancy later that afternoon from big mouth Lois, Clark immediately went looking for Lana and DID ask her to marry him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana meekly said, \"Yes, tomorrow if at all possible.\" Lana was worried that if she spent too much time thinking about it, she might back out. That Saturday the strangest wedding that ever happened in Smallville went off with no hitches. Against her better judgment, Lois was the Maiden Horse of Honor. Chloe rode in on her back. In fact, to make Lana feel better all the guests rode horses to the wedding. Clark and his parents walked in and afterwards Clark carefully climbed onto Lana's back. After the vows were completed, patting her growing stomach with both hands, Lana said (to thunderous laughter), \"Well Clark, as you can see you're going to have to wait a LONG time for the honeymoon.\" Clark just smiled and said, \"That's alright Lana, when we finally do go to where ever you choose for our honeymoon, I've got a BIG surprise for you.\" Which elicited another round of laughter from their classmates and the other guests. {Clark was of course referring to his secret identity as a Kryptonian.} <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Every day for the next week, Lana and Lois continued growing similarly like the first night. While waking up every morning for Lana was a treat seemingly without end, Lois was living through a 'growing' nightmare. After the first night, the rest of Lois's body started growing but at a much slower rate. In three days, Lois essentially caught up with Lana's height when she was only 5' 3\" tall. Lois wouldn't have minded it one bit if she hadn't had a 4' 7\" inch inseam at the time. Another difference between the 2 growing girls was their appetites. Other than being thirsty all the time Lois really wasn't eating anymore food than was usual for her. Lana on the other hand was starving and ended up eating much more than a horse normally would the last several days. A bad joke started circulating around Smallville that all the water and juice that Lois was drinking was going straight into her constantly increasingly longer legs. By the time she stopped growing a couple of weeks later, Lois' torso had returned to its original length. There is no question that Lois wouldn't have minded gaining the 5 inches and 2 cup sizes she did, if her legs hadn't grown to be 5 times longer making her 20 feet tall. Which started another joke circulating around Smallville about no one wanting to be touched by the 20 foot Lois.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Lana serenely accepted her new size and shape. By the time Lana's growth stopped, Clark literally had to use a baseball bat every day at school to fend off Lana's suddenly acquired admirers. That included a surprisingly large number of girls. A rumor had started going around (spread by Lois, of course) that if a girl grabbed onto Lana and held on long enough they TOO would grow into a new profile similar to Lana's statuesque 6' 1\" 48DD-22-40 figure. Mind you, it took all of Clark's will-power to keep himself from jumping Lana's bones EVERY SINGLE time he saw her. Of course, Lana wouldn't have complained. In fact, within a couple weeks of her growth stopping Lana started worrying that she had grown too BIG for Clark's taste! She noticed that he was increasingly nervous around her and she couldn't imagine any other reason for Clark not to make a pass at her. Now that they were the same height, Lana's sex drive had started working overtime when she was around Clark. It grew so intense that going into a room that Clark had recently left started Lana's juices flowing deep inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He instantly regretted picking up the Kryptonite, while it had not caused him the excruciating pain he usually felt when he was in range of the green meteor rock - it had left him with some very obvious side effects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to wonder how he was going to explain this shocking weight gain away. Clark had always had a pretty much perfect body, his Kryptonian powers and heritage had meant that he didn't really gain weight. On top of that, he had kept in shape via exercise, playing sports and plain old healthy eating, whenever he had put on weight, it had been quickly converted into muscle.

It was Lois, in his rush this morning, he had forgotten that she would be heading into school with him today. Worse still, she was about to see his newly developed pot belly, and she would surely realise that his weight gain wasn't a natural one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Smallville, did you hear me?\" Lois called again, as her footsteps drew closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark didn't know what to do, but he knew he had to at least <i>try</i> and cover up his new weight gain. Hastily, he tugged at his T-shirt, and pulled it down further over his chubby stomach, it practically bounced back up to it's former position, and Clark instead decided to zip up his jacket. Luckily, that worked, and covered up his stomach, but still left him with a very prominent bulge underneath his jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost embarrassing of all was Clark's open pants, he definitely needed to button those back up before Lois saw him. He fumbled with the zipper on his pants, and tried to force the top button back into it's hole, but his stomach wouldn't allow it. With Lois about to see him at any minute, Clark took a deep breath and sucked his belly in as far as he could, it just about worked - and he quickly zipped up and buttoned his jeans. He felt his newly formed flab bulged over the sides of his tight jeans, which felt like they might explode open again at any minute, but at least he was covered up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why didn't you answer me?\" Lois asked, as she walked up to Clark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, didn't hear you,\" Clark said sheepishly, trying not to look at Lois directly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois rolled her eyes. \"Sure, come on, we're going to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark nodded, and they walked off down the path. Lois didn't seem to have noticed that anything was up, but Clark was finding it hard to conceal his discomfort as they set off down the path, every step made his belly jiggle, his once hard pecs, now flabby man breasts, shook with each step he took. His belly chafed against his jeans, which he had filled out a lot more than he first thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

She realized he had seen her, and looked away, but a moment later, she was staring at him again, and her eyes focused on his larger middle. Clark attempted to suck his belly in again, but it didn't seem to make any difference - he was certain that Lois had noticed his weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...no offence Smallville, but have you put on a few pounds?\" Lois said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark knew that Lois probably found this very amusing, which just made him feel even more embarrassed. None the less, he tried to act as cool as possible. \"I uh...I guess I have put on a few,\" Clark said, absent mindedly rubbing his stomach. \"Too much home cooking I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois looked at him suspiciously. \"You know...I don't remember noticing you getting bigger, how did you manage to hide it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark tugged anxiously at his jacket, which he could feel starting to creep up and expose his belly with each step he took. \"I guess I just didn't really notice either...plus I had a big breakfast this morning so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Lois cut him off, looking confused. \"You never struck me as the kind of guy who would let himself go. Besides, doesn't all that work you do on the farm keep you in shape? How does a guy with a body like yours suddenly get a beer belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A body like mine?</i> Was that praise? From Lois? Clark didn't really know how to respond, and wasn't sure if Lois's comments had made him feel better, or worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just been slacking on my chores lately,\" Clark lied. \"As a matter of fact I uh...just started a diet earlier today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois raised an eyebrow. \"Was that before or after your 'big breakfast'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark blushed in embarrassment. \"Um...after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois shook her head as they continued down the path and on to school. Clark had little option but to accompany Lois into school at this point, if he turned back now, it would look even more suspicious - still, he wasn't looking forward to walking into school and everyone seeing his new growth spurts...</span></div></div>",

The Talon had quickly become Smallville's number one after-school hangout spot. Originally designed to be a movie theatre, the Talon had been converted into a popular Coffee shop by Lana, with the help of Lex Luthor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Talon was decorated with an Egyptian theme, with ornaments in the form of sphinxes and hieroglyphics painted on the walls and pillars. The gold and yellow, mixed with blue and violet colour of the walls, harmoniously complemented the environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lana generally enjoyed her job, some days the shop got so busy that she didn't get a moments peace. Today was one of those days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get a cappuccino please?\" One student asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Latte please!\" Another student called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here!\" Someone else shouted from across the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...in a minute,\" Lana said, rushing over to the back of the shop to prepare the orders. She frothed the milk, boiled water, and set the machine to make the required drinks. She glanced back at the front of the shop and was relieved to see that no new customers had arrived, but she suddenly realised that the third person who had spoke was her friend Clark, who was smiling at her across the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana smiled back, and finished preparing her orders, which she then took to the front of the store. The customers took their drinks and paid her, as Clark moved to the front of the queue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Clark,\" Lana smiled. \"What can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I came by to see you,\" said Clark, looking a little awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana herself suddenly felt a little awkward - her and Clark had an on-again off-again relationship, and while the two of them still had feelings for one another, Lana was never sure if Clark was being honest with her - and could never be in a relationship with someone when there was no trust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something I can help you with?\" Lana asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering if you might want to do something later...\" Clark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark,\" Lana sighed. \"We've been through this before...I think it's best we give each other some space for now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark nodded, and forced a smile. \"You're right, of course. I'll see you tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark turned and walked out, leaving Lana feeling a little bad about rejecting him, but she didn't really want to be dealing with the mysterious side of Clark right now.</span></div></div>",

For the moment, it appeared as though all the orders had been taken, and the mad rush that always happened around this time was dying down. Lana took a moment to clean up behind the counter while things were quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turned back around, she found herself face to face with a dark haired guy. He made her jump a little. \"Oh, hey, what can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy brushed his long, dark hair out of his eyes and surveyed the list of items that were written in chalk on a board behind Lana. Lana followed his gaze as he silently scanned the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take a regular coffee, black,\" the guy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be three fifty then please,\" Lana smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy reached into his pocket and pulled out the money, Lana extended her hand, and the guy reached towards her and dropped the money into her open palm. Just as Lana was about to place the money in the cash register, the guy closed his hand over hers, and tugged it towards him slightly. Startled, Lana looked into the guy's eyes in a confused manner, and felt a strange tingling sensation spread throughout her body - she glanced down at her hand, just in time to see a weird blue glow coming from the guy's hand. Lana pulled her hand away in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-,\" Lana started saying, but when she looked up, the guy had vanished, and her hand was suddenly empty. \"Well...that was weird...but then, what else is new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana examined her palm, but couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. Had this guy been another of Smallville's 'meteor freaks' or just someone playing a joke? Lana hoped it was the latter, as the meteor infected of the town often cropped up and caused trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening was pretty uneventful, Lana didn't see anybody else she knew, and it turned out to be an unusually quiet night. As it got late, her remaining customers cleared out, and Lana shut down the shop for the day and headed home. Tired from her busy day at the Talon, Lana changed into her pyjamas and jumped straight into bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lana woke up a little before 6, to the regular beeping of her alarm clock. As she yawned rolled over to turn it off, she noticed that the blankets were lower than they usually were. She looked down curiously, rubbed her eyes, and figured that she must have tossed-and-turned in her sleep a lot more than usual last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, the first thing Lana did was go to the bathroom and turn on the shower, letting the water warm up before she stepped in. While waiting for the temperature of the water to rise, she got out some lingerie and took a dress out of her closet. Somehow, it seemed as though she didn't have to reach as far into the closet as she normally did. Still more asleep than awake, she paid no attention to that, removed her silky pyjamas, and stepped into the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her naked body slipped into the shower, Lana's head suddenly banged into the shower head. \"Ouw...\" Lana rubbed her head. \"Chloe must have lowered it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana adjusted the shower head to a more appropriate height, which seemed somehow higher than normal...nothing seemed to be in it's right position this morning. Lana shurgged off the thought and let the soothingly warm water flow down her body, as she began to wash her hair, she was surprised by just how much it seemed to have grown lately. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hair can't grow longer overnight now, can it?\" Lana said, thinking out loud. \"I need to get this cut...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her shower, Lana was now finally well awake and more aware of her surroundings. When she dried herself off Lana was not happy - realizing that her towel seems to have shrunk. \"Damn it...I wish people would stop messing with my things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dresses, Lana's couldn't help but feel that her bra and panties were feeling tighter across her butt and breasts. Lana took a moment to look at herself in the mirror, and adjusted her underwear, it seemed as though she had shrunk quite a few items during her last wash. She reached for her dress and slipped it over her head, but, to her shock, it was too short! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" Lana asked herself, frustrated with what appeared to be an incredible shrinking wardrobe. \"I really need to start washing these things on a lower setting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana removed the too short dress and hurried over to the bathroom door to measure herself, she backed up against the door and looked at the place where she had previously measured herself - she suddenly became very concerned when she saw that she was apparently 3 1/2 inches taller than she had been previously...might this sudden growth spurt explain her apparently shrunken clothes? It was only last week that she had been measured in health class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other options, Lana grabbed a long dress out of her wardrobe - the kind she would normally wear when she was going out somewhere fancy, and that would have to be worn with high heels...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way to school, Lana decided to tell anyone that asks that she's way behind on her washing. It works, and fortunately for her, not only does no one question why she's seemingly wearing at least three inch heels in school, but she also lucks out and her physical education class is cancelled for the day. Heels in the locker room would certainly have looked weird...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, Lana saw Clark again. He stopped for a moment and regarded her with a curious expression on his face. \"What have you done differently today?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing...\" Lana replies, trying to avoid his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever you're doing, keep it up,\" Clark smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana blushed and decided to throw Clark a bone. \"Tell you what...why don't you come by the Talon around 5.30 and we'll have a chat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark smiled. \"Great, I'll see you there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, on her way to the Talon, Lana remembered about the mysterious stranger the previous day who seemed to have disappeared after ordering and paying her $3.50 for a coffee. Which just happens to be the same increase in her height...</span></div></div>",

When she had invited Clark to visit her, she had completely forgotten that THIS was the day Happy Hour was starting at the Talon. In his quest for the Talon to be more successful, Lex spent over an hour trying to convince her to try it. She didn't think the concept would work very well with a coffee-house but eventually gave in saying, \"Alright Lex, we'll try it for a month.\" So starting that afternoon and for the next 4 weeks during the week-days only, all coffees ordered between 5 and 6 were going to be priced 2 for 1. So Lana was understandably stunned when shortly after 5:00 the Talon started filling up REAL fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place became so crowded when Clark showed up 10 minutes early at 5:20, there wasn't a seat available anywhere in the place. Lana was now quite happy that she had hired Juliana Markova (the swim team's Junior Captain) to help her out during afternoons. Lana had wanted to give herself the chance to get caught up on personal things while there was still daylight outside. So the two of them were really working their rears off barely keeping up with all the new business that was walking in. In fact, Lana was SO busy she didn't even notice Clark when he gave her his order. Dejectedly, he went to the far side of the Talon to drink in silence. It wasn't until nearly 6 that the rush really started slacking off. Now with a much shorter line in front of the cash register, Lana had FINALLY noticed where Clark was standing off in a corner by himself. Looking at the clock and noticing the time, Lana realized that for once SHE had stood Clark up! Quite embarrassed over the matter, Lana signaled to Clark to return to the register. Right in front of Clark in the line stood the mysterious stranger again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the clock was now pointing directly up at 6, he asked Lana if the 2 for 1 special was still on. Quickly glancing at the clock she replied, \"Why yes Sir, you've just made it under the wire.\" He pointed at Clark and asked, \"What about the boy standing behind me?\" Not quite sure how she should answer him, Lana blushed and stood there for several seconds before saying, \"He's just one of the kids I go to High School with.\" Now seeing the surprised look on Clark's face, Lana started squirming behind the register. The stranger then said, \"Gee, that's really too bad Miss. The two of you look like you'd make a real nice looking couple. I bet that if you tried you could grow to like him, Miss.\" Approaching the cash register and overhearing that last part Juliana then added, \"Ya, Mister that's what EVERYONE over at Smallville High keeps telling her.\" Lana was now blushing an ever deeper shade of red and Clark was sporting a big grin. Hearing the stranger talk about growing, Clark had suddenly realized what it was about Lana that he had liked when he saw her earlier at school. Somehow over-night she had grown 3 or 4 inches taller. He had just noticed that she WASN'T wearing any high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he wasn't finished with Lana the stranger gave her his order, \"Along with these 3 muffins here, I'll have 2 of your extra-large coffees with double shots of the thickest cream you have.\" \"Let's see, $4.50 for the muffins and $5.50 for your coffees, that'll be $10.00 for everything, Sir.\" Lana said. Just like the previous night when he gave her his money she felt the tingling again. This time it was much stronger and lasted over twice as long as before. Also, this time he didn't disappear. Having given Lana a twenty, when she handed him back his change, he turned around and handed BOTH Fives to Juliana saying, \"Why don't you two girls split it. I\"m a firm believer in spreading the wealth around.\" While Lana or Clark didn't see it happen, Juliana's gorgeous emerald green eyes then briefly glowed bright blue just like Lana's hands had, the previous night. Stunned at the size of the tip, both girls barely got their \"Thank you, Sir\" out before he exited the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the Talon was still fairly busy, Lana asked Clark if he wouldn't mind coming back around closing time to walk her home. A bit bewildered by Lana's request, Clark did return shortly before she closed up for the evening. It had taken Clark quite a bit of explaining to his parents over WHY he was returning to town so late. Martha finally reminded Jonathan that the kids were both over 18 AND he knew that Lana is a girl who would make a wonderful daughter-in-law. Clark then smiled very sheepishly when he left for Smallville. Clark nervously walked Lana to her apartment above the Talon. With absolutely no clue about what Lana had planned, Clark was somewhat (but not too much) relieved that she ONLY wanted to talk with him and do some homework. Very surprised when Clark arrived home well before midnight, Jonathan nevertheless pretended to be asleep in his living room chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleeping in quite late for her, Lana's telephone awakens her at 6:30. It's Juliana, she wants Lana to let her inside the Talon before anyone sees her standing on the sidewalk out front. The panic in her voice instantly shakes some of the cobwebs from Lana's mind. Without bothering to throw anything else on, she then stumbles down stairs to let Juliana in. Lana can't understand why her balance is so bad that morning. Not immediately realizing what had happened to Juliana during the night, it's not until Lana sees herself in her full-length mirror back in her apartment that she understands Juliana's panic. Lana then started crying over how much bigger her body has grown. Seconds later, Juliana asked, \"So Lana, is this why you wore that long party dress yesterday?\" Lana slowly shakes her head yes. Eventually calming down enough to start looking for something to wear for school, Lana faints when she hears Clark's voice coming up the stairs. [Lana had been in such a hurry to get back upstairs with Juliana she had completely forgotten to lock the front door.] When Clark stopped by to see her, he noticed the door was unlocked and walked in closing AND locking it behind him. After the talk they had the previous night when he woke up that morning, Clark had decided he would walk to Smallville High with Lana. Hearing the loud thud Lana's body made when she fainted on the hardwood floor, Clark quickly ran upstairs to check on her. So you can imagine his surprise when he opens her apartment's front door. He sees that along with growing 5 1/2 inches taller overnight, both girls bodies have grown larger in another way. He can easily see their new bodies far more attractive outline through the sheets they've covered themselves with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Lana had fainted, Juliana dashed over to see if she was alright. Neither girl knew that overnight their busts had filled with a very creamy milk. That was the reason why both girls were now a very full cup size larger and had grown bustier by 4 1/2 inches. When Juliana leaned over Lana's head several large drops of milk were pushed out of her overly taunt breasts dropping into Lana's mouth. It's sweet taste immediately revived her. Once they realized how Lana had been revived, both teens blushed a deep scarlet. When they hastily measure themselves the girls learn to their dismay, that in addition to becoming bigger overnight they've EACH gained TWENTY pounds! Now hearing Clark approach Lana's apartment, the girls quickly grabbed a couple of sheets from Lana's clean washing for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened the door the look on Clark's face was priceless. Which Juliana rapidly captured several times on Lana's phone's camera. She had taken it out of Lana's purse so that Lana could call Chloe. After standing there speechless for over a minute and a half, Clark finally asked Lana if she knew why their bodies had inflated overnight. Shaking her head no, Lana meekly tells Clark about how afraid she is. Lana's quite concerned over just how big she might become if her growth surges don't stop soon. Still several inches shorter then Clark, Lana's now just as tall as Juliana was yesterday. So although she was already fairly tall for only being 16 1/2, overnight Juliana had become an inch taller than Clark and she relishes her new-found figure. Granted she'll now make a much larger wake when she swims, Juliana actually wouldn't mind growing even TALLER. Juliana's mother was nearly a foot shorter than either of her 6 older half-sisters mothers. So since Juliana was old enough to talk, they had ALL mercilessly teased her about her relatively short height within the family. They were ALL well over 6 1/2 feet tall, just like Daddy. Until that morning he had been just over a foot taller than Juliana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana quickly convinced Clark that other than her new stature she's really feeling alright, so Clark goes back downstairs to wait for the girls to get dressed. Since Lana doesn't have any clothes that fully cover her now, she realizes that going to school is out of the question, at least for the day. Juliana agrees to stay with her, so Lana tells Clark to stop by the School office and tell them that they aren't themselves today. Clark giggled when Lana told him that. After Clark had left Lana debates with herself over calling Lex. She's worried that if Lex should see her and Juliana's new size, he might decide to hide them in one of his labs for study. Lana eventually decides to just call Lex and tell him that unless he gets somebody to cover for her and Juliana, the Talon will be closed today. Lex surprised Lana by volunteering to help out until she gets better. He, of course, had assumed that they had both come down with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe stops by after school to bring the girls their home-work assignments and see why Clark had been so secretive about their 'condition'. Acting nonchalant over seeing their new bodies, Chloe keeps Lex from going upstairs. Which really wasn't all that hard considering how busy the Talon was that afternoon. While Chloe was downstairs with Lex, Lana took some money out of her purse including the $5.00 tip. She gave it to Chloe to buy them some cloth. She plans to make a very simple dress for each of them to wear for the following school-day. When both girls handle the bill, it and THEY glow blue again and feel the tingling even stronger this time. Lana mentioned to Juliana about the stranger and she replied, \"Ya, I felt a tingling last night too when he gave me his tip. Lana you don't suppose he's the one who did this to us, somehow?\" Now realizing that they may have stumbled onto the answer to their recent growth, Lana worriedly said, \"Gosh, if that's the case Juliana, I'm afraid that we're going to be growing again tonight.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they both wake up the next morning, how much bigger have the 2 teens grown?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey grow larger by the same amount as they had the previous night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Juliana Markova was able to both sneak into her house that afternoon after school and back out early the next morning. Being so excited about the prospect of AGAIN growing several inches taller, Juliana paced back and forth all night, so she didn't sleep a wink. Around 5:30 the next morning when she decided to dress to go over to Lana's apartment, Juliana was quite annoyed to see that her new dress fit her the same as it had the previous day. Now quite disappointed about not growing ANY bigger overnight, Juliana slipped out of her house and quietly returned to the Talon. Since Lana had given her a spare key-ring to the back-door that led to her apartment, no one that morning saw the still 6' 3\" Juliana with a 40 inch inseam enter the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Lana still sleeping above her blankets, Juliana doesn't realize yet that Lana had AGAIN grown larger overnight. Entering Lana's apartment, the first thing Juliana did was to kick off her uncomfortable shoes. It takes a couple minutes of shaking before Lana woke up and she's not one bit happy about it. Having not opened her eyes yet, Lana yelled out, \"CLARK, let me sleep a little longer.\" Juliana very startled by Lana's statement replied, \"Lana, it's me Juliana. We must have been wrong about that guy. I didn't grow any bigger last night.\" Still a little groggy, Lana rolls out of bed and right onto her COLD hardwood floor. THAT finally wakes her up and Lana now sees Juliana standing over her helping her to stand. Once Lana's finally standing up, the teens realize that they now seem to be about the same height! Once she's finished measuring herself, Lana's distraught to learn that in addition to now being 6' 3\" tall with a 44\" inseam, her bust has ballooned UP to become an impressive and very firm 44E. Lana then surprised Juliana when she burst into tears over her now even MORE enhanced figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Lana's mobile rings. It's Clark and he wants to know if Lana will come downstairs to let him in. She asked him, \"Why are you here so early?\" He replied, \"Yesterday after I left you and Juliana, I called Dr. Swan. Telling him what had happened to you girls he told me he would send someone right away to Smallville to check you girls out. She arrived at the farm less than an hour ago and we BOTH decided to not waste any time getting here. So Lana, how long do you think it will take for Juliana to get over here?\" No time at all Clark.\" Lana replied. Juliana is already here and we've got a new problem to show you. She'll let you in while I get dressed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliana went downstairs to let Clark in along with Dr. Beatrice Inga Gold. The good Doctor had attended college on a basketball scholarship. She was a very healthy and robust 6' 6\" tall, wore 4\" heels and her naturally platinum blond hair went down just past her waist. Not bothering to look outside through any of the windows, Juliana felt a little foolish when she opened the front door. Not seeing his guest she blurted out, \"Are you sure this Doctor will REALLY be sympathetic to our height problem? As far as I'm concerned Clark, I wouldn't mind growing even taller than I already am.\" Turning her head to look at Dr. Gold, Juliana had to turn her neck to look UP over half a foot at her. Juliana then blushed from embarrassment saying, \"Well Doctor, I guess you do.\" In good fun she replied, \"You've got that right, shrimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark and the others waited outside her door for several minutes while Lana dressed. Still quite upset about her now (third !) growth surge Lana was very reluctant for Clark to see the again \"newly improved\" Lana Lang. So she hides in the kitchen before telling them they could enter her apartment. Once her 3 guests were standing in the living room, Clark called out, \"Come on out Lana. What kind of new problem do you have? Juliana didn't grow any bigger last night.\" Since she was standing next to the kitchen door, Juliana quickly ducked inside. Pulling Lana into the living room she said, \"I know that Clark, but Lana's grown even bigger. She's become much bustier than she was yesterday and now we're the SAME height.\" Even-though he was nearly 6' 2\" tall, it was the first time in his life Clark was the shortest person in a room. Seeing Lana barefoot and standing as tall as him woke new feelings of compassion for Lana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly he was at Lana's side holding her. His efforts at comforting her reduced her to crying. Although she's still bare-foot, Lana looked directly into Clark's eyes. Sobbing softly she told him, \"Clark, nobody will like me now. I'm a meteor freak and we both know what happens to them.\" Trying his best to cheer Lana up Clark then said, \"Lana, with all the problems that we've been through, do you know WHY I've stayed with you all these years? It's because although you've always been shorter than me, in my heart, I've always looked up at you. Now, I actually do and I like it, A LOT.\" Lana then started passionately kissing Clark with a far greater intensity than she ever has in her young life. Dragging Dr. Gold with her as she leaves Juliana quickly said, \"Lana ring me when you're ready to see the Doctor.\" Clark ended up being VERY late for school that morning and he didn't mind it one single bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying downstairs out of the way for more than a couple of hours, Juliana and Dr. Gold went back upstairs right after Clark left. She then spent well over an hour examining each girl. They told her everything that they remembered about the stranger and the tingling sensations they had felt. Juliana even took out the $5 tip that she still had, to show the Doctor. When they both touched it like they had the other $5 bill the previous day, Dr. Gold saw the blue glow surround the girls. This time the tingling was so strong they both suddenly felt very weak, she grabbed both girls before they collapsed. Beatrice doesn't notice that the blue glow also surrounds her. Beatrice DID notice the strong static shock she felt when she caught the girls, but not the tingling sensation right after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheorizing that since Lana had grown again while she slept, and Juliana hadn't while she stayed awake, Dr. Gold convinced Juliana to get some sleep. Now being awake well over 30 straight hours she agreed with the Doctor. Juliana then flopped on her back on Lana's now barely long enough bed. Having set up her 2 video-recorders before Juliana went to sleep, about an hour and a half later they recorded Juliana's body start to slowly and surely grow bigger. However Lana and the Doctor didn't see it occurring, right then. Within half an hour of Juliana falling asleep, they were both out cold and sleeping on the floor on both sides of Lana's bed. While Dr. Gold was exhausted from her traveling to Smallville on such short notice, Lana's exhaustion was from her earlier activity that morning both in AND out of bed with Clark. The recorders also fully recorded Lana's and Dr. Gold's slumber. Waking up at about the same time well past sunset, they were all quite surprised to see just how BIG the girls had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Immediately after Juliana had laid down to sleep, Dr. Gold packed up her test samples from both girls and herself (it was a comparison sample) to ship to one of Dr. Swan's labs for a thorough analysis. Lana walked with her the 2 short blocks to an overnight shipping station. Twenty minutes later, Dr. Gold and Lana were back in her apartment, laying out 2 brand new sleeping bags on her bedroom floor. When they returned to the Talon and remembering her morning surprise, Lana went through the entire building locking all the doors AND windows. On the walk back, Dr. Gold had asked Lana if she could stay a day or two at her apartment and Lana readily agreed. The reason for her quick agreement was Lana intended to pump Dr. Gold for any information she had about Clark. At this point in their lives, Lana didn't know anything about Clark's Kryptonian heritage. She thought that Dr. Gold could provide her with some information to explain Clark's unusual behaviour, or at least why he disappeared all the time. Dr. Gold had decided it would be better if she were there when Juliana woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing up a few hours later to open the Talon, Lex wasn't alone. The coffee-house had been so busy during the previous night, Lex \"borrowed\" two of the female serving staff from the Castle. He wasn't about to be short handed again during Happy Hour. The place ended up being even busier that night so he wasn't. Shortly after sunset and just before leaving Smallville for the farm, Clark called Lana to find out how things were going for her. When she didn't answer he hung up without leaving a message. Clark figured Juliana and her were probably still being tested by Dr. Gold. The phone had wakened Lana, but she didn't get to it before he hung up. Now awake and feeling a little nauseous, Lana slowly crawled to her bathroom. After spending several minutes there on the floor, Lana finally drags herself up. She gasps at her again newly enlarged figure in her mirror. Looking at her bathroom door, Lana's eyes are now just about level with the top of the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore measuring herself to see just how much bigger she has become, Lana decided to cook dinner for the 3 of them. A little over half an hour later, Dr. Gold is roused by the delicious smells of Lana's cooking. She's dismayed to discover that somehow HER body has also been affected. For although Beatrice had grown only 1 and 1/2 inches taller, her bust previously a very comfortable and easy to buy for pert 36C, has ballooned up and become a far more visible but strangely much lighter 48DD. Also her thick platinum blond hair had thickened even more as it grew to now fully cover her rear. Out of habit, Dr. Gold slipped her heels on before going into the kitchen to see Lana. Noticing that Dr. Gold and her now seemed to be nearly the same height Lana cheerily greeted her saying, \"oh hi there Dr. Gold. Gee it guess it wasn't too bad this time.\" Beatrice asked back, \"What do you mean, Lana?\" Lana replied, \"Well, since I now seem to be almost as tall as you, I guess I haven't grown more than 4 inches taller this time. So I suppose I can put up with my boobs being just a little larger than before. I really don't think Clark will mind it if THEY'VE grown a little bigger again. He sure enjoyed them this morning.\" With a very worried look on her face Dr. Gold then told Lana, \"Lana, now don't get too upset about this, but somehow I've ALSO been affected. I'm an inch and a half taller, AND I'm wearing my stilettos. If you're now as tall as I am standing here, you're nearly SEVEN feet tall Lana.\" Lana promptly fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going to revive Lana, Dr. Gold first checked on Juliana. It was very clear to Dr. Gold that in addition to a now larger, more rounded bust, Juliana had already grown several inches taller. Fatefully, she decided to let Juliana continue her sleeping. Taking the tape measure with her, Dr. Gold returned to the kitchen to wake up Lana. It took her several tries with smelling salts before Lana stayed awake. Each time she was half-awake, Lana started saying seven feet and would again faint away. Once they had finished cooking dinner, Dr. Gold and Lana went to measure her in her living room. It seems that Dr. Gold was wrong about Lana. She wasn't almost 7 feet tall, along with her bust Lana's inseam had grown 11 inches this time. She was now 7' 2'' tall and sporting a surprisingly firm AND bouncy 53F bust. Also her weight had now more than doubled over the past few days. Just before closing, Lex went upstairs knocking on her apartment door. Just like the previous night he was checking to see if she needed anything before he left. Again keeping her door closed, Lana thanked him for his concern about her and said nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Lana and Dr. Gold were very relieved to discover that neither of them grew larger that night. Clark stopped by on his way to school that morning to pick up Lana's homework. Still uncertain over whether or not she wanted Clark to see the improved and now very much LARGER Lana she gave her homework assignments to Dr. Gold. Dr. Gold met Clark at the back-door, giving him Lana's school-work to turn in and the key-ring from Juliana's purse. Dr. Gold told Clark to come back after school when the Talon was busy. She knew by then some of the results would be available. Whether or not Lana had decided to let Clark see her new size by then, Dr. Gold knew that it would be much better for Lana's sake if Lana went through this with Clark at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning around 6:30, Clark decided to get something for himself and Lana before going upstairs to see her. Sitting by the locked side door that went upstairs to Lana's apartment and a couple of offices, Clark saw Lex exit it in a foul mood. It turns out his idea had turned out to be a little bit TOO successful. With Lana now out \"sick\" for 3 days the place was rapidly running low on many things. Lex had just spent most of the past hour trying to resupply the place and he wasn't at all happy with some of the over-seas freight charges he was paying for over-night delivery. Since he intended to go back upstairs in a few minutes, Lex didn't lock the door. Scowling as he headed for the register, Lex didn't even notice Clark sitting at the table closest to the door. A couple of minutes later the stranger who had started Lana's and the other's growth sat down next to Clark saying, \" Say aren't you that boy I saw here a few days ago with that sort-of short but pretty hostess at the register.\" Startled by the question, Clark turned his head to see who was talking to him. It took him a few seconds before he recognized the very tall, sandy haired stranger. He then asked, \"Say, do you happen to know if either of those two girls are working here today?\" Wondering why this guy is suddenly interested in Lana and Juliana, Clark warily replied, \"I don't think so. I haven't seen either of them in school the past couple of days. I think they might have come down with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow not wanting to go upstairs while that fellow's sitting next to him Clark orders himself 2 more of Lana's special coffees. Realizing by his body language, Clark is unsettled by his presence the stranger moves to a nearby table that just became free. Over 10 minutes later, just as Clark has finished slowly sipping his first drink, the building shakes like a small earthquake is happening. Unseen by Lex, Clark dashes off upstairs to check on Lana. Out of curiosity more than anything else the stranger follows him. Arriving at Lana's apartment, Clark opens the door before realizing that it WAS locked. The lock is now ruined and Lana screamed when she saw Clark standing there just inside the door-way. She happened to be on her knees behind a table looking at her open bedroom door. Since all of her growth has been in her legs, Clark doesn't yet realize that Lana's now a foot taller than him. Taking a few steps further inside and seeing her living room now a big mess Clark asked Lana, \"What's happened here? Who caused this? Where is Dr. Gold?\" Shakily pointing at her bedroom door Lana replied,\" There she is with Juliana. Clark, Juliana's has become a giantess.\" Breaking down into tears again, Lana pleaded with Clark, \"You'll still like me no matter how big I end up growing now, won't you Clark?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can answer her, Lana saw the stranger standing a few steps behind Clark. The stranger was muttering to himself, \"Oh, oh. This hasn't turned out like it's supposed to. He's not going to be at all happy with me, over this.\" So now pointing at the stranger and at the top of her now exquisite and extremely enhanced chest Lana screamed, \"GRAB HIM CLARK! HE'S THE ONE WHO CAUSED ALL OF THIS.\" By the time Clark has turned around the stranger had already grabbed the door and slammed it shut. Since the door's lock was now totally useless it swung back open. Clark was mystified at the empty space he's now looking at. [The stranger had again disappeared exactly the same way as the first night Lana saw him.] The hallway in both directions was also empty. Walking back inside Lana's apartment, Clark still doesn't see Lana's new longer legs. He was now totally focused looking at the now well OVER 9 foot tall Juliana. Her head and right shoulder were now through Lana's bedroom ceiling. It had happened when she stood up after waking a few minutes earlier. Trying to free herself from the ceiling had caused the small earth-quake Clark and everyone else had felt downstairs. Fortunately for Juliana, at least for now, her head poking part-way through the roof couldn't be seen from the street.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The reason Lana had lucked out with having her physical education class being canceled that day was that the Smallville High Junior Varsity Basketball team had had its game hastily rescheduled when their opponents Gymnasium became unavailable due to weather damage. It was one of the places the Autumn Tournament was being held this year. So all P. E. classes after lunch had been canceled for Thursday and Friday - the school needed the extra time to set up the gym for the afternoon games to be played on both days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for now, Lana had been reprieved on explaining why she was wearing her 'high heels' to the locker-room. She knew as soon as she removed her dress that every girl there would see the truth that she was afraid to admit to right now. Believing her sudden growth was a one-time occurrence, Lana thought that she now had until Monday to come up with an explanation for growing 3 1/2 inches taller overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all but 1/2 inch of her growth occurring in her legs, Lana's work went by quicker than usual, and by the time 5:30 rolled around she wasn't quite feeling as tired as she normally would. Taking her break a couple minutes before 5:30, Lana grabbed a table in a secluded corner and waited anxiously for Clark arrive. Hopefully, this time, he would not let her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pleasantly surprised to see Clark enter the Talon precisely on time (for once). With his track record of not showing up due to some last minute 'emergency', Lana had been debating with herself over how long she would wait for him to show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stood up to call him over to her table, he seemed to notice her increased height. She recalled that she had been a seated position when they had encountered one another at lunch time, and she wondered if would mention her growth spurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark walked over to Lana's table briskly, with a warm smile on his lips. \"Hey Lana,\" Clark greeted. \"I can help you with that washing if you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised and suddenly speechless over Clark's offer, Lana was puzzled until she remembered her explanation about why she was wearing that dress to school. Lana hadn't changed her clothes after walking over to the Talon (in record time) that afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...thanks,\" Lana said quietly, with a half smile. \"But erm...I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her back to the door, Lana did not see the mysterious stranger from yesterday enter the Talon, and sit near enough to hear her conversation with Clark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of small talk, Lana got up, went over to the counter, and prepared 2 coffees with pasties for them to snack on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her walk over to the counter, Clark appreciated how much more inviting Lana's rear swayed than it has in the past. He starts daydreaming about Lana being as tall and big as him. {During the past year or so, Clark had seriously started worrying that Lana was getting more skittish around him because he had grown so much taller than her.} <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Lana returned with their snacks Clark had a very contented look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking him what he was thinking about, taking her right hand in his left in a low voice (forcing her to lean towards him to hear) Clark tells Lana just how much he likes seeing her in that dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana is so touched by his sentiment, she blushes 7 different shades of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow whispering, Clark continues saying, \"Lana, wouldn't it be wonderful if you would you grow as much as me one day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow totally overcome by her emotions, Lana does not correctly hear Clark's wish. So without contemplating any possible consequences to herself, Lana immediately says, \"Yes, Clark I truly wish we could really <i>grow</i> together one day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lovingly kisses him on the lips. Seconds later, Lana hears a huskily deep and sexy feminine voice {that she suddenly wishes was hers} in her head say, \"GRANTED\". At first surprised and then perplexed by the voice, within a minute Lana has shrugged it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of Lana's break they eat their snacks in silence. They're both afraid to say anything because it might destroy this wonderful mood they're sharing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious stranger fully intends to immediately fulfill Lana's wish when she resumes working. Unfortunately, due to the unexpected basketball game being held at the High School the Talon had been pretty packed all afternoon. So Lana spent over an hour restocking and checking inventory in the storeroom. Before she started serving again at the front counter the stranger was forced to leave. The stranger could not stay indefinitely at any one place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana finishes work, closes up and then goes upstairs to her bedroom for some well deserved sleep. Waking up the next morning, Lana spends twice as longer showering as she normally would because she's so relaxed. Daydreaming about what had happened the previous afternoon with Clark, Lana doesn't even remember that she's now 3 1/2 inches taller until she dresses for school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince all of her regular school dresses have become to short to wear, Lana again puts on one of her party dresses and walks to school. Everybody assumes she still hasn't been able to do her washing. Anyone who was at the Talon yesterday saw just how busy it was. None the less, she was still concerned over how she was going to explain things when she can't hide her new improved legs on Monday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana got through the school day without any problems. Not too surprisingly to her, Lana does not see Clark at all that day. After school during her walk to the Talon, [which each time was getting faster] Lana thinks that maybe Clark was embarrassed about what he had told her the previous afternoon. Even-though they were now both Seniors, Lana thought there were times when Clark was still shy around her. Which had contributed to her confusion about their relationship and if there should be one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Lana's noisy alarm went off. She gave a groan and slammed her hand down on top of the wretched source of the noise, then plunged her head back into her pillow, determined to get an extra half hour in bed. As she turned over and prepared to resume her sleep, she was disturbed by a loud rumbling from beneath the sheets. Though a little startled at first, it didn't take long for Lana to realise that the noise had come from <i>inside</i> her. It was the noise of her stomach rumbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana couldn't really recall ever feeling hungry at this hour before - she wasn't a breakfast person, and was usually in such a rush to leave the house and open up the Talon that she had to wait until around 11am before she even had so much as a snack. She decided to ignore the noises of her stomach and return to sleep, but her tummy didn't want to stay quiet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next ten minutes, Lana tossed and turned in bed as her stomach rumbled and gargled in protest. With each passing moment, Lana could feel herself growing more and more hungry. Ten minutes on, she had been unable to get back to sleep, and was completely ravenous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghh...\" Lana groaned, her stomach aching slightly as she finally decided to sit up. \"I'm getting up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana swung her legs over the side of the bed and rubbed her eyes tiredly before standing up, stretching and letting out a yawn. She decided to get herself ready before she grabbed something to eat, so quickly changed into some tight fitting jeans and a sweater that clung to her upper body. She tied her hair back, grabbed her shoes, and hurried to the kitchen. Her stomach continued to growl, and the hunger she was feeling was actually beginning to grow quite painful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana rubbed her stomach absent mindedly as she moved into the kitchen. She began searching through the cupboards. Unfortunately, the cupboards were pretty bare. Lana soon realised she had failed to get any food in this week, leaving her with little more than bread, milk and a half empty box of cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this'll have to do,\" Lana said to herself, grabbing the cereal, the milk and a bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made herself a bowl, and immediately dug in. She was still confused about why exactly she was feeling this hungry, but as she began to eat, she forgot all about that. Some of the hunger pains in her stomach were beginning to ease as she continued to stuff spoonful after spoonful of cereal into her mouth. Soon enough, Lana had finished the bowl, but she knew that she wasn't full. She poured herself another, larger bowl, filled it with milk, and dug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each mouthful, Lana began to feel the emptiness in her stomach fade away, and after finishing her second bowl, the feeling of hunger seemed to have gone away completely. She patted her stomach in satisfaction, checked the clock - for once, it seemed she was going to be out of the house in plenty of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana placed the empty bowl in the sink, grabbed her bag, and left the house, heading to the Talon to begin her day's work. </span></div></div>",

A tall man, dressed in the familiar garb of a delivery man, had entered the Talon, and was wheeling a cart over to Lana's desk. Lana watched him approach in confusion; this wasn't her usual delivery guy, nor was she expecting anything today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin miss,\" the delivery man said, parking the cart and drawing a piece of paper from his pocket. \"I've got a delivery for a Lana Lang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" Lana said. \"But delivery isn't until Tuesday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're free samples,\" the delivery guy replied, patting the top of the cart. \"Some new food company in Metropolis is handing them out...trying to drum up some business, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea what's in there?\" Lana asked, peering over the counter at the cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery guy shrugged and lifted the lid, revealing a whole pack of cakes, muffins, pastries and various other items. Lana was surprised at this company's generosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want 'em?\" The delivery guy asked, closing the lid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll take them,\" Lana said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sign here,\" the delivery guy said, passing a clip board to Lana over the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana didn't bother reading the small-print; it was never important anyway. She quickly signed her name and passed the man back his clipboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, it's all yours!\" The delivery guy smiled, then turned and walked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana walked around the other side of the counter, grabbed the cart, and wheeled it around the back of the store. She lifted the lid and had another look inside; there was a ton of stuff inside! Much more than she had originally thought. Whatever company it was that had decided to give her these samples were certainly being generous. She grabbed a few of the items and placed them on the counter, then made up a sign which read <i>'FREE! PLEASE TAKE ONE!'</i> It was the least she could do considering how much stuff they had sent her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the items in the cart - nothing in there seemed particularly healthy, but they all fit in well with the Talon's coffee shop theme. </span></div></div>",

The free samples Lana had laid out were long gone, and she was running low on the stock that the food company had gifted her. Lana had eaten quite a few herself, ditching her usually well regimented diet as soon as the delicious chocolate goodies touched her lips; she wasn't proud of herself, but she had somehow managed to eat over a dozen of the delicious brownies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, got anymore of those brownies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take another muffin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are those brownies you were selling earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana was struggling to keep the customers at bay, and they seemed to be multiplying by the minute. \"I'm sorry!\" She called out over the crowd forming around her. \"We're all out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were annoyed groans and sad sighs from the customers, who began to filter out of the door, rubbing their stomachs hungrily as they headed back onto the streets. Lana didn't care though, she had sold enough products today to keep the store going for the next month at least! Business had never been so good. She looked over the room and saw that the few customers that remained were slumped in their chairs, looking strangely tired. One of them was Chloe, who was practically sprawled out on one of the comfy leather chairs on the far side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana wasn't surprised to see Chloe looking less than energetic. She had packed away much more food than usual this afternoon, consuming more of those sought after brownies than the average customer. Lana had eaten just as many, of course, but she hadn't had the luxury of slouching in a comfy chair. The beautiful brunette glanced down at her stomach, only to find it's flat, toned shape had been replaced with a slight bulge. She wasn't shocked, given the fact she had stuffed so many chocolate treats down her throat, but it was a strange sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the counter for a moment, Lana crossed the room and sat in the chair opposite Chloe. \"How you doin?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe gave a groan and rubbed her stomach. \"I think I might have overdone it,\" she moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana noticed that Chloe's stomach had expanded into a large ball, giving her the look of a woman in the early stages of pregnancy. \"Yeah...those brownies really went down a storm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose...you have any left?\" Chloe asked, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't still be hungry?\" Lana laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strangely...yes,\" Chloe patted her bloated belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana was about to speak, when a loud rumbling from her own stomach cut her short. Suddenly, she was hungry. Her stomach rumbled and rumbled, even as she tried to ignore it's cries. How could she still be hungry after all she had eaten? Perhaps the brownies weren't all that filling? But as her stomach continued to growl angrily, she knew she needed to eat something...</span></div></div>",

It took Clark a couple of minutes of gently poking the girls in their gloriously extra-rotund stomachs before they slowly start waking up. Seeing Clark standing over her Chloe, shrieks from embarrassment from having Clark seeing her in her current predicament, Clark starts laughing uproariously when Chloe desperately and futilely tried hiding her bloated stomach. Lana, awakened by Chloe's shrieking, notices Clark standing over her very sleepily Lana proclaims, I love you, Clark.Then wiggling her overly ample hips as seductively as she knows how and smiling very silly, Lana shocked Clark saying, \"I'm really ready now, Clark. So do you want to fool around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlabbergasted by Lana's words, Clark stands over her stunned and speechless. Before Clark can respond to Lana's invitation, both girls start burping like machine guns. Curiously, the air they expel is chocolate scented and rapidly drying out their mouths. In less than a minute, they're both running to drink something (anything) caffeinated. Fortunately for her, Chloe guzzles down hot coffee, by the extra-large cup, without her mouth getting burned. Lana, however, {soon to be her very great horror}, drinks literally gallons of highly carbonated soda pop. When they've both finally had their fill, Clark squeaks out a very faint, yes. Ecstatic, Lana grabs Chloe and starts hopping up and down as high as she can (which really isn't all that high considering their current bulk), deliriously shouting, \"Can you believe it Chloe, He said YES !!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, both girls start feeling their entire bodies <u>very slowly</u> inflating as their breath takes on an increasingly strong scent of what they had just drunk. For Chloe, it wasn't all that bad as first she melted into a roughly 5 1/2 foot mocha smelling blob that, in every way that matters, slowly becomes nearly twice the girl she had been that morning. Lana, however, when she started inflating began squeaking like a balloon nearing failure, which absolutely terrified Lana. She thinks she's about to burst like a party balloon. Instead, after several minutes of slowly expanding her body suddenly expanded into a very busty, overly hippy, extremely muscle-bound looking giantess. The sort of figure that Lana has feared becoming ever since she learned about Green Kryptonite's potential effect on humans.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For nearly 2 minutes, Lana's hand hovered over all of those very tempting treats. Since the weather outside was unseasonably cold Lana finally picked one of the blueberry muffin boxes of four. She figured that warming it in the toaster oven would make it taste more delicious. Just as she pulled the box out of the cart, one of Lana's oldest friends Angela Adams walked into the Talon. She was with Caroline Cooper, Captain of Smallville High's cheer-leading team. Seeing Angela look at her, Lana suddenly felt like the cat caught with the canary in its mouth. Knowing what Lana usually ate, Angela started to tease Lana about her choice for breakfast. Lana's stuttering to explain just made the situation more comical. By the time Lana explained things, the girls had arrived at the counter. Caroline noticed that there were several of those muffin 4 packs sitting inside the cart. Since Lana said that she was going to warm up her blueberry muffin before eating it, Caroline decided to also warm up 4 sets of 8 for the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractice was starting in a few minutes and she was sure the team-members would appreciate something warm to eat before practice started. So Lana warmed up all the muffins for Caroline first. Collecting the wrapping to throw away, Angela offered to throw it in the recycling bin at school which pleased Lana very much. She is a member of the High School's 4-H Club. Since Caroline was in a rush for practice, Lana warmed her muffin last after both girls had left. Just as she reached in the oven to start eating it, several kids came in and so it sat there cooling while Lana filled their orders. Twenty minutes later, Lana had finished warming up her fourth muffin. The first muffin was SO delicious she just had to warm up some more right away. Just as Lana raised the muffin to her mouth to eat, Angela burst through the door yelling, \"Lana don't eat it!\" \"Angela why are you in such a panic?\" Lana asked. Angela replied, \"After getting to school, I happened to glance at the wrapping and boxes those muffins came in. On the bottom on the box was a BIG LETTER warning to not warm up those muffins before eating. They were manufactured with a new mixture of berries and flour that automatically warms your body when eaten.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lana can tell Angela that she had already eaten THREE muffins, Angela asked Lana, \"Why are you wearing blue contacts?\" (Lana's eyes are a gorgeous chocolaty brown.) Lana replied \"Angela, what are you talking about? You know that I don't wear contacts.\" Angela then said, \"Well Lana, then how do you explain your BLUE eyes.\" Lana turned around, looked in the mirror, saw that she now had blue eyes and then uttered, \"What's going on here?\" Now Francine Foster the teams Co-Captain loudly enters with some of the girls with her, screaming at the top of her lungs, \"Get her.\" Lana's quickly surrounded by them. Lana asks them, \"what's the matter, girls?\" \"We want you to fix this at ONCE.\" Caroline bellowed. Lana then quietly asked, \"what do you want me to fix?\" Before they could show Lana what had happened to them, Lana doubles over with cramps far more severe than she has ever felt before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting her breath back, Lana looks up at the cheerleaders seeing them literally larger than life. Since it was so cold outside, they had all entered the Talon wearing very heavy weather coats. Taking the coats off, it was obvious the entire team was now a lot bigger up top. Since they all had outgrown them, none of the girls were wearing bras. Everyone's skin tone had also become bluish, even Mei the Chinese-American member of the team. Caroline next tells her that the others have changed even more because they had each eaten at least an entire muffin. The girls here with her had only eaten part of theirs when the changes started occurring. All the color drains out of Lana's face as she realizes that she has eaten 3 muffins. Then Lana feels very bloated throughout her entire body, even her hair feels different! Everyone suddenly hears very loud sloshing sounds coming from Lana's stomach. That can't be good, Lana thinks. Pressure starts building up fast inside of Lana. Lana suddenly grabs hold of the closest cheerleader. Before anyone can separate them Lana kisses her very tightly on the mouth just as a river of blueberry juice erupts out of her stomach. Within seconds, Lana has filled the other girl up with blueberry juice. The girl is now to scared to move her nearly 6 1/2 tall and round dark blue-skinned body. She's terrified of popping from the pressure now growing inside of her. Then moving at unbelievable speed, Lana locks the front door of the Talon trapping all the girls inside with her (including several other teen-aged female customers). Her grinning from ear to ear has everyone scared to death. When Angela asks her, \"What's next for us?\" Lana replies...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the day went on, Lana started to feel bad about turning down Clark's offer. He had, at least, made an effort to patch things up with her after their recent relationship difficulties, perhaps she had been too hasty in turning down his offer. For the rest of the day, Clark was once again on her mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her shift was over, Lana gathered up her things and began to head home. After several hours of careful consideration, she had finally decided to call Clark and ask if his earlier offer was open. As she walked down the street, she flipped open her phone and dialled his number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Clark answered the phone, he sounded surprised. \"Lana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Clark,\" Lana said. \"I was thinking about your offer earlier, and I'm sorry I turned you down. Listen, I've had time to think about it and...are you still free tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah, sure!\" Clark exclaimed excitedly. \"Do you want to go to that new diner that's opened up in town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Lana said. \"I'll see you around seven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a date,\" Clark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, after she had gone home, showered and made herself up, Lana headed back into town and arrived at the new diner. She looked around, but couldn't see Clark anywhere, but, then again, she was half an hour early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana turned to see a blonde, smiling, waitress. She decided it would be best to grab a table now, before it got too crowded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get a table for two please?\" Lana asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" the waitress replied cheerfully, leading Lana over to a small, two person table. \"Would you like to see the menu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll wait for my friend to arrive first,\" Lana said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress nodded and hurried away, and Lana stared at the door, waiting for Clark's arrival. As she waited, Lana began to grow more nervous...did her hair look okay? Was Clark going to propose they get back together? Was this really the right place to meet? These questions occupied her thoughts for the next half hour, while she continued to stare at the door. Each time it swung open, she expected to see Clark walk in, but each time, she was left disappointed. It had now reached seven o'clock, and there was no sign of Clark. Lana checked her phone - no messages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and lent back in her chair; perhaps, as usual, Clark wasn't going to show...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to see the menu now Miss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana looked up to see the waitress smiling down at her again. \"Sure, why not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress pulled out a menu from her clipboard and handed it to Lana, then walked off. Lana had a quick flick through. Nothing on the menu seemed to be especially healthy - mammoth burger and fries, pizza and fries, souther fried chicken and fries...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything that doesn't come with fries?\" Lana muttered to herself. None the less, she had to admit that the accompanying pictures on the menu made the food look appetising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the menu aside and glanced at her watch again, it was now five minutes past seven...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana continued to wait, but the minutes went by, and there was still no sign of Clark. Time dragged on, and soon enough, it had reached half seven. Lana was feeling more than a little annoyed - Clark had let her down once again, and it had been him that first extended the invitation for tonight! She resigned herself to the fact he wasn't coming, and pulled open the menu...</span></div></div>",

However, before she could leave, Clark came rushing in the door...exactly one hour late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Where have you been!\" Lana asked Clark. \"We were supposed to meet over an hour ago and I was about to leave! \" Glancing down at Clark backpack, she added, and what are you doing with your schoolbag with you on a Saturday?\" Clark glanced at Lana nervously. The truth was that he had been finishing up his homework earlier that day when he had been notified by Chloe about a local meteor freak on the loose, which had taken Clark several hours to find and apprehend. Clark had been so preoccupied with that task, he had not noticed he still had his backpack with him. Of course, he could not tell Lana all of that! \"Sorry, I was just studying, and I lost track of time!\" Clark lied. \"I won't let , happen again! Anyway, I see you have been looking at the menu for this place, is there anything you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Lana sighed in exasperation, but decided to let Clark's lack of \"time management skills\" go this time. \"Actually yes, Waiting here so long has made me really hungry. Could you get me the pizza and fries, please?!\" Lana figured she could afford to indulge herself just this once. \"Sure!\" Clark replied a little too enthusiastically. \"I'll get the same thing.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     Several minutes after they ordered, Clark and Lana's food arrived. Lana was surprised to find out that the portions at this restaurant where huge! Even Clark said he wasn't sure he would be able to finish his plate...and sure enough Clark finished eating after only half of his plate was gone! Lana, on the other hand, had grown very hungry while waiting for Clark, and the food smelled amazing! Therefore, to both Clark and Lana's surprise, the dark haired teenage girl managed to finish her entire plate of pizza and fries, and now felt completely stuffed! Hoping Clark wouldn't notice, Lana began to discretely  rub her swollen tummy while Clark and herself talked about the status of their \"friendship\"! However, while she was trying to explain to Clark that she wasn't sure they should become a couple again just yet, she thought she caught Clark smiling while staring at her rubbing her bare stomach over the lip of the booth a few times...but she thought she must just have been imagining things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After Clark had expressed his reluctant agreement wish Lana's decision and paying their bill, he began to get up from the table...when his backpack, which had been begun to come unzipped after it had been bumped during Clark's fight with the meteor freak, suddenly fell open, sending all of its contents spilling on to the floor. As Clark began to pick up his belongings from the floor, Lana noticed something unusual. Along with his books and notebooks from school, Clark had also been keeping a magazine in his schoolbag which. When Clark saw her looking at it, Clark quickly put it back in his bag and took of with a rushed goodbye, almost as if he had not wanted Lana to see it! Lana wondered at Clark's  behavior, which had been even stranger that normal and at what little she had been able to make out from the magazines cover: a portrait of a very fat woman and, in slightly smaller letters than the magazines title, which had been obstructed from her view, the letters \"BBW\"!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                                                        LATER THAT NIGHT...<br>\r\n      Although Lana had tried to tell herself that, since Clark and her were not currently together, he could read whatever he wanted, and that the contents of the mysterious magazine where none of her business, Lana's curiosity got the better of her, and she opened up her Internet browser and typed in the letters \"BBW\". Instantly, thousands of search results popped onto the screen. After looking at a few of the suggested sites for about half an hour, Lana began to understand that, in some circles, fat women were actually considered attractive and were called \"Big, Beautiful Women\" or BBW. Therefore, Lana thought to herself, Clark's magazine must have been a BBW admirer's magazine, and Clark must be attracted to fat girls! That would explain why Clark would have been staring at her stuffed belly earlier today...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   \"But that doesn't make sense!\" Lana thought. \" I'm pretty skinny, and Clark has liked me for years...\" Oh. Lana nearly gasped as she remembered that, during grade school and for a short time in Middle School, she had been rather fat herself. She had lost the weight later, of course, but she distinctly remembered that Clark had liked her even then. In fact, Lana thought to herself, he had actually seemed to pay even more attention to her then, even though other boys wouldn't give her the time of day during that period of her life. Since she had not liked Clark then, she had not really thought about why that was, but now it was all starting to make sense. Clark had first become attracted to her when she was fat, and from the look he had on his face when he had been staring at her bloated belly, he secretly wanted her to get fat again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Is that why Clark has been acting so strangely around me? Is that why relationships between him and me always seem to get awkward and fall apart?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     ...After much deliberation, Lana decided that....<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So that night, Lana went to bed with a new resolve to try patching things up with Clark. She figures that by eating larger portions at EVERY meal she should gain a couple of pounds every week. That way after 3 months of effort she should be at least 20 pounds heavier. Thinking to herself that that should be enough weight gain for Clark to respond positively to the NEW Lana. If Clark DOES show more interest in her, Lana will know for sure that Clark prefers that his girl-friend be a Big, Beautiful woman. Which will be alright with her. On the other hand, if Clark's interest in her doesn't substantially increase, Lana has decided that she'll break up with Clark for good. After all, she muses, Clearly Lex is also interested in me. She then figures having a wealthy husband can't be as bad as people say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the next morning when she makes breakfast, Lana start her new 'weight gaining' diet. First off, she fries 3 eggs rather than her normal two, has 3 slices of toast instead of her usual one and pours herself an extra, large glass of fresh juice which she almost never has in the morning. Lunch and dinner are similarly larger that day and every day after-wards. Oddly, Lana doesn't run into Clark at all for the next couple of weeks. It starts seeming to her, that he's deliberately trying to avoid her. Which doesn't sit well with her. It had been so many years since Lana had lost weight and became thin she has forgotten her old eating habits. It had taken her nearly a year and a half to fully slim down and THAT was with a doctor's continuing oversight. Her Aunt Nell remembered how roly, poly she and Lana's mother had been when THEY had started High School. She hadn't wanted Lana to suffer through the same taunting by the other students THEY had both suffered through at Smallville High. Late in tenth grade for Nell, they had finally worked up the courage to lose a lot of weight together. By the time Nell started eleventh grade they were now slim enough that all the terrible things being said about them, not always behind their backs, stopped for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after a few days of total release from her long repressing diet, Lana starts to really gain weight. She pack on the pounds a lot quicker than she anticipated and soon Lana realizes that she had  neglected to consider one extremely important factor. With her gaining as much weight as she intends to her ENTIRE wardrobe WILL become unwearable, necessitating her replacing everything that she owns in her closet and dresser. She had also forgotten about how hyper-active she was when she was heavier. There was something about her normally large appetite that made her act like a whirling dervish. When Lana had been the heaviest girl in her grade she had also been the strongest, but absolutely NO one had noticed THAT at the time. So in addition to growing fatter, Lana was quickly developing some serious muscle throughout her slowly enlarging frame. Curiously, even though it wouldn't normally be expected now that she was past her eighteenth birthday, Lana's body began growing taller and her bust also became more prominent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had decided to gain weight, Lana deliberately didn't weigh herself. She wanted to wait until after the eight weeks were up. She didn't want to get disappointed with herself, if she wasn't gaining weight as fast as she wanted. Good or bad, she wanted to be surprised by the final result. Which came a lot quicker than she had considered possible. Having not seen Clark for two weeks, Lana decided to start hunting for him. After all, she was ballooning up fast and Lana was now breathless at finding out what Clark's reaction would be when he sees her larger body for the first time. When Lana FINALLY did run into Clark sixteen days after starting her diet, in addition to already gaining 3 dress sizes, and although she didn't know it, Lana has already gained 15 pounds! The look on Clark's face was utterly priceless. She could clearly see that he was VERY, definitely interested in her new, much enhanced figure. Which then showed on her face when she blushed at his ( quite risque for Clark) comments about her new shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Lana obviously couldn't know about and neither did Clark was the REASON for his interest in Big, Beautiful women. It was actually an essential part of his Kryptonian heritage. Around 50,000 Kryptonian years ago, Clark's home planet had gone through some quite severe climatological changes. It had the effect of changing the evolution of the normal development for adolescent Kryptonian girls as they matured fully into grown women. Forage had become quite sparse, so all Kryptonian girls who survived during that time acquired an ability similar to Earth camels. However, in their case instead of evolving the capacity to store a lot of water in their bodies, all of them acquired the ability to store an unusually large amount of fatty tissue in their bodies as they entered puberty. So Clark just can't help himself from admiring very heavy-set girls, like Lana had been when she was younger. He realized that culturally it's not normal on Earth to desire a large woman as a possible girl-friend/wife so he just chalks it up to being another one of those differences from Earthlings that he needs to keep hidden. So as he grew older, Clark was relieved to learn that SOME Earth-men actually DO prefer large, busty women rather than the sizes 0 to 4 usually seen as fashion models. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she knows that Clark definitely desires her growing larger, Lana does so with a vengeance. By the following Monday, Lana gains another 10 pounds and then another week later, Lana has Clark totally eating out of her hand, except for one increasingly important request of hers. The most surprising thing happening to Lana is her rapid muscle development. It seems to her that she's gaining just as much muscle as fat. Which after thinking about it she decides can't be all that bad. After all, as long as Clark is showing so much more interest in her, she really isn't all that concerned with what anyone else says about her now rapidly enlarging body. One month after she started her quest to claim Clark for herself, it's become clear to everyone in Smallville that even-though she has already gained nearly 40 pounds, Lana will soon be a very large and hefty Amazon. Other totally unexpected changes start occurring to Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer metabolism has kicked into turbo-charged growth causing her to be even more active than when she was a fat kid. If Clark hadn't had super-speed on his side, he would've been unable to KEEP UP with Lana's movement! One side-effect that she utterly adores is Lana now only needs about 5 hours of sleep a night. Which only serves to provide her with more time to eat and grow bigger for Clark. After 40 days and 70 pounds heavier than when she started, Lana starts growing concerned about Clark's ultimate intentions about her. Clark does everything she asks him except having sex. Every single time she brings up the issue, he starts putting food (that suddenly and mysteriously appears in his hands) in her mouth. Admittedly she doesn't mind that ONE SINGLE bit, but she wonders WHY he STILL hasn't asked her to have sex with him. By now, Lana's really, really ready for it and she's growing increasingly frustrated that she's still a virgin! Two more weeks later and another 55 pounds heavier Lana's situation hasn't changed. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although Clark has no reason to suspect that Lana is rapidly becoming one of the strongest woman (or man for that matter) on Earth, Clark is quite concerned that if they DO go all the way having sex, he could accidentally seriously injure Lana or possibly even kill her. So quite understandably he's unwilling to have to live with THAT on his conscious. Consequently, he continues avoiding the issue whenever Lana brings it up. Now that she's at the point every day of begging Clark, \"WHEN will we have sex\" she can't understand why he refuses to say anything one way or the other. So after 8 weeks since starting her endeavor in gaining weight along with Clark's interest in her, that afternoon in sheer desperation Lana walks (she can't fit in her car anymore) over to her best friend, Chloe's while Clark's busy doing his chores on the farm. Fully aware of Chloe's more than little girl infatuation with Clark, Lana doesn't intend asking her for any advice on her problem. Instead, she's looking for Chloe's cousin, Lois. Lana's rationalized that being an outsider Lois would have a different perspective on the matter. And besides Lana knows that Lois has ABSOLUTELY no interest in Clark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been so focused the past 8 weeks on getting and then keeping Clark's interest, Lana hadn't noticed the changes occurring recently at Smallville High. When Lois answered the front door Lana was stunned to see that during the past few weeks, Lois had also gained a respectable amount of weight. Although she was gaining weight much slower than Lana, Lois was now 3 full dress sizes larger after gaining 35 pounds. The vast bulk of it had settled onto Lois's hips and thighs and so her bra size hadn't even become one inch larger, which really annoyed Lois to no end. Secretly, if she HAD to gain some weight Lois would've preferred that some of it landed in her bust, particularly if she ended up growing at least 3 or 4 inches and a full cup bigger. After all, Lois figures being the older (bigger) sister she should be somewhat bigger up top than her kid sister, Lucy now is. When Lana blurts out, \"what's happened to you?\" Lois replies, \"Me. What about you Lana? You must have gained at least 60 pounds the past couple of months.\" With great pride in her voice Lana tells Lois, \"Actually Lois, I've gained 125 pounds and I can't wait to grow even bigger.\" Lois then notices something else about Lana has changed. Mentioning it, Lois says to her, \"Lana, how TALL are you?\" She replies, \"Five foot one, why Lois?\" Lois shoots back, \"Are you really sure about that Lana? You sure look to be the BIGGEST five foot one, that I've ever seen.\" Lana doesn't believe her so Lois insists that she measure Lana. Sure enough with all the weight she had been gaining and all the larger clothes that she had been buying neither Lana or Clark had noticed that along with every other part of her she was ALSO growing taller. During the past 8 weeks, Lana HAD grown taller. She's now just over 5 foot 4 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering from her unexpectedly welcome shock Lana again asked Lois, \"Why had she gained so much weight recently?\" For once, Lois was at a loss for words. All she sputters out after a minute of silence between them, \"I haven't the faintest idea why I started gaining weight. I didn't plan on doing so and by the time I realized why my pants were getting so tight on my hips, I had already gained 10 pounds. So I went on a diet to lose that weight and the only thing that happened to me was, I started gaining weight even FASTER, so I stopped trying after 2 weeks. It has sort of worked alright because now I'm only gaining a couple pounds a week now. The only thing is, I do wish all this new weight wouldn't seem to be only migrating to my hips (which Lois loudly slaps with her left hand). Lana, I know this sounds mighty weird but it seems to me that maybe, seeing you grow bigger and more beautiful every single day at school, my subconscious mind decided that my body NEEDS to also grow a lot bigger. Lana, lately I've been eating like a horse and I've now been getting worried that even though it could take quite a while to happen, I might END up as big a as horse. Then again, several dozen other girls in school have gained a lot of weight recently.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's about to ask Lois, what she's talking about when Chloe walks into the living room. She's clearly grown much fatter and bigger all around than Lois has, but Chloe's still a great deal smaller than Lana. Still Lana is really spooked at what has recently happened to Lois and Chloe. For the first time since embarking on her endeavor to gain weight and capture Clark's attention, Lana realizes that her actions have unwittingly affected others. Before Lana can get a word out Chloe said, \"Ya, ya Lana I know. There's no question about it, you win. This is a whole new wall of weird in itself. Some kind of strange and very selective virus has attacked many of the girls at school since the semester began a couple of months ago. So far, the doctors at Smallville Medical Center and Metropolis General haven't been able to pin down any common source for the infection or even what it is. All they know for sure is, once a girl gains around 7 pounds, she'll continue gaining weight irregardless of what ever she tries to lose it. Lana, I'm surprised that you haven't noticed anything about this at school.\"  Chloe then asked her, \"Lana, why did you come here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replied, \"Something I need to ask Lois about Chloe and no, I don't think you can help with my problem.\" So Chloe went to her bedroom and Lois went outside with Lana for a walk. About 20 minutes later, Lana has filled Lois in on pretty much everything about her none existent love life with Clark. After they get several bites at the Talon (it's Lana's day off) the two girls spent some more of the afternoon walking. Well Lana walked, Lois followed alongside her at a dead run for the next hour and a half before a possible solution suddenly appeared. Now far more winded than she ever thought possible, Lois instantly agrees when Lana offered to carry her back the nearly 10 miles to Chloe's place. She rationalized that if anyone asked why Lana's carrying her, Lois will just say her ankle gave out. Which it had, along with the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Lois realized the OBVIOUS solution to Lana's invisible love life they both laughed at themselves for not thinking of it sooner. Lois said to Lana, \"Just tell Clark that unless the two of you have sex by Saturday night, you'll go on strike and completely stop eating on Sunday morning. Lana agreed with Lois reasoning and asked Lois,\"Say, do you want to see the look on Clark's face when I give him this ultimatum?\" Lois enthusiastically said, \"Yes, but won't he react differently if I'm there when you tell him?\" Lana then said, \"Oh, that won't be a problem because you'll be hidden.\" Lois then asked, \"It's alright with me. This should be fun to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Lana then carried Lois back to the Talon and Lana's apartment there. Lana placed Lois in the bathroom and kept the door cracked open like she normally did so Clark wouldn't suspect anything. When he stopped by later for her afternoon snack, Lana asked him right off. Seeing Clark's face at the news, Lois couldn't keep still. Hearing her, Clark decided to immediately call Lana's bluff. Starting to take his and Lana's clothes off, Clark really got Lois to start sweating. She had no intention to watch them have sex, but Lois had no way to get out without Clark seeing her. Lana couldn't protest either after just giving him that ultimatum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after stripping off all their clothes except for his boxers and Lana's lingerie, Clark started quietly giggling. When Lana asked, \"what's so funny Clark?\" Quickly going to the bathroom door and opening it Clark replied, \"this Lana. I'd ask you to JOIN us Lois, but you're still way to SKINNY for my tastes.\" Lois screamed bloody murder at being discovered. Lana fainted at the thought that Clark would EVEN consider sharing his bed with 2 girls at the SAME time. Clark firmly held on to Lois until Lana woke up. Seeing how upset she was Clark apologized to Lana and after awhile both girls had calmed down enough for Clark to talk to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that this had been Lois idea in the first place, Clark asked Lana if she was really serious about going on a diet. When she said , \"Yes, Clark. I started gaining weight for you. I thought that after a month or so you would want to move our relationship to a deeper level. But so far that hasn't happened. I don't think you realize just how much I really truly love you. For the past couple of weeks now, I've been crying much to sleep every night over your continued refusal to have sex with me. My God Clark, we're both eighteen now. Why do you still refuse to touch my body that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark then started crying real tears of sorrow, which totally stunned both girls. After he calmed down Clark said, \"I was afraid that I might seriously hurt you Lana.\" Lois then jumped in, \"Oh come on Clark, you're not going to use that phony excuse now, are you?\" Annoyed at Lois statement Clark shot back, \"So Lois, do you want to find out just how STRONG I am?\" Seeing the enraged look on Clark's face, Lois quickly shut up. She then slunk to the furthest corner of Lana's bedroom from Clark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow totally backed into a corner Clark was stumped about what to do next. He DID want to have sex with Lana and had so for several weeks. He also didn't want to hurt her and so after pondering it for several minutes, Clark finally agreed to have sex with Lana. He told Lana that it would be his choice where they would go do it right after Lois left. So on her way out the door, Lana then told Lois, \"Don't tell Chloe or anyone else, ANYTHING about this and don't you worry Lois, I'm sure that everything will come out alright.\" Everybody got a hearty laugh over Lana's unintended double entendre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Both of these next 2 choices are to be written about some time, AFTER Lana and Clark FINALLY do have sex. Just as it would occur on American television.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Yeah, sure. So why, when you aren\u2019t eating chicken soup, do you always have a sandwich? Why don\u2019t you eat a cheeseburger?\u201d Pete asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll eat what I like, thank you very much.\u201d Chloe said. \u2018But I really hadn\u2019t thought about it. Do I really eat that little? Could I be sabotaging myself?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA likely story. You just want to stay thin for your evil alien overlords.\u201d Pete joked. \u201cAdmit it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d Said Chloe. \u201cI\u2019ll take up eating burgers and things, for one month. I\u2019ll even document it for the Torch. If I gain more than five pounds, the last article will have a headline an inch high, saying <i>'PETE ROSS IS ALWAYS RIGHT!'</i> It will be in block capitals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete blinked. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded. \u201cBut if I have to eat your grease-fest, you\u2019re gonna eat what I would eat. Sandwiches and soup for lunch, fruit and cereal for breakfast, everything. And you document it for the Torch too. I know it\u2019s a daily newsletter but all I ask is a paragraph or so. Then, if you lose so much as five pounds, I get to write <i>\u2018CHLOE SULLIVAN IS ALWAYS RIGHT!\u2019</i> in block capitals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete mused on it.

But not as foul as it had seemed. It was okay, but tasted like it was mostly just designed to fill you up. Well, let no man say that she didn't have an appetite. She usually meant an appetite for adventure, or danger, or something, but a regular old food-based appetite might do just as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed, and took another bite. She was beginning to get used to the flavour. It looked like Pete had cooled his soup down enough to drink too. She chewed some more. It was alright, bland, but not terrible. They chatted. Before she knew it, the fries were half gone and she was starting on her second burger. It tasted the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pete jogged off at the end of lunch, Chloe fondled her rather full stomach. Clark walked with her.

However, just as she was starting to panic, a hand lifted a double cheeseburger to her mouth, and Chloe tore through it greedily. Then, before she could think who the hands who it belonged to, she was feed an entire large pizza, slice by slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same pattern continued with the rest of the food on the table until it was all gone, and Chloe was happily, but painfully stuffed. Soon, however, the same pair of hands that had been feeding her started rubbing her extra, extra large belly making her feel, not just better, but absolutely fantastic! Finally, Chloe looked up to see that the hands belonged to Clark Kent, who was smiling and admiring her large belly! Then just when things couldn't seem to get any better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe woke up, and she had to admit that she was sad that the dream wasn't real. As much as she valued her independence, she would be more than a little tempted to sacrifice a little of it if she could pig out all the time and be loved by Clark Kent!

After some deliberation, Chloe had finally decided to see if Clark really <i>did</i> want to see her get bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her bet with Pete still on, Chloe had been already forced to eat his enormous breakfast - which had been made up of waffles with syrup, eggs, sausages and bacon. But not only had Chloe eaten all that, she had <i>doubled</i> it. Chloe had never eaten so much at such an early hour of the morning, and had actually found it quite difficult to keep going after her sixth sausage, but the idea of turning Clark on with her overstuffed belly pushed her on. By the time she had cleaned out her fridge, gobbled up seven sausages, eight pieces of bacon, three eggs and a dozen or so waffles, she was close to bursting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh...\" Chloe groaned. \"I don't think I've ever eaten this much in my whole life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulge of Chloe's stomach was blatantly obvious, and she had to keep tugging her top down to cover it her bloated belly, which kept forcing the shirt to ride up above her belly button. She managed to conceal it somewhat with her jacket, but was still very much aware that she looked mildly pregnant as she walked to school - a walk which Chloe found exceptionally tiring due to the vast amount of food being held within her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got into school, she hurried to the Torch office and slumped down into her chair, letting out a sigh of relief as she rubbed her bulging belly. Clark usually met her here every morning before classes began, and Chloe was sure he would be along at any minute.

Although she had been planning to save it for a snack later, and she was very stuffed, but she thought that it might be the perfect tool to evaluate whether Clark really enjoyed her new eating habits...and the inevitable results on her physique. Timing thinks just right, Chloe managed to open the candy bar, a CLARK bar of course, and take her first bite just as Clark entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chloe, I was wondering if we needed anymore material for today's issue of the Torch...\", Clark immediately stopped speaking at the sight of Chloe and her now immense stomach. Once again, it took a few awkward(on his part at least) seconds before he could bring himself to stop staring at Chloe, munching on a candy bar, large belly exposed up to her belly button. This did not escape Chloe's notice, but she wanted to make Clark squirm a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing like nothing out of the ordinary was occurring, Chloe continued to slowly munch on the candy bar, saying in between bites,\" Thanks for asking Clark, but I think we've got everything covered. Our copy boy just needs to print out the copies for this afternoon's distribution. I've even prepared that confession that Pete was right about my eating habits, because, well,,,\", Chloe playfully wiggled her stomach with her free hand and feigned embarrassment, \"I weighed myself this morning, and I have apparently already put on five pounds!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Clark discreetly watched Chloe continue to eat her candy bar, Clark, trying not to let on how turned on he was, managed to stutter, \"Wo...wo...wow, that was fast. So I guess you're going to stop eating like Pete now right?\"<br>\r\nPart of him wanted her to say yes, so Chloe and him could go back to just being friends, with no...other feelings to get in the way. Another part of him, still quiet, but insistent, wanted her to say no, so she would keep eating and growing. Whatever he expected, he was surprised at Chloe's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. In fact, I'm tired of living up to anyone's standards of beauty, or what I should and shouldn't eat. From now on, I'm going to eat what I want, when I want, and as much as I want, no matter what the consequences are for this...\" With that, Chloe patted her stomach and continued munching on her CLARK bar, and Clark, despite his best efforts, resumed staring at Chloe, (the?) new object of his affections. As Chloe took the last few bites of her candy bar, her pants, which had been tightening ever since her large breakfast that morning, finally gave out. Then, something happened that neither Clark or Chloe had expected,,,the button of Chloe's pants flew off !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAutomatically switching to super speed mode at the sight of the flying object, Clark managed to get himself back to normal speed before Chloe noticed anything had changed...but not before sneaking a peek at Chloe, belly now fully exposed, which only lasted a few nanoseconds but seemed like a lot longer to speed-mode Clark. After returning to human speed, Clark looked down and spouted out, \"That's...fine...whatever...but you might want to get some new pants before classes start...\", with that a visibly embarrassed and blushing Clark exited the room to avoid a very uncomfortable situation with his friend... but did he still just think of Chloe as a friend? Trying to push the thought out of his head, Clark went somewhere to think before first period started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a smiling Chloe pulled a new pair of pants out of her bag, which had belonged to her Mom along time ago. She hadn't been sure, but she thought something like this might happen, and if she kept eating like this;she would probably have to buy new clothes pretty soon. But is was all worth it to see Clark admire her like that.After getting up from her chair, not an easy task considering her rather bloated form, she put on the new pants, which where a little loose on her...for now.

But two questions still remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, would Chloe like him admiring her form as it grew? He already knew that she liked him, off course, but would she enjoy that he liked her eating and gaining weight? Then he thought about Chloe's actions a few minutes ago and realized something, she was using her new eating habits and weight gain to flirt with him! She had flirted with him before, but not to the extent of showing him her skin like that, and she obviously knew he was admiring her growing form, and seemed okay with it. And surprisingly, he was also getting used to this strange new attraction. After all, he was an alien with powers, so liking Chloe getting fatter was not all that unusual by his standards. Besides, although Chloe liked him, Clark knew she was too independent to gain weight just for him, so he realized she must be enjoying her fattening process as well. So, Chloe liked him, and he liked her. So the second question was: what was the problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was Lana. Despite his new attraction for Chloe, Clark still retained some feeling for Lana, but he was not sure what they were now, Sure, he had admired her since he was five, but it was starting to seem like Clark Kent and Lana Lang just couldn't work as a couple. And although he was sure he would always like her as a friend, Clark's new found acquaintance  with some of the more flawed sides of Lana's personality made him wonder if he really wanted her as a girlfriend, let alone something more long-term in the future, But then again, Chloe was one of Clark's best friends, and he wasn't sure he wanted to risk their friendship with a hastily-entered relationship. He also knew if he didn't pick Chloe or Lana soon, he would lose his chances with both girls,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Clark pondered, who should he pick:Chloe or Lana?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a lone period of deliberation, Clark decided that he would like to take his chances with Chloe. After all, he had tried to have a relationship with Lana before, on more than one occasion, and they just couldn't seem to make things work. Besides, he really did like Chloe, and he had never really given her a chance ,unless he wanted to count that dance he botched by running off to save Lana from the tornado. Not that he thought it was wrong for him to save Lana, but he now realized that he should have tried to put more effort into patching things up with Chloe afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    So, it was decided then, no more putting things off for Clark Kent, he would ask Chloe out at lunch today, if he could get her alone that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at lunch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was sitting down alone in the cafeteria, trying to wolf down another huge meal, with twice the amount of burgers and fries as Pete usually ate, and a desert to boot. Although she was enjoying the feeling of eating like this, she had to admit that her stomach, which was still getting used to digesting this much food at a time, was getting a little uncomfortable, Plus, she was beginning to wonder if she had only been imagining Clark's attraction to her expanding form. What if his starring glances and embarrassment were actually signs of disgust for her enlarging body? Chloe was starting to think her plan for luring Clark in was crazy, and was about to push away her large meal when Clark walked up to her table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Chloe. where is Pete? Is he meeting us for lunch today?, Clark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe sighed. Of course, now Clark would only talk to her if needed something, or wanted to know where Pete was. \"Actually, I heard he called in sick today. I'm kind of relieved actually, now he won't see my confession that he was right about my eating habits when it comes hot off the presses.\" Actually, Chloe was rather proud of the article that accompanied that announcement, it urged teenagers, especially females, to avoid trying to conform to the media's standards of beauty and to love their bodies, no matter the size. It was a fluff piece, but she thought is sent an important message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark replied, \"Oh, sorry to hear that, but I guess that gives us time to talk alone.\" Now Chloe was nervous. What would Clark say? Did he not like her new look? Was he about to suggest she stop eating so much? \"About what?\", She managed to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a Friday, and I was wondering whether you would like to go out with me tonight? Maybe to Caesar's Palace?\" Chloe, still in shock, hesitated in her reply. Clark wanted to go out on a date with her? What's more, he wanted to take her to Caesar's Palace, a local Italian restaurant known for its rather large portions. Maybe he did like her weight gain, after all. In fact, her plan just might be working!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her hesitation as a sign of rejection, Clark hastily added, \"Of course  if you don't want to go, that's ok too. I mean, I don't want to screw up our friendship or anything...\" Before Clark could finish that his though, Chloe butted in, \"Are you crazy? Off course I'll go with you! What time did you want to pick me up...or would your rather me pick you up at your house?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark smiled, \"I'll pick you up at 7, ok?\" With that, Clark began to walk away, before remembering he had not eaten his lunch yet! With a little embarrassment, he then preceded to sit next to Chloe again, who now had extra incentive to finish her huge meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown-st  to both of them, Lana had been watching their entire conversation with more than a little bit of envy. How could Chloe do that to her? She was supposed to be Lana's friend, and now she was moving in on Clark, who both girls knew Lana liked. She would make Chloe pay for this. As the old saying goes, \"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little over a month later, Clark and Chloe are still dating, and Chloe has gained...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just another day for Clark and Chloe, the happy couple that had become the subject of gossip in Smallville High. Everyone knew Chloe had liked Clark for awhile, and many of their peers thought it was nice to see the two together. However, many of them where concerned by the fact that Chloe had gained 10 pounds since the 4 weeks and 2 days Clark and her had started dating (15 pounds since her bet with Pete).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the truth was, the new couple couldn't be happier with Chloe's (quite intentional) weight gain, which was rapid enough to be noticeable to an admiring Clark, but not so fast that Chloe had to force herself to eat more than she wanted to with her new found appetite. As the couple walked to their third period class together, hand in hand, they walk past Lana, who greets the two of them with a forced, but seemingly heartfelt , \"Hey guys, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, Clark responds, \"Not much, me and Chloe were just talking about what we were going to do this weekend. I suggested that her and I should go to a local film festival, but she wants us to go with Pete to an amusement park a couple towns over, and hang out with him there. I suppose she has a point, we have been spending an awful lot of time alone together recently, and maybe we need to spend more time with our friends.\" He smiles at Chloe as he says this. Then Chloe adds, \"Speaking of which, we were wondering if you would like to come with us?\" She knows that if Lana accepts her offer, the weekend might be awkward for Clark and Lana (and probably herself, as well), but she still felt bad for Lana, who had lost her chance to be with Clark to her. \"Sure\", she told herself, \"Clark did ask ME out of his own free will, but i did sort of provoke that response by flirting with him...in my own unique fashion.\" The thought of the past month of eating and weight gain almost made her blush, but she forced herself to focus on Lana's predicament. She still wanted Clark and herself to try to be friends with Lana, even if that made things a little awkward for Clark and herself for a little while. Since Clark offers no objections to Chloe's suggestion, she guesses that he feels the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to appear happy, Lana responds, \"Sure, that sounds like a great idea! I've messed hanging out with you two, you know, and I haven't really gotten to know Pete all that well, either!\" With that, Clark, Chloe and Lana make plans to meet up with Pete that weekend, and the three of them head to their classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, underneath the mask of her bubbly personae, Lana was still hurt and angered by Clark and Chloe's new relationship. Chloe, her best friend, had stolen Clark away from her! To add insult to injury, Chloe had gained a considerable amount of weight in only a month! \"If I were dating Clark\", Lana inwardly fumed, \"I would work hard to stay beautiful for him, not let myself go!\" However, for the first time in a month, things were looking up for Lana...and a certain Pete Ross. During the course of Clark and Chloe's relationship, Pete had grown jealous of his best friend, who had stolen the girl he secretly loved out from under him. He was also puzzled, although not necessarily repulsed, by Chloe's weight gain, and was convinced that Clark was responsible somehow. In a rare show of vulnerability, Pete had opened up to the only person he thought might understand, Lana Lang. Together, the two of them had come up with a plan: to drive  Clark and Chloe apart over this weekend, so Lana could have Clark, and Pete could have Chloe. The odd thing was, while they were planning to split the new couple up, Lana had gotten to know Pete better that she had in all of their previous years at school together, and vice versa. They had actually become pretty good friends. \"Just friends?\" A voice in the back of Lana's head asked. \"Where did that thought come from?\" Lana asked herself. No, she liked Clark, and Pete liked Chloe. If they kept their eyes on the ball, both Pete and her could get who they really wanted and everyone could be happy...Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that weekend at the amusement park...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weekend that all four teens had been looking forward to (for different reasons) finally arrived. After meeting at the parking lot of Smallville high after school Friday, the four of them drove to Jakelburk, where the amusement park was located. What Pete had neglected to take into account was that the amusement park was almost 8 hours away! There was not way they could even get back to Smallvile before morning, much less ride on rides at the amusement park. After explaining the situation to their parents, it had been decided that the four of them were mature enough to stay at a hotel for a couple nights...as long as the guys and girls stayed in separate rooms.of course. It turned out though, that the only two rooms left in the hotel were a room with two single beds that had just had a mice problem(which had been taken care of), and room with a double bed. Left with little choice, they checked out the rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't go in the room with the singles, I'm allergic to mice!\", Pete said. Clark nodded, he had known this about Pete for years. However, he definitely did not know what would happen next. \"Oh, um...so am I.\" Lana said quietly. She wasn't really allergic to mice, but none of the other three knew that, and it would give her and Pete a chance to hammer out some of the details of their plan before morning. \"Is that the real reason you're lying?\" The annoying voice in Lana's head returned. She tried to make it shut up. The other three in the group stared at Lana. \"Houston, we have a problem!\" Chloe exclaimed. Clark thought for a moment, then said, \"Let's be reasonable about this, shall we? This is the only hotel in town, and we can't drive back now. How about Chloe and I stay in the room with two beds, and Pete and Lana stay in the room with one? Our parents won't have to know anything, Besides, I'm sure there will be a coach in the room with the double for Pete or Lana to sleep on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, there was no coach in Pete and Lana's room, which was several rooms away from Clark and Chloe. \"At least they won't be able to hear us talk about the plan.\" Lana thought. \" or get some alone time with Pete...\"the voice insisted. Before Lana could tell it to shut up again, Pete, who was now (awkwardly) lying next to Lana on the bed said, \"Wow.Weird coincidence that you and I have the same allergy, right? Are you sure you don't want me to sleep on the floor?\" \"No, we can be grown up about this, right? Besides this room has a hard floor. And there's one more thing...I lied about the mouse allergy, I just wanted to be able to talk to you about our plan again before tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of the plan, Pete's body stiffened. \"Look, Lana, about the plan...I'm sorry but I can't go through with it. I know we have been planning on breaking up Clark and Chloe for weeks, but...Clark and Chloe are my friends, and now I can see that they make each other really happy, I don't want to mess with that. Besides, I've finally started to get over Chloe anyway. I'll understand if your mad, but I just can't go thought with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, however, Lana wasn't that upset, and she just shrugged and said, \"You know what? I actually know what you mean. They do look happy together, and I think I'm finally starting to get over Clark.\" Only after she had spoken these words, Lana realized they were all true. And the reason for that revelation, the last bit anyway, was lying in bed right next to her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great then!\" Pete breathed a sigh of relief. He didn't think now would be a good time to mention it, but the only reason he had been able to get over Chloe was that he had fallen for Lana. Maybe, just maybe, she felt the same way too, but he would have to find out some other time, maybe tomorrow? \"Well, I guess we better get some sleep. We have a long. fun day planned tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, Pete.\" and with that, Lana and Pete quickly feel asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver that weekend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings turned out well for everyone that weekend, Predictably, Clark and Chloe frequently snuck of together in order to explore the amusement park, eat (mostly Chloe) and, well, make out in out of the way places. Pete and Lana were okay with that though because it gave them chances to be alone together. Eventually, they got to talking about how they had gotten over their old crushes so fast, and one thing led to another. By the end of the day, they had snuck in a couple of make-out sessions of their own. Lana decided she wouldn't tell the voice in her head to shut up anymore. Although things were a little more awkward for them that night at the hotel, the decided to take things slow and just get some sleep. However, they had decided that they were most definitely a couple now, and they would tell Clark and Chloe on Monday. Or Tuesday...As it turned out, school was canceled that Monday, and both couples got to spend some time alone that day. Furthermore, much to Clark's (and Chloe's) delight,between her time at the carnival and her feeding sessions with Clark on Monday, Chloe had put on another ten pounds! Deciding that her body was getting used to eating more, Chloe decided to up her food intake even more! By the end of he next month...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(note from supercode: in case you were wondering, the Jakelburg in this chapter is fictional)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   By the end of the next month, Chloe had put on a whooping 20 more pounds! Even Chloe was amazed at how fast she was gaining weight now! In the past, she had never considered herself very susceptible to peer pressure, but her growing appetite(and body) were clearly evidence that the blond haired teenager had been subconsciously  suppressing her appetite for food for years. She was sure glad that was over! Since her discovery of Clark's fat-loving tendencies had given her an excuse to indulge herself, Chloe had gained over 30 pounds in record time...and she couldn't be happier. Obviously, she had known that Clark would like her gain, but Chloe was surprised at how much she was enjoying it too! Chloe found that she really enjoyed eating whatever foods she wanted, fattening or not, whenever she wanted, and she was surprisingly enjoying the feeling of her softer, expanding form almost as much as Clark was! At first, Chloe had been afraid that her dad would try to step in and put her on a diet, but that had not happened. Although he had been concerned for his daughter when she had suddenly started overeating and putting on weight, he had left it alone when Chloe had explained to him that she was perfectly happy and was actually enjoying the results of her new eating habits. Although he did not understand that one bit, Chloe's dad just chalked it up to \"another teen faze\" and left Chloe alone. Secretly, he was a little relieved. After all, he wasn't a small guy, and if this meant Chloe wouldn't get on to him anymore on the rare occasions he cheated on his diet, he was all for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    So, Chloe was dating Clark, Pete and Chloe were okay with that, and both Clark and Chloe were enjoying Chloe's new eating habits and growing body. Chloe's life should have been perfect, except for two things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    First, some of her meaner peers at Smallville High were starting to tease Chloe about her weight, calling her names like \"Fatty\", \"Piggy\" or other \"original\" taunts that betrayed their limited vocabularies and intellect. Of course, Clark, Lana and Pete always had her back, and Chloe had never been bothered too much about what people thought of her. Still, it was extremely annoying when people started snorting in front of Chloe when she ate a snack or her daily big lunches at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The second problem bothered her more. Although Chloe loved Clark, and he seemed to be very attracted to her, Chloe was really starting to be bothered by Clark's bizarre comings and goings, and his constant inability to be where he said he would be...at least on time. Although she did not think Clark was, or would ever, cheat on her, she was still very irritated by these absences. Chloe had been Clark's girlfriend for more than 2 months, and she was starting to get upset by the fact that he wouldn't trust her enough to tell her what was going on. If she didn't find out what was going on soon, she would,,,Chloe just didn't know if things between her and Clark would work out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    However, something was going to happen today that just might turn things around. Today was a Friday, and Clark had asked her to meet him at his loft to tell her something very important! \"Maybe it's about whatever Clark has been hiding from me!\", Chloe hoped. Whatever the big secret was, Chloe Sullivan was about to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Chloe went to Clark's barn to find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chloe quickly learned that keeping up with Clark wasn't such an easy task. Chloe increased her caloric intake by 50% from what it had been just before they went to Jakelburg and during the first week of their new closeness Chloe only gained a couple more pounds. The more meals that she ate with Clark the greater the mystery grew. Chloe hadn't realized that since she now walked a lot more than she used to her metabolism had increased. All the extra food she consumed was being literally burned off before her body could transform it into the fat she craved. Determined to gain more weight over the next couple of weeks Chloe made sure that she ate at least twice as much of the same food as Clark did. Which was a considerable feat in itself, considering how much he sometimes ate. It did have the desired effect Chloe was seeking, SORT OF. Weighing herself on the 20th day of their new 'friendship' Chloe was thrilled to see that she had now gained an additional 20 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in nearly 2 weeks, Chloe looked closely at herself in a full-length mirror and was perplexed by what she saw. Chloe thought that with all the weight she had recently gained, her body shape should be much more pear-shaped than what she saw in her reflection. Clearly her waist, bust and hip expansion was happening, just much slower than she expected. Additionally, both her calves had visibly thickened out. Chloe didn't realize that there was definitely more muscle there than before. Her legs were becoming very well-toned from all the walking with (and running after) Clark. In her rush to gain weight, Chloe had neglected to consider the way increased physical activity would affect HOW she would gain weight. At least now she had the answer as to why the past few days she had suddenly started drawing wolf whistles in the hallways between classes. Those whistles had been an unexpected but very welcome boost to her self-image. Of course, Clark's many words of encouragement when they were alone didn't hurt her cause either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Chloe's body transform into a more feminine shape got Pete to wondering if he had made the right choice after all. Maybe all Chloe needed was some more meat on her bones he said to himself several times. A couple of them were inadvertently said out loud when Lana was close enough to hear. Which understandably didn't sit too well with her. Lana herself was noticing Chloe's changed silhouette attracting more attention from other boys at school. Every morning, Lana kept telling herself that she had made the right move to leave Clark to Chloe. However, her sub-conscious refused to accept that idea. It started to assert itself a week after the Jakelburg trip. Without ever realizing it, all of Lana's meals grew larger particularly with tasty, fattening foods.  She learned her weight was increasing a couple of weeks later at her semi-annual doctor's check-up. Her doctor asked Lana when she had changed her diet. Lana was stunned when she told her, her current weight. Lana had gained 10 pounds without ever realizing it! After leaving her doctor's office Lana now understood why all of her blouses and skirts had recently become a lot tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Driving home from her Doctor's office, Lana was still trying to sort out how on Earth she had gained 10 pounds without realizing it. A week after the trip to Jakelburg, Lana had had her usual monthly weigh-in at Smallville High and she had weighed her normal 108 pounds. Driving past Clark and Chloe walking together on Main street gets Lana to thinking. By now Chloe weighs close to 150 pounds and it's sure showing in unexpected ways. Her calves are now larger than ALL of the girls distance runners and other athletes. Her bust and hips have also expanded into a quite attractive roundness. For a few seconds there, Lana even considers asking Chloe for help with her 'growing' problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home Lana sees Pete patiently waiting for her. They had planned to go out that afternoon. Around forty minutes later while on their date, Lana again hears Pete make a favourable comment about Chloe's increasingly rounder figure. Inside she snaps but doesn't let on to Pete. Lana decides that since Clark appears more attracted to girls with Reubenesque figures, two can play at that game. She's going to steal Clark back from Chloe gaining even more weight than her, no matter how much that turns out to be. Knowing that she has a natural tendency to gain weight, Lana assumes that it shouldn't be too long before she grows bigger than Chloe. Shortly after Pete drops her off back home Lana, diligently goes through her pantry looking to see which fattening foods she needs to buy that evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Lana does is make a list of her clothes. Putting together a shopping list to duplicate several outfits she always wears with identical sets two, four and SIX sizes larger. She figures that way people (especially Chloe) won't notice her gaining weight so quickly. Fortunately for Lana she's still growing a little taller which her sudden high calorie meals helps along. Being over 30 pounds lighter than Chloe, it takes Lana over a month to catch up with Chloe when she weighs 190 pounds. All through this time, Lana has done her best to stay away from Clark and Chloe. Lana had decided at the start to surprise Clark with just how big she's grown when school breaks for Christmas vacation. Lana figures by then she should weigh well over 200 pounds. An unusually cold autumn really helps Lana hide her expanding frontier. All the girls at school are bundling up in very warm large coats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing an orphan, in the past the Kent's have always invited Lana to Thanksgiving dinner. So even though Clark is now dating Chloe, they decided that this year would be no exception. Lana is unsure about accepting. She's heard stories of just how big and voluptuous Chloe has recently become. She doesn't want Clark to see her until she has at least doubles her original weight. Knowing that Chloe will be there also doesn't help things. A couple of days before Thanksgiving Lana now weighing 204 pounds decides to accept the Kent's invitation. Shortly before 4 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day, Lana shows up having gained 100 pounds. When Lana takes off her coat, the Kent's and Chloe are stunned by Lana's much larger figure. Chloe's the first to say anything. She asks, \"My God Lana, what's happened to you? You've grown FAT.\" Lana replies, \"Look how's calling the kettle black. How much do you, now weigh Chloe? Since school started I've gained exactly 100 pounds. I now weigh 208 pounds. Even better, I've also grown over 3 inches taller.\" With a dejected look on her face Chloe replies, \"The last time I weighed myself I weighed 202 and I don't think I've grown any taller. However, THAT was on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Clark walks in from the barn. Seeing both girls in curve hugging clothes and catching the last part of the conversation about what they now weigh. As far as he's now concerned, Christmas came VERY early this year. A sudden bout of weakness in his legs causes Clark to fall with a thud. Every one's head then turns to him and the silly ear-to-ear grin he now wears. Trying to make some small talk Martha says, \"Lana, since Clark started dating Chloe, we haven't seen much of you lately.\" Chloe rudely jumps in saying, \"Ya, well you can't say THAT anymore.\" Lana then surprises herself by blushing a deep scarlet. Noticing Lana blushing, Martha Kent scolds Chloe for her uncalled for remark. Clark feigns being weak to get BOTH girls to help him stand up. He needs to see who is more eager to help. They arrive at him simultaneously and yank him up to his feet helping Clark to the dinner table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying grace, the two girls make short work of Martha's 30-pound turkey. Seeing the wishbone first, Lana lunges for it. Catching on to what was about to happen Chloe grabbed the other end and so they both pulled to see who would get their wish. Everyone except Clark is surprised when the wishbone doesn't break like it normally would. Clark hit it with his heat vision so it split in half meaning neither girl was a loser. After each girl inhales an entire pumpkin pie for dessert who does Clark invite outside for a stroll?</span></div></div>",

He's all alone so I might as well as stop by and say hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark looked over to both girls as they massaged their bloated bellies that still growled for more food somehow. \"Do you two want to tag along?\"<br>\r\nLana and Chloe eyed each other and knew that they couldn't let either one of them be alone with Clark in case the other one decided to make another move on him. \"Sure!\" They both responded and with that they heaved their fat bodies out of the chairs and out the door to where Clark was waiting by the barn. Chloe and Lana were confused when Clark further ushered them inside and sat down on a bale of hay. \"Okay so I'm going to be honest....I can't decide between the two of you because I love each of you and your bodies, I've loved both of you for a while but haven't been able to decide but I have an idea that may help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught the interest of both girls and they were curious as to what his idea might be. Lana spoke first and said,\"Well what did you have in mind?\" Chloe followed up and said, \"I want to know too but I wouldn't be opposed to it involving more food. Your mom's cooking is amazing as always and I feel so bloated but I wouldn't mind having some more.\" Lana nodded in agreement and Clark smiled at the two bloated beauties before him. \"I think we should take a break from trying to figure out our relationships and just enjoy each others company and whatever happens, happens. The other part of my idea is that Lex told me that he was working on weight gain and loss programs as a new business move and I thought why not use his new weight gain formula to increase your appetites. Because....well I'd kind of like the chance to feed both of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were unsure for a moment as they sat their massaging their stomachs and thinking it over.

The only food remaining on the Kent's Thanksgiving table is part of the pumpkin pie the Kent's shared. Deciding he needs some time alone to work things out Clark starts for the front door. Martha asked him, \"where are you going son?\" He replied, \"I think I'll go outside and walk off some of my dessert.\" Before Clark had even taken another step, his mother then asked, \"Clark aren't you going to ask someone to go walking with you?\" Clark then froze like a deer caught in a pair of headlights. However with Chloe and Lana's busts now staring right at him, Clark was right in the middle of two pairs of headlights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow faced with two pairs of pleading eyes, it's over two very long and tense minutes when Clark chickens out and foolishly said, \"Ah, mom.\" Both girls (now afraid that he'll choose the other and acting as if they could read each other's mind) before Clark can get another word out, they converge on him. Each girl grabbed an arm and with seemingly no effort by either of them, they physically carried Clark outside. He was only wearing his short sleeve shirt so he had to pretend to be freezing in the nearly freezing weather.

When Lana and Chloe had dashed outside with Clark, they hadn't stopped running until they had reached the Kent mailbox. He sees his parents standing on the porch bundled up against the cold looking out at him. Clark is now faced with the most important decision in his life so far and he knows it. He realized that Lana had deliberately gained 100 pounds because she still wants him.  Her newly well-rounded body is just as appealing to him as Chloe's. However Chloe has now been his girl-friend for awhile and he now feels more comfortable around her than Lana. But then again, he thinks, since his parents HAD deliberately invited Lana over for Thanksgiving dinner, even though he had split-up with her <i>she </i>was their choice for his girl-friend. So, to be fair to Lana, he should give her another chance to be his girl-friend. Clark's final thought before choosing was, \"It's too bad I'm not home on Krypton. Dr. Swan once mentioned that due to the over-abundance of women on Krypton it had been quite common that two, three or even four(!) girls would share a boy, just as long as they were all teenagers.</span></div></div>",

Lana now wrongly assumed that since Clark and her will now be going steady, and as traditional as he is, he would soon ask her to marry him. Logically the wedding would be right after they graduated next June. So Lana didn't want to waste any time planning her wedding. As popular as Clark is in school, Lana knows that ALL of the Senior girls will want to be her brides-maids. The Kent-Lang wedding could very well be the biggest wedding of the year, if not the decade, in Smallville. After all, she figures the bride will certainly be the BIGGEST in town. Lana planned to continue gaining weight. She would now concentrate on not only growing fatter but also becoming more muscular. Being a little mischievous, Lana decided that by dropping a few hints around Smallville High, she could start a serious weight gaining fad among the Senior girls. All she hinted at was that the girls she planned to choose as her brides-maids would HAVE to have at least a somewhat Ruben-esque figure by Easter. She figures that way only serious weight and muscle gainers need apply. After all, when Chloe had started becoming more muscular, she had started drawing a lot of wolf whistles. But that, of course, was before Clark had picked her as his girlfriend. Chloe instantly seconds Lana's idea for the brides-maids. She has her own SPECIAL reason for supporting Lana's idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana is ecstatic that <i>finally</i>, Clark had chosen her to be his girlfriend for real. However, she does look back with a lot of regret over all the time they could've been together had she not slimmed herself down so much to become much more popular in school. Chloe also is very happy for Lana. For although she had started gaining weight as a bet, it had started taking over her entire life. It seemed to her that her only pursuit in life had become getting fatter for Clark. He had been absolutely wonderful about her willingly gaining so much weight but during the past week or so, Chloe had sensed that something was bothering Clark. She had become concerned that maybe she had overdone it and gained too much weight for Clark's tastes. So now that Clark had chosen Lana, Chloe was actually relieved and so she decided that starting next Monday she would start working on getting rid of some of her excess baggage. She knows that she wont be losing the 1 1/2 inches in height she unexpectedly gained. However, she was determined to keep as much of her new muscular development as she possibly could. Chloe had now become interested in physical fitness. She started thinking that maybe she could use an increasingly very muscular body to help pay for college. After all, that fellow out in California had parlayed his body building career into a serious fortune and even got himself elected Governor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Clark woke up, Lana instantly started to seriously make out with him along the side on the lane. Chloe quickly excused herself, walked back to the Kent farmhouse and gave Clark's parents the good news. Martha's expression of surprise made Chloe's week. It did take her some time before the Kent's were really convinced that Chloe had no ill feelings about how things had turned out. After all, Martha said, \"I was the one that insisted Lana come over for Thanksgiving dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe then said, \"If it will make you feel any better about Clark's decision, how about I finish off that last pumpkin pie Mrs. Kent?\" Martha agreed that would be a good idea and then Chloe offered to do ALL of the Holiday dishes by herself. That task, Martha insisted she would help Chloe. Meanwhile, Jonathan was outside nervously watching the kids. He was concerned about what could happen to Lana if Clark would lose control. He needn't have worried. Clark made it abundantly clear to Lana that she would have to wait until their honeymoon before they would have sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much bigger does Lana grow, in her brand new role as Clark's girl-friend and presumptive fianc\u00e9e by New Year's Day?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following in Chloe's footsteps, literally, before the long holiday weekend is over, Lana quickly learns that keeping UP with Clark is quite a job. Minutes after Lana had said her good-bye to Clark on Thanksgiving Day she had decided that she wouldn't need to weigh herself every week. In fact, Lana decided to wait until after school had started in the New Year before she weighed herself again. So following Clark around at school and elsewhere in Smallville had its rewards. Although already popular in school once it got around that Clark and Lana were an item, her popularity skyrocketed. Within a week Lana was again buying new clothes. She was now so happy she didn't even bother to keep track of how much she now ate each day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween all of the flat-out running she now did daily trying to keep up with Clark and her work at the Talon, Lana's appetite doubled without her noticing or even caring just how big it was now. By the time Lana had ballooned up to be a size 16, she had started drawing, for the same reason as Chloe had earlier, the exact same wolf whistles in the High School hallways. Since everyone knew who her beau was, it was all in good natured fun. As Christmas approached, Lana continued growing bigger in every single way, including a little surprisingly her height. Christmas came and went as the old year wound down. After having Thanksgiving AND Christmas dinner at the Kent's, Lana eagerly looked forward to New Year's Eve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Chloe has found out that building a body full of muscle is not an easy task. Without the encouragement she had been receiving from Clark, Chloe's weight started dropping faster than she had expected. It quickly interfered with her plans to bulk up and grow a LOT stronger. So after two weeks of struggling Chloe admitted defeat and approached Lana. She asked Lana if she minded it if Chloe hung out with her, especially at meal-time. A person would've had to be totally blind to not notice Lana's rapidly growing frontier. It was also starting to become apparent that Lana was now gaining a lot of muscle along with fat in all the right places for a woman. Lana heartily agreed to help Chloe in her endeavor and they grew more muscular together. However at every meal, Lana ate increasingly larger portions than Chloe. By the time Christmas vacation started, Chloe was so satisfied with her progress she didn't hesitate at all, when Clark and Lana jointly asked her over to the Kent farm for Christmas dinner. A jolly old time was enjoyed by all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Chloe had left for home on Christmas, Martha pulled Lana aside. When she asked her to come over for New Year's, Martha really insisted that Lana bring something with her to stay the night in. There was no way on Earth that Martha OR Jonathan now would jeopardize Lana's safety. They realize that Clark would be devastated if anything bad now happened to Lana. Lana arrived shortly after noon on New Year's Eve and Clark was totally flabbergasted. On the advice of Clark's parents, Lana had coyly suggested that she didn't wanted to be sitting around in a crowd to ring in the New Year. Clark and erroneously assumed that she planned to stay alone in her apartment above the Talon. So after having eaten her biggest meal ever for dinner, Lana and the Kent's gathered around the television to watch the festivities from Times Square. It was only a little after 11:00 in Kansas and so after it was all over, Clark innocently enough asked Lana, \"How much do you weigh now?\" She replied, \"I honestly don't know Clark. Since we've been going steady, I haven't weighed myself even once. You know Clark, I'll go do it right now.\" She then asked Martha to come with her to help her figure out what her current measurements were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha took her tape measure with her to figure out how much Lana had grown. And boy had she. Lana was now fully 5 1/2 inches taller than when she was when school had started and with a bust already exceeding 50 inches with an absolutely fabulous size F, all of her bras would now have to be custom-made. It was a few minutes after Lana had gone upstairs when Clark and Jonathan heard a scream coming from a bathroom upstairs. It was Lana, she came down the stairs as fast as she could babbling, \"I did it, I did it.\" \"Did what?\" Clark asked. Lana replied, \"I broke your scale, Clark.\" He then replied, \"Lana you do know that that scale only goes up to 270 pounds.\" \"Yes I saw that. Isn't it wonderful? Clark, if I keep gaining weight like this, I'll probably weigh twice as much as you do by Easter!\" Lana was absolutely giddy over this unexpected news. A few minutes later, Martha came downstairs with 2 small overnight bags. When Jonathan asked her about them, She said that the kids should really ring in the New Year alone. Looking at how happy they both were he agreed and asked, \"Well, where should we go?\" Martha replied, \"I've got the perfect place picked out.\" And it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark then mentioned to Lana about the scale they have in the barn for weighing their cows. Lana teasingly says, \"OH HO, so you now think that I'm as BIG as a COW.\" The shocked look on Clark's face caused Lana to break up laughing. He then realized she was playing with him and they started getting a little frisky as Clark for the first time in his life got to second base. Lana then hugged Clark with all her might and he pretended that Lana had squeezed him to hard. It was for Lana's sake and the funny thing was she didn't stop squeezing. Her motor was now really getting revved up and this time she wasn't planning on taking, \"NO Lana, let's wait.\" from Clark. Clark only succeeded in getting put of his TIGHT predicament by convincing Lana to go out to the barn and learn her weight. She fainted from joy, when Clark told her that she now weighed 302 pounds. Less than 20 minutes later, Lana was stunned to wake up in her favorite silk nightgown tucked into bed in her apartment above the Talon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark was sitting in a chair out in the dining area. When she asked Clark how did she get there dressed as she was, he smiled and then told her that it was his little secret. He further said that he WILL tell her, how it had been done on their honeymoon. \"Honeymoon\" she said. \"Well yes Lana, that IS where you go after getting married.\" She started to cry and right then and there, Clark proposed to her just as the town clock struck Midnight. It was over 10 minutes later when they stopped kissing each other. Lana now wants to tell the whole town but Clark convinced her to wait until school restarts. Besides he said, I still need to get you an engagement ring. Lana then said, \"Clark darling, you don't need to do that. I'll be happy with whatever kind of wedding ring you get me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess I better fly solo until I can sort all of this out. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.\" As Clark walks back to his house, he is surprised to see that, not only are Chloe and Lana not saying anything, they also don't appear angry at Clark. Instead they just seem disappointed and perplexed by Clark's inability to chose between them. While Clark sits in his room before going to bed, he wonders what the days events will do to his relationship with his favorite large young women...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    That Weekend....<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     It was now the Saturday night before school started up again, and neither Chloe nor Lana had been talking to him since Thursday. Although Clark still thought he had done the right thing by being honest with the 2 girls, he missed them both a lot. Suddenly, Clark's thinking was disrupted by a knock on the door. He wondered who it could be, since both of his parents were out of town for the weekend and would not be back till Monday morning. Leaving his room, Clark headed downstairs and opened the door...and he was very surprised by what he saw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Both Chloe and Lana were there wearing very tight clothing which showed off their expanded  bodies, and it was obvious that both girls had gained at least 5 pounds! However, after his initial wave of excitement had left, Clark came back down to earth and said, \"Are you 2 here to try to make me choose again, because I still don't think I can do that?!\" After the 2 girls assured him that was not their intention, a perplexed Clark let them in the house.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    \"What is this about then?\" Clark asked. Chloe and Lana looked nervously at each other, then smiled before Lana replied with an awkward smile, \"Well, Chloe and I both had a lot of time to think after you left us out front on Thanksgiving, and after talking for a little while, we realized something. You see, we've all known each other for along time, and Chloe and I have been around you long enough to know that you are not a bad guy and that you really do care about both of us. Also, both of us care a lot about you and neither one of us wants to go without you so... after much deliberation, Chloe and I have decided something..\" Lana paused and started to look REALLY embarrassed, like she wanted to leave the room, before Chloe put her pudgy arm over Lana's large shoulders as a gesture of support, which REALLY confused Clark, and added, \"we decided that the three of us could all be adults about this and put past jealousies behind us...\" Clark was glad his two \"friends\" weren't going to hassle him about choosing one of them now, but he was still wondering were this was going to. Finally, Chloe clarified the issue for him, \"Lana and I decided that we were mature enough to share you, if that's alright with you of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Clark was almost numb with shock and had to pinch himself to make sure this was really happening to him. Maybe he didn't have to be on Krypton to have 2 hot girlfriends after all! After a long 3 minutes. Clark replied (as nonchalantly as he could manage under the present circumstances), \"Um, yeah! That would be great! That is, if you two are sure about this...\" Chloe and Lana nodded their heads, and Chloe added, \"As long as we don't catch you with anyone else, I think we can make this work!\" Clark nodded, he wasn't an idiot, and he would not  screw this awesome setup up by cheating on both Chloe and Lana! Besides, he really did care quite a bit for both girls, and he was glad he didn't have to hurt their feeling by choosing between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So...\" Lana began as both of the pleasantly plump young women gazed at Clark in a seductive manner, \"What should we do first?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After thinking it over for a few seconds, Clark decided to ask his two girlfriends to join him in the...<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

His facial reaction would let her have some idea of any fat-loving tendencies he might have. It would certainly explain why he'd never shown any interest. Even though she'd never been to a gym in her life and never gone on a diet, she'd still not put on any real weight in the past. In fact, she'd struggle if she ever did want to gain. But for Clark, it would be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, it even explained Clark's obsession with Lana a little better! Eight years ago, when Chloe moved to Smallville, Lana was quite a fat girl. Nothing extreme, maybe a hundred and eighty pounds or so. Still, it was pretty big. Martha Kent described her as 'Corn-fed' once. But she'd lost all that weight in order to join the cheerleading squad and then lost even more weight thanks to cheerleading practice.

She'd break the two hundred pound mark if he asked her to, just to see his smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark walked in to see Chloe sat at her desk, typing out a report for the Torch. When he caught her eye, she asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Clark. Do I look like I've gained to you?\" Chloe pulled her button down shirt up, off her belly. And it was a belly, too. Her stomach was distended, although still firm. She looked like she'd swallowed a bowling ball. No wonder she'd worn something loose today. But he really wished she hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet. It just looks like you've been eating well.\" Clark replied, earnestly. He didn't bother to mention that anyone but him would consider it a lot more than just eating *well*. \"Worried you might be losing?\" he asked. \"Or are you worried you might be gaining?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worried? Hardly! I could stand to gain a few pounds to be honest.\" Her photographer's eye, honed over years as the combination of Smallville High's News Editor, Chief Reporter and Sole Photographer, caught the sudden look on Clark's face as his eyes widened in surprise and he smiled instinctively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Clark Kent really did like the idea of Chloe Sullivan Plus? That was good to know. It was only a pity that she'd taken so long to see it.</span></div></div>",

Actually, I never really cared about the bet, I just wanted a decent excuse to get some feminine curves!\" She didn't mention how much food she had forced herself to eat to gain those five pounds that quickly,even having a big snack as soon as she got to the Torch, before Clark arrived. But it was worth it to see that look on Clark's face. Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe lifted up her shirt again, just for a few seconds this time. \"Are you sure I haven't gained to much? I was actually thinking of gaining a little more weight, but I wanted a second opinion from someone I trusted to be honest with me. So, what do you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark hesitated in his response this time, and for a moment, Chloe thought that she had overplayed her hand. Maybe she had been wrong, and Clark really didn't prefer fat girls! But after a moment Clark responded with a (poorly) disguised smile. \"No, I really think a little extra weight would look good on you.\" Then, feeling a little guilty for his self-serving response, he quickly added, \"But really, you should just do whatever makes you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright then, I guess I will! Thanks for being honest with me Clark!\" She then added, after a moment's hesitation, \"Would you keep on eye on this though?\" She quickly patted her stomach, \"i want you to tell me the second I start looking too chubby, ok?\" Clark gulped, \"Sure, I can do that!\" He replied with a little too much enthusiasm. He would watch her weight gain alright, but he had no intention of ever telling Chloe when she was getting fat. After all, that's what he secretly wanted to happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe smirked, If she was right about Clark's attraction to \"corn fed\" women, and she was pretty certain now that she was, he wouldn't tell her to lose weight anytime soon. However, he would have a good excuse to constantly admire her expanding figure, instead of Lana's now-skinny form, And if Chloe Sullivan had anything to say about it, she was going to be bigger that Lana had ever been before this was over! \"Great then, I have to get to class now, but I'll see you at lunch!\" With that, Chloe walked out of the Torch office, followed by Clark's admiring glances...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month had passed since Chloe's discovery at the Torch, and she had been exploiting Clark's fat-loving tendencies as much as she could since then in several ways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she ate until her stomach was full on a consistent basis, and she was ALWAYS eating when Clark was around, at lunch, snacking on Clark candy bars at the Torch, and anywhere else she saw the \"mysterious Clark Kent\". Needless to say Clark seemed to enjoy this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, she would wear tight clothes to school until she could no longer fit in them at all. Even so, with Chloe on her new \"fat-kins\" diet, she was moving though clothes sizes pretty quickly! Clark REALLY enjoyed this. Unfortunately , the rest of the school was starting to notice Chloe's gain as well, and some people had actually started to make fun of her behind her back. Although she was by no means fat, she was starting to get noticeably chubby. Chloe, being a reporter was well aware of these taunts, and she knew she had a decision to make.Either lose weigh and please her peers at Smallvile high, and their media-brainwashed standards of beauty OR please Clark by continuing her weigh gain, and let the taunting continue. Clark or the rest of the world? No contest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Chloe tried her boldest move in her plan so far! Driving up to the Kent farm one Saturday to get Clark's help on the Monday edition of her school paper, Chloe walked into the loft, were Clark had brought his laptop, wearing a completely new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Clark looked up to greet Chloe, his jaw nearly dropped to the floor. Chloe was wearing a rather revealing outfit: a pair of tight jeans showing off her newly expanded butt, waist and thighs and a shirt and top which left her belly completely exposed. And what a belly it was! Since Chloe has started overeating, she had developed a big, soft potbelly that was driving Clark wild!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming down a bit and trying to pretend nothing had happened, Clark told Chloe about the article he was planning on doing for the school paper, and Chloe offered to help him get started. They worked on it together for more than an hour. During that time, Clark found himself staring at Chloe's belly several times, before snapping out of it and bringing his eyes back to the article. Although Chloe enjoyed these admiring glances she was tired of playing dumb, and when Clark eyes roamed to her stomach again and then started journeying back to the computer, Chloe caught Clark's eyes on the way up! \"See something you like, Clark?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark panicked, he had been caught! However, Chloe did not press the issue. Instead, She simply walked away from Clark and said, \" I think you can take the article from here.\" But, before leaving the barn she walked right in front of Clark's sitting form, so he was eye level with her stomach, and playfully teased him, \"Remember to tell me when I'm getting too chubby Clark!\" Clark just gulped and nodded, he was too nervous to say anything. With that she walked away, saying a casual \"Hi.\" to Lana, who had just come to the the barn so Clark could help her with her science homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat neither Clark nor Chloe knew was that Lana had seen Chloe's attempt at flirting with Clark. She wasn't surprised that Chloe would flirt with Clark. After all, Chloe liked him, and he was technically fair game, since no one was dating him at the moment. What surprised her was the fact that Chloe's attempts had been successful enough to make Clark utterly speechless! How could Chloe do that to Clark when she was obviously very chubby now!? Then she remembered how enamored Clark looked at Chloe's new potbelly. And, now that she thought about it, hadn't Clark paid a disproportionate amount of attention to HER when she had been fat!? At the time, she had barely even known Clark, so it hadn't seemed that important. But now the pieces all clicked into place inside her head. Clark liked his girls fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this realization. Lana decided she should...</span></div></div>",

She knew she could try to gain weight too (after all, she had been pretty fat herself at one point) but she had worked hard to get her body into the shape it was in, and she didn't want to give that up. Besides, it was easier for Chloe, she had never cared much about what other people thought of her anyway! Lana, on the other hand...she had gotten used to being admired by others for her looked.  Furthermore, although Lana knew Clark liked her for more than her looks, she knew he could not really be happy being with if she did not gain weight.  Therefore, she decided that it was time to put Clark strictly into the \"friend\" category, and let whatever happened between him and Chloe, happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter greeting Clark, Lana let the farm boy help her with her science homework until she was finished. Before she left, however, Lana decided to clear the air. \"Hey Clark, there's something we need to talk about before I go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark was nervous, he did not know what this was about. \"Go ahead.\" \"Well, I know things have been really tense between us lately, so after a lot of thought, I have decided that it is just better for us to stay friends, I hope you can deal with that, because I really don't want to lose you as a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark was surprised, but weirdly, not that disappointed . He knew he should have been devastated over what Lana had just said...but he was secretly relieved. Although he still liked Lana, he had been developing feelings for Chloe recently as well, and he had started to feel guilty for staring at the blonde's expanding figure. However, not that Lana had just labeled Clark as a \"friend\", he realized he had no reason to feel guilty anymore! Who knows, he may just decide to pursue Chloe Sullivan now after all. \"You know what? I'm okay with that. Things just weren't working out with when we  were a couple anyway. Still, hope to see you around, and if you ever need a friend to talk to, I'm here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana smiled. That had gone better than expected! Despite the fact that she still had some nagging feelings for Clark Kent, he had been right to say that a relationship between them just couldn't work. Besides, now she felt free to look at other possible dating options. \"Great then! I'll see you around!\" And with that, Lana Lang left the Kent barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Several months later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past three months or so. Chloe Sullivan's growth had slowed down...but not stopped! Although it had started to appear that she had hit a wall in her weight gain, Chloe had been determined to break through it! With the addition of midnight snacks and a second lunch (which she snuck into her mouth during her boring 7th period class) to her already heavy diet, Chloe Sullivan was still slowly growing outward! Of course, by this point her frame had gone from slim to very chubby/borderline fat, and some of the meaner students at Smallvile High had started to openly tease her about her expanding waistline and \"unconventional\" eating habits. Even Pete,who was worried for his friend, had taken her aside and said, as politely as he could, that \"you might want to ease up on your snacking just a little bit.\" Chloe had reacted to all such taunts and comments by playing dumb or (if the commenting individual seemed to mean well) saying, \"Thanks for your concern, but I'm happy with how things are now, thanks\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark had, of course, been very impressed with Chloe's fattening body, and had actually started dating her two weeks ago! To Chloe Sullivan, that was worth all the taunting in the world! However, Chloe Sullivan was slowly starting to realize there was a problem with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, Chloe...</span></div></div>",

At first, it had just been about trying to fatten up to attract Clark's attention, but as time had gone on, Chloe had become addicted to her late night binges, extra portions, all you can eat buffet's, second lunches and regular between-meal snacks. By the end of each day, Chloe was left feeling thoroughly stuffed, and her stomach was full to bursting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such evening, Chloe had gone round to the Kent's for dinner, and had extra large portions of everything they had put on the table. Martha Kent had actually started making extra food just for Chloe's visits, something that had delighted Chloe. During dinner, Chloe ate more than anyone else at the table, and by the end, was feeling incredibly full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mrs. Kent,\" Chloe groaned as she finally put down her knife and fork, and suppressed a belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Kent's cleaned up, Clark and Chloe rose from the table and headed to Clark's room in the barn. Chloe was actually having some difficulty walking. She had already had two lunches, and had snacked on about ten chocolate bars and muffins throughout the day, as well as starting off with an enormous, greasy breakfast. Her overindulgence at dinner had filled her to bursting point, and her belly, usually large, but flabby, was now enormous and bloated, peeking out from under her button up shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark, I think I might have overdone it today,\" Chloe groaned as she and Clark climbed the ladder to his room, each step causing her larger thighs to rub together, and her bloated belly to push against her tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the top, Clark laid a hand on Chloe's distended belly and gave it a rub. \"You do look pretty full,\" he said, with a smile. \"Maybe you should sit down and have a rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Chloe said. \"I can barely move when I'm like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe walked to Clark's sofa. Chloe had been going through clothes pretty quickly in the past several months, and was outgrowing outfits every few weeks. There had been many times when she had found her size 'S' clothing tearing open at the end of a long day, or her new jeans popping open after a big lunch. Now, she was wearing a size 'L', which she found to be quite loose on her chubby body, and give her some more breathing room. At the moment though, that wasn't the case, and her clothes felt skin tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chloe sat down on the sofa with a tired groan...</span></div></div>",

Her bloated gut pressed up against her shirt and jeans, and pushed them to their limits. Suddenly, Chloe heard several loud popping noises, and looked down to see the buttons on her shirt exploding off before her eyes. The buttons flew off around the room, until every last one of them had been blown apart, leaving her chest and stomach fully exposed. She got a good look at her huge, round, bloated belly, which pushed out beneath her breasts like a beach ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Chloe heard a snap, and although she could not see past her belly, she knew that her jeans had just burst open, because she felt an immense amount of pressure being relieved on her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark had heard the noises, and turned around just in time to see Chloe lay both hands on her exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh...\" Chloe gave a moan as she rubbed her concave stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Clark gasped. \"Chloe, you really did overdo it tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at Clark, she saw him smiling down at her exposed form, and she grinned in return, and began rubbing her belly very deliberately. Chloe arched her shoulders, and let her shirt slip down her arms, then kicked her jeans off, so she was sitting only in her underwear. She lay on her back, sticking her massive belly in the air. As she did so, she got a good view of her breasts, which were threatening to outgrow her latest bra. They had gotten much larger lately too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo Clark...I'm so full...can you rub my belly for me?\" Chloe said in her sexiest voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark didn't need to be told twice. He rushed over to Chloe and began to massage her bloated gut, kissing her as he did so.

Furthermore, since Chloe had been wearing  too-tight S sizes clothes until they could no longer physically fit on her frame, she had not realized that she was now too big too fit COMFORTABLY into size L clothes, which she didn't even have in large supply anyway! It was official, she had to go shopping soon, and she had to get clothes that would be loose on her (at least for now) so she could go awhile before replacing them. There was just one problem: She had no money!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending money on all the food she had been snacking on, and the few bits of L sized clothing she did own, Chloe Sullivan was pretty much broke!

Even though her weight gain had started simply as an attempt to attract Clark, she had to admit that she was starting to enjoy her new eating habits, and the resulting expansion of her body! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe Sullivan finally brought out a few sets of clothes that she could grow into over time.

She was disappointed at Clark's response, although she could not say why. That's what she had wanted Clark to say, right? Then the images from her dream came, unbidden, into her mind. She knew that being that big in the real world would be impractical, to say the least, but part of her still found the idea of being able to let go and just eat and be taken care of attractive. She pushed the images out of her mind. That was an absurd idea! How could she be a world-class reporter if she was so big she could barely move! Besides, she was still a long way from being a size 30, so she would still have plenty of time to enjoy herself and eat whatever she wanted! Still, she couldn't hide a tinge of disappointment from her voice when she replied to Clark, \"Yeah, that sounds reasonable,...I guess. I mean, I wouldn't want to be as big as a circus fat lady or something, right?!\" Before Clark could dwell on THAT mental image, she added, \"but hey, let's get something to eat!

Clark had a medium sized plate of chicken and steamed rice, while Chloe loaded three huge plates with almost every item on the menu, including different types of sushi, chicken, noodles, heavily oiled vegetables, fried and steamed rice, and several desserts! To her astonishment, and Clark's delight she was still hungry when she was done, so Chloe had Clark bring her another round of food, almost twice as big as her first! She gulped down about half that amount quickly...before her stomach started to feel full. But Chloe was determined to eat it all! Watching Clark's admiring glances, and rubbing her increasingly stuffed (but seemingly bottomless?) belly, she slowly worked her way though the rest of the food, until there was only a single dessert left on her plate. By this point, Chloe felt like she could not eat anymore...but that chocolaty dish just looked too good to pass up, so she somehow forced herself to eat that too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Chloe finally   stopped eating, and began to rub her very swollen belly while Clark watched in appreciation.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    The tiny wooden chair, obviously not built for Chloe's new stocky frame, suddenly broke into little pieces underneath Chloe! For several moments, Chloe just sat there, too stunned too move. When she finally did try to get up, she found that  her stomach was to stuffed to allow her to sit up on her own, let alone stand! Thankfully, Clark was able to help her up and the owner, looking very embarrassed and apologetic, made sure Chloe was ok. He even offered to pay for her and Clark's meal as compensation for any embarrassment  his restaurant's  \"flimsy furniture\" may have caused them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    However, Chloe was still mortified. How had she allowed herself to eat so much food that she had broken a chair and couldn't get up!? Then the answer came too her...she was addicted to overeating ALL the time! That wasn't a problem though, right? \"Not as long as you can STOP eating once you hit size 30! After that, you'll be too big even for Clark!\", a voice in Chloe's head responded. She immediately decided that was a ridiculous thought, and resolved to prove to herself that see could stop eating whenever she wanted. In fact, she wouldn't eat for another twelve hours! It shouldn't be that hard after a binge like that, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Several hours later...</b><br>\r\n <br>\r\n   It was ten p.m, and Chloe finally drifted to sleep after an hour of tossing in turning in her bed, trying to ignore her loudly growling stomach. She didn't normally go to bed this early on a Saturday, but the days events had made her tired.Chloe Sullivan drifted of into dreamland. Unfortunately, she would not rest peacefully tonight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    In her dream, Chloe Sullivan was once again the morbidly obese version of herself she had been in her last dream, but now she was naked in front of every student in Smallville High! She was naked because she had just burst out of her very large clothes, and now everyone in the school was pointing and laughing at her, even Clark Kent! Clark  then proceeded to walk up to her and said, \"I said I wanted a big girl, not a whale! We're through!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Mercifully, that was were the dream ended. Chloe woke up in a cold sweat and was mortified to discover that she was ravenously hungry! Unable to fight her cravings any longer, Chloe raided her fridge, emptying out most of its contents, and ate EVERYTHING. Feeling ashamed for her lack of self control, Chloe forced herself to her scale. She was horrified to discover she had gained five pounds since she had gone to bed! How long ago had that been, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe glanced at her clock, it was only 11 PM. She hadn't even been able to stop overeating for 10 hours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Chloe Sullivan was afraid now, Afraid of losing Clark. Afraid of losing control of her eating and her body's expansion. Afraid she might become a lonely, immobile blimp that no one could ever love. Although she was not usually one to break down, Chloe cried herself to sleep that night,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>               The next day, Chloe Sullivan stayed home, and refused to see anyone. Because her dad was forced to work that weekend she did not even get out of bed in the morning! She simply ignored phone calls from Clark, or any of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Needless to say, this upset Clark, who was perplexed by his hefty girlfriend's behavior. After Chloe ignored four of his phone calls, Clark decided enough was enough, and super speed over to Chloe's house! At the time, his parents were using both of the Kent family's vehicles, and Clark was so worried that something was wrong, he did not even bother to think how he would explain his presence at the Sullivan house, which was 5 miles from the Kent farm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Once Clark arrived at Chloe's house, he noticed that her car was in her garage, and began to knock incessantly on her front door. Finally, after about a minute of knocking, Chloe yelled, \"Go away!\" to the annoying intruder. Clark was undaunted, however. \"Chloe, is that you? I thought something bad had happened to you! What's going on, and why didn't you answer your phone?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Chloe sighed. Although she did not want to see anyone right now, she knew she would have to speak to Clark about what was bothering her eventually. With a sigh, the now plus-size Chloe pulled herself out of bed, changed into some of her new, larger clothes, and dragged herself to the door, where she greeted a very worried Clark Kent. \"Alright, I guess we do need to talk. Come inside and I will tell you what was going on.\" Clark could tell that something was wrong with Chloe right away but he did as he was asked and sat next to her on her living room sofa and waited for his girlfriend to talk. \"I blame you!\" Chloe pointed at Clark, who was now VERY confused!  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   He responded. \"Blame me for what?! Why didn't you want to talk to me?!\" \"Because your encouragement is making me FAT, Clark! And now, I can't stop eating, even if I try to!\" Clark raised his eyebrow. He knew what Chloe was saying was true, but he thought that she was completely fine with her new eating habits and continual expansion. In fact, he thought she was enjoying them as much as he was! \"Why is this a problem all of a sudden?\" Clark asked in almost a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Because I'm not sure I'll be able to stop once I hit a size 30! After I pass that, not even you will want me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Oh. Clark realized now, that he had made a mistake. One he needed to rectify immediately. \"Yeah...about that. I lied. I only set a size 30 limit so you wouldn't freak out and think I was trying to make you immobile or something. You can get as big as you want! You could become the world's....\" . Clark hesitated to use the word, but decided to anyway, so the full effect of his words could sink in, \"FATTEST women, and I would still be in love with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           Chloe was shocked and relieved at the same time. \"Your in love with me?!\" Clark just nodded, he couldn't believe he had just admitted that aloud! \"And you really don't care if I get above size 30?!\" \"nope.\", Clark responded simply. Not knowing how to react, Chloe slapped Clark, who immediately rolled with the blow so he would not break Chloe's hand. \"That's for lying to me and making me doubt myself! And this...\" Chloe kissed Clark before he realized what was going on,\" is for telling the truth! And in case you haven't figured it out yet, I love you too, you brilliant, stupid farm boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Before the couple could lean in for another kiss Chloe realized something. When she had greeted Clark on the porch, neither of his family's cars had been there. \"Clark, how did you get here? I only saw my car in the driveway, and your house is 5 miles from mine!\" <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n        Clark froze. In his rush to see if Chloe was okay, he had forgotten that using his super speed might raise suspicion. How could he have been so stupid! Clark knew he couldn't keep his secret from his reporter girlfriend forever. But that wouldn't stop his from trying to cover his tracks now! \"Um...I ran here. I was worried about you, Chloe!\" Chloe raised her eyebrows. Today had been a very hot day, and five miles was a long way to run in this heat! Chloe inspected Clark and noticed that he did not have a drop of sweat on him, either....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  AFTER SEVER MINUTES....<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had no other explanation for his speedy arrival at her house and decided not to force the issue. The look of suspicion on her face turned to a smile, and she wrapped her arms around Clark, grinning as he squeezed her back. All her thoughts about ending up obese and unloved faded away at Clark's loving embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Clark,\" Chloe said. \"I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe let her hands drift down to her bulging midsection, which she rubbed delicately in a circular motion. She was all too aware of the fact that Clark liked it when she played with her growing pot belly. She gave it a decisive pat, and walked into the kitchen, Clark following close behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe walked to the freezer and bent over, deliberately pointing her sizeable butt in Clark's direction, smiling to herself as she rummaged through the freezer drawers looking for her prize. Finally, she found what she was looking for, a jumbo tub of chocolate ice cream. She rose up, and knocked the freezer door shut with her round butt. Clark grinned as he watched the display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Clark, what's your favourite part about watching me eat?\" Chloe asked, genuinely curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...my favourite part?\" Clark stuttered. \"Erm...well...I...I love it when you burst out of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark blushed slightly, as she took a large spoon from the kitchen drawer. \"When I burst out of something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...you know what I mean, when you get so full the button on your pants busts open,\" Clark explained, looking excited. \"Or like last week when you sat down after that king size lasagne you ate and your shirt ripped open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe giggled. \"I kinda enjoyed that too...okay Clark, let's see if I can't burst out of a few things for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark looked on eagerly as Chloe opened the ice cream tub and dug the spoon in...it was going to be one hell of a week for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ONE WEEK LATER</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next week, Chloe worked on fulfilling Clark's favourite fantasies. Every day, she stuffed herself full to bursting point, eating everything in sight, always asking for more and always finishing every last scrap of food on her plate. Chloe Sullivan had become an eating machine, always ravenous for more. Always determined to please Clark, and herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Chloe had been letting Clark down somewhat, in that she hadn't burst out of a single piece of clothing all week. She was gaining weight quite rapidly, but her recently purchased clothing was relatively loose compared to her old outfits. She would have tried one of them on, but she had thrown most of her old stuff out after she started getting bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Saturday morning rolled round, Chloe woke up late, still tired after a night of heaving binging at Clark's house. She gave a groan and rubbed her eyes, then swung her body out of bed. She ran her hands up he thicker legs, chunky thighs and over her bulging stomach, before giving her sizeable breasts a squeeze. She the went to the bathroom, her body jiggling somewhat as she walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see how much I've managed to pack away this week...\" Chloe yawned and stepped onto the bathroom scale. Much to her amazement, she could somehow gained twenty whole pounds in one week! \"Oh my God! Twenty pounds! Twenty pounds?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe could hardly believe it. She gave her chubby belly a squeeze and smiled. \"Nice work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Chloe heard a knocking at the front door...</span></div></div>",

So, I'm free today.Is your dad home?\" Chloe shook her head. As usual, Gabe Sullivan had to work on Saturday. Clark grinned mischievously, \"Want to hang out and do something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Chloe got his drift and grinned right back while massaging her increasingly plump pot belly. \"Sure! But in case you haven't noticed, I'm still in my pajamas. I'll go shower and get ready, then we can do something...fun. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Clark nodded in agreement, then decided to watch T.V while his girlfriend was getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        After Chloe Sullivan was ready for her day. She came out to meet Clark in a tight shirt and her tightest pair of pants. showing off every inch of her expanding body and leaving very little to the imagination! Luring Clark toward the kitchen with a come-hither look, the blond haired teen lured Clark into the kitchen where she quickly heated up an assorted variety of pastries (donuts, danishes, cinnamon rolls, etc.) big enough to feed a large family!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Clark eyed her with curiosity. \"I already ate, who are these for?\" Chloe smiled at him and replied in the most flirtatious voice she could manage. \"Me. I. am. starving!\" She was careful to accent every syllable of that statement as she handed the box to a VERY excited Clark. \"Do you want to feed them to me?\" Clark could only nod enthusiastically, as he was too excited to speak. Without a word Clark feed Chloe the pastries for over an hour. True to her word, Chloe Sullivan had been EXTREMELY hungry, and managed to eat all of the pastries without too much effort, even licking the extra frosting of off the platter! Even Chloe was surprised she had been able to eat the whole platter of goodies\" \"Wow.\" Chloe thought to herself as she rubbed her extremely large and stuffed belly. \"I knew I could really put food away now, but this is crazy! How did I get to be such an eating machine?!\" As Clark watched in fascination as her girlfriend rubbed her large belly, Chloe came to a sudden realization. \"I have been stuffing myself so often now, that I have gotten used to it! I couldn't stop gorging myself 24/7 or slow down my weight gain if I wanted to!\" But Chloe knew for certain now that she would never want to stop. Confident in Clark's continuing affections, enjoying her new eating habits a great deal, and strangely, loving how her continued weight gain continued to make her body bigger and softer, the blond haired reporter knew she would continue eating and gaining weight no matter how big she got...and she would love every minute of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As if to reinforce that point, the buttons suddenly flew off Chloe's clothes as her jeans came unzipped and her shirt practically burst off her body, once again leaving Chloe Sullivan in little more than her underwear! Far from being embarrassed, both Clark and Chloe enjoyed the event a great deal! As Chloe began to pat and rub her belly seductively, Clark lost control and began kissing Chloe's bloated stomach, which made Chloe feel absolutely amazing!\" The last thought Chloe had before she fell asleep in a food induced stupor was \"Funny thing. They say that inside every fat person is a thin one trying to get out! But from the way things are going I would say that outside this...\" Chloe smiled as she patted her engorged pot belly, \"not so thin girl is a very  FAT girl trying to get in! And that's just fine with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  A couple hours later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Chloe Sullivan woke up to find that Clark was... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't use to take such frequent naps, but as her appetite grew more insatiable and her stuffing sessions grew more frequent and lengthy, she found herself getting tired quite quickly. She had slept for a few hours, and as she sat up in bed, she found herself looking slightly less bloated than she had been earlier. She rubbed a hand over her large, round belly, noting it's softness was returning. Chloe had to admit, she preferred the feeling of a full, bloated belly to an empty one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to her side, expecting to see Clark, but to her surprise, the farm boy was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he was already awake? Chloe swung her legs out of bed and gave a stretch, then stood up, causing her body to jiggle. Hopping out of bed wasn't quite as easy as it used to be, but it was always fun to watch her big belly jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe, not bothering to get dressed, walked into the kitchen in only her underwear, enjoying having her growing body exposed. She knew that Clark had enjoyed her little surprise for him last night - it had taken a week of total and utter gorging to outgrow her clothes, but it had been worth it just to see the look on her new boyfriend's face. It was hard to believe she had gained a full twenty pounds during the week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark? Are you here?\" Chloe called. \"Weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming Clark wasn't in, Chloe glanced at the clock and noticed it was 12:00. She had slept longer than she thought...and it was time for lunch! She walked over to the cupboards, but when she looked inside, she found them empty - last night's stuffing session seemed to have cleared her out. She walked to the fridge, which was similarly empty, but seemed well stocked on cheese, one of Chloe's favourites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a loaf of bread, Chloe decided to make grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch - she found that they usually filled her up quite nicely. She switched on the grill and began making the sandwiches, putting slice after slice of bread under the hot grill until the entire loaf was gone and she had a plate piled high with about 13 cheese filled snacks. She smiled as she took the plate and put it on the table. She grabbed a chair and sat down, her big belly falling neatly into her lap, touching the underside of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she chowed down, Chloe couldn't help but wonder where Clark was. It wasn't a school night, and he hadn't told her he had plans in the morning...unless he forgot something and didn't want to wake her? Nah, that wasn't it. Chloe had almost forgotten, but now that she thought about it, she realised that Clark did, indeed, have a habit of disappearing at unusual times. It had been a contributing factor to his and Lana's relationship ending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>ONE HOUR LATER</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later, and Chloe was done with her lunch. She had eaten every last bit of food on her plate, and was currently feeling so full she could hardly move. That was the way she liked it. She felt her belly touching the table and pushed her chair back slightly, looking down at her massively bloated stomach happily. She gave her belly a pat, as if to congratulate herself on another stuffing session, then began to rub the sides of her bloated gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

He had been watching T.V. while Chloe was asleep, and had seen a report on the the news about a mysterious individual who was on a rampage attacking teenagers in Smallville that the police were, so far, unable to apprehend. Guessing that it might be a meteor freak, Clark had gone to investigate, hoping to be back before Chloe woke up. Fortunately, the \"freak\" had been rather easy to incapacitate after Clark found him. Unfortunately, he had also been smarter and more elusive than most of the super powered thugs Clark had faced, and it had taken hours of patrolling the Smallville-Metropolis at super-speed to find him. And so, Clark had returned hours later than he had intended to the Sullivan home, only to find Chloe very much awake, wearing a suspicious look on her face and her hands firmly crossed over her chest. Although Clark had disappeared on her before, Chloe had always let it go once Clark returned, but he could already tell that his reporter girlfriend would not be so easy on him this time. He thought about coming up with a lame excuse for his absence, but wisely chose to let Chloe speak first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Chloe was indeed upset, but she decided not to give Clark the third degree right away, Instead, she would make Clark sorry for leaving by telling him what he missed, then give him a chance to explain himself. \"You missed me stuffing myself at lunch today, Clark. I ate a whole loaf of cheese sandwiches. I was sitting there thinking, 'Oh, I wish someone was here to feed me these delicious sandwiches, but no one was there!\" Clark looked down to see Chloe's bloated belly, which Chloe immediately hid (as much as she could, anyway) from Clark's sight to express her displeasure at his absence. \"Why weren't you her Clark? Where were you? And don't try to tell me you were just running an errand in town or checking up on your farm, because both of those places are several miles away, and your car was here the whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Clark gulped. He guessed this moment would come sooner or later. After all, Lana had eventually gotten on to him about his absences when he had been dating her, and despite her intelligence, that girl hadn't even been a reporter! However,  he hadn't expected Chloe to start getting suspicious so soon! He quickly though about making an excuse that Pete had picked him up to hang out with him, but both Clark and Chloe knew that a Kent would never just up and leave someone they cared about without telling them were they were going unless there was an emergency, so that was out. Finally, after mulling it over for several seconds, Clark decided to tell her the truth. He wasn't about to lose Chloe like he lost Lana, in the heavy veil of deception he had made to protect his secret. He had even told his parents that he intended to tell Chloe his secret eventually anyway, since he wanted Chloe to trust him and because he knew that if he didn't, Chloe's reporter mind would figure it out on its own eventually. And so, although it was much sooner than Clark had planned to do it, he decided to tell her the truth...one step at a time. Chloe was starting to look impatient, so Clark started decided to just come out with it. \" I saw on the news that someone was terrorizing people downtown, and it sounded like a meteor freak, so I rand down there to stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    At first ,Chloe thought Clark was lying to her. Why would Clark go after a meteor freak on his own, and on foot no less! But from the look in his eyes, Chloe could tell her boyfriend was telling the truth. Despite Clark's experience keeping his secret, whatever it was, he had never gotten good at lying. \"Clark, are you crazy!? Why didn't you wake me up so we could go down there together?! I know I was in a stupor from all that food, but I could have still woken up to help you, instead of you going into the fire by yourself!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    \"It's ok.\" Clark replied. \"I took care of him, he's in Smalliville prison now, in the special solitary wing they have for,,,what do they call meteor freaks again? Oh yeah, \"abnormals\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Chloe had to admit, she was impressed. She wouldn't believe Clark if he wasn't looking her right in the eye while he was talking to her. \"Well, that's great Clark, but you got lucky. That guy could have killed you! And where would your family, and Pete and I have been then?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It wouldn't have been that easy for him to kill me, Chloe.\" Clark spoke calmly. Before his girlfriend could ask what he meant by that statement, Clark super-sped behind Chloe and added, \"I have some tricks off my own!\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Chloe Sullivan slowly turned around and put her hand up to her gasping mouth. It all made since to her now! She understood why Clark wouldn't want to tell her what was going on when he disappeared, after all, she had done a lot of reporting on meteor freaks before, and she could understand Clark not wanting that kind of public exposure. \"Oh, I get it! You're a meteor...\" Chloe wisely chose not to use the world \"freak\", \"infected person, right. That's what you didn't want me to know all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Clark almost left at that, but decided to tell the whole truth. \"Not exactly. I wasn't infected by the meteor rocks. I sort of came down with them.\" As Chloe starred at him wide-eyed, Clark added lamely, \"in a spaceship. I've had special abilities for awhile, a lot more than just speed by the way,  but even I didn't know that until my adoptive parents told me a couple years ago, and showed me my spaceship.\" Clark had hoped Chloe would be understanding, but even he did not expect what happened next. Chloe smiled. \"That is so cool! It explains everything! Your disappearances, the cave walls, the weird symbol on your barn, everything!\" Far from being upset, Chloe looked like she could barely contain your excitement! \"I mean, how many girls can say they have a super-powered alien as a boyfriend!? Are there any more of you on earth?! Can I see you spaceship!? Don't worry, I won't tell anyone anything, I just want to learn more about you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Clark looked down and sighed. He was glad Chloe was taking this so well, but she had unintentionally reminded Clark of his  specie's failures, and his own. \"No, I think i\"m the last of my kind, my parents sent me in that ship to save me from our dying planet. Don't ask me to explain that, because I don't know much else, and how I came upon that knowledge is a long story I'll tell you later. And I'm afraid you can't see the spaceship because I sort of blew it up, for reasons too complicated to get into now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Oh, I'm so sorry, Clark!\" Chloe went in close to Clark to hug him, her anger at him completely forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Thanks, Chloe.\" Clark said while hugging Chloe back, \"But it's something I have learned to live with. I just wanted you too know the truth. So, you're ok with all this? You aren't mad at me anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Of course it's okay! And no, I'm not mad, but don't ever run to someone's rescue without telling me again, or else you wont get to see any of this...\" Chloe revealed her still bloated stomach to Clark once more \"for a while. Okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Clark nodded enthusiastically, then reached over to rub Chloe's enlarged belly before pulling her in for a kiss.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n               Neither one of them left the room for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 By the time summer vacation rolls around, Chloe has gained another...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>        30 pounds! Unbelievably, Chloe Sullivan's gluttonous eating habits, lovingly encouraged by her boyfriend from another planet, Clark Kent, had plumped Chloe up another 30 pounds within just a few months! All in all, Chloe Sullivan had gained well over 60 pounds from moment she had made that fateful bet with Pete until the start of summer vacation! Now considered fat by most people, Chloe Sullivan was nonetheless undaunted in her continued efforts to overeat and gain weight! However, despite Chloe Sullivan's general disregard for public opinion, she was still nervous about the trip that she and Clark had planned to take to a beach in another state to celebrate the beginning of summer vacation. Surprisingly, convincing her father had not been a big issue, since Gable Sullivan knew about Clark Kent's generally positive reputation, and trusted him to take care of his daughter. Therefore, he had grudgingly agreed to let Chloe and Clark go on the weekend trip after Clark promised to\" take care of her\", and \"not to let her out of sight\". The Kent's were not so easy to convince. Years of living in a small town had made both of them more conservative in their values than Gabe Sullivan, especially Jonathan Kent, who had been born and raised in Smallville. However, in the end, the couple had convince both of the elder Kents, first Martha, then Jonathan, that the two of them were grown-up enough to take a trip like this on their own and make their own decisions. After all, they would be Seniors next year!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    No, what made Chloe nervous was the though of showing off her (relatively) new body at the beach they were traveling too. Chloe had wanted to wear a one-piece bathing suit to the beach, but Clark had strongly suggested that she should buy a bikini in her size(no longer an issue task!) since she had always worn one while swimming before. Chloe Sullivan understood Clark's point: Her larger body was nothing to be ashamed of, so why hide it? However, the blond haired teenager had to admit, she was a little afraid to show off her new,fat body in front of everyone. It was one thing to let Clark see her larger form, but it was something else entirely to willingly let others put her under that level of scrutiny, and Chloe was a little afraid of what people would say. Nevertheless, Chloe gave in to Clark's request and bought a bikini in order to show she would not let other people's opinions influence her she hoped it would be the right choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                               That day at the beach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         At first, everything went pretty well. Oh, there were a few stares. And a couple people pointed and whispered to each other about \"the fat girl in THAT bathing suit\" behind Chloe's back. However, for the most part, people seemed to be too busy having fun at the beach too direct hostility toward a large Chloe Sullivan walking around on the beach in a bikini next to her muscular boyfriend, who was buying her a bunch of food at the snack bar while tying not to stare at his girlfriend's large exposed belly and barely exposed butt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      However, as Chloe was walking with an ice cream cone in one hand while  catching up to Clark, who had almost reached the beach blanket the couple had laid down on the sand, Chloe Sullivan heard a comment she decided she could not ignore coming from another blond-haired teenager on the beach! \"You see..\" spoke the tactless youth to her friend while pointing directly at Chloe, \"that's why I can't let myself eat the carbohydrates  or sweets I love so much. I don't want to become a whale like her!\" Chloe looked right at the rude, clearly anorexic girl seated next to her brunette friend, and called out to her boyfriend, \"Hey, Clark, can you set that food down and come over here for a second?\" Clark quickly complied, although he did not know what Chloe had planned. Before he knew it, Chloe was kissing Clark right in front of the teenager who had made the snide remark, and Chloe made sure both of the other girls could see it, making the kiss last five seconds long to make clear that her boyfriend was willfully kissing her back. Both of the seated teens looked shocked that a girl Chloe's size could have a boyfriend that looked like Clark. But Chloe was not done yet! Positioning herself uncomfortably close to the face of the loud-mouthed blond sitting next to her friend, Chloe Sullivan brought the triple-scoop ice cream cone she had been holding up to her lips and  gave it a long,slow lick that covered the entire surface area of the ice cream! \"Oh,SOOOOO good!\" Chloe taunted the anorexic girl dramatically before walking away arm in arm with a slightly-stunned Clark, leaving the two skinny girls in a state of shock at the unexpected turn of events they had just witnessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Once the couple were seated at their beach blanket, Clark let out a small chuckle. Chloe's response to the other young woman's taunt may have been a bit more immature than he had expected, but he knew Chloe would probably not do something that childish again, and he was glad his girlfriend had the self-confidence not to take other people's taunts to heart. After all, he really liked how Chloe looked now, and he had really enjoyed the sight of his beautiful, fat girlfriend dramatically licking her triple layer ice cream cone! Besides, the mean girl had pretty much brought what happened on herself. Clark had the feeling no one else would taunt Chloe Sullivan's appearance today! With great enthusiasm, Clark prepared to feed his girlfriend the many snacks he had bought her at the snack bar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                           Fast forward to...<br>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                      </span></div></div>",

The bikini clad blonde reclined on the beach blanket with her head in Clark's lap, gently rubbing the sides of her incredibly bloated stomach. It was the first time Chloe had overindulged like this in a public place - previously, all of her binges had been done in the privacy of her or Clark's home, where her overstuffed belly could be hidden away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, Chloe had finally shown her new body to the world, and she was quite happy showing her protruding gut in public. There was a time when she would have felt self concious wearing just a bikini, let alone wearing a bikini while being the heaviest girl on the beach - but, as the sun shone down upon her exposed (and now slightly tanned) body, she realised she had never been happier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark's hand brushed against her taught, food stuffed belly. \"Full?\" He asked, with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full.\" Chloe agreed, patting her bulging stomach in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to go for a swim before we go, you want to come?\" Clark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe gave a tired groan. \"Clark, I'm too full to <i>move </i>right now, let alone swim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark laughed and gave Chloe's belly a brief rub before standing up and heading towards the sea. Chloe watched him go with a smile before she reclined on her back with an exhausted sigh. Although Chloe did her best to avoid becoming unfit, she found she lacked the energy for exercise these days. Besides, she had been entirely truthful a moment ago, she could hardly move right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chloe lay on her back, she got a good view of the three large spheres that were her breasts and belly. Chloe hadn't really noticed it before, but her boobs were getting huge! They looked positively enormous crammed into her bikini top, and this was something Chloe liked - she was definitely the bustiest girl at the beach today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shadow fell over her. Chloe looked up, expecting to see Clark returning from his swim, but instead, she found herself face to face with someone she didn't expect...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Lana?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was alarmed to see her raven haired friend standing over her. She sat up slowly, her big belly spilling into her lap and her breasts jiggling slightly as she adjusted her position. Chloe locked eyes with Lana, and then looked over the rest of her body...while Chloe had ballooned these past weeks; Lana looked as slim and toned as ever. Clark\u2019s former love interest was wearing a black bikini which showed off every inch of her traditionally \u2018perfect\u2019 body. Chloe looked about twice her size now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Chloe,\u201d Lana smiled, kneeling down beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026hey,\u201d Chloe wasn\u2019t really sure what to say. She and Lana hadn\u2019t really spoken to each other since she had started dating Clark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here for a while, but I wanted to catch you on your own,\u201d Lana said. \u201cI know since you started dating Clark I haven\u2019t really seen much of you. To be honest, I still had some nagging feelings for him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Chloe said, somewhat surprised. \u201cAnd\u2026what about now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re all gone,\u201d Lana smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, not that you\u2019d have anything to worry about anyway, I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was honestly relieved; she had half expected Lana to announce that she still had feelings for Clark, and that she wanted him back. While Chloe\u2019s relationship with Clark was rock solid these days, having Lana announce some sort of desire for Clark would have complicated matters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cA lot\u2019s changed in the past few months huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana let her eyes drift down to Chloe\u2019s pot belly. Chloe caught sight of this, and Lana quickly looked away. Chloe just smiled. \u201cIncluding my weight,\u201d she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana managed an awkward smile. \u201cOh uh\u2026I wasn\u2019t\u2026I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Chloe said, stroking her belly absent mindedly. \u201cI know I must look pretty different these days, but I\u2019m happy with it.\u201d She gave her belly a reassuring pat. \u201cHappier than I\u2019ve ever been with my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana was still looking awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, when I saw you earlier, I was shocked,\u201d Lana said. \u201cBut\u2026every time I caught a glimpse of you after that, I actually envied you\u2026you seemed to be having so much fun, eating what you wanted, proud of your body. Happy with your life, with Clark. And\u2026well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Chloe raised an eyebrow quizzically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a decision,\u201d Lana said. \u201cI want to gain weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was amazed to hear those words come out of Lana\u2019s mouth. Years ago, before her acquired her perfect, slim, sexy body, Lana had been chubby. She had lost all the weight, and remained in perfect shape ever since, doing all she could to maintain her figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLana\u2026are you feeling all right?\u201d Chloe asked, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfectly fine,\u201d Lana said. \u201cDo you have any idea how stressful it is maintaining this body?\u201d She gestured to her flat stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got a great body, why would you want to change it?\u201d Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you feel better after you changed yours?\u201d Lana asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe shrugged. \u201cWell\u2026yeah, I guess I did, much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to become some immobile blog or something,\u201d Lana chuckled. \u201cI just want to let go for a while, get a little curvier, get a little belly\u2026\u201d She gestured to Chloe\u2019s stomach, which was far more than a \u2018little\u2019 belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe realised that Lana was serious, and if she wanted to join Chloe in her new overly indulgent lifestyle, then why not? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you need any help, you know who to come to\u201d Chloe smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana laughed. \u201cYou know, maybe you could give me a few pointers? If that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Chloe said, the idea of an \u2018eating partner\u2019 excited her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come round to my place when we get back to Smallville in a few days, I\u2019ll make sure we\u2019ve got plenty of supplies in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe and Lana giggled in anticipation of their gluttony. After talking for another ten minutes and catching up on the latest gossip, Lana went on her way, just as Clark emerged from the sea and walked up to Chloe, his body dripping wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that\u2026Lana?!\u201d Clark asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was surprised too,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cShe\u2019s visiting relatives up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you two are talking again,\u201d Clark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we\u2019ll be doing more than talking\u2026\u201d Chloe grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, Chloe and Clark had returned from their brief vacation, both of them well rested after an enjoyable few days away together. Chloe was sure she had gained another few pounds during the getaway, which seemed to have gone straight to her plump butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a day of rest, she had been shopping for the huge amount of food that she readying for her and Lana's feast. After giving Lana a text, the two girls had set a time for their evening of indulgence, and Lana was on her way over as Chloe prepared the first wave of snacks. The plump blonde had changed into some of her new clothes - a form fitting purple coloured button up shirt and some tight jeans that exposed every curve of her body. Since her latest shopping trip, Chloe found her clothes far more comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the door bell rang, and an excited Chloe hurried to answer it. Lana was standing there, looking a little nervous, wearing leather pants and a black tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you hungry?\" Chloe grinned. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chloe lead Lana through to the kitchen, where she had been slaving away for most of the day preparing their enormous feast. While Chloe's weight gain had been a gradual process, lacking any significant binges at first - she had gone all out for Lana's first attempt at total gluttony. Scattered across the kitchen were plates of food which varied from small to large sizes - Chloe had prepared Burgers, Pizza, Chicken, Tacos, Nachos, Hot Dogs, Fries and all other manner of fattening foods, everything Lana would need to begin her journey. On the other side of the room was a separate row of desserts featuring Cakes, Ice Cream, Chocolate and various other sweeties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's mouth dropped open as she gazed around the room. \"Chloe...oh my God! I can't eat all this, it's too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe smirked. \"You won't be eating it all, silly. This is for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Lana looked a little more relaxed upon hearing that, but she was still in shock. \"But still, just the two of us are going to eat <i>all </i>this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe rubbed her belly in anticipation and smiled at Lana. \"You'd be surprised how much I can eat now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana gave Chloe a curious look, and they sat down at the table. Lana started on the burgers, while Chloe grabbed a slice of Pizza and crammed it into her mouth. Lana was only half way through her burger when Chloe reached for another slice, and another...and another. Lana watched the plump blonde in amazement, she was amazed that Chloe could put away so much food so quickly while she was only just finishing her first burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep up Lana,\" Chloe said in-between mouthfuls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana had been a little apprehensive about actually going through with all this, but seeing Chloe devouring that Pizza gave her a renewed enthusiasm. She dived in for her second burger and started to speed up, cramming the burger into her mouth in several un-lady like mouthfuls. Chloe gave her an encouraging smile and Lana reached across the table for a slice of Pizza, which she quickly devoured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Chloe said, wiping some grease from her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chloe changed plate and reached for some fried chicken, Lana started getting stuck in to the Pizza. It seemed as though she was starting to relax now, and she seemed to be working up quite the appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Lana gave a muffled moan of enjoyment between bites of Pizza. \"It feels great to just let go. Usually I just eat salads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck!\" Chloe made an exaggerated noise of disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana laughed, before cramming another slice of Pizza into her mouth. Chloe was quite enjoying having an eating partner, while she certainly enjoyed her solitary binges, it was fun to stuff herself with a friend. Although Chloe couldn't see Lana's stomach from where she was sitting, she was sure that the raven haired Miss Lang must have been looking pretty stuffed right now. She was devouring Pizza slices in two or three bites, and soon she had nearly finished the plate! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, leave some for me!\" Chloe laughed as Lana reached for another slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana pulled her hand away and let out a loud belch. Chloe giggled, but Lana covered her mouth in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should try something else...I didn't realize I was eating so much!\" Lana pushed the half empty plate away and grabbed a nearby Hot Dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was starting on the burgers now, having already eaten quite a bit of fried chicken. Her tight clothes were getting tighter, and she could feel her buttons stretching apart. Most of the time, she wore overly tight outfits just to arouse Clark, who loved nothing more than seeing her outgrow old clothes. Today however, she had worn them for her own enjoyment. Truth be told, Chloe loved the sensation of her bloated stomach pulling apart her shirt and pants. The clothes she was wearing at the moment were only about two weeks old, but she had outgrown them very quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby blonde watched as her companion reached for another hot dog. \"Having fun?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana, her cheeks full with food, nodded vigorously in Chloe's direction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chloe didn't know that Lana had a \"little\" secret that she (Chloe) had innocently let out of the bag. For although both Miss Chloe Sullivan and Miss Lana Lang were born in Smallville Hospital just a few months apart, they attended different Elementary schools. So they never met each other until they were in the fourth grade. After Lana's parents were killed in the meteor storm, her mother's sister Nell was granted guardianship by the Family Court. Having never married and having no children of her own, Nell went WAY overboard indulging Lana's whims. The major one being a propensity to over-eat at every meal. It was at Lana's seventh birthday party that things came to a head. Lana's atrocious table manners upset several of the parents at the party and Nell was brought before the Family Court to see whether she deserved to continue raising Lana. Lana had already grown into quite a cute butter-ball but seeing Lana's size the Judge wasn't amused. She ordered Lana to be treated for her overweight condition for Nell to retain custody. Not wanting to loose control of her niece, Nell readily complied in every way listed. She even sent Lana to a child psychologist who after a few months study diagnosed why Lana was so desperate to grow so big. She still remembered that terrible day and somehow had gotten it into her head that her parents wouldn't have gone away [died] if Lana had been a bigger girl. So by the time they met Lana had become the petite-sized girl that Chloe knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking Lana \"Having fun?\" Chloe had accidentally let the proverbial barn door open. Hearing that question triggered inside Lana an uncontrollable desire to eat until she quite literally passed out from exhaustion. However before THAT happened after 20 minutes of essentially non-stop eating by the two girls, Chloe suggested that they should see whose belly had grown bigger from their efforts. Chloe was stunned when she discovered that Lana was only about one inch behind her. She couldn't figure out how Lana had managed to grow so big in one sitting. It had taken Chloe over a month before she grew that much from eating just 1 large meal. Even more surprising was Lana showed NO intention of slowing down. She had already returned to the pizza boxes for several more slices. Chloe quickly resumed her eating but now kept a very close eye on Lana's portions. While Chloe wasn't slowing down her bites began to grow smaller as she was rapidly approaching her limit, while Lana's started getting bigger! Chloe became concerned when Lana viciously growled at her when she suggested that they stop for awhile {to catch their breath}. After spending NINE long years denying herself delicious fattening food and all kinds of wonderful desserts, Lana had NO intention of stopping until she passed out. Which didn't occur until she had been eating non-stop for nearly an hour. Chloe was even more baffled when (in her sleep) Lana started moaning like she was having really, REALLY GREAT sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Lana's moans before her entered, Clark didn't know what to say or do. Seeing Lana passed out and hearing her moans grow louder, Chloe tried to explain to Clark about what had happened that afternoon. Because they had grown up on neighboring farms Clark knew about Lana's early fatness and also the treatments she had undergone to control her runaway appetite. So although he wanted to scold Chloe for her mistake, he realized that she didn't know anything about Lana's problem so it wouldn't do either of them any good to berate her about it. Now that Lana had ballooned into becoming much bigger than Chloe, Clark's affections started shifting back towards Lana. Of course being the person he was, Clark didn't let on to Chloe. To help Lana through her soon to arrive problems, Clark gently picked up Lana and then carried her back to her upstairs apartment at the Talon. Seeing that, Chloe started worrying about her place in Clark's life. After carefully setting Lana down on her bed, Clark called Martha and told her what had happened. Martha immediately left for town to help take care of Lana. Fortunately for Lana, Martha arrived several minutes before she was needed. After her stomach settled down, Lana spent some time thinking about that afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Lana react to her now VERY heavy and still quite bloated stomach?<br>\r\nThe next item should ONLY deal with Lana's reaction to Clark's presence in her bedroom. <br>\r\nChloe's reaction (whatever it turns out to be) should wait until the following update.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sadly, it will not take into account the 9th season of the show or beyond, since I have been unable to see those episodes yet. Also, Clark and Chloe's relationship will have changed some plot elements of the show. Hope you enjoyed reading this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Twenty Years had passed since Clark and Chloe had been in high school, and a lot of things had changed. Clark had finally come to grips with his destiny and had been Superman for several years. Over the years, with lots of help from Chloe, Clark had managed to put all of the rogue Kryptonians and criminals that had escaped from the phantom zone and Krypton, including Doomsday and Zod, back into their extra-dimensional prison for (hopefully) all of time. Thankfully, Chloe had managed to split Jason Tegue off from Doomsday with Black Kryptonite first, and he was now safely locked away in a mental institution, working on his psychological issues. Lex was also sent into the Phantom Zone by Jor-El who (rightly) considered the Luther to be an extreme hazard to his son's well being. Furthermore, Chloe had become Watchtower for the Justice League (which Clark had named and now lead), a job which required a lot of technical skill but little in the way of physical exertion. That was a VERY good thing! After Clark and Chloe had gotten married six years after their relationship began (with Pete as the best man and Lana as the maid of honor), Chloe had gained an enormous amount of weight due to her own eating habits and Clark's encouragement, and she now weighed well over 500 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Of course, being that heavy had caused Chloe some logistical problems at first, as she outgrew clothes quickly and required large amounts of food to satisfy her always growing appetite! However, when Clark's grandfather sadly, but inevitably passed away, he gave the millions he had made while running his successful law firm to Clark, the only member of his family who had managed to stay in touch with him over the years. As terrible as that event had been, it did solve Clark and Chloe Kent's money problems, although they were too humble to flash their money all over the place. For a time, however, Clark and Chloe still worried about the possible health problems Chloe's weight might cause her in the long run. Thankfully, it turned out that Chloe's meteor related ability to heal also amped up her own body's immune system, keeping the newest Mrs. Kent happy and healthy regardless of her weight, fitness levels, or eating habits. In fact, she actually aged at an increasingly slow rate, and looked far younger than her friends Lana and Lois, who had married Pete and Oliver Queen, respectably.  This was a fact not lost on Martha and U.S Senator Jonathan Kent (who was still alive since Clark had not had to choose between saving him and Lana!) at their yearly family gatherings, although they were too polite too acknowledge the fact out loud. Chloe still didn't know if she would live as long as Clark, who no longer appeared to age at all as his powers appeared to grow stronger, but she knew that her and Clark would have a long, happy (and in Chloe's case, fattening) life together!</span></div></div>",

Inside was a grainy security photograph of her, looking rather suspicious, outside of a Luthorcorp facility in the dead of night. She remembered the incident well;  last week she had gotten a lead from one of her contacts inside Luthorcorp, who had told her that something strange was going on at a brand new, specially constructed facility on the outskirts of Smallville. Chloe had gone there alone, and attempted to get a look inside, but she had been unable to find an entrance. She had eventually given up her search, but she hadn't realised there was CCTV at the site. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be anyone,\" Chloe said, although she knew it was a transparent lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be, Miss Sullivan,\" Lionel agreed with a smile. \"Which is why I haven't contacted the authorities, but if you are caught around one of my labs again, then there will be consequences. Am I understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Lionel said. \"Always a pleasure to see you, Clark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark gave Lionel a curious look as he turned on his heel and strode out of the room. Chloe breathed a sigh of relief as she watched him leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell us about this?\" Clark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark, I can handle these things myself,\" Chloe protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously not, if you're getting caught on Luthorcam,\" Pete added sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe ignored him, as a thought occurred to her. Lionel had said 'lab' before he left, and wherever there was a Luthorcorp lab, there was something strange going on, something that Chloe wanted to know about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear what he said?\" Chloe asked Clark and Pete. \"He said that place was a lab, we have to go back there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, did you hear a word he said?\" Pete asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can either let me go alone, or you can come and help me.

Chloe was still on the lookout for the surveillance camera she had missed last time. Suddenly, she heard a bang, and smelled smoke. She looked up to see the hidden camera was on fire, with sparks flying off it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" Chloe said, exchanging a confused look with Pete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have...erm...short circuited or something,\" Clark said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe gave him a suspicious look. It was a little too convenient that the camera had gone wrong at the exact moment they arrived, but she wasn't one to look a gift horse in the mouth. She lead the way forward, and, with the camera down, the three companions were safe to explore their surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See if you can find a door or something,\" Chloe said, taking charge, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey split up, each of them running their hands across the stone surface of the building. Chloe was still unable to find so much as a crack in it's surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found something!\" Clark suddenly called from around the other side of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe hurried round to find Clark and Pete pulling open a circular door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you find that?!\" Chloe asked in amazement. She had been over this place for hours on end the last time she was here, but had been unable to find anything. How had Clark managed to locate a door in under five minutes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they must just have put it in,\" Clark shrugged. \"It wasn't that well hidden...really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe wasn't sure she believed that, but she was so excited about having found a way inside, she decided not to ask any further questions. Chloe headed inside first, followed by Clark. Pete stayed outside to keep guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorway lead Chloe and Clark into darkness, with only a few blinking lights in the distance guiding their way. Chloe kept close to Clark as they made their way inside, not wanting to lose him in the pitch black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can see a light switch...\" Clark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then your eye sight is better than mine Clark, I can't see a thing in here!\" Chloe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark flicked a switch, and with a loud clunking noise, a series of bright lights activated above them. Each one flickered to life one after the other, revealing three large vats surrounding them. Above the vats was a walkway overlooking their position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's inside those vats?\" Chloe pondered, looking up at the huge containers curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can get a better look from up there?\" Clark suggested, looking up at the railed walkway above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Chloe was way ahead of him. She had already spotted a ladder at the side of the room, and was climbing up it towards the walkway. She reached the top step and hopped off. Clark hurried after her as she walked along the walkway overlooking the vats. From her new vantage point, Chloe could see that each of the vats were uncovered, and filled with a slimy goo. In each vat, there was a different colour goo - one of them was green, the other purple and the other yellow. Chloe peered into the vats, wondering what the hell that stuff was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, be careful,\" Clark warned, as he ascended the ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Clark,\" Chloe said casually, peering over the railing to get a closer look at the goo filled containers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the walkway shook. Chloe gripped onto the railing, but it was too late...she tumbled over the side of the railing...</span></div></div>",

First, the inside of the vat was too high for her to climb out of the goo-filled container on her own. Second, her entire body, especially her stomach, was starting to feel really strange( yet actually rather nice!) all of a sudden...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me, Clark!\", she screamed. But Clark was already on his way. He had grabbed a ladder from inside of the lab and used it to climb up near the top of the goo-filled vat to pull Chloe out. Unfortunately  , as soon as he got to the top of the ladder, the goo started to glow, and an all-too-familiar pain started to coarse through Clark's body. One of the ingredients in that slop must be green meteor rock! With a loud groan of pain, Clark stumbled, nearly fell actually, to the bottom of the ladder, and he ran to get Pete for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Chloe did not notice that the goo around here was glowing because she had her own problem right now: all her clothes were starting to feel really tight! \"Why would Luthercorp want to develop something that would make clothes shrink?\", Chloe though to herself. Before she could analyze this thought, however, Pete and Clark came charging in and helped her out of the vat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Chloe could ask Clark why he had screamed out in pain and ran when she had been in trouble, she noticed that Clark and Pete were staring at her .

Tying not to panic. Chloe spoke to Clark and Pete, \"Look, I know this is REALLY weird and awkward but... can you two please just try to find something to cover me up with so we can get out of here?\" Thinking quickly, the portly female added, \" And PLEASE find me some information about whatever that slime was!

Meanwhile, Pete gathered up some towels from around the lab an placed them on Chloe. As big as she now was, the towels could not cover her completely, and parts of her, especially her large belly were still exposed, but at least she was not completely unclothed!

However, they had more pressing problems at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         First, Chloe needed some new clothes. Fortunately, Pete had a great aunt that had stayed at his house on one occasion, and forgot to bring some of her clothes home. She had been a big woman, and Pete guessed her clothes would fit Chloe now, although he did not know how long they would last. As soon as Pete thought of this, he quickly retrieved the extra large clothes from his house and brought them to Chloe, who tried them on. The clothes were tight, but at least they fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Second, Chloe did not want her dad to see her like this and freak out. Thankfully, Gabe Sullivan had been called to a Luther Corp Seminar ironically titled, \"The Environment and You\" which emphasized that the workers at the fertilizer plant, which was known for polluting the lakes and rivers around Smallville, were to be environmentally conscious. Since the seminar was in Topeka and would take a few days, Chloe was on her own this weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          The third problem was not so simple. Apparently, Chloe's weight gain made her VERY hungry, and Chloe knew she would have to eat soon, but was worried about her expanded waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"What should I do?\" Chloe wondered....</span></div></div>",

She quickly surveyed the fridges contents: Leftover bacon, sausage, and other meats, several kinds of cheese, three types of Martha Kent's famous fruit-filled pies, ice cream, and 2 fully loaded frozen pizzas, among other items. Almost without thinking, the ravenous teen quickly began cooking and heating up several of the items in the fridge, while snacking on the ice cream ,which obviously did not need to be cooked. Finally, an agonizingly long time after she had finished the ice cream, Chloe pulled one of the pizzas out of the oven and began to stuff her face with it, trying not to run the clothes she had just put on or wake up Clark, who had fallen asleep several minutes ago after Pete had gone home. After rapidly consuming the Deluxe pizza, Chloe was shocked to discover she was still hungry!

Taking a closer look, Clark realized that she had eaten every item in his family's kitchen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Suppressing a belch and holding her painfully swollen belly in her hands, Chloe let out a sigh of relief.

She pushed through the front door, and found a tall, bespectacled brunette standing in the reception area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Sullivan?\" The woman said, smiling politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" said Chloe, as she approached the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jacqueline, we spoke on the phone,\" the woman said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember,\" said Chloe. \"Nice to put a face to the name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline smiled, in a somewhat eerie way that reminded Chloe of one of the Stepford Wives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we begin the tour? I have prepared a few examples of our work for you to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded, reached into her bag, and pulled out a notepad and pencil. \"Okay, let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline walked Chloe from the main reception area down a long corridor. There wasn't really much to see, but Jacqueline was giving some sort of manufactured company speech about the clinic, it's history and it's founders. Chloe scribbled down some notes, but she wasn't especially interested in what Jacqueline was saying...she wasn't planning on writing a comprehensive history of this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And at the end of this hallway, you will see our three surgeries, where young women like yourself can enhance their bodies with state of the art plastic surgery...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe turned her nose up at the idea, but quickly smiled when she saw Jacqueline staring at her. \"Oh...it sounds great,\" she lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you think so,\" Jacqueline replied, that artificial smile still plastered across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, I will show you, and let you speak to, some of the girls who have come here to undergo surgery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe got her pencil ready as they walked through another set of double doors and into the next room. Unlike the clinical, bright white corridor they had just walked down, this room was a luxurious looking suite with wooden walls, a roaring fire and works of art hung on the walls. Chloe's eyes drifted across the room to where three girls, about her age, were standing smiling at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are three of the girls our clinic has helped to improve over the past few months,\" Jacqueline said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe's mouth nearly dropped open as she stared at the three girls. It was obvious they had all been 'enhanced' in some way. The first girl, a tall, slim blonde, possessed what had to be the biggest pair of breasts Chloe had ever seen in person - they were at least a DD cup size, and were practically overflowing the skin tight tank top the girl was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl, who was slightly shorter than the first, but no less attractive, also possessed a larger than normal bustline, but it was her behind that drew Chloe's attention. The girl had a large, perfectly rounded ass, and wore only a pair of tight denim shorts to keep it in check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third girl was a rather curvy brunette, with a skinny waist, wide hips and seemed to combine the attributes of the previous two girls - her butt and boobs were huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe wondered why the hell these girls would want to do this to themselves. It just made her more determined to write her article. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Tiffany,\" said Jacqueline, pointing to the blonde with the huge breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Chloe said, trying not to look directly at the girls heaving bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Tiffany grinned. \"Do you like 'em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe wasn't sure what to say, she just looked back at the girl awkwardly. \"Sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Tiffany here came in, she was just an A cup, and was tired of being teased because of her small breast size,\" Jacqueline explained. \"The next girl along is Amber,\" she went on, gesturing to the girl with the bulging behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she said to Chloe, an entirely serious expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was about to reply, when Jacqueline spoke again. \"And this is Becky,\" she said. \"When she first came to us she weighed about three hundred pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Chloe gasped as she looked the girl up and down. She would never have guessed that this girl had ever weighed anything more than two hundred, at the most - she had a supermodel like body, just like the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Becky said, addressing Chloe. \"I was so huge when I first came here, and they really helped me slim down, I used to be such a fat slob...but look at me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe had to admit, the surgery being done here was pretty impressive, but no less contemptible. She looked along the row of girls again, and imagined how Clark and Pete would react if they had accompanied her here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you think you have enough for the article?\" Jacqueline asked. \"You can interview one of the girls here if you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe considered the offer...</span></div></div>",

She could think of nothing she would enjoy less than talking to three bimbos for the next hour, while they blabbered on about their amazing surgery and how hot they all considered themselves to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" Chloe said. \"I think I've got <i>more</i> than enough info.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see,\" Jacqueline said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all three girls straightened up in an almost militaristic way. Their eyes widened, their hands dropped to their sides, and they all stared directly at Chloe, who began to feel a little unnerved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I should get going, I need to make a start on the article,\" Chloe said, and she began backing away towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're not going <i>anywhere</i> Miss Sullivan,\" Jacqueline said menacingly. \"Girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the command, the three girls rushed forward, their bountiful assets jiggling promiscuously as they lunged towards an alarmed Chloe. Amber grabbed Chloe's arm, but Chloe managed to shove her back. Not knowing what the hell was going on, she made a break for the door, but Becky and Tiffany seized her before she could so much as turn the door handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...off...me!\" Chloe said as she struggled against her attackers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subdue her,\" Jacqueline ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls were dragging Chloe to the floor, as she tried desperately to free herself from their grip.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chloe awoke several hours later in a daze. She slowly but surely opened her eyes, only to be blinded by a bright light above her. She instinctively moved her hand to cover her eyes, but found that neither of her arms would budge. She still felt sore at the back of her head, and it all came flooding back to her - those augmented girls and their psycho mistress had attacked her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe resolved herself to opening her eyes. The bright light was still there, and she blinked repeatedly as she stared up at it, but she was determined to get a look at her surroundings. She attempted to move her legs, but, like her arms, they also refused to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dim those lights,\" a familiar voice commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the noise of someone flicking some switches, and suddenly the bright light faded considerably. As her eyes adjusted to the new lighting, Chloe could see that she was staring up at the roof of a room. She struggled to sit up, but it was no use; she was strapped down to the table. She turned her head to the side, and saw the unmistakeable figures of Becky, Tiffany and Amber standing on one side of the room. She glowered at them furiously, and turned her head to the other side, just in time to see the smirking figure of Jacqueline leering over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?!\" Chloe shouted, trying desperately to free herself from her constraints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd give you a little incentive to write something more <i>positive</i> about me and my girls here,\" Jacqueline smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this for some good press?\" Chloe asked in disbelief. \"You must be desperate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had hoped a teenage girl like yourself would be the perfect way to advertise to the rest of your school, but it appears I chose poorly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right you did,\" Chloe snapped. \"People like you make women everywhere feel badly about their bodies, you're nothing but a -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Chloe could finish, a hand came out of nowhere and clasped itself over her mouth. Chloe glanced up to see Amber glaring at her menacingly. Tiffany and Becky appeared from behind her, and Becky produced a roll of duck tape from behind her back. Amber quickly lifted her hand away, and Becky tore off a strip of tape and placed it over Chloe's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk too much, Miss Sullivan,\" Jacqueline said. \"You may notice that the room you are in is a laboratory, <i>my</i> laboratory, to be exact. I have developed the ultimate instant plastic surgery - with my machines here, I can manipulate the human body however I choose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe stared at Jacqueline as though she was completely insane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, leave us,\" Jacqueline ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three surgically enhanced girls left the room, as Jacqueline crossed to the far side and began to fiddle with some controls and levers. Chloe began to grow agitated...just what was this crazed woman planning to do to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What those girls don't know, Miss Sullivan, is that my machines, once used to alter the body, can also alter the mind,\" Jacqueline explained. \"You saw how obedient they were. Once the...ahem...enhancements...have been made, a chemical within the body alters the subjects state of mind, making them subservient to my will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe tried to say something, but all that came out was a feint murmur beneath the tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you like my alterations, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline pulled a lever, and a mechanical buzzing noise filled the room. Chloe could only stare up helplessly as a large machine lowered itself from the ceiling and extended two large, green liquid filled syringes towards her body. Chloe attempted to struggle, as the syringes grew closer and closer, but it was useless. Jacqueline laughed, and Chloe closed her eyes and winced as the green liquid was injected into her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the green liquid began to flow throughout Chloe's body, Jacqueline looked on with a malevolent grin on her face - it was already beginning to take effect. Chloe, bound and gagged to the operating table, was making a desperate attempt to free herself from her constraints, but it was useless, Chloe's body had already started to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe could feel her skin tingling, her clothes tightening and her constraints growing even more constricting. Unfortunately, with her head also strapped down to the table, she couldn't see a thing, and was left simply staring up at the brightly lit ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Chloe wasn't seeing was that her small, petite body was currently undergoing some serious changes. Her clothes were tightening because her entire body was growing. Her legs grew long and slender, causing her jeans to shrink around her thighs and ride up above her ankles. Chloe winced as she felt the jeans become unbearably tight, digging into her skin. She gave a muffled cry beneath her tape-gag, and Jacqueline laughed mockingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Miss Sullivan, you will find the constraints that keep you bound will adjust to your transformation, you will be made quite comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe gulped nervously, wondering just what that meant. The rest of her outfit was growing equally skin tight; her jacket had shrunk around her chest and the buttons on her shirt were tightening to ridiculous levels, threatening to explode off at any moment. Even her shoes were beginning to chafe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe wished she knew what was happening to her body; she knew she was undergoing some sort of bizarre cosmetic changes, that much was obvious, but what exactly was this mad woman doing to her? Would she end up with enormous boobs? A Giant ass? Chloe didn't know, and she wasn't sure she wanted to. None the less, she had a feeling she would find out very soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Chloe heard an almighty tearing noise. She gave another muffled moan as she felt her jeans completely rip away from her body, exposing her bare legs to the cool air of the lab. She struggled again, trying to kick her exposed legs free, wishing she could cover herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use Miss Sullivan,\" Jacqueline said. \"The changes have begun to take effect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of popping noises came from slightly higher up Chloe's body, and she felt her shirt rip open. Immediately afterwards, her arms burst through the sleeves of her jacket, tearing apart the leather material like it was nothing. The tattered remains of Chloe's clothes hung to her expanding body, but Chloe was feeling very much exposed. The only item of clothing that remained on her rapidly growing form was her underwear, and that too was reaching it's limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please...make it stop...\"</i> Chloe thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end other end of the table, Chloe's feet tore their way through her shoes and her socks stretched and exploded as her feet wriggled free. Chloe felt cold, exposed and ashamed as her semi-naked figure continued to struggle on the hard table surface. Jacqueline had been right about one thing - those constraints had, bizarrely, growing along with the rest of her body, slowly adjusting themselves to allow her body some basic movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe had grown dramatically, and although she could not see it, she was much, <i>much </i>taller than she used to be. Chloe had always been a short girl, but now her height had shot up to about 8 foot! Chloe felt her bra strap digging into her back and her panties giving her a major wedgie; and she knew what was next. Her underwear wouldn't be able to hold out forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Chloe's nipples tore through the front of her bra, poking free from the lacey cups for a moment shortly before her bra strap snapped apart, and the now useless piece of underwear slipped away. Chloe heard Jacqueline laugh again, and felt humiliated. Her humiliation continued quickly as she felt her panties give up their struggled to contain her butt. With another tear, she felt them completely rip away from her body, leaving Chloe Sullivan a very large, very naked blonde, strapped to a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Jacqueline said. \"The process is complete! Now...how you do feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chloe, red with embarrassment, struggled to take in the astonishing transformation she had just undergone, one thought was prominent in her mind...</span></div></div>",

There was a high pitched beeping noise and Chloe's constraints suddenly snapped open. Immediately, Chloe sat up, bumping her head against the ceiling and for the first time, getting a look at herself. Her body was huge! Proportionally, everything was the same, she was just a few feet taller - but Chloe was amazed at the changes she had undergone. She was enormous! She had actually doubled in height, and her ass now took up most of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore the tape away from her mouth and threw it aside in disgust, completely taken aback by her dramatic transformation. She was so tall that she hardly had any room to move - she had to bend her back over just to keep her head from knocking against the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline stared over at the enhanced young reporter before her and smiled. \"Much better, wouldn't you agree? Now then, I have plans for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plans?\" Chloe asked nervously, still staring down at her naked body in awe, only half paying attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your first assignment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe snapped out of her trance and glared at the woman, suddenly very angry. \"Assignment?! Assignment?!! You honestly think I'm going to <i>work </i>for you after <i>this</i>?!\" She gestured to her enormous body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline's smile faded. \"What is this? You were supposed to be under my control...my machine didn't work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline turned and ran for the control panel, but Chloe acted quickly. With one swipe of her arm, Jacqueline was knocked flying across the room. Her body slammed into a computer terminal, and she slumped down into unconsciousness. Chloe smiled in satisfaction as she watched her tormentor's body fall to the floor. Although Jacqueline had altered her body, at least she still had her mind. To Chloe, that was the most important thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I gotta get out of this lab...if I can stand up...\" Chloe said, noticing that her voice sounded louder than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant blonde started to make her move, heaving her huge body off of the operating table and trying to manoeuvre herself towards the door. Unfortunately, Chloe found this to be quite a gruelling task - her head thumped into the ceiling - there was no way in hell she was going to stand upright in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Chloe sighed, rubbing her sore head. \"That's not going to work...maybe if I crouch down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe slipped off the table and onto the floor, kneeling down as low as she could. This worked better, but she was still way too big for this room. She got down on all fours and began crawling towards the door. As she moved, her knocked aside some lab equipment, papers and test tubes, covering the floor in mess. Her ass knocked aside a computer, which smashed onto the floor behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops...\" Chloe said, as she looked back at the chaos she had caused simply by trying to reach the door. \"Clumsy me.\" Chloe actually managed a giggle at her last comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with her face at the door, Chloe was left with her next problem. How was she going to get out of here?</span></div></div>",

After first arriving in the small town looking for her missing cousin, Chloe Sullivan, Lois had encountered a naked amnesiac Clark wandering around in a field, before the two of them had joined forces to find Chloe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, a number of other annoyances had occurred, chief amongst them was Lois' continued stay in Smallville due to the fact that her father was forcing her to finish high school there. Once she had done that, she was free to return to Metropolis University, but until then, she was staying in Smallville. The Kents had been kind enough to let her stay with them, and despite her frequent squabbling with Clark, it was an arrangement that had worked out pretty well - she got a free place to stay, as well as free meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois had also come to work for her cousin at the high school newspaper - The Torch, and while she had not been enthusiastic about journalism to start with, she was starting to enjoy it more as the days went by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois entered the Torch office early on Monday morning, a freshly bought coffee from the Talon clutched in her hand. As she walked through the door, she found Chloe sitting at her desk typing away, and Clark sitting on the edge of the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have known you two would be here already,\" Lois said tiredly as she walked up to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it wouldn't hurt you to arrive on time once in a while Lois,\" Clark said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, unlike <i>you</i> Smallville, I actually have other places to be,\" Lois bit back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark frowned, and Lois enjoyed her victory. Since they had met, both her and Clark had continued to antagonise one other, and generally find each other incredibly frustrating, and yet, she ended up spending most of her time with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's new in Smallville cous?\" Lois asked Chloe, peering over her cousin's shoulder at the computer monitor. \"Or should I say, what's weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe grinned. \"It's been pretty quiet for once, but there are a few things that might be worth reporting...there's a new factory opening up on the edge of town that's going to be making all sorts of tasty food products and something about a chemical leak into the river from a Luthorcorp plant.

They offered someone from the Torch a free tour, so they'll be expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, after she had sat through her compulsory period at school, Lois headed out to the new food factory on the edge of town. She couldn't help but feel this whole thing would turn out to be pretty boring - and would students really be that interested in new food products? Nevertheless, working for The Torch allowed her to add some extra curricular activities to her application to Metropolis University, which was useful. Plus, Lois had to admit she had really been getting into the world of investigative reporting lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving followed the directions given to her by Chloe, Lois had walked some distance from the Kent Farm to the new factory, which was in a fairly remote area of town. As Lois approached the factory, which was surrounded by a high fence, she noticed how high-tech it all looked - it's sleek metal design and smoke spewing chimneys were at odds with the peaceful, country-side serenity of Smallville. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois took in her surroundings for a moment, then made her way to the front gate. A security guard made his way towards her from the other side of the gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said Lois, greeting the moustached man. \"I'm Lois Lane, from the high school paper, here to do a story on the factory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard nodded and unlocked the gate. \"Oh yeah, go on through Miss Lane, they're expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois smiled and walked past the guard. <i>\"They're expecting you\"</i> - that always sounds ominous, Lois thought. She headed along the path and through the main entrance, stepping through a revolving door and into a clean, modern looking reception area. A tall blonde woman with spectacles and a sharp business suit was heading towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Miss Lane I presume?\" The woman asked, looking down at Lois over her glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" Lois replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, welcome to Smallville foods, I'm Miss Decker, I'll be your guide on your tour around the factory,\" the woman said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois nodded along. \"Smallville food huh? Original...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Decker frowned. \"I beg your pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Lois said quickly, smiling pleasantly in an attempt to cover up her previous sarcasm. \"So, how long is this going to take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no more than an hour,\" Miss Decker. \"Shall we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois nodded, and exhaled slowly as Miss Decker led her through some large double doors up ahead, and onto what appeared to be the factory floor. Lois could see numerous workers packing food into boxes and taping them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where we package the food up,\" Miss Decker says. \"As you can see, we have already received plenty of orders from local businesses, and we expect to do a good trade here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois was starting to get bored already, she had to stop herself from yawning as she and Miss Decker headed through another door. However, the next room proved to be a lot more interesting - they were suddenly walking on a gantry overlooking large vats of different foods, some of which Lois didn't even recognise - but she could smell them, and they smelled <i>delicious</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where we refine out products,\" Miss Decker explained, gesturing to the large containers beneath them. \"We use a special process to make all our food as healthy as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you produce really healthy stuff here, is that right?\" Lois asked, peering absent mindedly over the railing at what appeared to be a large vat of chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, we do,\" Miss Decker replied. \"But we make a wide range of goods as well, and other things such as cakes, muffins and chocolate bars...we know what you young people want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois forced a smile. \"Yeah...seems like it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out of the current room and entered another clean looking corridor, this one had various metal doors going along it, and Lois noticed how quiet her guide suddenly became as they walked along here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what goes on down here?\" Lois asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is where our researchers and food technicians make all our products taste as yummy as possible. But I really can't tell you anymore, as this section is top secret, we wouldn't want anyone stealing our company's secret recipe's now would we?\" Miss Decker said, quickening her pace slightly as they headed through another door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois took one last look at the mysterious corridor over her shoulder as they exited the corridor and went into the next room, which was a fairly boring looking packaging printing section. The tour continued for another half an hour, with Miss Decker enlightening Lois as to the many amazing products that Smallville foods made, before they found themselves back at the main reception area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you enjoyed the tour,\" Miss Decker said with a smile. \"Did you get enough information for your school's article?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois had to stop herself from yawning. \"Oh yeah, more than enough thanks,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Decker nodded in satisfaction. \"Well, before you go, I've been asked to give you a free sample of some of the food we make here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Decker walked up to the front desk, and pulled a basket that was sitting on it towards her, she then beckoned Lois over. Lois looked into the basket, and saw an energy bar, a chocolate bar and a blueberry muffin, amongst other items...they didn't look too bad.</span></div></div>",

As she took hold of the basket's handle, Lois realised that it was actually a lot heavier than it looked, just how much free stuff had they given her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thankyou for your time Miss Lane, I look forward to reading what I'm sure will be a marvellous article about the good work we do here,\" Miss Decker said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois nodded. \"Oh yeah, you'll love it, I'll make sure you get a copy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Decker gestured to the doors, and Lois made her way out of the reception area and back out through the gates, the security guard silently waving her off.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lois took the chocolate bar out of the basket and unwrapped it, but before she could take the first bite, she was startled by the loud honking of a car horn from behind her. It was Lana, and Chloe was with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of her window Lana says, \"I'm taking Chloe out to the Kent farm. She mentioned that you were going over to this factory today, so I decided to swing by and see if you wanted a lift.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of the basket immediately convinced Lois to accept Lana's offer. Before Lois had a chance to say anything more than \"Thanks\" Lana hits the accelerator and starts off towards the Kent farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the basket of goodies, Chloe asks Lois, \"Where did you get that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Miss Decker woman from the factory was real insistent I take them,\" Lois says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, one of the perks of being a newspaper reporter, <i>free</i> samples,\" Chloe grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a very responsible driver, Lana had both hands on the steering wheel and kept her eyes on the road ahead.  \"So, what kind of goodies did they give you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sort of a mixed bag,\" Lois replied. \"First off, there's this chocolate bar that I've just started on and which I must say tastes exquisite, a blueberry muffin and an energy bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's ears really perked up at hearing that. \"Oh goody, I just adore energy bars. Can I have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, no wonder this basket is so heavy!\" Lois exclaimed, looking deeper inside the basket. \"There's a box of a dozen more of these super-long chocolate bars and it says here that they are each 1 1/2 pounds of a new formula of Ultra-deluxe chocolate. There's also a full box of twenty energy bars in 5 different flavors and they each weigh TWO pounds. Looks like there's a couple dozen muffins as well...jeez...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was new to Smallville and still looking to make some friends, Lois decided to be generous and give Lana the entire box. Lana then profusely thanked Lois while she was placing the box on the front seat next to Lana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving now taken both the box of chocolate bars and the box of energy bars out of the basket, Lois sees what appears to be a bag of the biggest grapefruit she has ever seen - they vary in size but they're all easily bigger than a cantaloupe. Lois is now getting confused, there was <i>no</i> way that all of this food could have come from inside that little basket...and yet there's still more inside! Having been to the Orient several times with the General, Lois immediately recognized the package of 5 dozen extra-long bamboo shoots. She then spotted the final item in the basket and burst out laughing, much to the confusion of her two companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has got to be a joke. They just can't be real...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can't?\" Lana asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These potatoes!\" Lois said, holding one up so that Lana could see it in the rear view mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was so funny about the potatoes was that they were all about half a foot long. They had a strange hourglass shape and they all had very light hair that was nearly as long as the potato and totally straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I wish my hair could grow as long and silky as that,\" Lana said, almost to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Lana arrived at the lane that went up to the Kent's House. \"You should probably put all that stuff back into the basket Lois,\" Lana suggested. \"I don't want my passengers sitting on blueberries...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how!\" Lois exclaimed, trying to cram the copious amounts of food back into the basket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lana we're almost drowning in food back here. I think you're going to have to take most of it out before we can get out of the back seat!\" Chloe chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana stopped the car in front of the Kent home, just as Clark came walking down the path towards them. \"Hey guys...what are you,-\" Clark stopped, as he peered into the car and saw the food scattered across the back seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? Another item for the Wall of Weird,\" Chloe grinned up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Clark had succeeded in getting <i>all</i> of the food out of Lana's car and into the Kent's kitchen, where it was stacked high in a corner. Martha and Jonathan were staring at the pile with perplexed looks on they're faces. Lois was more than a little confused herself, she never would have thought there was quite so much food in the basket she had been given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about next time you decline the free samples Lois?\" Clark said, as he eyed up the stockpile they had accumulated in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois ignored him, and bit into a chocolate bar she had unwrapped. Actually, it was her third, but she didn't really want to admit that to anyone...or herself. She had to admit, they were incredibly tasty, and if they were as healthy as the food company made them out to be, she wouldn't put on much weight by eating them. She folded the chocolate bar back up hastily as Martha walked past, walking into the kitchen to finish preparing dinner. Lois had grown to love Mrs. Kent's cooking during her stay at the farm, and did not wish to offend her by eating a chocolate bar and spoiling her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for all 3 girls safety, Lois had yet to read the wrapper's warning about consuming any dairy products at or around the same time as any product from Smallville Foods...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner soon began, with both Lana and Chloe sticking around at the insistence of Clark's parents. Although she was a little full from scoffing down the chocolate bars earlier, Lois enjoyed every scrap of food on her plate. Lana and Chloe seemed equally satisfied, and, following a delicious dessert, which was Martha's famous extra-rich home made ice cream made with fresh cream and milk, everyone decided to head off to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I take these grapefruit with me?\" Lana asked, looking at the food pile. \"I usually have them for breakfast anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be my guest,\" Lois said, gesturing to the pile. \"I can't stand the damn things anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Lana said, as she began to gather up the grapefruit. \"I almost forgot I still had that energy bar as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy 'em,\" said Lois, as she walked back to the kitchen table to see what Clark and Chloe were talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is it okay if I stay the night? I've got plenty of work to do, and it would just be easier if I crashed here,\" Chloe was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Clark. \"It's no problem, I'll get your room ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Chloe. \"Oh, by the way Lois, I've got a craving for one of those blueberry muffins...do you mind if I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Lois interjected, knowing where this was going. \"The sooner we get rid of all that stuff the better, take as many as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe smiled and gathered up a few of the muffins in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you got enough there?\" Clark asked, looking at Chloe's full arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe smirked. \"Well...I don't want to be coming down here waking anyone up in the middle of the night because of a muffin craving now do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark and Chloe headed off upstairs as Lana took her food and waved goodbye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois was glad the day was winding down, she was feeling pretty tired, and knew she would need to be up early to work on the article for the Torch. As they left the kitchen, she slipped the half eaten chocolate bar she had started earlier out of her pocket, and finished it off as she made her way upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Lana arrived home to find had eaten the entire energy bar on her way home. It had tasted pretty damn good, she had to admit...perhaps she would ask Lois for some more tomorrow? As she stepped into her house, her stomach suddenly gave a rumble, and she found herself strangely hungry again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird...\" Lana said to herself, rubbing her stomach absent mindedly. \"Maybe I'll have one of those grapefruits as a snack before I go to bed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, Lana had consumed not one, but <i>two</i> of the mega sized grapefruits. She was surprised at just how much food she had consumed this evening, but was relieved that her hunger was finally satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately afterward, she barely made it to her bed before practically collapsing onto her mattress and falling into a deep sleep with all of her clothes still, apart from her shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after midnight, the new moon rose and Lois suddenly woke up feeling very strange. Tiredly, she sat up in her bed, a strange feeling coming from her stomach, she wasn't sure what was causing it, then suddenly remembered she had eaten quite a bit. Lois swung her legs out of bed and felt her bare feet touch the cold floor, she decided to make her way to the bathroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened the door and stepped out of her room, she noticed a light still on in the hall coming from the guest room where Chloe was staying. Perhaps she wasn't the only one feeling bad? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois decided to see what her cousin was up to. She knocked the door, and gently pushed it open, just in time to hear a loud moan. \"Chloe? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could taken another step, Clark hurried out of the room, a look of panic on his face. Lois stumbled back as Clark bumped into her, and Lois fell to the floor, suddenly feeling a lot worse, a dizzy feeling overtook her, and her stomach began to make strange noises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark! Hurry!\" Chloe's panic stricken voice came from within the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois moaned as she began to feel even worse. She looked up at Clark. \"Smallville, what's wrong with Chloe? What the hell's going on?\"</span></div></div>",

What's happening to Chloe?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois pushed past Clark, and was about to step into Chloe's room when he blocked her path. \"Ermm Lois...I wouldn't go in there if I was you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smallville, either you get out of the way, or I <i>knock</i> you out of the way,\" Lois said angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark didn't seem to want to argue further, so Lois pushed past him and into the next room, eager to find out what was wrong with Chloe. Perhaps, she too, had eaten a little too much at dinner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, you okay?\" Lois asked as she stepped through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she actually <i>saw</i> Chloe, Lois's mouth fell wide open. Her cousin was sprawled out on the bed, and her entire body was blue from head to toe - a dark blue. Lois had never seen anything like it. She might have thought that Chloe was choking, but she certainly didn't look as though she was having any difficulty breathing - in fact, she was moaning quietly to herself as she rubbed what appeared to be a very bloated stomach beneath her silk pyjamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been like this since her moaning woke me up,\" Clark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with her?\" Lois asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Clark, shaking his head worriedly. \"I've never seen anything like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud noise came from Lois's stomach, and she began to feel dizzy again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Clark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I'm fine,\" Lois lied, still feeling a little weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, can you hear me?\" Lois asked, kneeling at Chloe's bedside and gazing at her cousins blue face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded in between moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what did this?\" Lois asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe shook her head. \"I...I...don't know...maybe...that...food...you got from that factory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe opened her mouth to speak again, but instead, only ended up saying, \"Urghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhooooooooohhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois still wasn't feeling too good herself.  What if those free food samples <i>were</i> having some kind of effect on Chloe? And hadn't she taken the blueberry muffins? Perhaps that was the cause of her current colour change...<br>\r\nBefore Lois could think anymore about Chloe's strange reaction to the food, she felt her stomach begin to churn, she stumbled back wearily, and sat herself down on the edge of Chloe's bed. What the hell was wrong with her? She wondered. </span></div></div>",

Suddenly, Lois felt something move beneath her hand. In shock, she pulled her hand away from her stomach, and stared down at her midsection, it had almost felt as though her stomach was pushing out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois cast a nervous glance back at Chloe, and noted how large her belly was looking, was she bloated from dinner, or was something else going on here? Suddenly, Lois felt something else move around her stomach, she looked back down at her own chest, and, to her horror, saw her stomach bulging out before her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" Lois exclaimed, gripping her belly firmly in her hands as she stared at it in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark's eyes widened in surprise. \"Lois...it looks like your having the same reaction as Chloe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?!\" Lois snapped back at him as her stomach continued to bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Chloe gave another loud moan, and Lois felt something hit her in the back of the head. She spun around, forgetting about her own problems for a moment, and saw a button had burst off of Chloe's pyjamas. She stared at her cousins swelling belly, which was now growing bigger and bigger before her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...\" Chloe groaned with what might have been pleasure, as her blue belly began to creep out from under her pyjama top. Her top began to ride up, exposing more and more of her pregnant looking belly, her entire body, now completely blue, was swelling up like a balloon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...Chloe...\" Lois gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chloe's burgeoning belly forced another button on her pyjamas to pop open, Lois turned her attention back to her own swelling stomach. It had grown even bigger in the last few seconds, and was growing out at an alarming rate, she seemed to be bloating twice as fast as Chloe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois lifted her shirt up, exposing what was now a small pot belly. Her once firm abs had been covered in a gradually thickening layer of flab. Unlike Chloe however, Lois was not turning blue, and while Chloe's stomach appeared to be firm and round, Lois's looked soft and flabby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lois, your getting fat!\" Clark suddenly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois glared at him. \"I can see that Smallville, why don't you go and get some help instead of just standing there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Clark, awkwardly turning and hurrying out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Clark was gone, Lois felt the top button of her pants give way and burst open, forcing her zipper down and exposing her frilly lace panties. She was grateful that Clark had left before seeing that. Her jeans tightened along her legs, and her shirt began to grow more and more uncomfortable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing Chloe?\" Lois asked her cousin, turning back round to face her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...I'm going to burst!\" Chloe moaned, as strange, blue tears fell from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois wanted to help Chloe, but she had no idea how to do so. Chloe gave another mammoth groan, and, quite suddenly, the rest of the buttons on her silk top exploded off, flying off around the room and ricocheting in different directions. Lois had to duck down to avoid one of them taking her eye out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe's swollen stomach was now fully exposed, as were her breasts. Lois instantly noticed that Chloe's belly was not the only part of her that had grown - her breasts appeared to have shot up by two cup sizes, and were now resting comfortably atop her huge, round gut. Chloe didn't seem to care she was currently exposed, as she continued to wriggle and writhe on the bed, her belly growing larger, and her breasts quivering with the movement of her swollen, blue body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, maybe you should cover up before Clark gets ba,-\" Before Lois could finish her sentence, she heard a loud ripping noise from below her. She looked down apprehensively, but didn't see any tears. She then cast a glance over her shoulder, and saw that the seat of her pants had ripped: her butt was growing too. In fact, her clothes were getting so tight that she was starting to believe that she was growing all over.</span></div></div>",

In any case, both Chloe and Lois continued to expand. However, while Chloe's expansion was starting to slow, Lois's was actually starting to speed up. She was beginning to regret eating so many chocolate bars! All the while, both Chloe's and Lois'  clothes gradually ripped while they were expanding, until they were both completely exposed. By the time the expansion had stopped, the both of their body's had grown fat all over. Chloe looked to be about two hundred pounds, while Lois looked like she was almost twice as big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Clark burst into the room and said \"My parents are going to get some bigger clothes. We don't think a hospital is going to do much for something like this, so they suggested we see if this wears...\", Clark never got a change to finish his sentence, as he had chosen this moment to look up. Although Chloe had been able to get some bed covers over herself, :Lois had been left without any such cover. There, in all her newly fattened glory, stood a naked, \"plus size\" Lois!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark's jaw dropped, and he couldn't help but stare at Lois' newly enlarged body for several seconds. At the site of a fat Lois in the middle of the room, Clark experienced an odd mix of shock and...attraction? Before he could analyze these thoughts. Lois slapped him, but not before he snapped out of it and rolled with Lois' blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop staring, Smallville! I'm not part of a freak show here!\" Lois fumed. Clark just nodded and nervously looked down while slowly backing out of the room, \"Yeah, anyway, I'll just tell my parents to get both of you really big clothes then! I guess we'll figure all this out later!\" With that, Clark practically ran out of the room, both Lois and himself were glad that Chloe had not seen what had happened, as she had been hiding under the bed covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Several hours later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana and Chloe were sitting in the kitchen. Thankfully, the Kents had been able to provide them with very large clothes, which they were now wearing. As far as they could tell, both Chloe and Lois had stopped expanding, and Chloe's color had returned to normal. However, the fact remained that both girls were now FAT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Kents, including Clark, had gone to the food factory to get some answers, Lois and Chloe were sitting around in the kitchen, trying to avoid exposure to the outside world. \"I'm bored, I think I'm going to get something to eat, maybe some ice cream will cheer us up!\" Chloe exclaimed while she got up, raided the fridge, and put the remainder of last night's ice cream into two large bowels. Lois, now seated in two chairs in order to accommodate her extra bulk, replied, \"Are you crazy? Don't you think we have eaten enough as it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe just looked at her and said, \"Yeah, but my new body seems to get really hungry quite often, and I really feel like I need to eat now! You understand, right?\" Lois nodes, her stomach had been growling for almost 2 hours now, and she had to admit it would feel good to indulge herself. \"Besides...\", Chloe said in a nonchalant sort of way, \"We don't exactly have figures to worry about any more. I mean. what's the worst that could happen when we're already fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois agreed and took her large bowel of ice cream. As the two ate, Lois thought about what Chloe had just said. Maybe she was right, maybe they should just make the best of this awkward situation, indulge themselves, and try to have a little fun before they got back to normal. \"Yes,\" a voice in Lois head cut in, \" and for once in your life, you won't have to worry about living up to daddy's expectations of you! You don't have to stick to a strict diet and exercise all the time! You can just relax and eat whatever you want!\" Lois was taken aback by this stray thought. \"Were did that come from?\", she wondered. And yet, Lois had to admit that the idea was sort of appealing. She DID spend a lot of her time, energy, and effort to keep up the perfect body...until now. But there didn't seem to be any point to any of that now! \"Besides\", she privately admitted to herself as she secretly stroked her soft, fat belly underneath the table while eating,\" this new body feels kinda...nice. Comfortable even.\" Before Lois could analyze this thought, Clark burst though the door and exclaimed, \"We have a problem!\"</span></div></div>",

Clark stopped to explain, \"The Smallville foods associate said that, in some of the animal trials for their food, eating their food with dairy products caused the subjects to rapidly gain a small amount of weight, then get an uncontrollable hunger. That would, of course, cause them to eat and gain even more! They also said something about a food label on the samples that should have warned you about eating the food with dairy! Do you two know anything about that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Chloe quickly got one of the food items from off the shelf, and read the warning label before face-palming her head. \"Stupid! It's right there, and we didn't even bother to read it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Let me see that!\" Lois insisted. Reading the label, Chloe's (now) super sized cousin glared at it. \"You're right, the warning is there, but it's in really small print. Besides, it says it should only cause a small amount of weight gain!\" In her frustration, Lois temporarily abandoned modesty to lift up the bottom of her extra-large shirt, revealing her enormous new belly. \"Does THIS look small to you?!\" Lois growled while shaking her gigantic stomach, causing it (and the rest of her body) to jiggle uncontrollably, while Clark stared in fascination. Lois noticed Clark's focused attention on her belly, and raised a questioning eyebrow at him, causing him to (finally) raise his eyes forward and speak. \"No..no it doesn't. When I explained the amount you and Chloe had gained, and Chloe's temporary blueness, they actually seemed quite surprised and apologetic about the whole thing! In fact, they said they would be willing to give both of you a nice  settlement if you offered not to sue! They  might have to go back to formula with their whole food line!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What about Lana?\" Chloe asked. \"She ate some of the food too!\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    Clark shook his head. \"I called her, and she seems to be unaffected. aside from being hungrier than usual last night! I guess whatever she ate wasn't as potent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Lois crossed her large arms, \"Well, that's great for her, Clark. What about that settlement? What will that be like?\" \"They weren't too specific about that. They said they would have to contact you too personally with that information. However, they did say they would hire doctors to figure out how to cure your present condition, and that they would give you financial compensation for any embarrassment or physical/emotional/psychological harm their products may have caused you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The two enlarged cousins stared at each other before Lois replied. \"Well, I guess that doesn't sound so bad. How long do they think it will take to cure us?\" Clark seemed hesitant to answer, but finally replied, \"A few weeks, or months.\" \"Months!\" Chloe looked at Clark in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"They said they've never had a reaction this severe before, especially in humans! It make take time for them and the doctors to figure out how to cure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"But what about school?\" Lois asked. \"Or the Torch?\" Chloe added. \"There is NO WAY we are going to Smallville High looking like this! And I am not going to be held back Another semester!\" Lois exclaimed. Clark seemed unglazed in his reply, \"Already covered. In addition to curing you, and giving you financial compensation, Smallville foods offered to get you two private tutors to home-school you two until you are cured. The General and Mr. Sullivan have already agreed to this arrangement, and I will be do more work at the Torch to pick up the slack for whatever you two can't do at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Thanks Clark!\" Chloe smiled. Lois, on the other hand, had to suppress a shudder at the thought of the General seeing her flabby and out-of-shape like this! \"Will my dad be coming here?!\" Lois asked nervously. Clark hesitated before replying. He could see Lois was nervous at the prospect of her dad seeing her like this, and he briefly considered making her squirm, like she loved to do to him, but thought better of it. It wasn't like a Kent to kick someone when they were down. \"No, he is still in the middle of a tour of duty, he won't be able to come here.\" Lois sighed in relief, but she was still not liking the prospect of having to stay cooped up in the house looking like THIS, even if she did secretly enjoying the feeling of her new, fat body and the prospect of eating whatever she liked and relaxing for a change!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Good then! I'll go tell my parents that you two have agreed to our arrangements!\" With that, Clark nervously glanced at his two friends(although his gaze seemed to linger on Lois a little bit longer) then ran (at human speed) out of the kitchen. Lois furrowed her eyebrows, Clark was acting even weirder than usual now, and she couldn't figure out why.he kept looking at her( and to a lesser extent, her cousin) like he was afraid they would ignite when he looked at them, Instead of of joking around about their condition, or acting calm and collected like he usually did in a crisis, Clark actually seemed nervous around her now. And what was up with him staring at he exposed belly like that? Lois would  get to the bottom of Clark's stranger behavior soon. After all, It wasn't like she would have anything better to do for the next several weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Several weeks pass before Lois discovers the source of Clark's erratic behavior.

Doctors had, so far, been able to cure neither Chloe nor Lois of their \"condition\", so the plus-sized young women were still being home schooled in their respective houses, Refusing to go outside, and with nothing to do but schoolwork, and articles for the Torch, Lois had gotten REALLY bored, So she had taken up watching Clark like a hawk when he was around the house to see what had gotten into Clark lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Lois almost pitied the guy. Apart from his usual schoolwork, chores, football practices, and weirdly timed disappearances, Clark was also having to take care of Chloe and her. These \"extra\" tasks, including doing extra work for the Torch, bringing the girls their assignments for the paper, and getting them more food and clothing when they ran out or outgrew them (which happened pretty frequently due to the girls' hunger induced binges and constant weight gain), were obviously exhausting Clark, and causing him to stress out quite a bit! But that wasn't even the worst part for him! Lois had noticed that Clark's eyes would often drift toward her body now. Despite the farm boy's obvious efforts to keep his eyes to himself, the 375 pound women couldn't help but notice that Clark would often find himself staring at Lois expanded breasts, massive belly, or shelf butt. After every occurrence of this kind of behavior, Clark would catch himself, blush, then rapidly turn away. Lois found herself laughing every time she thought about Smallville trying to suppress his wandering eyes. It was so obvious what was going on. Although Lois wouldn't have guessed it in a million years, Lois had finally discovered one of Clark's dirty little secrets: He liked BIG girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Several days after Lois' discovery of Clark's hidden inclinations, she finally decided how to exploit this piece of information to her own advantage! And the best part was, if all went well, both her and Clark would get something out of it! It was only fair, after all that Clark had done for her the past 3 weeks! Therefore, that Friday after Clark got home from football practice, and John and Martha Kent had left for Metropolis for the weekend, Lois used her massive body to corner Clark in the bathroom after he had showered and gotten dressed. Needless to say, Clark was surprised! \"What are you doing in here, Lois! I just got done taking a shower. If you had gotten in here sooner, I wouldn't have had clothes on!\" \"Relax, Smallville, it's not like that hasn't happened before! Besides, I have a proposition for you.\" \"What are you talking about?!\", Clark demanded to know. \"You see...\" Lois replied, \"I know your secret. And I am really bored.\" <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     Clark started to panic. How could Lois have found out he was an alien!? And what, he wondered, did that have to do with Lois being bored?<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n      Lois almost laughed at Clark's panicked expression, \"It's nothing to be ashamed of, Clark! I'm sure a lot of guys like fat girls!\" Lois realized that she had just referred to herself as \"fat\" for the first time since this whole ordeal had started, but just shrugged it off. Who cares? It was just a word anyway! Clark gulped, as his face suddenly reddened from embarrassment.He supposed this wasn't as bad as Lois finding out he was an alien, but it was a lot more embarrassing! It was true, although Clark had liked Lana before he had even started \"liking\" girls, as soon as he did start liking girls that way, he had been attracted to heavyset girls. However, Clark quickly realized this made him different than most of his male peers, and hid his \"preferences\" from other people, just as he did with any of his traits that made him \"different\". But now Lois had found him out. Clark sighed and prepared for yet another joke at his expense, courtesy of Lois Lane, It never came. Tired of waiting, Clark spoke, \" I don't know how you found out, but If you are going to make fun of me for this, I would prefer you get it over with!\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n     Lois looked at Clark with an amused grin.\"It was pretty obvious, Clark, with you staring at me and all. And I'm not here to make fun of you...\" Lois moved, letting a surprised Clark out of the corner of the bathroom. \"...I actually thought we could use each other for awhile...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Clark's eyes widened for a moment. Surely Lois didn't mean? \"What do you mean, Lois?\" Lois rolled her eyes, Clark could be so oblivious sometimes. \"Do I have to spell it out for you Clark? You're a single, decent looking guy who likes fat girls, and I am, for now, a fat girl who is REALLY bored from staying in this house all the time, and I haven't been with a guy in over a month! You do the math!\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n       Clark was VERY surprised now, as he had never even thought of Lois (okay, maybe a few times) that way before she had gotten fat, and he certainly never thought she would like him that way! \"That's very flattering Lois, but I can't. I've never actually done...'that', and I wanted to...\" \"Save yourself for Lana?\" Lois cut him off. Clark just nodded. Lois had to suppress a laugh, \" You aren't even a couple right now. Besides, wouldn't you rather  know what you are doing when that day 'oh so inevitably ' arrives?\" Lois failed to hold back her sarcasm on that last remark and she could see that Clark was on the verge of getting angry, although she could see he was actually thinking about Lois' offer now. She decided to change tactics. \"Look Clark, I know you like Lana a lot, but it's obvious you have a thing for big girls too. We both know Lana will never be fat, so why don't you take this opportunity to 'have some fun' with a fatty, and get it out of your system before you and Lana end up 'happily ever after' together?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Clark thought about this for a second. Lois' offer definitely appeared to be genuine, and she had made a couple of good points. Although he like Lana a great deal, Clark knew she could be a little vain about her appearance, and would never let herself gain weight. And it's not like his parents, or anybody else for that matter, were here to catch them. Still, Clark feared taking Lois up on her offer would make things awkward between him and his friend/rival, and how would Chloe feel about this if she found out? \"What about Chloe, how would she react if we did this, and she found out?\" Clark asked. Lois paused for a second, then answered. \"Look, Clark, this may be hard for you to believe, but she's over you. Even if she found out, I don't think it would threaten our friendships with her. Besides, we won't let her find out. And the two of us can go back to 'hating' each other afterward.\" Lois had purposely used the word \"hate\" in a joking manner, so Clark wouldn't take it seriously. She wouldn't admit it, but she really liked the boy scout. Not in THAT way of course, that would be crazy,right? But he was attractive, and she trusted him, so she didn't see any problem with this \"arrangement:\" she was proposing. Clark tried one final tactic to extract himself from the situation. \"What if I just say no, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Lois frowned and wondered why Clark was resisting her so much, she knew he found her present form attractive. Why did he ALWAYS have to be such a boy scout. Lois finally decided she had enough of Clark dragging his feet in the dirt. He was going to have fun with her one way or another, even if she would have to strong arm him! \"He'll thank me later\" Lois thought to herself before replying. \"If you say no, then I will just have to tell Lana about your fascination with fat women!\" Lois replied with a smirk. \"You wouldn't...she wouldn't believe you anyway!\" But Clark knew it was no use, he knew Lana would almost certainly believe Lois if she blabbed to Lana. After all, Lois wasn't smitten with Clark, why would she lie about that? Defeated, Clark just looked helplessly at Lois. \"Why would you do that?! She would never want me then! Are you that desperate?\" Lois was angry now, but she tried to keep it under raps so she could get what she wanted. \"I'm never desperate!\" Lois lied. \"But you are always so stressed out and nervous I thought you could you use some fun in your life for once! Besides, I really should tell Lana, anyway! Do you really think it's far to pursue her without telling her something like that?!\" Clark nearly hung his head in shame. He didn't want to admit it but maybe Lois had a point there. Still, there was one thing nagging at the back of Clark's brain, a truth about himself he knew, but didn't want to acknowledge,\"But that idea is crazy anyway. I don't like Lois that way right? Or at least I didn't before she got fat! Right?\". Still, it was a tempting offer. Finally, Clark made his decision...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \", I've decided that...\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, it was what she wanted, but she didn't want Clark THAT badly, right? \"Of course not,\" Lois told herself, \"You're just excited because you haven't been able to do this for awhile. It's just a stress reliever, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Clark was having similar conflicting thoughts. He couldn't understand why he was going along with this, even under \"duress\". He doubted Lois would have gone through with her threat if he hadn't agreed to her offer, and he could have convinced Lana Lois was lying even if she did, but he decided to go along with it anyway. That was an uncharacteristic move for one Clark Kent, who \"only had eyes for Lana Lang\". Even so, Clark had a nagging feeling this course of action MEANT something, but he couldn't (or wouldn't let himself) figure out what that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Let's get done to business, then,\" Lois spoke while giving Clark a seductive look before lying down on Clark's bed. Clark joined her with a strange mixture of reluctance and enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         (Fade to black, like in the show, and fast forward about a week)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Clark and Lois continued in their \"arrangement\" for another week, careful to keep their new status (whatever that was) a secret from everyone else. This required them to be sneaky, but Clark was an expert at keeping secrets, and Lois wasn't half bad in that category, either. Throughout the week, Lois and Chloe (Clark had visited his reporter friend's house several times in the week, although he had trouble looking her in the eye now) had both gained a lot more weight. However, Lois had obviously gained even more than Chloe, gaining 30 pounds in a single week!. Although Lois knew part of this effect came from the weird food she had eaten, she suspected her the new found \"companionship\" with Clark had made her even less anxious about her eating habits and appearance. Smallville certainly didn't seem to mind her eating habits or weight gain one bit! To tell the truth, Lois was enjoying her new lifestyle, and had to admit she might miss it (and maybe Clark) a little after she was cured! \"Stop thinking like that, Lois!\" She told herself, \"Your are going to be thin and beautiful again soon, that will be worth a few sacrifices!\" But Lois was starting to wonder if that last thought would actually be true or not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Clark had similar misgivings. As hard as he had tried to keep things between Lois and himself \"professional\", he had been forced to admit to himself that he actually had feelings for Lois, which had been there even before all this craziness started, although he doubted she would ever return them. He didn't even know how he felt about Lana anymore. Therefore, between the prospect of Lois losing her new figure, and him losing her, Clark was secretly starting to dread the day that the doctors found a \"cure\" for Lois. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     In the meantime though, both Clark and Lois were \"making due\" with their current situation, and trying to keep it a secret from everyone. At the end of the week, however, they finally slipped up, as Lois had left a small dab of her unique brand of lipstick on Clark's neck from a kiss that she had forgotten to rub off him. Thankfully, the mark was so small the Kents didn't notice it, but when Clark came to Chloe's house to see how she was doing, she saw it immediately. Being a reporter, she had an eye (and nose) for details, which also told her that the lipstick on Clark was Lois's unique, homemade variety. She immediately called Clark on this, and he was forced to tell Chloe what had been going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After letting the new sink in for a little bit, Chloe felt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

You wouldn't be agreeing to this arrangement unless you already felt a strong connection to Lois, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark nodded. Over the course of the week, he had come to realize his feeling for Lois went back for at least several months, and were far more than just psychical. \"Yeah, I guess e you are right about that, but so what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe sighed, she hated to burst Clark's bubble, but she had to tell him something. \"Clark, I love my cousin, I really do. She's one of my best friends, and she has a lot of good qualities, but... between you and me,she has had a lot of flings, Lois can be very \"detached\" when it comes to psychical intimacy. She may not share your feelings; and even if she does, she may be to proud to admit it, even to herself. I just don't want you to get hurt Clark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark nodded his head in understanding. \"I know. But I like..no, I love her too much not to take that risk. Besides, If I back out now, Lois will know something has changed, I'm just going to have to wait to see what she does after the doctors find a cure for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll still want her even after she loses all of the weight?\" Clark gave her a look of surprise he had never told Chloe about his love of fat girls, so how did she know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe read the look on Clark's face and smiled. \"Clark,I'm a reporter,remember? I've known about your preoccupation with larger women since we were sophomores. In fact..\"Chloe blushed a little,\"If I had thought I had actually had a shot with you at that time, I would probably have started packing on the pounds on purpose! But that's ancient history now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Clark just nodded. \"Yeah I would still want her after she lost the weight. I just hope she feels the same way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral weeks later..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     All this time while Lois and Chloe's bodies were relentlessly growing bigger &amp; heavier, Lana's frontier had also been in continuous expansion in its OWN way. That first night, Lana had been very lucky to return home alive and unharmed. Moments after she pulled out of the Kent Farm driveway, Lana unexpectedly started feeling very drowsy and several times her car almost went off the road on the way back home to Smallville. Slowing her car down, Lana took twice as long as usual to return to the Talon and her upstairs apartment there. Dragging the over-stuffed bag of goodies that Martha had packed upstairs with her, Lana set it down on the floor next to her bedroom door, stripped off all her clothes and then fell back first onto her bed naked. Within seconds of Lana's head hitting her pillow she was fast asleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A couple of hours later when Clark called, Lana was quite annoyed with him waking her from such a wonderfully sound sleep. When she had moved into the Talon, Lana quite foolishly bought one of those phones that after every 3 rings, rings louder and louder if it isn't picked up. So she was quite understandably upset but when Clark asked, \"Lana, do you feel alright? Lois and Chloe aren't feeling well and we think it's from those samples you girls ate from Smallville Foods.\" Lana's anger at Clark instantly evaporated when she realized he was very concerned that since she lived alone, getting sick might leave her stranded in her apartment for many hours or possibly days before help would arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Since nothing had happened yet to Lana and she only felt hungrier than normal, Clark didn't think to warn her about not mixing dairy with any Smallville Foods product. So when Lana's very loud growling stomach woke her up 40 minutes earlier than usual the next morning, she cooked up an omelet with a lot of goat cheese. Instead of her normal 2 egg omelet, Lana cracked open SIX and would've opened more except she ran out. While cooking breakfast, Lana also tossed in half of the bamboo shoots which accidentally fell into the bag while Martha filled it the previous night. She even ate two of those enormous grapefruits rind, seeds and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     When Smallville Foods learned during its development about the unfortunate interaction of dairy with its products, the lawyers told them to immediately stop all research and put the warning notice on all its products. So they never learned about mixing more than one of its products with diary in the same meal caused a far different reaction. Something Miss Lana Lang and no-one else would ever experience first-hand. The first and most important part was Lana became bigger differently at a far less noticeable pace than either Lois or Chloe. So two and a half months later, when Christmas arrived Chloe now tipped the upstairs scales at 290 pounds and Lois had just passed 525, they and the Kent's saw for themselves just how much Lana had (unbeknown-est to them) grown way, WAY up AND out !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally sated by her unusually large breakfast and with nothing else to do, Lana decided that morning to go in early to Smallville High and try working off some of the excess energy she was filled with in the weight room. Since Lana was a Varsity cheerleader she had priority when the football team wasn't using the room. Arriving about an hour before her first class, Lana was surprised at how much quicker than usual her normal weight routine went. Taking a shower before her first class, Lana was almost late to class due to her primping in the locker room. Everything seemed a little off to her, but she just let it slide. Nothing unexpected happened in any of her morning classes that day. Twice she passed Clark in a hall between classes and he said nothing. Lana noticed the glum look on Clark's face and just figured (accurately) that he was thinking about the 2 sick girls at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch-time didn't come a minute too soon for Lana, because her stomach was already churning from her not having eaten anything for 6 hours. Other than almost emptying out her wallet, Lana was a little surprised that she took FOUR times her normal amount for lunch. She then ate 1/4th of one of the energy bars with 2 heaping cherry vanilla ice cream sundaes for dessert. Then instead of making a bee-line to the School pool right after her last class, Lana drove out to the Kent farm to see how Chloe and Lois were doing. Raiding the pile of Smallville Foods food was a bonus for her. Arriving unexpectedly, Martha was a bit flustered when Lana asked her to see the 2 sick cousins. Saying, \"Wait here a minute Lana, I'll go upstairs and ask if either of them feels well enough yet to have any visitors.\" Martha then went upstairs. While she waited for an answer, Lana wandered into the kitchen. Seeing that the remaining food that was still stacked very high in the corner, Lana took the rest of those really tasty bamboo shoots and several of the long-haired &amp; hour-glass shaped potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a grocery sack to take them out to her car, Lana returned to the kitchen before Martha. Martha told Lana that neither girl wanted to see her. Lana wasn't  hurt hearing that, she figured they were still to sick to want any company. Noticing Lana longingly looking at the pile of food, Martha said, \"Lana, the people from Smallville Foods are coming by in a little while to collect all of that. The factory manager said they needed to test EVERYTHING that's already been eaten. Do you want me to give them your address?\" Lana replied, \"No Martha that won't be necessary. Like I told Clark last night, other than having a bigger appetite than usual I feel fine. Actually Mrs. Kent, I feel better than fine. So I guess that food settled in my stomach much better than it did with Lois and Chloe. {As Lana patted her 19-inch waist} Besides, it wouldn't hurt me to gain a few pounds.\" (Being only 5' 1\", Lana weighed just 6 stone [84 pounds]).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly returning to the Talon, Lana carried her new bag of goodies inside to her kitchen. After putting it all away Lana saw she still had some time left, so she drove over to the school pool. Lana planned on getting in an hour's worth of swimming before her shift started that evening at the Talon. After doing laps for just 20 minutes, Lana hoisted herself out of the pool. It was after just a few minutes of swimming that every time Lana did a flip turn her bikini top started riding up on her bust growing uncomfortably tight. Thinking to herself maybe I shouldn't have had that second sundae at lunch, Lana showered and dressed for work. She grew a bit annoyed when her normally slightly loose bra felt unusually snug when she put it on. Out loud to the (she thought) empty locker room Lana said, \"Man, it's not that time of the month yet, I really SHOULDN'T have had that second sundae at lunch.\" (Lana's one of those unlucky girls who retains a LOT of water every month during her period. That's why she buys and usually wears slightly loose lingerie.) <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Among the half dozen occupants of Smallville Highs swimming pool girls locker room right then was one Theodora (Teddy Bear) Brown. No girl at school had a more appropriate name. In addition to a pair of the most gorgeous big chocolate brown eyes that perfectly complemented her super-silky soft dark brown ass-length hair, Teddy had a naturally light brown skin tone befitting the Hawaiian ancestry of BOTH her grandfathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddy's family had settled in Smallville a year after her TV show had gone off the air. That happened when she started 10th grade. Since Teddy performed under a stage name in the movies and both of her TV shows, and then had grown from a petite 28A-22-30 body to a more voluptuous 32C-22-37 while growing 5 inches taller that year. She FINALLY exceeded (but just barely) 5 feet tall when Teddy started 11th grade in Smallville, so no one there approached her inquiring about her famous identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing Lana's voice echoing in the locker room, Teddy decided to start keeping a close eye on Lana. A task that wouldn't be difficult at all considering that in addition to usually swimming the same afternoons, they shared 2 classes that semester. It was 2 1/2 weeks later when Teddy took Lana aside at Smallville's annual Halloween party in the County Convention Hall that she asked Lana about her now larger body (but ONLY if someone looked REAL close).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpset that her secret was out, Lana was quite reluctant to own up to anything more than she MUST be having a late growth spurt. Teddy then said, \"Oh come on now Lana, you think I just got off the boat yesterday. For the past month now [stretching the truth there a little] I've been watching you closely at lunch-time. If I had eaten as much food as you do every day, I'm PRETTY SURE that I would've gained at least 50 pounds! What's your secret, Lana?\" Now realizing that she hadn't been as careful hiding her growing hunger as she thought, Lana panics and says something she immediately regrets saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the middle of 11th grade, Lana started wearing platform or high heeled shoes a lot in school and around town. It was during one of those phases when things were going good between Clark and her. At the time, Lana was nearly a foot shorter than him and was getting stiff necks from looking up so far when they were together. So with her height changing from day-to-day, by the time she started 12th grade everyone in Smallville had stopped paying any attention to Lana's constantly changing height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich fortuitously turned into a god-send when Lana's body started growing larger in all THREE dimensions from her suddenly much larger and more numerous meals caused from eating all those really delicious items from Smallville Foods. For that year's Halloween party, Lana decided to wear her tallest platform shoes with the built-in high heels. Combined they now made her over a couple inches taller than Clark [had he shown up at the party]. She had decided to go as \"the Bride of Frankenstein.\" Without even trying to, Lana won 3rd place for best costume. Theodora won for showing up as \"Cat-woman\". It was her self-designed and built realistically moving 30-inch tail that clinched it for Teddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Lana was such an upbeat girl and basically trusted everyone, she wasn't alarmed when Teddy had said, \"Lana there's something I have to ask you about that's really important <u>and it can't wait any longer.</u>\" Lana immediately assumed that Teddy wanted to know if any homework was assigned in Trigonometry that day. Lana had noticed that Theodora had missed class that day. When Teddy told Lana that she knew she was eating an impossible amount of food, Lana blurted out a several things she immediately regretted about the samples she was still eating every day from Smallville Foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana then fainted when Teddy said, \"So THAT'S why you've recently grown a couple of inches.\" Sometime later, after Teddy had finally revived Lana with some non-alcoholic fruit punch, Lana just sat there speechless. She had incorrectly assumed that her clothes had grown tighter on her the past few days because it was her time of the month and those samples were probably making her retain <u>a lot</u> more water than usual. After promising everyone involved to keep it a secret, Lana was shown just how fat Chloe and Lois had already grown after only TWO days from the samples. So Lana hadn't even considered that her body was slowly and evenly expanding in ALL directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana and Theodora left the party, for the Talon, right after having their pictures taken receiving their trophies. Teddy had been wrong about Lana's change in size. It turned out that she had already gained 2 3/4 inches in height. In addition to THAT Lana had grown just over FOUR inches in her bust and her bra had moved up a full cup size and then some. A major reason why nobody else had yet noticed Lana's growing figure is a couple days after Lana ate her first energy bar, a strong cold front rolled into Smallville. Everyone started wearing heavier clothing and larger (warmer) overcoats. Also, when Lana went swimming after school, the girls locker-room was normally pretty empty. So her suddenly enlarging frontier was safely hidden from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the blue, Teddy then offered to help Lana keep her growing figure a secret for as long as possible. Asking,\"Why?\" Lana was stunned when Teddy surprised her by first giving her a unexpectedly strong bear hug. [That's where Theodora had gotten her nick-name.] Teddy replied, \"Lana, I don't know if you've noticed but for some reason, I'm the shrimp in my family. I would dearly love having a girl-friend much taller than me. Especially one who came over a lot doing home-work. I've grown real tired of my barely 14-year old sister heckling me about <u>being AT LEAST 6 inches shorter than her,</u> and given her current age, she probably still has a lot more growing to do! Grateful for an ally in her growing situation, Lana immediately said, \"YES!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right after Lana saw Martha Kent at the family farm the day after the 3 girls ate those samples from Smallville Foods, Lana called a former classmate who was now a Sophomore at Kansas State who was majoring in Agri-Business. She made an appointment to see her earlier the following evening for her help. Sara-elena Ursula Stefania Ingrid Quartermain had as her Ukrainian-born grand-father often said in his thick Russian accent, \"My girl doesn't have a green thumb, she has <u>TWO GREEN HANDS</u> \" [He was referring to all of the 1st-place ribbons she won at 4-H and FFA {Future Farmers of America} fairs as a child. Susi Q as everyone called her possessed the knack for coaxing any kind of crop to grow much bigger and tastier than normally expected. She also won 2 state championships while competing against adults while still attending Smallville High. Something no-one else had ever done before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Martha told Lana about the people from Smallville Foods reclaiming all of the remaining samples she wanted to find out what she could about everything she had in her possession. The next afternoon promptly at 5:30 just as promised, Lana arrived at Susi's Sorority House at Kansas State. Susi was waiting for her on the front porch. Both girls quickly went to her over-sized dorm suite. After introducing Lana to 2 of her 3 room-mates, Susi quickly shooed them out for their talk. First off, Lana asked Susi if any of the bamboo shoots she had were still viable enough to re-grow. Susi then asked, \"Lana, wouldn't it be a whole lot easier for you to just buy some more from the store you bought these from?\" A little reluctantly Lana then proceeded telling Susi everything she knew about the Smallville Foods samples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending 40 minutes thinking about Lana's request, Susi agreed to help her any way she could. Susi then carefully examined every bamboo shoot Lana had brought with her and pronounced most of them as seeming to be alright and she would grow and study them for Lana. Susi then gave Lana back the remaining shoots she felt were not cultivatable to eat. To thank Susi Q for her help, Lana invited her out for dinner at an all-you-can eat buffet she past near the Sorority House. They stayed there for 90 minutes while Lana made a serious dent in their offerings. Watching Lana shoveling the food down her throat with both hands, Susi felt several pangs of jealousy. She thought to herself, \"Man, I wish I could put it away like Lana does and have such a nice trim waist.\" Being Slavic among other nationalities, Susi kept a <u>very close</u> watch on her calories least she started ballooooning up like her 6' 2\" mother who currently weighed 30 stone (420 pounds).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning Susi Q to her Sorority, Lana drove back home to Smallville much happier than when she left that day from school. Tossing several bamboo shoots into her goat cheese omelet every OTHER morning, Lana's supply was almost gone when Susi called Lana telling her to come to Kansas State right away. When Lana saw how tall the plants had grown in just a couple of weeks she exclaimed, \"WOW, I didn't know bamboo grew <b>THAT</b> fast.\" Susi replied, \"Lana <u><b>NO</b></u> species of bamboo or anything else for that matter grows any wheres near as fast as these samples have. Lana I'm really scared about this. Maybe you shouldn't have been eating them so regularly. Just think if people started growing <i>as fast or even worse </i>what if they grew as tall as these plants seem to imply. We'd soon be over-flowing with real <b>LIVE</b> Giants, and not just the sports kind.\" Would you want to live in a world like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana then told Susi, \"Susi Q, you're over-reacting. If those bamboo shoots could <u>really make someone gigantic almost over-night</u> with as much as I've eaten the past couple of weeks, I'd guess I should probably be 8 or 9 feet tall by now.\" Susi then said, \"Well Lana, you're a little taller than I am now but when you visited me less than 2 weeks ago, I know you were CLEARLY over half a foot shorter. How do you explain that?\" Lana replied, \"Oh that's easy {pulling up her full-length dress} I'm wearing some of my platform shoes today.\" Conceding the issue, Susi was still very concerned that continuing her consumption of the Bamboo shoots would soon have <i>some kind of deleterious effect</i> on Lana. Collecting most of the potted bamboo plants, Lana just waved off Susi's concern saying as she left the suite, \"Susi Q, don't worry about it. If nothings happened so far, it's not going to start now.\" Seeing the great look of concern on Susi's face, Lana promised to call right away if she suddenly became any bigger than she currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later at the Halloween party, when Theodora pointed out to Lana that she HAD grown taller AND bustier, Lana was torn over whether or not she SHOULD call Susi. Lana was sure that Susi would insist Lana stop eating the bamboo shoots. She liked her new size and didn't think it would hurt anyone if she grew <u>just a little bit BIGGER</u>. Lana rationalized to herself, who would it hurt anyway. So she didn't call Susi Q the next day like she had promised. In fact, when Susi Q came home for the Thanksgiving holiday she accidentally (and literally) bumped into Lana just outside the Talon, Susi was furious with Lana. Not only had she not told Susi about her new stature or bust, she could also clearly see that Theodora had grown a lot taller than she should have since school started in September.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shortly after closing the Talon for the night, Theodora arrived to help Lana with their joint problem. Even though she had already grown several inches taller in less than 2 months, no-one other than Theodora knew it and Lana would do anything to make sure that Smallville Foods didn't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Susi woke up half an hour later, the 2 teens were still stumped over what to do with Susi. Since it was Thanksgiving weekend Lana offered Susi some of her leftovers. Once she started in on it, Lana was stunned at the pace that Susi consumed the potato salad she had forgotten to take to Teddy's house. [Teddy's mother had invited Lana over for Thanksgiving to thank her for helping Teddy in school.] Lana hadn't consider the possible side effects of using a couple of the voluptuously shaped potatoes to make the potato salad Susi ended up eating. Lana was just as surprised as Teddy and Susi were a couple mornings later. Although she was already a stocky 6' 4\" (1.93 m) woman, Susi Q had managed to keep her weight a little under 200 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour-and-a-half after finishing off the extra-large bowl of potato salad, Susi really got the munchies and didn't stop until she had nearly emptied all of Lana's pantry shelves. When she was finally full of food, Susi had become completely immobile in Lana's living room. She didn't wake up until more than 30 hours later and by then had transformed. Now 6' 6 3/4\" tall (a full 2 meters), Susi Q sported an hour-glass figure that would've made Jayne Mansfield envious and look like a 14-year old teen in comparison. Susi's copper-red hair was now a little darker, grown out more than a foot longer and become much silkier to the touch. Now in the same boat with Lana, Susi eagerly listened to Lana for tips on hiding (mostly) her brand-new enhancements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That evening when she weighed finally herself, learning that she had gained over 40 pounds during her growth surge of the past few days Susi promptly fainted! Now terrified she may continue getting a lot heavier like her mother and a lot fatter like Lois &amp; Chloe, she immediately tried getting a hold of Lana. Lana blissfully unaware of Susi's panic had turned off her phone while she took the Talon's end-of-month inventory. Three days later, when Lana finally looked at her waiting messages she promptly called Susi. By then, Susi had calmed down a lot. In addition to having lost several pounds, Susi stayed an F-cup while she gained just over 3 more inches to her bust, while she waited for Lana's return phone call to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo disguise her sudden growth at Kansas State during Thanksgiving, Susi secretly stopped wearing the <u>very high</u> heels she had worn for years and switched to only wearing flats.

She would return to start the Spring semester happily sporting her newly much improved body. To help Lana and Teddy Bear protect \"their\" growing secret, if she was asked, \"How on Earth did you grow so much recently?\" Susi Q was prepared to pretend to have <u><i>\"accidentally\"</i></u> eaten <b>ALL</b> of her brand new and untested formula for improving plant growth &amp; germination. She was willing to loose some or even all of her lab privileges to keep the <i>true secret</i> of her growth hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Early on Christmas Eve, when Lana told Susi &amp; Teddy that she would leave for the Kent farm at 11 a.m. on Christmas morning she neglected to mention she wouldn't be driving there. Although close to freezing outside, Lana (who was no longer affected by the cold) walked there at a <i>very brisk </i>pace. She arrived over half an hour after the girls did. By then, the jig was up. When Martha opened the door for her unexpected visitors, she gasped at their new size. Since she now essentially lived in the living room, Lois was the next to see them and instantly grew envious of their new stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind immediately locked on how much <u><b>MORE</b></u> weight she could gain if she was as tall as either of those girls. Less than 10 minutes after their arrival, the 2 girls had spilled all the beans and Lois wasn't happy with the looks Clark was giving both of them. She already figured that Clark was <i>ALSO</i> wondering how they <b>[and especially LANA]</b> would look a couple hundred pounds <u>or more</u> heavier. After all, at their new heights the additional weight wouldn't be as obvious as it currently was with the less than 5-1/2 foot tall Chloe &amp; somewhat taller Lois. Especially now that Susi Q was <b>8-1/2 foot tall</b> !! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>A few days earlier:</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her first day home from school for the Christmas holidays, Susi had visited Lana at her apartment above the Talon. Having not yet realized the source of her new height and currently fabulous 38F bust was the nearly pornographic potatoes from Smallville Foods, she baked all but two of the remaining potatoes for dinner. Smothering them with insane amounts of sour cream, about an hour after she finished eating several of them Susi suddenly became enormously hungry and nearly cleaned out Lana's entire pantry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on that evening after Lana ate the remaining 3 potatoes with the last of her Smallville Foods grapefruit, she leisurely consumed the Talon's entire food supply when the <u>munchies hit her</u> shortly before she retired for the night. When she had <u>finally</u> stopped eating Susi Q promptly fell into a deep sleep (probably from sheer exhaustion) for nearly 40 hours while her body elongated further and blossomed into its current <u><i>uber-size</i></u> and <u>now</u> sporting a 50Q bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Returning to Christmas noon at the Kent farm:</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after finishing her meal, Lana excused herself from the table quickly dashing to the nearest bathroom. Locking the door behind her, Lana started crying more than she had ever done in her life. She immediately knew <i>or actually <b>THOUGHT</b> she knew</i> that this time she had lost Clark for good. The expression on his face when he saw her in her wonderfully busty and nearly 7 foot tall body was <u>absolutely nothing</u> what she had hoped <i>(and prayed)</i> for. Martha was the first to go looking for Lana. So not knowing about Clark's current situation with Lois, Martha tried (unsuccessfully) cheering Lana up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It was nothing like the daggers Lois shot at Lana. After being accidentally warned about Lana's reason for accepting the Kent's offer for sharing Christmas lunch at the farm, Lois was fuming that she couldn't say <b><i>ANYTHING</i></b> without revealing her relationship with Clark to everyone there (except for Chloe who, of course, already knew everything). So when Lana dashed to the restroom to cry, Lois relaxed her guard. Which ended up starting a firestorm with the Kent's before sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lana exited the bathroom with obviously tear-streaked eyes, Clark looked up from his conversation with Teddy. She had pretty much filled Clark in about what Lana had been doing the past 2 1/2 months, that he hadn't noticed. One thing Lana hadn't told anyone yet was <u><i><b>JUST HOW MUCH WEIGHT</b></i></u> she had gained since eating her first <i>\"free sample\"</i> from Smallville Foods. The only way that Lana was able to burn off the excess energy from all those energy bars she religiously consumed every day was to swim furiously in the pool and exercise increasingly larger weights later and later into the night at Smallville High's gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that she had cried, Clark approached offering his sympathy. That only served to cause Lana to start crying again and she then immediately dashed out of the Kent's house. Unable to use his super-speed with so many people at the farm, Clark stood there helpless as he watched Lana run all the way back to the Talon in less than a minute. The perplexed look on Clark's face when he realized just how <b>FAST</b> she had run home, mystified the others. It was nearly an hour later when Lana finally answered her phone. When Lana filled Clark in about her current vital statistics he fainted, which thoroughly infuriated Lois. She didn't like it one bit that Lana apparently was now back in the picture.</span></div></div>",

Best of all, winter vacation had started yesterday, and Chloe was now helping Lois and Clark \"cover their tracks\" so the Kents wouldn't suspect anything! In fact, Chloe was currently letting them \"stay over at my house to help me get ready for the back to school issue\", while her dad wasn't home, of course. In reality, Clark and a rotund  Lois were making out (and progressing from there) in the Sullivan's guest bedroom while a similarly fattened  Chloe watched TV downstairs, with the volume at max so the \"couple\" upstairs could \"express themselves\" without being heard. \", They TOTALLY owe me for this one!\" Chloe thought. This scene was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone, which had been called five times before. After screaming upstairs for Clark and Lois to quite down, Chloe picked up the phone. It was one of the doctors. \"I'm sorry to keep calling you miss Sullivan, but we think we may have had a breakthrough.\" \"You mean like a cure?!\" Chloe was excited  at the prospect, but fearful that this would mean her cousin would drop  her best friend. \"Yes, but the situation is more complex then that. You and miss Lane should come back to the lab , I will explain more there.\" Chloe was puzzled , and was thinking of Clark again. \"Can anyone come with us?\" \"I'm afraid not. This is purely confidential. Only you and miss Lane can come. You'll see why you get here.\" \"Ok, we will be there soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After breaking Clark and Lois up and explaining the situation to them, Lois and Chloe endured a tense ride to the lab , Finally, after their arrival, a couple of doctors  escorted the two  heavyset girls into the building and promptly asked them to split up to be consulted separately  by the head physician . Lois wondered why the doctors were being so secretive about finding a cure for their condition. Her nervousness only mounted when she heard Chloe screaming with joy . \"Darn, I guess that means they really did find a cure!\" Lois thought. Although she hadn't admitted it to herself, Lois had been fearing this day would come for awhile now. Sure she could be \"thin, beautiful, and healthy\" again , but the recent high school grad knew she would miss her recently picked up  lifestyle, And as for Clark...well, she was actually starting to think she would miss having him around as more than just a roommate. After all, there was no way he'd be attracted to Lois at her skinniest. \" That doesn't mean I.love him or anything though, right!?\" Lois realized with a shock that she did. Over the past few months, she had actually allowed herself to fall for the boy-scout. Not that it mattered. She HAD to take the cure. Otherwise, the General would disown his fat daughter and she would be left broke and unable to attend college again. Finally, after almost an hour spent in a mix of both fear and excitement, the head medical researcher stepped in and greeted Lois with a smile and a perplexing statement.\"Well, miss Lane, I have some good news, and  some more good news!\" \"Ok, what's the first bit of good news.\" \"We found a cure for your condition.\" \"I figured that part out already.\" Lois couldn't suppress a sigh after her reply.She knew she would have to go through with it,but Lois would REALLY miss being fat. The doctor noticed Lois's less than upbeat reaction. \"I see that this news doesn't excite you as much as your cousin, Is something wrong? This conversation is completely confidential.\" Lois hesitated, then reluctantly replied, \"I've just gotten used to this new lifestyle of being lazy and eating whatever I want. I guess that sounds pretty stupid to you.\" Not really Miss Lane. In fact, I think the other bit of  news may raise your spirits.\" \"What's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The doctor smiled. \"There's actually no medical need for you to take the cure. Apparently the formula in the food you ate, in addition to increasing your weight and (temporarily) your appetite, also mutated your cells; allowing them to adjust to any weight, bodily composition, or level of physical activity you could put them though, and still be  healthy.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"May I be blunt, miss Lane?\" \"Please.\" \" If you don't take the cure, you can be as lazy and gluttonous as you want, and no matter how fat you  get, you will never have health or mobility problems, Of course, you will never be skinny again, either.\" Lois couldn't help but smile, despite her lack of hunger pains the last couple of weeks, the super-sized teen had continued to gorge herself more and more lately, and was very pleased with the idea that she could continue her lifestyle and her relationship with Clark, unabated. Immediately though, a dismal thought hit Lois, and she frowned before asking the doctor a question. \"But if I don't take the cure, I don't get the settlement, right? Then I wouldn't be able to afford to go to college. I mean, you work for Smallville Foods, you would have to tell them I refused.  right?\" The doctor smiled and shook his head. \"Not directly, I'm and independent contractor, but as a doctor, my first responsibility is to my patient. You see, with you body currently so adaptable to circumstances, you are probably better off not taking the cure from a purely medical standpoint. That is why we have been so secretive; making sure you and miss Sullivan were alone while telling you about the cure. I've worked with my staff for years; I trust them, and they are  sworn to secrecy. Your cousin has already decided to take the cure, but we haven't told anyone  YOUR condition is treatable. If you decide not to take the cure, I will just tell your father, and Smallville foods, that your condition, although benign, is untreatable, and that they might as well allow you to just eat what you want and relax. Smallville foods will still have to give you the settlement, since their formula changed your lifestyle so drastically.\" \"Thank you! But...is that legal?\" The doctor shrugged, \"Allowing a patient to be healthy and make their own life choices is the only ethical thing a doctor can do in this kind of situation. So, do you want the curet?\" \"Hell no!I mean...no!\" Lois looked down sheepishly. She couldn't believe she was making the decision to stay, as the General would probably describe her now, \"a  lazy pig\", but she was clearly happier and less stressed this way! The head doctor must have picked up on her embarrassment, and added, \"You don't need to be embarrassed at this decision miss Lane, a lot of people choose, or are forced by genes or habit, to live a fat lifestyle such as your own all the time. Of course, their circumstances have come with more of a health risk than your own, until now, that is.\" \"What do you mean, until now?\" \"I already have miss Sullivan's permission to use that data we have collected while finding a cure. Medicine may never be able to cure obesity, but with the data from our test, we CAN cure ALL obesity related illnesses! If you give us your permission to use this info, withing ten years time, every fat person in the industrialized world should be perfectly healthy.\" \"So I get to be moderately wealthy, eat whatever I want, take it easy, and I can help millions of people around the world? Of course you can use the data!\" \"Thank you miss Lane, pretty soon, millions around the world will be thanking you and your cousin too. One last thing, you may find one downside to your new lifestyle. Unfortunately, most men you age don't like larger women, so...\". Lois interrupted the doctor with a smile while thinking of Clark, She was definitively ready to take her relationship with him out of just the physical stage, but she knew he would be glad she decided not to take the cure. \"That, doctor, will not be a problem for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                               15 years later...<br>\r\n         After choosing not to take the cure, Lois and Clark's relationship quickly grew, to the point that they started openly dating each other once Lois went back to college. Surprisingly, \"The General\" eventual came to accept Lois' new shape, and was supportive of her and Clark's relationship. Eventually, Clark told Lois he was an alien, and she still accepted him with big, pillow-like open arms. They got married when Clark finished college, and both of them begin working at the Daily Planet soon after \"Superman\" appeared; Clark as a reporter, and Lois as an assistant editor. Although the settlement from Smallville Foods had been enough that she never had to work again, she was happy to do something with her life, although she was glad her job allowed her to sit around and eat what she wanted. She continued to gain weight, and was now almost 700 pounds, much to Clark's delight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Chloe had also gotten a settlement after taking the cure. At first, Chloe's body was still very voluptuous from all the food she had eaten while fat. However, after, becoming Watchtower, and dating and marrying Oliver Queen, who spoiled her a great deal, Chloe was now even fatter than she was before she took the cure. However, thanks to Oliver's consant love for her, as well as the recent medical advances bought on by her and Lois' experiences, the 400 pound blond wasn't worried at all, in fact she had never been happier!<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n        One interesting side effect of all this was that large people were now more accepted in society. In fact, some celebrities were now choosing to get fat now that they felt less pressured to be thin. As Lois looked up from her work station in the Daily Planet she noticed that many of her co-workers looked more relaxed happy, and noticeably plumper than they had been before this fat-friendly trend started. Apparently, she had helped bring about a fat new world!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clark had just gotten off the phone with Lana and she had a far more interesting and useful reaction from eating the snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing why Lois and Chloe were expanding so rapidly, Clark remembered that Lana had <i>also </i>heartily eaten some of those goodies from Smallville Foods. Very concerned that she was also blowing up like a blimp, Clark called Lana at her apartment above the Talon. When she didn't answer his worry grew. Just as he was going to go upstairs and tell everyone he was going to check on Lana the phone rang. It was Lana calling on her mobile. She had to yell on the phone for Clark to hear her. [Of course, Lana knew nothing about Clark's super-hearing.] He played along asking her questions. He didn't want to worry Lana about what was happening to Lois and Chloe if he didn't have to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly put after falling onto her bed thoroughly exhausted, Lana was stunned when she woke up less than 20 minutes later totally refreshed. Now a bundle of energy, Lana decided to do some homework. In under 15 minutes, Lana finished a whole weeks worth of assignments from ALL of her classes. Now suddenly feeling fairly hungry, Lana told Clark about literally inhaling 3 more of those new energy bars in a matter of seconds after she had eaten nearly 3 gallons of her favorite flavor of ice cream. Lana told Clark that she had gone downstairs and within a couple of minutes consumed the coffee shop's entire supply. Lana then stated giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark asked her,\"What's so funny Lana?\" She replied, \"Oh Clark, I was just thinking about how BIG I looked. When I finished eating all of that ice cream, I looked like I had just swallowed a very big beach ball. Funny thing though Clark, my boobs had become just as bouncy as my stomach now was.\" Then in a surprisingly throaty and sexy voice, Lana continued on saying, \"You know for a couple of minutes there Clark, I just stood there looking at myself in the mirror. And I can't explain it, but I started to get turned on. I know that sounds pretty vain of me and it's kind of weird even for Smallville. Anyways, I decided that even-though it now WAS a little after midnight, I went jogging just for a little while to burn off some of the ice cream I had just eaten.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing on Lana said, \"Before I knew it, I was at the turn-off to Route 36.\" Clark but in saying, \"Lana, you must've read the sign wrong, that turn-off is over 10 miles away from Smallville.\" \"I know\" she replied. \"But Clark, that's not the end of what happened. It was like suddenly I COULDN'T STOP myself. I started running faster and faster. Things then started to blur around me and all of a sudden a terrible headwind came up in my face. I didn't stop until I saw a couple of jets landing on my right.\" Now totally mystified by what she had just said, Clark jumped in saying, \"Lana you have to be hallucinating. You know jets can't land at Smallville Regional Airport at night. Even Lex can't DO that.\" Lana then said, \"Clark, I'm not at Smallville Airport.\" \"Well, where are you Lana?\" Clark asked. After maybe 45 seconds of silence Lana finally told Clark, \"I'm standing outside one of the terminals at Denver International Airport. By the way, how are Chloe and Lois doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough clearly Lana had also been affected by the Smallville snacks, Clark decided to not tell Lana anything specific about the girls recent ballooning. So he just asked if there was anything he could do to help her. She just said \"ya, could you ask your parents if they can help me get a ticket back to Smallville. I think that I'd prefer to ride a Greyhound bus back home.\" When Clark handed the phone to his Dad, Jonathan couldn't understand a single word that Lana said. All he heard on the receiver was an extremely high-pitched squeal. It was then that Clark realized that Lana had been talking literally a mile a minute. Only HE could understand her with his super hearing. So Clark sent a message to Lana's phone about where the bus station was in Denver and her ticket. Fortunately for Lana, the next bus to go through Smallville was leaving in less than an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lana returned to Smallville late that morning Martha met her at the Smallville Bus Station with a change of clothes along with her school books. Within 5 seconds of Lana walking into the restroom, she had cleaned up, changed into her fresh school clothes and walked back out to Martha. Even though Martha had been fore-warned to bring her some of her largest clothes,Lana was still quite annoyed with just how tight her clothes now fit on her. Already warned by Clark about Lana's new super-speed ability, Martha took it all in stride. Wistfully Martha said, \"You know Lana if I could move as fast as you, I could finish my housework in a snap.\" Which she emphasized by then snapping her fingers. Lana surprised Martha saying, \"I'll stop by and help you Mrs. Kent, RIGHT after school lets out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Chloe's and Lois's frontiers have FINALLY finished expanding. What size and shape have they become and what else has happened to them during the past 10-11 hours at the Kent farm. Also, do they react the same when Clark finishes telling them about what happened to Lana? The next piece can also include an update, of some sort, regarding any other changes to Lana that occur from eating those energy bars. Particularly, whether or not she decides to eat more of them when she visits the farm after school. </span></div></div>",

Where am I headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, according to my inside source, the leak originated from some sort of Luthorcorp lab near the Smallville Dam,\" Chloe explained. \"I'd say that would be a good place to start. Lex and his cronies won't have had time to do a cover up yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois finished her coffee and tossed the polystyrene cup in the trash before hurrying up, shouting a quick 'See you later!' over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later, Lois arrived at the enormous Smallville Dam. The sounds of the water were almost overpowering - Lois had never heard so much noise. She peered over the railing, almost expecting the water below to have turned green or something...but, much to her disappointment, everything looked normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno how Chloe expected me to find anything here...\" Lois muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lois spotted something down below. On the banks of the river, was a large Luthorcorp truck, and a small number of people were standing near it. \"Jackpot...\" Lois smiled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving as quickly as she could, Lois circled around the Dam and moved down to the bank of the river. She slowed her pace, deciding to move carefully and quietly in case she was spotted. She stopped briefly, lurking just out of sight behind some bushes - from her vantage point, she spotted the Luthorcorp employees grabbing equipment from the back of the truck, and changing into large white decontamination suits, as they walked towards the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were far enough away, Lois moved forward, crouched behind the truck, and hurried down the river bank. The Luthorcorp workers were too busy to notice her, but she could hear them talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful,\" one of the workers snapped. \"Mr Luthor wants this whole area cleaned up before anybody finds out about the leak. As soon as we get the anti-toxin into the water supply, we can get out of here. Be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anti toxin huh...\" Lois murmured, crouching down out of sight on the damp ground, and peering into the water. \"Sounds serious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois couldn't see anything wrong with the water. Perhaps she had missed her chance, and the mess had already been cleaned up. She heard the sound of machinery powering up, and saw that the Luthorcorp team was now moving a large tube into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lois craned her neck, trying to get a better view, her foot slipped on the ground and she fell back onto her butt, which squelched against the muddy ground. \"Damn it...\" she cursed. </span></div></div>",

The tube they had put into the water was making louder noises, and was now being connected to the back of the truck. Lois brushed herself down, but realized she had actually just wiped mud all over her outfit - suddenly, she wished she had visited the food factory instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...\" Lois grumbled, staring down at her ruined outfit. \"It's gonna take a lot to get that out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something caught Lois's eye. The mud she had inadvertently wiped on her jacket was changing color from brown to green! Now, the patches of the mud smeared across her top were beginning to glow. Lois instantly knew this was the chemical substance that had been leaked into the river, it had to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to remove her jacket, not wanting to be contaminated by the glowing green substance, but, to her horror, her hands were also glowing green. She held them in front of her face and shook them violently, trying to wring her hands of the sticky green mess. Her eyes drifted back to her chest, and she could see the green liquid was gradually seeping into her clothes - in fact, she could feel her shirt beginning to get damp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what the hell, not like things could get any worse,\" Lois said, deciding to get rid of her jacket before this stuff soaked through to her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois grabbed her jacket and pulled it open, quickly throwing it to the floor and kicking it away. Now that she was focused on the muddy ground, she could see there was a whole puddle of the green stuff at her feet. \"How the hell did I miss that? Stupid Lois, stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois looked down at her chest, and realized that some of the green had already soaked through to her cotton shirt, but not enough to worry about. She would just wash it when she got home, but she didn't fancy explaining to the Kents why her jacket had suddenly gotten radioactive, so she threw it in a nearby bush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome distance away, the Luthorcorp team had turned on their machine, which seemed to be pumping the anti toxin into the river at last. Deciding that she had spent more than enough time here, Lois knelt down by the river and washed her hands in the water - which she assumed was safe at this point. She pulled her hands out, and, seeing that they were clean, hurried away from the area. </span></div></div>",

It seemed to bring her nothing but trouble - and she got into enough trouble already. Now, there was a very real possibility that she had been contaminated by some sort of Luthorcorp experiment - or whatever the hell that green stuff was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had also lost her favorite jacket, which had been quite an expensive purchase. She was feeling pretty angry right now, but was sure she would have ample time to cool down on the long walk back home. Lois thought it best to return to the Kent farm, rather than back into school. Her clothes were filthy, and she was still worried about having touched the green stuff in the mud; she knew she wouldn't feel better until she had a shower. She felt her shirt chafe for a moment, but shrugged off the feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt had pretty much survived the whole ordeal at the river, but she could feel some of the liquid had soaked through her shirt and onto her bra. It was annoying, but at least that stuff hadn't had some kind of corrosive effect and eaten through her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois continued the long walk back, she had forgotten quite how far she would need to walk, but it was allowing the sun to dry her clothes for her, even if her jeans were still encrusted with mud. As she walked on, Lois felt her shirt chafe again, and wondered if she had gotten some dirt in her clothes after her fall. She shrugged off the thought again, and told herself she would clean herself up as quickly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the chafing feeling did not go away. Despite Lois's attempts to ignore it, the uncomfortable feeling continued to grow. Her shirt actually seemed to be tightening as time went on, it was becoming ridiculous. Had the damp caused her clothes to begin shrinking? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Lois looked down, and could have sworn that her shirt had gotten smaller. It seemed as though it was accentuating her bust line. Lois stared down at her bust curiously...did her breasts actually look...a little bigger? Lois dismissed the thought almost instantly, it was like something that might turn up on Chloe's 'wall of weird'. She looked away from her chest, and carried on walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lois heard a loud 'POP'. She froze in her tracks and jerked her head downwards, what she saw shocked her. The second button down on her shirt (the first one she always kept undone) had popped open, and it was obvious why. Lois now found herself staring into her own cleavage, her shirt was pulled tight across her breasts, which, despite her earlier attempts to dismiss the very idea of such a thing, had grown larger. While Lois had never exactly been flat chested, she had been a BB cup at most, but the way her cleavage was looking right now, it seemed as though she had shot up by about two sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...just...impossible...\" Lois said, shaking her head in disbelief, unable to tear her eyes away from her enlarged breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt about it, they had grown, and there was only one explanation - that the green substance Lois had been exposed to had caused them to expand. </span></div></div>",

She folded her arms firmly over her bigger breasts, squeezing them down. She didn't want anyone to notice, certainly not Clark or his parents...how the hell would she explain that she had gone up a cup size in one day? Then again, maybe they wouldn't notice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her arms still folded, Lois headed up the path to the house. As she approached the door, it swung open, and Clark headed out of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lois,\" Clark said, eyeing her suspiciously. \"What happened to you this afternoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now Clark,\" Lois said, avoiding his gaze and barging past into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you fall over or something?\" Clark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois stopped, and spun around to face him with a sigh. \"Yes Smallville, I fell over. I'm a mess. Are you happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark sighed. \"I was just wondering what happened about that story Chloe sent you out on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Lois replied instantly. \"It was a dud, her source must have messed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark nodded slowly. \"It's not like Chloe to get her information wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this time, she did, okay?\" Lois snapped, turned on her heel, and marched into the house away from Clark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was safely inside, she hurried up the stairs, arms still folded in case she happened to bump into anyone. Clark was out of the way, but Jonathan and Martha could easily turn the corner at any moment. Luckily, this did not happen, and Lois practically leapt the last few steps into her room and quickly locked the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leant her back against the door, and let her arms fall to her sides as she exhaled slowly. \"Thank God for that,\" she breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois closed her eyes and contemplated her next move. The chemicals from the leak at the river had gotten all over her clothes, so she definitely needed to throw those out. It might also be a good idea to to wear loose fitting clothes for the time being, in case anyone pointed her enhanced bustline. She was still feeling dirty from her clumsy fall earlier as well, so thought a shower might be a good idea too. Lois was going to need to work hard to cover this mess up...</span></div></div>",

Lois groaned in discomfort as her shirt pulled across her breasts, the cloth tightening and stretching against the growing, moving flesh. The shirt strained against the new curves beneath it, binding her breasts as if unwilling to let them grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Lois moaned as she felt her buttons twisting and pulling at their threads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centre button started twisting, and Lois's growing boobs made her shirt begin to rise, exposing her midriff. Her mammaries continued to rise like baking dough, ballooning out rounder and higher as if they were inflating with helium, despite the fact they were actually plumping with substantial flesh that was too firm to sag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt was unable to take any more pressure, and, suddenly, the centre button popped off. Lois's breasts surged into the sudden gap in her shirt, forcing the next button down to pop open. Lois gasped as she laid eyes upon her exposed breasts, which were beginning to overflow the lacy cups of her bra. Her boobs jutted out about half an inch more; her breast flesh jiggling in the now undersized cups of her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt was effectively useless now, with only the two bottom buttons remaining. Lois undid the last two buttons herself, and slowly let the shirt slip off of her body. As the shirt slid to the floor, Lois's breasts wobbled precariously inside her bra. The bra was stretched tightly across her firm areolas, which were beginning to peek up above the lacy edges of her bra. Lois moved slightly, and the lace pinched at her nipples, digging into her areolas as they puffed upwards and closer to the bra's edge. Though they came dangerously close to bursting free from the bra, the growth appeared to have stopped now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois could only stare in amazement at her new breasts, which she guessed had reached a D, or possible DD cup size. No way could anyone not notice them now...</span></div></div>",

She certainly didn't want Clark to see her new bustline, she would never be able to live it down. Perhaps it would be best to just stay hidden, and and hope that her breasts shrunk back to their regular size? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lois! Dinner!\" Clark called from downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right there!\" Lois answered instinctively, but immediately realised her mistake. \"Crap! I should made some excuse...now I have to show up for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois stared down at her bulging chest, on closer inspection, they weren't <i>quite </i>as big as she had first thought. D cup, perhaps? At least two sizes larger than before, but Lois suspected they could be hidden with the right item of clothing. Looking like a stripper while having dinner with the Kents wasn't an option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lois! Hurry up!\" Clark called again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois growled in annoyance, and hurriedly began to pull top after top out of her dresser drawer. None of them would fit - she'd have to go shopping for bigger shirts - but what was she going to wear <i>right now</i>? For the first time, Lois was starting to regret buying such tight, form fitting clothes. She didn't have anything roomy enough to conceal her. but maybe Clark did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully and quietly, Lois opened her bedroom door and peeked around the corridor. With everyone eating dinner downstairs, it was empty. Still dressed only in a ridiculously tight bra and jeans, Lois ran across the landing and into Clark's bedroom, praying that nobody would hear her and come looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark's room was a disorganised mess, with sweaters, jeans, underwear and schoolbooks strewn across the floor. Lois looked around the room, and finally stumbled across a large, baggy sweatshirt sticking out from underneath Clark's bed. She pulled it on over her head and turned to the mirror. Her chest was well disguised by the loose cover-up. With a sigh of relief, Lois left Clark's room and headed downstairs...</span></div></div>",

Clark was right to be suspicious of course - Lois was constantly berating him for the state of his room and clothes - the fact that she was now wearing one of his not so clean tops must have appeared slightly odd to the young farmboy. None the less, Lois attempted to keep her cool and get through dinner without any embarrassing moments. She planned to finish up here pretty fast, so she could return to her room and figure out a solution to her bizarre new growing problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Martha served up dinner, a delicious home made pumpkin pie, Lois grabbed her fork and began to chow down. Clark gave her another strange look, as Jonathan and Martha discussed their day. Lois ignored her surroundings and focused on getting through the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lois felt a subtle movement beneath her top. She peeked down at her chest, and, to her horror, she could see the front of sweater was pushing out further and further. Her breasts were growing again, and at the worst possible time, right at the dinner table, in front of the entire Kent family! She dropped her fork in alarm, and the heads of everyone at the table suddenly turned her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lois, are you all right?\" Martha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...fine...just fine...\" Lois stuttered, folding her arms over her growing chest in a desperate attempt to conceal her latest growth spurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a little pale,\" Jonathan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...I don't actually feel so good,\" Lois said quickly, looking for a quick way out. \"And as much as I love your pumpkin pie Mrs. Kent, I don't think I can finish this...just not feeling so good today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois's breasts were swelling faster than before, and she could feel the oversized sweatshirt growing tighter and tighter. She knew she needed to get out of the kitchen before she gave herself away. She quickly rose from the table, hands still folded across her chest, squeezing down her bloated tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta go,\" Lois said simply, and she darted from the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was out of sight, Lois dropped her arms to her sides and ran upstairs, but was entirely unprepared for just how heavy her mammoth mammaries had become. They bounced up and down as she tackled each step to her room, nearly dragging her whole body to the floor.

Its getting harder to find ways to hide these monsters.\" she mumbled to herself. \"Talk about getting a massive boob job in a day.\" Lois crossed her arms as she cradle her breasts while walking towards her bed. \"I'd better call Chloe and see if she can help figure out a cure for me.\" As Lois reached for phone her breasts swayed as it was getting annoying for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was at the Torch wondering why Lois hasn't reported back yet. She knew that Lois missed her class. I mean yeah Lois does have that reporter's work ethic to get the best scoop possible but she would always get into some sort of mess that both she and Clark had to bust her out of. Just as Chloe was going to resume her work, her phone rang. When she looked at the caller ID it was Lois. She answered it right away. Chloe answered,\" Lois! Where are you? Where's the assignment I gave you? Don't tell me you ditched it for something else.\" Lois said, \"I did go to the Smallville Dam. But I need you to come over to Clark's place! Its an emergency!

Mr. Kent, Is Lois here?\" \"Yeah she's upstairs. But she's been acting weird today. Ever since she got home.\" said Mr. Kent. \"Weird? Like how weird?\" asked Chloe who seemed puzzled at what Mr. Kent told her. \"Well Chloe, you want weird? She was wearing one of Clark's sweaters during dinner and she didn't even touch my pumpkin pie.\" said Martha as she was cleaning the dishes. \"She was quite pale and she said she wasn't feeling well.\" \"Well wearing farmboy clothes is one thing and her missing a good cooks cooking isn't weird either Mrs. Kent.\" said Chloe. \"Well Chloe she had her arms crossed around her chest as if she was hiding something from us.

You in there? Its me Chloe!\" said Chloe as she leaned her ear against the door. In surprise it swung open as Lois grabbed Chloe and pulled her in there. Chloe stumbled a bit as she regained her balance and looked at Lois who was sort of in panic as she looked the door. \"OK Lois whats the scoop? You didn't drag me out here for nothing.\" said Chloe with a shrug. She noticed just as the Kents said to her was wearing one of Clark's sweaters. \"Well here's the deal Chloe but promise me you'll help me find a cure for the predicament I'm in.\" said Lois with her back turned against Chloe. \"What did you get into this time? It was just to investigate what Luthercorp was doing at the dam.\" said Chloe \"But of course I'll help you out if you just tell me whats wrong with you.\" Lois slowly turned forward, as Chloe said, \"Doesn't look like a problem to me Lois.\" As Lois's breasts were noticeable yet, \"OK let me give you a clear look at what I've been hiding.\" Lois began fold arms at the bottom of the sweater as the shape of her mammoth breasts began to take form. They were at least the size of soccer balls. \"Oh my god Lois! What happened to you?\" said Chloe as she went closer to see if they're real or not. \"Well at the dam, Luthercorp was cleaning up a mess and I actually slipped. My hands got muddy and so did my jacket. I wiped my hands all over my blouse and soon enough the mud started turning green and I had to ditch my jacket since I was afraid I might get contaminated. Then my hands started turning green but luckily the were putting anti toxin in the water and I washed my hands. I wasn't expecting this to happen.\" said Lois as she heaved her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they must be heavy. I'll try to help you in anyway I can. Do you have the blouse?\" asked Chloe still looking at Lois. \"Yeah I put it in a container just in case.\" said Lois as she searched for the container. Chloe noticed that Lois was having a hard time bending over as her breasts were very noticeable. \"Here you go.\" said Lois as she arched her back. \"I'm going to have this analyzed and checked. I'm pretty sure I can find a cure. In the meantime you need to stay put. Who knows how big you'll get if you go out.\" said Chloe. \"Thanks cuz! Your the best cousin in the world!\" said Lois as they hugged. \"Hey don't want the toxic chemicals spilling on me now.\" joked Chloe \"Remember! No adventuring out! Stay put!\" as Lois nodded and watched Chloe leave. Chloe said goodbye to Mr. and Mrs. Kent and said that Lois was having back pains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been awhile since Chloe left. Lois was bored and didn't know what to do. As she pondered while lying down on her bed....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that her breasts had stopped growing, Lois catches her breath exhaling very deeply. Looking down her cleavage Lois said out loud to herself, \"Wow, that was a close call. I guess I'm stuck wearing this bra until my boobs shrink back down to a more reasonable size. The only good thing coming out of this, besides my boobs is Lucy won't see me like this. She would never let me live it down if she saw just how big, her BIG sister had grown.\" It doesn't take Lois long to realize that every blouse and shirt she has is now way too small for her. Which really annoys her since most of them she had bought since recently arriving in Smallville. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStalling for time and hoping that they'll at least shrink some by morning Lois yelled downstairs that she wasn't quite herself. So Martha Kent volunteered to bring Lois' dinner to her bedroom. Stripping down to just her panties and still precariously over-stretched bra Lois jumped into bed just before Martha opened her bedroom door. Martha noticed that Lois seemed to have a bigger chest than she remembered but she ignored it saying to herself, \"I guess Lois' body has temporarily swollen up with whatever has her down.\" As soon as Martha closed the door on her way out, Lois catapulted out of her bed to eat dinner. With everything that had happened to her that day Lois had forgotten to eat and so she was ravenous. It barely took her 5 minutes before she had polished off her dinner including the extra large bowl of soup Martha had quickly warmed up for her. The soup was so delicious Lois called down for another bowl, after she finished that one, Lois consumed 3 more bowls before her hunger was finally satisfied. Which really surprised Lois because normally she wasn't all that enamored with any kind of soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow suddenly feeling very bloated, Lois was to curious to NOT find out just how big she had grown. So after she hunted for a few minutes Lois found a piece of string long enough to completely go around her newly, expanded bust. Lois was a very unhappy camper when she realized that her perfectly stable and very unobtrusive 34 B bust had now become a very noticeable and jiggly 40 DD. Falling forward onto her stomach Lois fell asleep several inches above her bed.. The only thoughts going through her mind were, I hope these boobs and stomach shrink before I wake up tomorrow. That thought worked on her unconscious mind all night. She didn't wake up until after the sun had risen and its light shown through her bedroom window. While she slept, both Lois' stomach and her boobs shrank and by 5 in the morning she was already back to her old size. Unfortunately for Lois her boobs and stomach continued shrinking. When she finally woke up, her waist was 3 inches smaller than usual and her chest was now literally FLAT as a board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up Lois is now even more dismayed with her bust size. Saying to herself, \"Sheesh, I was better off having big jiggly boobs rather than NO boobs.\" Instantly<br>\r\nLois' boobs start inflating again to their previous DD glory. While her eyes grow bigger with her bust, Lois starts thinking about this new turn of events. When they stopped inflating, Lois decided to as she said, \"Well now, why don't I take these out for a spin.\" She spent almost all of the next hour test driving her boobs and was absolutely delighted to discover that she had ABSOLUTE control over their size, shape, shading and most importantly BOUNCINESS. Since it was Saturday, and Lois hadn't yet planned on doing anything, she would've spent ALL day in her room playing with her new bust. She stopped when Martha Kent called upstairs saying that breakfast was ready and somebody was waiting for her downstairs with a big surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lois turns towards the bathroom intent on taking a shower right away. She then decides that since she's going to throw away her clothes she might as well do it right now. Just as she has unlocked her bedroom door she says, \"Oh what the __________, this can wait until later. I really need to take a shower immediately.\" By now the goop had started to BUBBLE on Lois's chest! She hadn't grown any bigger but she was still worried a lot about her situation. So forgetting to lock her bedroom door Lois walks into the bathroom, turns on the shower and after waiting a few seconds for the water to heat up steps inside the shower stall. Just after Lois turned on her shower, the splashing water masked the sound of her bedroom door opening. Even if the water hadn't been running by now Lois would not have heard the door. Her eyes are now totally focused on her rapidly INFLATING bust. It now looks to be bubbling another inch bigger every few seconds. She's also working her way fairly quickly through the alphabet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside a few minutes earlier:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois had been so focused on getting into the Kent house she didn't hear Lana drive up the path behind her. Since Lois was a very recent new resident at the Kent farm, she didn't know that it was unusual for Clark to be home so soon after school had let out. He was there waiting for Lana to come by the farm. They had a 5:30 meeting to go to together and Mrs. Kent had suggested she come by for supper before they went. Lana had been half-way to the Kent farm when Chloe had called her on her mobile. Chloe couldn't get a hold of Lois because in her haste to leave for the Dam, she had left her cell-phone in the Torch's office. So Lana volunteered to go by the Dam to tell Lois that Chloe wanted to talk to her. Lana arrived well after Lois and Lex's workers had left the area. She looked for a short while and found Lois' muddy jacket. Since it was still warm out, Lana picked it up and then tied it around her hips intending to show off to Lois when she saw her. Lana then drove off to the Kent farm arriving just as Lois was running inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gets out of her car, Lana's skirt starts feeling a lot tighter on her hips and rear. Squirming around some as she walks toward Clark, he  greets her with a smile on his face. Lana asked, \"What's with Lois? Chloe's looking for her.\" Clark tells her, \"Oh, she's just annoyed with Chloe sending her on a wild goose chase. She was a mess, but oddly it fits her somehow.\" Lana then proceeds to call Chloe so that Clark can fill her in about Lois. Lana then goes inside to find Lois and to properly adjust her skirt. It has become uncomfortably tight on her and it feels like the circulation to her legs is being cut off. Before Lana can fix her skirt she runs into Martha Kent in the kitchen. Lana tells her that she'll be back right after she talks to Lois. Mrs. Kent tells her, \"Lana you can take your time. I'm making you your favorite dessert and it still needs a little more time to bake.\" \"Why thank you, Mrs. Kent\" she replied. Lana then walks upstairs to Lois' bedroom arriving just as she went to turn on her shower. Just as Lana starts opening the door she hears the shower come on. The door was open far enough for her to see the pile of clothes Lois intended to throw out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing just how dirty they were, Lana (being the thoughtful girl that she is) picks up Lois' clothes and carries them to the washer downstairs. Holding them very tight to her chest Lana's blouse also ends up being soaked by the time she gets to the washer. Seeing her, Mrs. Kent tells Lana that she can use her shower to clean up. Martha then tells Lana that she'll keep Clark outside until both girls finish their showers. [Lois' showering can be heard downstairs.] So after stripping down to her panties, Lana dashes upstairs for a quick shower. When she runs upstairs, Martha seeing her swaying rear says to herself, \"My oh my. I hadn't realized just how MUCH Lana's hips have filled out lately. It should very easy for Lana to have babies with Clark {fingers crossed} when the time comes.\" Lana stumbles some going up the stairs due to her suddenly enlarged girth and now {BOUNCING! chest}. Since 9th grade, Lana's bust size has been 'A' just like most of her grades in school. She's totally shocked to actually see them in motion while she walks. After taking a few steps in the upstairs hall, Lana starts smiling. Thinking to herself, \"Alright Lois now we'll see whose bust is larger.\" She then enters the bathroom intent on seeing just how big her body has grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana knows full well that the only logical reason why she's suddenly so much bigger is that somehow she has again been exposed to meteor rocks. She also knows that the growth almost certainly won't be permanent, but she intends to enjoy this while she can. Looking in the bathroom mirror, Lana gasps at her new shape. Her enlarged hips and bust have given her a fantastic hour-glass figure. Her now exquisitely perfect 36 DD bust has started bubbling like Lois' was and Lana's growing very weak-kneed from the sensations she's experiencing. After turning both faucets on full blast, Lana very  enthusiastically soaps up for her shower. A sponge bath would have been a better idea for both girls to take. Before it's finally washed off the girls, the goop slowly flows down their bodies. It settles on their hips and rear where unnoticed by them some of it is absorbed. Both girls quickly learn that their bottoms have expanded several inches larger. Once they dry off and see just how big they've blossomed NEITHER one is a happy campers. They're now enormous and instantly realize that none of their clothes can possibly fit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoincidentally, they both peek out into the hall at the same time. Seeing each other they both start crying which only serves to attract the attention of Mrs. Kent. Asking if they need any help, together they say, \"Not right now, Mrs. Kent. Maybe later.\" That satisfies her curiosity for the time being. Clark now wants to come in the house. He's finished his homework and is anxious to start eating. It's getting late and Lana and him still have that meeting to attend. Joking, he says, \"I just hope you girls don't eat too much. It wouldn't do for either of you girls to blow up like a blimp.\" Lana nearly falls over laughing her head off at that comment. Lois is not at all amused by it. Lana then yells downstairs that Clark should start supper without her. Right now she's not herself and he should go to the meeting alone. Her words cheered Lois up some. At least now they can work together to find a way to reverse this problem. While Clark and Mrs. Kent are eating, Lana quietly calls Chloe. Lois and her fill Chloe in on what's happened to them and asks her for any suggestions. Chloe then said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She feels that she might know something about what that stuff was SUPPOSED to do in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina Williamson a low-level technician working for Lex isn't answering her phone. She never will again. Less than an hour after the spill occurred, the lab making the stuff \"mysteriously\" blew up. She and several other key science researchers were still inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n{One of the clean-up crew DID see Lois at the Dam.} After returning to the lab he dutifully told Lex, \"I saw what looked like a high school girl lurking near the spill.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Lex wasn't sure who might have leaked the story to Chloe, he didn't waste any time trying to figure out just who had called her. Since she was always Miss Johnny-on the spot snooping into Luthor business, he just assumed she had been the girl the worker saw. Having to use nearly all his anti-toxin to cover up the spill cost Lex a fortune. This was something that he should have had difficulty keep hidden from his dad.  It was Lex' good fortune that just then his dad was focused on finding out more about Clark. So in some respects things worked out much easier than Lex thought they would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Chloe hung up she asked both girls, \"Well, whose bigger?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery reluctant to find out, Lana asked, \"Come on Chloe does that really matter? I mean, my God we're both much bigger that ANY of those fertility statues Miss Graves showed us last year in Anthropology. Remember what she SAID about them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Chloe had been sick that week, she didn't know what on Earth Lana was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing new to Smallville, Lois also didn't know and wasn't interested in learning Lana was talking. After several minutes of coaxing, Lana and Lois finally agreed to measure each other. They only agreed to do it to shut Chloe up. Her morbid interest in just how big they had become was seriously creeping them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to their difficulty moving they needed Mrs. Kent help. When she saw how both of them were squeezed so tight in the hallway she nearly fainted. Minutes later after gathering herself together, Martha found a measuring tape and proceeded to help them work out their new sizes. This was after both girls had manged to moved downstairs to the living room. It was the only room in the house big enough for them to sit comfortably. Over half an hour later she learned that both girls busts were now 40 LL After double-checking her figures Martha started laughing so hard, she ended up with tears in her eyes. Being new to Smallville's strange events Lois took the news very badly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana then told Lois, \"You don't need to get so upset.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois replied, \"This is a disaster. How can we ever go to school or anywhere else with bodies like these.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana very calmly replied, \"Cool off Lois. After all, things could of ended up being a whole lot worse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see how.\" Lois loudly snapped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana then whispered saying, \"Welllll, Lois just think you could have named Zelda. Do you seriously think you could even move with a SIZE Z bust.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois immediately quit complaining about everything. </span></div></div>",

Before Lois could think about her situation any further, she was distracted by a tightness in the seat of her pants, she hoisted her jeans up a little and decided to keep moving, but the tightness did not go away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What <i>now</i>?\" Lois groaned, and she cast a glance over her shoulder. \"Oh <i>crap</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lois's utter horror, it now seemed as though her butt was growing too! It suddenly hit her that after falling down, her butt had hit the ground, and was no doubt exposed to the same substance that her caused her boobs to grow. She felt her rear end, and found it was also damp and wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was difficult to get a good view simply from struggling to look over her shoulder, she wished she had a mirror with her. But even though she could not see the full extent of her expansion, she could still feel it - her ass cheeks were swelling within her jeans (which, Lois had to admit, she had chosen <i>because</i> they emphasised her butt). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhh...\" Lois moaned in discomfort as she felt her pants grow tighter and tighter around her butt. She clenched her teeth and closed her eyes, groaning continuously as her backside bulged to bigger and bigger sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois was snapped out of her discomfort induced trance upon hearing a loud tearing noise from behind her. Obviously, her jeans had not been able to take it any more. Despite feeling hugely embarrassed, even with nobody around to see her, Lois was actually kind of relieved that all the pressure had been relieved from her butt. She reached around and felt her ass, and her fingers traced along the large tear that had formed down the seat of her pants - although there was no way she could really see it, she could feel that the tear had formed directly in the middle of her pants, and her frilly lace panties were no doubt exposed. It was like something from a cartoon, or a bad dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, however, her butt had not actually grown quite as much as she had suspected. It had, without a doubt, become more of a 'ghetto booty' than ever before, but at least it wasn't monstrously huge. Better still, it seemed to have stopped growing. Hopefully it was over now, and perhaps the new changes to her body would simply fade with time...or diet and exercise. Lois didn't really know what was going to happen next, but she knew she needed to get back home, and change into something that didn't make her look quite as...enhanced...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering the tear in her jeans with her hand, Lois began running back home, her enlarged breasts shaking and jiggling and threatening to pop out of her bra. Luckily, her bra kept them in check, although Lois had to stop more than once to make some adjustments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally got home...</span></div></div>",

They all began to look around till one of them spotted Lois getting up after slipping in the mud behind the truck. One of them yelled at Lois, \"Hey you!\" as Lois soon found out she was spotted. \"Holy crap! I better scram.\" as she started running opposite of where the Luthorcorp team were. One of the Luthorcorp men screamed at the others, \"Go! Chase after her! She must not let this leak out to the public!\" as some began to ensure a chase after Lois. Lois saw the men from Luthorcorp chasing after her as she ran full steam along the riverbank. She was quite ahead when she tripped on a bark of wound causing her to slide in the mud. She slid on her belly where the mud went into her tank top. She pick up a lot in her bra and her belly since her tank top was tucked in. Lois zipped up her jacket  as she got up and continue running. She found a hiding place in an old tree and hid there. The Luthorcorp men gave up searching after an hour. Lois didn't notice the green glow in her jacket as she was too focused on keeping an eye on the goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left, Lois sighed in relief. \"Now to get cleaned up!\" she thought to herself. But she was clean, which she found weird. She went to the river to clean up little dirt on her body. After drying off, she decided to call it a day as she walked back towards her car. While walking she felt a bit heavier, but she shrugged it off. She drove towards the Kents to begin her report to Chloe. Lois had the feeling of heaviness in her body. As if she over ate but she hadn't eaten since lunch. Lois pressed down on her belly as there was a little bulge but not that noticeable. Her breasts also felt bulkier. It was soon nightfall as she was almost finished with her story. She remembered she missed class but this story was worth the sacrifice. She took a bath to be refreshed.She wore a long sleeved blouse with matching pants. As she lay on the bed reading her report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois then heard Clark's voice, \"Lois! Dinner's ready!

After finding and meeting with her cousin Kal-El and his Earth parents for the first time she starts looking for something to eat. Used to the public gardens common to all Kryptonian cities, Kara is surprised by their complete absence on Earth. Wandering through the countryside, Kara notices some enticing bushes with blue colored berries growing in some beautiful and unexpectedly very red-tinted soil. Knowing that even if these berries are poisonous, since she's invulnerable on Earth they won't bother her in any way Kara digs in. Once she had tasted just a couple of the berries, Kara just couldn't stop herself from eating more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it's several pounds later before her hunger is satisfied. Kara's stomach is now very bloated but she doesn't pay any attention to that because she KNOWS with her Kryptonian physiology all of that food will be digested fairly quickly and her stomach will return to it's normal very flat 22 Earth inch size. As she walks back towards the Kent farm, Kara starts feeling a slowly increasing discomfort. It started in her stomach, but soon progresses up to her chest right behind her bust. By the time she arrived there, Kara has begun to grow worried about the situation. Both her stomach and chest are feeling increasingly bloated. Not only that, Kara has now started feeling a strange fullness in both parts of her body. Kara becomes even more dismayed when she sees that all of her fingernails have turned into the very same shade of blue as those berries she had eaten earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow becoming panicked over what's happening to her, Kara fruitlessly knocks on the farm house door. All the Kent's have left and she doesn't know where to look or if she should wait for one of them to return. Kara had no way of knowing that they would be gone for 2 or 3 days. While she had visited the Kents, Lana had come by to talk to Clark about something for school. Kara took note of the manner and tone of their talk and ESPECIALLY how intently Clark had looked at Lana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking in the context of her home planet's Kryptonian customs, Kara incorrectly assumed that Lana was Clark's first girl-friend among other possible candidates. With no other idea on what to do next, Kara decided to go find this Lana Lang as quickly as she could. Kara's feeling's of her body wanting to grow even bigger, grow more intense by the second. However, before she even gets to the County road, Kara realized that her stomach was now slowly expanding. By the time she finds where Lana lives, her bust has also joined it in inflating. Although she now looks like maybe 5 months pregnant, at least for now Kara doesn't yet look <i>too </i>busty...</span></div></div>",

So the magician had turned to food, not seeing much in the quiet town to do other than eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been doing this for the past week and the results were in the bit of extra jiggle in her rear and the pot belly steadily devouring her normally trim figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing louder, she took a larger bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this place can't compare to a home-cooked meal,\" a voice spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from her plate, Zatanna saw a middle-aged woman smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suggesting you can do better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded. \"Yes and are you that Zatanna my son has told me so much about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son...are you Clark's mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martha Kent, pleased to finally meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise,\" Zatanna replied. \"I've been a bit down lately because I can't find a venue for my act this time around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why not stay at our farm? I'm sure Clark would love to see you and our barn isn't getting much use these days. You could set up a show in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Kent nodded and she was soon being hugged by the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear. Now how about you pay your bill and we can head on over to the farm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna nodded, smiling wider than she had since first hearing about her sponsors pulling out from her act.</span></div></div>",
