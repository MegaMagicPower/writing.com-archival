Roberto or aka Robert couldn\u2019t believe what had happened to him but as he looked at his hands, that glowed with blinding light, he knew that This was not a dream, that what had happened at Misty Birch park was all real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, oh man, oh man, what am I going to do?\u201d Robert asked getting up and  pacing around his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell someone, but who should I tell?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert thinks for a few minutes and finally comes up with a answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I\u2019ll tell Arnold.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold was Roberts best friend, ever since elementary school, that is saying something because Robert didn\u2019t have many friends. Arnold always had Roberts back and vice versa. Robert couldn\u2019t tell his parents who were down stares right now watching tv together, nor could he tell his 18 year old sister, who he didn\u2019t get along with at all, but still loved with all his heart, even though he would never emit it to her face. Robert didn\u2019t know how they would react, therefore Arnold won by default. Robert picks up his phone from off his bed and dials Arnold\u2019s number as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Arnold says sluggishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man I need you to come over like right now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobert? Why are you ok?\u201d Arnold asks still trying to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, I just need to speak with you man please.\u201d Robert says anxiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d Arnold says a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt bad waking up Arnold when he was just trying to get his beauty sleep, but sleep could wait, especially after what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took Arnold a few minutes to get to Roberts house. Arnold didn\u2019t use the front door like a normal person, no instead he climbed up to Roberts window, which wasn\u2019t all that strange to Robert. Arnold had done that ever since Robert had known him, plus it helped because your parents didn\u2019t like anyone to come over when it was night time, so yea it worked out for everyone.<br>\r\nHe <br>\r\n\u201cHey man why did you want me to come over so late.\u201d Arnold asked as Robert helped him get inside his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk man, I got one hell of a story for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was walking down the sidewalk. He wore a black jacket a white shirt , and blue jeans with black Nicky shoes. Robert liked taking a walk at night, he loved feeling the cold night air brush up against his brown skin, and blow through his curly hair. It helped him think, especially when he was going through hard times. Robert had another fight with his dad about going into the family business. Roberts dad was the owner of a plumbing business and had always wanted Robert to fallow in his foot steps, but Robert never wanted to go down that path. Robert wanted to do more with his life, but he didn't know what that was yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something breaks Robert out of his thoughts. Robert looks up towards the dark sky and sees something falling, what ever it was, was big and bright. It looked like a meteor, and it was headed towards Misty Birch Park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoom.\u201d The meteor lands in the center of the park, shaking the surrounding with a earthquake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the meteor crash in the distance, Roberto sprints towards the crash site. Roberto entering the park is confronted with black smoke that insulted his lungs with vile gas. Robert looked around at his surroundings, trees were destroyed, and on fire, the ground was up lifted, the once clean roads were now filled with cracks, and were destroyed. That was one hell powerful meteor Robert thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert made it to the crash zone of the meteor, but what he sees isn\u2019t a meteor at all, but a 50 ft man wearing strange clothing. Robert stand still unable to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 50ft man looked injured, Roberto wasn\u2019t a doctor, but the 50ft man looked really injured. Robert soon finds the strength to move and walks towards the giant man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant man begins to movie and looks towards Robert. Robert stops moving after realizing that the giant man had noticed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c@#$(#)$$(@72.\u201d The giant man begins to speak in a language that Robert didn\u2019t understand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t understand you.\u201d Roberto says pointing to his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant man looks at Roberto for a few minutes with a little annoyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this better child, are you able to understand me now?\u201d The giant man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes that much better.\u201d Robert says a little surprised by the recent change in the giant mans speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear you lowly little creatures language is so annoying.\u201d The giant man says with a arrogant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sorry if we can\u2019t be as good as you.\u201d Robert says  sarcastically with a little bit of attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s alright, not really your fault.\u201d The giant man says, actually thinking that you had truly  apologized to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was not in the mood for this p, not after having it out with his dad. But even though he wanted to walk away he could leave a injured man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey look man you are badly injured should I call a ambulance?\u201d Roberto asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant man starts to smirk and giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike your human science can fix me? What a joke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk that was the last straw, Robert was tired of this mans arrogance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk well sorry for trying to help! Good luck dude!\u201d Robert says as he started to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait mortal.\u201d The giant man says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert stops walking and turns around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook mortal I am in need of your assistance.\u201d The giant man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really you need the help of a lowly mortal such as myself?\u201d Robert says copying the arrogant tone of the giant man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant man wears a unsatisfactory look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk what can I do for you.\u201d Robert says with a little pep in his step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was one thing Robert liked it was putting jerks in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook mortal You know I am injured, but in truth I\u2019m not going to last much longer, not with out aid.\u201d The giant man looks down at Robert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d Robert asked. Robert didn\u2019t like this giant jerk, but that didn\u2019t mean he wanted him to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMortal, we must fuse together.\u201d The giant man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Robert asks I pot sure he heard what the giant man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe must fuse together. Only by my essence being fused into your body, can I continue to live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will happen to me, if we decide to do that.\u201d Robert asked a little worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing my subconscious will fade into your psyche, so you don\u2019t have to worry mortal.\u201d The giant man says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk man my name is not mortal, it\u2019s Roberto Morse.\u201d Robert says putting his hands on his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a horrible name, do your parents hate you?\u201d The giant man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good name.\u201d Robert says annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me what\u2019s your name, and what the hell are you.\u201d Robert asks <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name? My name can not be pronounced by people of the lower dimensions, so call me what you wish.\u201d The giant man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I\u2019ll call you Gray.\u201d Robert says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god.\u201d Gray says rolling his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs to were I come from, l come from the 5th dimension.\u201d Gray says with a sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe 5th  dimension? What\u2019s that like?\u201d Robert asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is indescribable, beyond mortal comprehension.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray looks down at Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Robert will you help me.\u201d Gray asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert thinks for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk we can fuse or whatever.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have my thanks, but a word of caution, you will have all of my powers, do be careful. Oh and one more thing you must never go to the 5th dimension ever.\u201d The giant man says with a stern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. I won\u2019t go to the 5th dimension.\u201d Robert says feeling a little curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon making the promise Gray starts to transform into white smoke. The white smoke surrounds Robert, and then before Robert new what was happening, Robert started to inhale the white smoke through his mouth. As the white smoke entered Robert, Robert felt his body being tarred apart, pain indulged Roberts very being, but he couldn\u2019t scream, he couldn\u2019t move. It soon ended, the pain was gone, and Robert was on his knees panting. Gray was gone leaving nothing but a huge crater. Robert looked at his body, Robert felt good no great, and yet scared. What would happen to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man I got to get home.\u201d Robert says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlash.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was indulged by a blinding light and the next thing he knew he was in in room sitting on his bed. Robert opened his door and alerted his mom and dad that he was home, then returned to sit on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(End of flashback)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god man p, you have super powers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He gradually rose from underneath the covers. His black hair hung over his eyes. He pushed it back and threw his feet on the ground. \"Okay, mom, I'm up.\" He remarked as she flipped on the light. She was in a turquoise robe with snowflakes littered around it.. Her light-blonde hair was pulled back in a bun. \"Get dressed,I woke you up late.\" she said, turning to walk out of the room. She stopped halfway and turned around. \"Ohh, and its cold outside, so wear a coat.\" He nodded and sat for a few minutes in a daze. When he finally was half-awake, he stood up.  <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n        It had been a week since his fifteenth birthday, and it was surely a very odd day. You see, his family is \"different\". They have special powers. Mental powers. They can use thier minds to make people say and do things against their will. Kyle, however, is very special, for he can also move objects and see spirits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       He walked over his dresser and pulled out a pair of jeans, a green and black shirt with the saying \"Hello: My Names None Of Your Business\" and a blue, light jacket.

A elderly woman was siting on the black desk chair. She was in a yellow flowered dress and three inch white high heels. A wide amber bonnet was on her graying haired head. <br>\r\n    \"Please child, tell me where I am.\" She said in a soft, but scared toned voice. Kyle smiled and dropped the heavy backpack making a thud sound.<br>\r\n    \"What's your name?\" He questioned nervously. It was still weird to talk to the undead. He had never really taken anything supernatural seriously before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The old woman thought for a moment. \"My name is Alison Vonstrution,\" Kyle noticed a small red handbag resting on her lap. \"I can't find my husband!\" she exclaimed, her voice rising a little. A tear fell from her eye.<br>\r\n    \"Mrs. Vonstrution, please stop crying,\" Kyle pleaded. \"What year do you think it is?\" <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Sometimes, or so his grandmother has told, spirits know they are dead.

Instead she wiped tears that weren't there and rose up from the desk, twirling around in her yellow flower dress. She began to mumble as she danced, Kyle couldn't hear it clearly but figured it was her husband's name. \"I made it! I didn't go too far...\" She spoke to herself a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Vonstrution?\" Kyle interrupted. But the spectral lady was in a trance and she continued her movements as swirls of phantom energy floated around her, crackling against furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle thought about going downstairs right away and letting his mom know that a ghost had visited. This was his family's business after all, and he was still just learning the basics. With barely over a week since his powers manifested, all he had seen were accidents around the local area. But what better way to learn than to take on a new case? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman stopped dancing and took off the bonnet tied around her hair. To Kyle's surprise, the grays were diminished and he could see strands of brown replacing them on the scalp. Her face looked less wrinkled and even her dressed appeared more vibrant as if her ghostly form was taking on more color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking for Mesmerize, I have a call of urgent warning from the near-future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his developing telekinesis, he clumsily retrieved his phone from the desk and began to type as he interviewed Mrs. Vonstrution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not available but look, I am her son! I can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Vonstrution smiled. \"Of course you can. An event will happen in a few months that will wipe out 90% of the world! My husband and I... We were fighting the Consumption but it drained him and I perished in the explosion that was meant to defeat it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle scratched his head in confusion. He had also never heard of a ghost from the future. This encounter was already having him question everything he thought he knew about his abilities. Still he didn't want to give up just yet and go asking his mom for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're from the future, Mrs. Vonstruition, how can I help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make wormholes, I can't bring myself to before I died... but I can send you to the point in this timeline and you can prevent billions of deaths!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked at her youngest now, her face looking only a few years older than Kyle. He had so many questions and wanted to ask how she was doing that.. but refrained from doing so to not show his inexperience. Maybe that was something ghosts could do, he really did have plenty to learn about the mysterious Spirit World that his mother had spent years devoted to studying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, child. These portals may seem.. frightening.\" <br>\r\nMrs. Vonstruition spoke, spreading her arms around the center of the room. Sparks of spectral energy began to rise from her limbs as she closed her eyes, concentrating. Kyle began to feel dizzy as if a sickness was overtaking him. \"Stand aside for now. When the time is right, you'll know to take the plunge.\" The now not-so-old lady assured him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wasn't feeling so well but indeed, there was a powerful rift spreading throughout the room. The ceiling light swung back and forth and cracks began to form on the walls. Mrs. Vonstruition looked like her body was completely glowing as most of her hair floated up and her skin became translucent, showing a rather disturbing view of her innards. \"Ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wormhole looks beautiful. It seems to keep growing, taking over the room and although something about it disturbs Kyle, he can't help but feel drawn to it. Is this how he can save the timeline?

The manager just finishing his shift and exits. The door is locked and sliding metal mesh gate is pulled down and also locked. Patiently the dark figure waits and watches until the manager leaves the empty parking lot. Leaving his headlights off he drives closer to the store entrance and exits his jeep. He looks both ways assuring himself no one else is around and approaches metal mesh gate knowing it would be locked he reaches towards the gate lock and positions his hand over it and within seconds it begins to disintegrate leaving a faint mist that is absorbed through the skin of his palm, a gaping hole is left where the lock was, leaving the edges not sharp but smooth to the touch and the gate loosens and lifts a little at the bottom raising itself. He proceeds to lift it higher up and above the the glass door lock and this time he places his hand on the glass door close to the lock, the glass is absorbed through his skin, instantly he feels the added weight of the metal mesh and glass added to himself. His first thought was the hidden safe, he knows where its at in the managers office and proceeds to quickly to it. Of course it was locked so he put his hand on the combination wheel and slowly it disintegrates and again absorbed. The safe opens revealing the coinage and cash set for the morning shift, he quickly stuffs it into the sack he had in his other hand, he added the personal items of the manager that he stored for safekeeping. When he finished with the safe he went into the store choosing the most expensive laptop, gather the appropriate accessories and upgrades. He knew what he was look for and was quick at it, and when he finished he stopped at the countered and hesitated. He put down the laptop, accessories, and sack and thinking for a second he holds his hands close together and slowly a glowing glob of glass metallic metal rotated and slowly it st formed into a perfect sculptor image of the manager in glass and metal. This was his trademark. he gathered everything, left the store and left in his jeep</span></div></div>",

You got something to eat and you immediately went to sleep afterwards, since you weren't feeling well at all. You figure that whatever had struck you, had messed up your system and you needed to get some rest to recover from some sickness. You got in your room and crawled in bed early, sleeping through the night clear until morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the alarm went off at 6 o'clock the next morning, you rolled around in bed, as you normally would do. However, you noticed something really odd. Even though you were holding on to the pillow with both hands, as you always did, you couldn't feel the sheets or the mattress under you. The sheets and the covers were still draped over your chest, but something felt strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly turned around, the covers suddenly fell from your back and shoulders, leaving your entire body exposed. Luckily, you were wearing your pajama's, otherwise you would have felt cold. Again, you couldn't feel the mattress under your torso. It almost felt like you were sleeping on air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you opened your eyes. Yes, your bed was still there. You were still in your room. Your sheet and covers had fallen to the floor. However... You were hovering three feet above your bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What the---\u201d you moan as you rub your eyes and look down. \u201cWhere's my bed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it dawned on you. You spent the entire night sleeping while hovering suspended in the air about three feet above your bed! In other words, you were flying all night long! You're floating like a balloon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHOA!\u201d you gasp, as it dawns on you that you're three feet away from the carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get down!\u201d you say to yourself, as you drop your pillow to the floor. \u201cHow did I get up here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou try to imagine your body landing with your feet first on the floor right by your bed. It begins to succeed at first, as your body slowly descends to the floor. Your toes are sticking out, facing to the carpet, and they gently touch down on the carpet. You breathe a sigh of relief, as you made your first landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is weird! I guess I gained the ability to fly or something!\u201d you wonder out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel an intense pressure building in your chest, which almost seems like your powers to go flying needed to be tested and soon. You take two steps towards your dresser when you suddenly begin to hover above the ground once again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man! I'm airborne again!\u201d you gasp, realizing that your feet had left the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time around, you concentrate on lending on the floor. This time, it works out a little easier than the first time, and you land on the ground. But, as soon as you begin to walk towards your closet, your body wants to take flight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I guess I'll need to fly around a bit...\u201d you sigh, as you extend your arms above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body lifts up off the ground and starts to float around the room. The tingling pressure in your chest immediately decreases and you feel much better right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fly two circles around your room, and you finally touch down next to your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang! I can fly! This is freakish! It's cool, but freakish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this point forward, you got no problem staying on the ground. But you know what to look out for, and to be ready to take off and to fly around now and then, especially when that odd tingling feeling comes back in your chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not ready yet to fly around at school, but flying home when school was over begins to sound like a great idea...</span></div></div>",

The driver could no longer move and the car was completely at a standstill, remaining in the middle of the street, just a few feet away from the two boys who were crossing the street without even seeing the car as it came towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only person who wasn't frozen was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa...

So that's what you did. You ran as fast as you could. Out of school and the playground. You didn't stop running until you were alone. You looked around. You were in the playpark a few miles from your school. Then, you sat down and thought. Where had your clothes gone? As you thought, you absent mindedly straightened your t-shirt. Looking down, you noticed that your clothes had re-materialised. \"That's quite a gift\" said a voice. Looking round, you saw a girl from your school. \"Have you been following me?\" you asked. She nodded. \"I was sent to get you\" she explained \"This isn't how I planned on telling you this, but I can read minds, I just heard everything you just said\" You went red. Very red. \"I think we should team up, your shape shifting abilities, my mind reading and controlling abilities, we could be unnstoppable\" she said.</span></div></div>",

But, I think I'm getting off topic. My name is Scott Parsons. I'm six feet tall exactly, never by an inch. I have silver hair, not gray, silver. My eyes are a strange yellow. My build is not that good. I wasn't the weakest kid in school, but I wasn't the strongest either. Anyway, Chemistry was probably the most BORING class ever. I only had one friend in there and his name was Baron. He was actually the rich kid, but he's not a snotty stuck-up brat like usual rich kids are. He had blonde hair and blue eyes. The bell finally rung and we were leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Parsons...hold up a moment...\" said the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher's name was Mr. Wallace. He wasn't that bad of a teacher, but he could really talk. I actually seen at least three kids fall asleep in his class! He has brown hair and eyes covered behind glasses. \"Mr. Parsons, I would like you to get some beakers from my lab please\" he said. \"I am aware that this is your lunch period, but if I recall in class you say you never eat school lunches. Now go on, get to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and entered the labs through the double door connected to his room. I don't know why he couldn't have gotten these himself. I was about to go back when I noticed a faint glow emitting from the bottom of a door. I never even knew there was a door there. I walked over and tried to open it. It wouldn't budge. I pressed against the door using my body and tried again. This time, I got it open. But, I was flung in from the amount of force I put on the door. I went head first into a shelf with several different chemicals contained. All of them fell on me, mixing as they fell. I thought by body would be eaten away, but I only felt a tingling sensation.</span></div></div>",

The shelf, however, had me pinned down. Mr. Wallace walked in and helped remove the shelf. \"What were you doing in here?!\" he asked slightly yelling. I got up and tried to squeeze the remaining chemicals from my clothes, \"I saw a light in here and I wondered what it was. The door was jammed so I pushed against it...and I think you can tell the rest. What was that light?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wallace walked over and simply pointed to the light bulb illuminateing the room. I felt so embarrassed, but then I remembered the chemicals. \"What were in those beakers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure myself\" he replied. \"I discovered this room a few days ago. I tried to identify what they were but they seem unnatural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got cleaned up, but I was excused from school early. Mr. Wallace wanted to make sure I was okay, so he demanded for me to go home and shower this stuff off. Problem was, I think my skin absorbed some of it. But, I'm not complaining. I got to go home early on a Friday! My house wasn't far from the school and I always rode my bike. I never wore a helmet, I never needed it. I peddled along and slowly made my way back home. I had to stop a couple of times to let cars pass down the intersections, but it wasn't that bad. I was nearly home when I heard a slight fizzle. My bike started to wobble and by back tire exploded. I tried to slam on the brakes but they launched me forward. I was heading straight for a light post. I prepared for impact but I felt nothing. I opened my eyes and saw that I was on the ground. I stood up and looked at the pole. There was a huge dent in it and the light above flickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wha...what happened? Did...did I...do THAT?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed my bike and walked the rest of the way home. I put my damaged bike in my garage and headed inside. I immediately took a shower, but I couldn't get that incident out of my head. I knew some people called me thick skilled, but I know I'm not THAT thick skulled. I dried myself off and put a clean pair of clothes on. Mr. Wallace said that I should burn my old clothes, and I didn't want him to say that for nothing. I did that with no problem at all. As I headed back, I passed my house's chimmney. I knocked on it, feeling how hard it was. I hit my head, and not only heard, but felt a metallic surface. Then, my back started to feel funny.</span></div></div>",

My back had a gray tint to it. It wasn't skin, it was armor! The mirror wasn't foggy or anything, my back was actually armor! They seemed to be plated because I could still bend over and back up again. However something else also seemed to be forming on the overlaps. I tried to not think about it, but what if they were something dangerous. Right on that thought, solid steel spikes shot out from them. They were about three inches in length and about a inch in diameter. There were at least three per plate of armor. I tried to put my shirt down, but the spikes pierced through the fabric. I had no idea what was happening to me. It was those chemicals! They did this! I couldn't call a doctor or Mr. Wallace, I would be turned in and he would be fired. But, I knew who I could call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran out of the bathroom but tripped down the stairs. I curled up to ease the pain, but I felt nothing. I looked around and saw that I was at the bottom of the stairs. Although, everything seemed taller. I stood up to find my shirt in shreads. I ignored that fact and headed for the house phone. On a note beside the phone, it said: \"Gone for the weekend. Don't wreck the house while we're gone.\" I disliked the fact that they couldn't trust me, but I loved them. I was about to grab the phone when I felt this sharp pain in my arm. Then, it happened to the rest of my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's....happening...to me....?\" I grunted in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel it, cold metal rushing through my body like blood. My arms began to form thick plateing. My hands slowly being covered in the same substance. I not only felt my chest getting harder, but also bigger. It seemed that I was gaining a little bit of muscle as well. My chest now seemed like armor, shining in the daylight from the window. My legs became metal too. My feet were solidified into metal as my toe became small claws. The pain faded from my body, but rushed straight to my head. It was too great, I passed out from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I woke up, my entire body felt numb. I tried to stand up, but my limbs were too weak. I looked at my hands, completely metal with small claws tipped on my fingers. But, something felt different. It was my head, something was on my head. I lifted a hand to touch it. A sound was made; like metal touching metal. Good thing the phone was on the ground, because I was freaking out!</span></div></div>",

One, because he was rich and two, because he was ridiculously smart. I wore a baggy sweatshirt and sweatpants to hide my mutation. I hope that Baron would still be my friend. I've seen this like a million times in stories over the internet. Someone changed completely, and then their family, friends, and everyone else decides to forget about him/her forever. I glanced through my window and saw Baron running up the driveway. I put my hood up as soon as he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what they did to ya?!\" he asked. I already told him about the chemicals. But one change made him stop in his tracks. \"Dude...you got taller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, apparently along with my extra muscle I gained some height as well. I sighed, \"Baron, what happened to me is...different then what you think. You need to promise me that you won't yell or inform the police.\" Baron backed up a little, \"Can I at least get a hint of how bad it is?\" I pulled up my sleeve, revealing my new hand. My hand was covered in metal and my fingers were claws. This made Baron gasp, but he seemed alright. I began to pull off my sweatshirt. I hoped that Baron wouldn't bolt for the door. The sweatshirt was completely off, revealing my mutations. One thing I forgot to mention was my head. My skin was metal, but it had this design. Around my forehead and lower neck area looked something like a helmet. Down my neck were these plates that overlapped. My eyes were all yellow and my teeth were shiny and pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude...that's awesome!\" shouted Baron. \"You look like a superhero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shot him a look, \"Since when does this remind you of a superhero?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It kinda reminds me of that one show with alien heroes and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S A TV SHOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy voice shook the house, knocking a few things over. One item was the television remote and turned it on. It was on the news station. \"This is just in, we have a bank robbery in progress dowtown\" said the newswoman. \"The Fourth Street Bank was activated into complete lockdown from the inside. Local authorities cannot get inside or determine what the robbers want. But they are assuming that they are trying to get into the bank's reserves. Local authorities are trying their best but they cannot get past the thick steel doors blocking the entrance. There are reported hostages...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaron shut the TV off and looked at me. \"Dude! This is perfect!\" he exclaimed. \"You can save those people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up to me and tried to put his face near mine to look threatening, \"There are hostages dude.

Baron took notice of this, his face flashed with an idea. \"Dude, try rolling into a ball!\" I had no time to argue, so I began to curl up.

Although his face was filled with shock, \"Dude...your as big as a freakin wrecking ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened up and headed for the door.

I had no time to lose, I ran out the door, rolled up, and went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth Street Bank looked like the Greek Parthenon, only with more metal. The doors and the windows were blocked entirely with metal. Policemen and firemen were at the doors, trying to find a way inside. The hero stayed in the alleyway, away from the police cars and people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testing testing, 1 2 3...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baron, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, I AM YOUR FATHER.\"\u00a0The Darth Vader voice was funny but unneeded. \"Sorry dude, yeah it's me. This earpiece will allow me to contact you for some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. So, is there anywhere on the outside I can get to? I don't think I could ring the doorbell and walk in unharmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on....okay. The only thing untouched by the lockdown is the skylight. Get up there and you'll be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa man! You're forgetting two things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A name...and a grand entrance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero looked up, \"I have an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolicemen were forcing the crowd back. The last thing they needed were more civilians getting hurt. A few screams caught their attention, right before a giant silver ball fell into the street with sheer force.\u00a0The ball unfurled, revealing the hero. The crowd was silent as it looked across the crowd. Each step it took caused a tiny shake. \"Excuse me officers\" he said, \"But I'll need to borrow your car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer took no time in getting away. The hero picked up the car with ease, flipped it, and laid it at an angle over another. The hero then ran back before rolling into a ball. The ball rolled forward, flew off the car like a ramp, and headed towards the side of the bank. At the last second, several spikes formed on the outside, allowing the hero to stick to the wall. He slowly rolled up to the top until he landed on the roof. The spikes retracted as he unfurled from the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm on the roof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, be careful\" Baron said. \"There's like four guys in there heavily armed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero nodded, jumping right before he curled into a ball. He smashed straight through the skylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Hurry up!\" Several men were trying to get into the vault. Two men were standing guard while two held guns facing the hostages. One in particular was a little girl. The tallest one seemed to be the one in charge. \"You idiots better get into that vault soon! Otherwise the rest of us will get larger portions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of smashing glass caught their attention. A giant silver ball crashed into the floor, sending a wave of cracks everywhere. The hero unfolded from his state. \"Stop this now and release the hostages!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards pulled their guns out and fired. The hero turned his back to them. The bullets bounced off his back and hit the guards. But luckily it just hit their arms. They dropped as the ball rolled towards the others. Silver spikes fired from his body, pinning the two armed men to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right there metal head!\" The hero turned to consult the insulter. However, he had to stop. The leader held a gun in one hand, and the little girl in the other. \"Now you have two options here. Either one, stop now and let me go with the money. Or, you can continue being a hero and the little girl dies! Your choice hero...\"</span></div></div>",

Last week however something inside you had changed you can't remember how or even why it was happening.  All you knew was that somehow you had become far different than you ever had been. You went to your parents and asked them about it, but unfortunately they gave no answers to you. It wasn't until you smashed the alarm clock and your end table the next morning when you first discovered you had Super Strength! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You were amazed at your strength and power and even became invigorated at using it to get what ever you could want. You could literally be anything! The first thing you decided to do after that was get dressed and show your best friend your new found powers surely she too would be amazed at your awesome power as well! There was just one problem though, you had no control over your power and wound up breaking everything you touched from the door, to the bathroom faucets and even your dad's car which you thought was a piece of junk anyway. Slowly as time passed you began to realize that having these powers may not be as great as you would think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You go towards your best friend Rebecca Star. She had blond hair blue eyes was about five foot six feet tall and you and her had known each other since you were little. You try to knock as carefully as you can as you didn't want to damage her door, but still had little to no control over your own strength yet. It was her mother who answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Hello, Is Rebecca Home?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Yes, she is come right in, recently she's been keeping to herself a bit more than usual though. I don't know what's gotten in to that girl, maybe you can help.\" Her mom said letting you inside her house.  It was shortly after that you went towards Rebecca's room and knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Rebecca it's me! You can open up.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" No! You can't see me like this! I'm a freak!\" Rebecca yelled.  The freak comment suggested that something has happened to her, something she's afraid of.

What ever it was that's bothering you or changed you I'm sure we can get through it together! I have changed somewhat as well, Here I'm coming in!\"  You tell her and come in the door and that is when you first see Rebecca and the changes she has gone through. You just woke up to having super strength one day ago, but your friend Rebecca now had cat ears and a cat tail as well as the reflexes of a cat and very sharp claws!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She was amazed to see your strength but as you saw her sitting in the corner of the room afraid of everyone judging  her for how she looked, you caressed her as gently as you could and held her in your arms. \" Rebecca! Just cause your like this  doesn't make you any less of yourself, You are still my best friend and always will be!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Thanks, I need  that, but I think you need to learn to control your strength your still hugging too tight I can't breathe.\" Rebecca said.  You quickly remove your arms from Rebecca allowing her to breathe once more.  The week passed on and Rebecca began homeschooling still afraid of what people would think about her look. During that week you discovered to teenager all over the world were beginning to have powers but there was no reason or explanation of why. You and Rebecca for that past week had been working on that mystery.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You missed Rebecca w hen you had to go to school but you also knew that she needed time before she was more comfortable with her changes.

You expected them to be fearful, or wary of your powers, but now you knew that your parents really did love you. You also found out who your true friends were in the next few days. After the hubbub had died down, the world continued as normal. Rebecca was told to return to school, as well as many of the other students that had disappeared from school over the last few days. The school counsellor was kept very busy, seeing students both with powers and without that were trying to cope with the new situation. The counsellor had sent a letter home to your parents, recommending a monastery in the nearby hills. She thought that being able to keep your mind focused, you would be able to keep yourself from hurting someone accidentally, as you had come close to doing several times already, in school and at home. So you trained, after school every day for months, feeling more and more focused. As a side effect of being around the monastery, you also picked up much of the martial prowess of the monks that made their home there. You even manage to persuade a sword master at the temple to teach you how to use a blade, if only that the constant practice would help her maintain her focus, even outside of the monastery.</span></div></div>",

Each time you heard there insults it made you angrier and angrier but you also knew you had to restrain from seriously hurting anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Aw, Poor little Kitty all alone! Go back to your litter box you freak!\" This one was heard quite a bit from Rebecca she was getting used to it. But still not liking all the attention she got just cause her powers made  her look more like a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Yeah, After all you are the cat's meow in your alley! We don't need a freaky geek like you here!\" Another of the bullies said. The one from this bully from her tone you could tell Rebecca was hurt by this, as the girl who said this was one of hers and your former friends you didn't know if she was jealous of you two, or just plain mean cause you two had changed.  By now though you had enough and decided to stop these bullies before Rebecca feels any worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You two leave my friend alone! She doesn't deserve to be treated like that!\" You tell them. Unfortunately the school bullies now that you would get in trouble if you voluntarily hit them so instead of stopping they start picking on you instead. \" This is none of your business ox woman! You should just abandon her it would make your life so much easier.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I don't abandon my friends! And I'm not an ox. Now Apologize to her now!\" You demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" We don't have to listen to you, so we don't need to apologize to anyone. Why what are you going to do throw us down like the brutish thug you are?!\"  The Other bully said,  it was at this point you decided if they weren't going to apologize then it would be best to walk away before you blow your temper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" If you don't apologize you may end up regretting it. Are you okay Rebecca?\" You asked looking at Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I wish I could just go home school for the entire year, why did my parents have to tell me to go back to regular school? It's hard enough as it is at home. My parents hardly look at me anymore.\" Rebecca replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I am sure this is new to them as well, it will take them time to get used to it as well.\" You said.  This cheered up Rebecca a bit so far she's had it hard and you had your training at the monastery as well in order to maintain control which occupies some of the time you could spend with Rebecca.  The two of you go to your class hoping the day would get better as so far it's been nothing but bullies and people picking on anyone who's out of the ordinary.</span></div></div>",

When this law passes it will enforce you to change schools to a place where only Super powered teens are. We are simply offering you a chance to become a Team before the law passes. Luckily this law will only go for high school, and not for college.\" The other man in the suit told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Do you have others who have agreed to your terms?\"   You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Why yes, In fact we do three boys in  fact all around your age. Unfortunately only two of them are here today. Each one has a superpower that is quite different from yours in fact. Why don't we let them come out.\" The man in the suit said and then he signaled for two boys to come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" Hello I am Keith Silo. I recently joined the group due to well various circumstances. A few months ago I found out my powers. To put it in the simplest terms I am a Speedster. I am quick on my feet as well as quite intelligent as well.\" Keith said.  Keith was six feet and two inches tall had brown hair and blue eyes. He wasn't the most muscular of the guys you've seen but the second you saw him run you knew he was telling the truth about him being a Speedster.  It wasn't long after Keith came out that  the next guy came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The next teenage boy had red hair, blue eyes and appeared to be five foot nine inches tall. \" Greetings My name is Hansel Bask. Unlike my friend here I am not a Speedster. I am a Shape Shifter. I can change my shape to be anyone or anything.\"  Hansel said.

Now I will pick you for a demonstration.\" Mr. Daniels said pointing towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Me? What do you need me to do?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I want you to perform basic mouth to mouth on this dummy.\" Mr. Daniels said. \" Just do it as you normally would.

Aside from cracking the mask, the girl didn\u2019t respond to the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d the girl asked laughter and a hint of madness in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up despite the senior pushing down on her; he twisted her arms in a way that should have dislodged both her shoulders, nothing. She did a neat backflip over the senior\u2019s shoulders and choked him into unconsciousness with his own arms. Chuck had taken off running and was too far away to catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked girl sighed before asking, \u201cDid you get that Liz?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it Mindy,\u201d a young blonde, maybe fifteen at most said climbing out from behind the fence she\u2019d been hiding behind, \u201cGot some good pictures, I was worried that you might not win this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they\u2019d played smart and just grabbed me as a group I wouldn\u2019t have, but they were all stupid people who think with their dicks,\u201d the masked girl said picking up one of the boy\u2019s phones and sending it the picture she\u2019d taken earlier before sending it to the police with the name of the school and location as well as a recommendation they send an ambulance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe better get out of here,\u201d Mindy said removing her mask, \u201cPolice will be here soon and they don\u2019t like vigilantes.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You shok your head. \"They think we tried to steal the diamond, they're looking for us\" you say \"We have to be more careful\" Abbie nodded, seriously. \"We need costumes\" she said \"So people don't guess our identity\" \"In order to get costumes, we'll have to let someone else into our secret\" you say. \"Better to let one person into our secret than the world\" Abbie replied. You fell silent. She had a point. </span></div></div>",

Sam looked out of breath, as if she had just finished a marathon. \"What's up, Sam, it looks like you just chased a cheetah across half the world\" you asked. \"Abbie's been kidnapped\" she said, still trying to catch her breath. \"What!\" you asked, frantically. \"I know, why would anyone want to kidnap Abbie?\" said Sam \"Her parents aren't overly wealthy, the only reason that I could think of was that her kidnapping had something to do with her powers\" \"We have to go\" you say \"You can't go home, Sam, they saw us at your house, so they might try and capture you to get to us\" \"O.K\" said Sam. \"Just let me grab a few things, and we'll go\" you say.

You and Sam are hiding in a bush when the same black car comes past. \"That's the kidnappers car\" you whisper \"We have to follow them\" \"Follow me\" said Sam, leading you to the road. She comes up next to a car and brings out a piece of wire. She slides it inbetween a window and the door and jiggled it about. The door to the car unlocked. Amazed at what she had done, you fired a small pulse into the car to deactivate the alarm. You then go over to the passenger side and climb in. Sam fumbles underneath the car and, suddenly, the car starts. Sam climbs in and starts driving after the departing lights of the black car. \"I'm impressed, where'd you learn that?\" you ask Sam. \"My mum's a criminal\" she said \"I picked up a few things\" \"Keep the light off, we don't want to attract they're attention\" you say. After what seems like hours, you arrive at a warehouse. \"Abbie must be here\" you say. You stayed in the car and watched several men in black get out of the car and head towards the warehouse. \"I'm goin in\" you say \"Stay here, if i'm not back in thirty minutes, call the police and tell them where Abbie is\" Sam nodded. You got out of the car and headed towards the warehouse. You tried one of the doors. It was, as you had anticipated, locked. \"I could really use Sam's lock picking skills now\" you thought \"I guess i'll have to do with my own talents\" You then quickly sent sparks through the metal lock. You switched the electric charge on the locking mechanism, so that it repelled the other metallic charges, causing it to unlock. You slowly opened the door and walked inside. You heard voices coming from up ahead. You crept forward and peered round the corner. You saw six men with guns, surrounding Abbie, making sure that she couldn't escape. She was wrapped in an electric blanket, which kept her body temperature high enough so that she couldn't produce ice. She was sweating like crazy. You quickly step out and reveal yourself to the six men. Abbie's eyes widened at the sight of you. The six men all trained their guns on you. \"Take one more step and we'll shoot\" said one of the men, probably the leader. Looking down, you saw that the floor was metal. You signalled for Abbie to raise her feet off the ground. Abbie, realising what you planned to do, lifted her feet off the ground. You stepped forward, channeling your electricity through you and to the metallic ground. The men were shocked to say the least. They were all knocked unconscious by the blast. It wasn't a major shock. Just enough to knock them out. You ran over to Abbie and untied her, taking off the electric blanket. \"Lets get out of here\" you say. She gets up, but stumbles. You put her hand over your shoulder and, her leaning on you for support, you proceed to sneak out of the warehouse. You leave the warehouse and break into a light jog for the car you had arrived in. You and Abbie jumped in the back. </span></div></div>",

Physically, you are near perfection with a figure that models would kill for and strong attributes. You were a legend among super heroines with the ability to manipulate magic. Your only weakness, you could never work potions as you were allergic to even the most basic of ingredients. Your mother, a witch of an unknown coven, disapproved of your heroic activities and constantly tried to convince you to 'disappear'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwelve years ago, you faced the the most notorious villain ever, he called himself Scilock. This super villain was a mad genius with an inert talent for magic, he used high tech gadgetry and magical artifacts to steal money and magical items to increase both his wealth and power. Only the more he obtained, the more he wanted. You and Scilock had crossed swords a number of times, each ending in a stalemate. He always managed to escape justice and you always managed to stop him from obtaining his goal. With each encounter over next two years, the dialog between the two of you became more intimate. Unknown to you, it was Scilock's way of manipulating women but, unknown to him, he was actually falling in love with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, tragedy struck, forcing you and him to work together. A massive, man made storm from an unknown super villain threatened the entire city. You convinced Scilock, who had secretly fallen for you, to help save the city. Together, with your combined talents, found and deactivated the weather machine responsible for the storm. However, the machine was detonated before either of you could get out of range. Those who knew you, mourned their loss. Few mourned over Scilock, though they knew, in his final hours, he turned good. Unknown to the world at large, you and Scilock both survived, though you were badly injured. He slowly nursed you back to health and the two of you married shortly after, leaving the world to believe you were both dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen years later, you, Maria Strong, and your husband, Max, returned home from a night out to discover that your home had been ransacked. Stephanie, the teenage girl you had hired to watch over your nine year old daughter, Megan was unconscious on the floor and the door to Megan's bedroom had been ripped off its hinges. Fearing the worst, you ran for Megan's room while Max tended to the baby sitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan!?\" you called, rushing into her room. \"Honey, are you in here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer came but you found a note on her bed, held there by a knife, trusted into the mattress. It read...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Scilock... If you wish to ever see your daughter alive again you will return to us and reclaim your proper place in the Council of Chaos.... You have seven days to comply or your daughter will face our wrath.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Council of Chaos?\" you muttered. \"Max never mentioned this to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the note and marched downstairs to the living room where Max was giving Stephanie an ice pack her her head and roughly pulled him out of ear shot before handing him the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care to explain this?\" you whispered, angrily. \"You never told me you were a member of this group!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax read the note and turned red with anger himself. \"I never was a member.\" he whispered back. \"My father was and he was a bitter enemy of your mother, they just assumed that I would take my father's place but I was more of a solo act and refused them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to turn pale, now understanding your mothers protests against you marrying Max. You still loved him with all of your heart and you were not about to let him face this alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of Stephanie, Maria.\" he said suddenly. \"I'll be in the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't, Max!\" you whispered, stopping him. \"Megan is my daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are my wife!\" Max fired back. \"I can not, will not allow you to place yourself into danger, this is my hunt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he pushed passed you and ran for the basement stairs, to entrance of his secret lair.  You sighed, shaking your head and walked over to Stephanie. Twenty minutes later, Stephanie was well paid and sent home, magically influenced to believe that she, you, and Max had made their reports to the police. Once she was gone, you moved down stairs to find Max. Only you discovered that his old costume was missing from its display, along with a large number of his new gadgets and magical items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God!\" you thought. \"He's gone after them!\" you started to shiver. \"We've been out of practice for ten years, he won't stand a chance unless I can get some help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Max was a tall, powerfully built man, completely bald, with eyes that had the color of fire, a result of his power. You gently ran your finger over his rock like chin on the photograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, Max.\" you whispered tearfully. \"It's my turn to save you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you ran upstairs to the attic and entered your lair.

Along all but one of the walls were shelves upon selves of books, containing spells, incantations, magical history of the city, and so on. On the one wall, free of books were shelves of jars and vials, containing various powders and liquids to make potions.

You enter, give the clerk the passwords Bob told you, and finally you meet the New Do Wells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy, they are some characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy Hitter, AKA Jessica Archer, F 19<br>\r\nJessica's power is super strength, which is both practical and normal for regular heroes. The only thing wrong with Jessica is her utter rage that comes with everything. That, and her being slighlty overweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Animal Kid, AKA Bill Moran, M 25<br>\r\nBill is consistently shirtless. He doesn't have a distinct power, however he does seem to lack restraint, allowing him to go to more depths that certain minds couldn't think about. His weakness is, he's not very bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRighteous Fury, AKA Elissa Berkhauser, F 47<br>\r\nElissa, older than even I am, was a surprise. She dressed very classily, and didn't seem to partake in the roughhousing of her cohabitants. She has the power to summon electricity, however it is only if she believes what she is doing is align with her beliefs. Weaknesses: Her general brittleness. Also, she believes in Scientology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. One Inch, AKA Harry Archer, M 19<br>\r\nHarry doesn't really have a power, if you ask me. Harry was born one inch tall, as all of his nutrients were given to his twin sister, Jessica. Harry still remains light hearted, and surprisingly charming. His weaknesses? He can die pretty easily, he's fairly cowardly, and he pisses off Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipknot, AKA Chris Weiss, M 27<br>\r\nHe can climb anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese five were a curious bunch. They didn't seem to work well together. But, I still needed to save Max. Would they be the people to take with me to the ends of the Earth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

YOU decide<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Edit 30.12.2013</i> <br>\r\nI had a very limited review the other day, which merely asked a question about a single thread that ended badly. As such, I have decided to put in a couple of rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In regard to additions:</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understand that some stories come to a close at their own pace, but do not end the story after only one chapter of it. The review that I speak of had found this dead end storyline. I have changed it, and will be looking through the rest of the story for any other areas where people have ended the story without letting it develop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In regard to reviews and ratings:</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I am in favour of helpful reviews that help me to improve my own work and chapters, I am not in favour of people who give me a one or two star review and then justify it with one line, and a question at that. If you have a question about the story, please don't put it in a review, send me an email about it. Keep the reviews for constructive criticism on how to improve the story, or to tell me what you liked about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's everything, please enjoy the story. </td>",
