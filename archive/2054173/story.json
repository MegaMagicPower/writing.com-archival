The basis for the idea came from all the comics and other media that had people transformed into superheroes. After enlisting in the research ward in the military you and Alison worked on the project that would create the world's first super-powered task force. Tonight was finally the night. You along with a few other people were going to undergo the experiment. Your friend, Allison, was going to activate the Nucleus, a machine that contains a mix of various ions that activates the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready partner?\" Your partner asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready!\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison then pushes the button on the touchscreen computer. After the button was pushed the Nucleus began charging. Within the next minute the Nucleus fires a beam at you and your fellow test subjects. The atomic blast enveloped your body. You could feel your muscles tensing and aching in an almost unbearable pain. You then pass out. You faintly hear your friend's voice calling your name. The project was over, but the blast from the Nucleus knocked you and the other test subjects out like a light. A few hours later you wake up in the infirmary. Nothing felt weird or different, but you were certain that you were somehow changed. You then hear a familiar voice call out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad your awake. How are you feeling...</span></div></div>",

You're the kindest man that I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange tension fills the air and not relating to the experiment. Could Allison be in love with you?

We need to gather the others and see what type of changes the Nucleus bestowed upon them. According to our research the changes could be nuclear, biological, quantum, chemical, or anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Despite firing ions various components were added in. So all the results wouldn't be the same. Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it me or do you think that someone may try to steal our invention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Don't be... Could the Nucleus have given you psychic powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison this is no time to joke around! I just have a bad feeling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Could she be right? I have to find that out later. I just remember how Colonel Logan was anxious to put together the task force. What could have in store for this task force other than win wars?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered from all the superhero comics that there's always a villain that wanted absolute power for themselves. You just felt that somehow something could go wrong. As you run out the door you trip over your own feet. To your surprise...</span></div></div>",

People with the M-gene go through a metamorphosis. This usually occurs during or after puberty and people who go through the change may look the same or look completely different.

Upon birth your species resembles humans, the species who dwell on the planet that your kind now coexists with. The year is 2300. In the year 2116 after the destruction of your species original homeworld, the Synthumian space staion Cosmoya, your kind was forced to find another home world until a new one could be rebuilt. According to your race's history your race were just several nomadic clans that traveled the cosmos. It was during the Cosmic Wars that the tribes united together. In the year 700 they built an organic space station that could support your kind. The planet was made out of an organic metal with unique properties. Once the space station grew to maturity your kind brought the Fluxvolvian Stones, the catalyst that triggers your kinds transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation usually bestows unimaginable power, but sometimes an individual's physical appearance undergoes a minor or drastic change. Before any of your kind can use the Fluxvolvian stones their are a few requirements that the Counsel has in place. All Synthumans must know the knowledge and lore of your race. They must also sign up for the military draft or be part of the military, even if it's in non-combative roles. Finally, Synthumans must never abuse their powers. This has helped the government of your race keep everything in order despite some criminals who illegally go through Flux. During Flux the individual in wrapped in an orb of light. After Flux the orb vanishes and the individual comes out changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince your kind inhabited Earth they were amazed at what they discovered. People of Earth had developed powers similar to your kind, but through various means. The WU has dubbed such people as Revolutionaries since most of them required experimentation or were just freak accidents. You were currently residing in the Gravlock base in Odessa, Texas. You were part of a global Synthumanian military unit called Galacton. As part of Galacton you and other Sythumians would fight rogue Revolutionaries or Sythumans who posed a major threat to your home. You have yet to go through Flux, yet going through Flux was voluntary when all the requirements were met and also due to Sythumian military scientists having to grow the stones in the labs scattered across the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuild wise you stood at 6'8\" and were stocky in stature. Your stocky frame boated of well-developed muscles. All in all you were average height for your race, but compared to humans your a tall guy. Your you had a fair complexion and bright teal eyes and black hair. Yet both pre-Flux and post-Flux after flux your race came in many skin tones, except that pre-Flux skin tones were the same as humans while post-Flux can stay the same or drastically change. You were currently with your fellow Sythumans as the director of your faction was going over the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up troops. World United has recently reported that the League of Corruption has been recruiting more members. We located their base in Skarnum. We will be sending several teams to take out their base. The only problem is that men and women who have gone throughFlux will be enough. If you want to go through Flux now is your chance, however slots are limited so it's a first come first serve basis.\" The director said as a table came up right out of the floor next to where she was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour director, Starna Warpoon was a Synthuman who has already gone through Flux. Her appearance was always the same even after Flux. She had the power of magnetism and could turn anything she touches into a magnet if she so chooses. Her naturally beautiful blonde hair and silver eyes were full of determination. Her complexion was a natural tan and she was the same height yet not as buff as you. You secretly harbored a crush for the director since you were the same age. Out of all Synthumans you were one of the few to achieve a high rank despite not having powers yet. It was after this speech you decided that you were ready to go through Flux. Luckily for you, you were the first in line, After signing up on the tablet that was on the table you take your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later half the room had signed on to go through Flux if they haven't been through it already. The director then resumes to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate your dedication. Tomorrow report to the Training Room for Flux.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied you head back to your quarters.
