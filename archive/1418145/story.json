You climb out and look up at the pikachu who by now had become a lot less hyper. You see her eyes start to fill with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo, now I can't get married\" the pikachu girls wails, \"I told you to stop toy\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all i'm not a toy, and second of all you started it\" you reply. The pikachu girl keeps crying and feeling kind of bad because you were partly responsible you say \"hey why can't you become a bride anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to save myself for my first and now I can't\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're first then would be me?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly stops crying and says \"well yeah, but you're just a toy I can't marry you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I am not a toy and why not?\" you ask feeling kind of insulted that she said she couldn't marry you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're so small, and I don't think you're even a pokemon\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm not a pokemon but you didn't seem to mind those things when you were using me for you're own pleasures\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" she says looking downcast, \"you're just so cute, and it's my first time in heat and I can't find a mate\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you found a male pikachu you'd just have sex with him?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and says \"Yes and then he'd become my husband and he'd take me home with him, i'd have to leave my family but my parents already knew and accepted that\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're stuck with me\" you say smiling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're so small\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The better to care of you\" you say. \"But we haven't even introduced ourselves, i'm John\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda\" the pikachu replies, \"why are you being nice to me? I just used you for my own pleasure\" Linda asks staring down at you puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was always taught if it didn't kill you, just forgive and forget, no point in worrying about the past\" you say \"besides I got a beautiful giant pikachu as my wife that's a pretty good deal from my end\" you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says i'll accept you as my husband\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, have fun finding a mate\" you say turning and starting to walk away. Linda's tail lands in front of you and blocks you're path you \"I guess you wouldn't be so bad as a husband, I mean that did feel wonderful\" she says. \"But you're so small, how do I know you won't leave me for another girl or even my own mom\" Linda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise to take care of you from head to paw\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I can trust that\" Linda says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and how can I know you won't just try to get rid of me the first chance you get?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could always test the other's trust\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and how?\" you say, She picks you up and holds you in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you trust me?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not entirely since we just met but as much as anyone\" you reply. She opens her mouth and puts you down on her tongue, she closes her mouth and you just sit there. \"All I know is if i'm dying i'm choking her on the way down\" you think. Her tongue starts moving up and down and she knocks you over with it, it starts rolling you around her mouth and after a minute she opens her mouth and pulls you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you actually let me do that\" she says smiling at you, \"you're weird\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well this is a pretty weird situation\" you reply. She puts you into her breasts and says \"i'm going to test you in a bit.\" You feel her start running and you hang on as her chest kept bouncing around and hitting. She stops running after 10 minutes and you hear a door open and her run up a staircase. She opens another door and yells \"hey Vixi I brought you something interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and where is it?\" this vixi girl replies. Linda pulls you out of her breasts with 2 fingers and you hang in the air. Sitting in front of you is a vulpix, she was just as shapely as Linda with a smaller chest but a perfectly proportioned body. She gasps and moves closer she gives you a sniff and says \"what is it? a weird bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I take offense to that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh\" she screams and jumps back \"it can talk?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a human, like in the stories\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so why did you bring him here?\" Vixi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see.....he's also my husband\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's what!!??\" Vixi screams<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He made me cum so...\" Linda trails off, she puts you down on a bed and her and vixi sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So just get rid of him\" Vixi says, \"why do pokemon make such bad first impressions\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, he has my scent on him\" Linda says, \"do you want him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm well he made you cum so he might be inexperienced but why not\" Vixi says. She turns to you and says \"hey little guy, you belong to me now, we're gonna have so much fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah no\" you reply \"even if every bone in my body wasn't telling me to stay away from you i'd still stick with Linda\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just say?\" Vixi asks starting to get mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks Vixi\" Linda says grabbing you and bolting out of Vixi's house. She keeps running for another 5 minutes before she stops panting and says \"Wow \"pant\" you \"pant\" have guts\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do all pokemon make such bad first impressions, no offense but it's 2 for 2 so far\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well humans are only the stuff of fairy tales here\" Linda says, \"so I guess I should feel honored having you as a mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks\" you say starting to warm up to the pikachu girl, \"so I guess that means you won't be leaving home\" you say as she places you down on her shoulder and start walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not\" she says \"but it's going to be really weird explaining this, oh and just let me talk to my dad\" she says. She walks for a few minutes and you notice that the \"forest\" you were in was just a park in the middle of a city although a very big park it was still just that. Linda walks up to a 2 story house and as she enters you hear a loving voice from the kitchen say \"Welcome home Linda.\" Linda hides you in her chest again and walks into the kitchen \"hi mom\" she says hugging her mother compacting you in her breasts you were pretty sure on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts moving from side to side and says \"um mom, I kind of had my first time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Linda that's wonderful\" her mother says \"but wait why are you still here?\" she asks puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see my mate isn't exactly normal\" Linda says, she reaches into her breasts and pulls you out. You are hanging in front of a raichu standing a bit taller then Linda, you could tell from the resemblence where Linda got her great body from and you smile a bit before saying \"hi.\" Linda's mother leans forward and looks at you closely, she walks around her daughter getting a view of you from all angles, finally she gives you a poke. A smile spreads across the Raichu's face, \"that's quite a catch Linda, but from what i've heard of human men they're all sex crazed beasts\" the raichu says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I take offense to that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm sorry\" she says, \"that was meant as a compliment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....thanks\" you reply. \"I'm Trudy\" Linda's mother says extending a finger which you shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm John\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well John take good care of my daughter she's my pride and joy\" Trudy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\" you say. You're then taken and introduced to Linda's father who begrudgingly accepts you as his daughter's husband due to the laws and because Linda and Trudy were im support of you. Linda gives off a squeal as her father says he accepts you and runs upstairs, she runs into what you assume was her room. The walls were painted pink and there was a book case taking up one whole wall, the bed was very large and fully yellow. You notice a door on one side of the room which you assume led to a personal bathroom. Linda sits down on the bed and places you down in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why weren't you afraid or weirded out by me\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm kind of a fantasy junkie so I know a lot about humans\" she says. You lay back and snuggle into her chest fur. \"What are you doing?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm gonna be here a while might as well get comfortable\" you reply, you reach over and stroke one of Linda's legs getting a slight moan out of her. \"Well aren't you the sensitive one?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, i'm not, it's just that for some reason having you near me makes me feel wonderful and you're petting feels so good\" Linda says.</span></div></div>",

She blushes \"hurry up and get petting\" she quickly says. \"Whatever you want\" you say smiling, you climb onto her back and start rubbing and petting, it only took you a few seconds for you to get a small moan out of her, you ignore it and just keep petting. It takes you 5 minutes but you pet every inch of her backside and you jump off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt great, would you mind doing my front?\" Linda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, hey do you mind if I give you a nickname\" you ask as she turns over and you climb onto her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with calling me Linda\" she says right before you start rubbing, as soon as you do she starts softly moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know, I just think it'd be cute, just say no if you don't want it\" you say rubbing harder. When you get no answer you say \"well since you don't mind, I was thinking something like cutie or cuddle mouse,\" She tries to sit up but can't she just lays there softly moaning as you pet her. You stop after a minute and she sits up, \"I don't want a nickname\" she says looking down at you sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say Linda\" you reply sitting down on her stomach, you jump off onto the bed as she shocks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, what was that for?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking advantage of a girl when she's vulnerable\" Linda replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you're really one to talk\" you reply sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't want to hear that from you\" she says leaning over and giving you a poke with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, whatcha gonna do about it\" you reply grabbing her tail, as you do so she goes limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you're weak to petting and you're tail is even weaker\" you say smiling. You gently start rubbing her tail and she gives off a sigh of pure happiness as she leans over and hugs you to her wrapping herself up into a ball with you still holding her tail. You give it a stroke every so often and smile as she'd usually pull you even tighter and give off a sound from her throat almost like a purr. After 5 minutes you let go and you see her eyes go back into focus, she looks down at you for a second before hugging you into her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that felt amazing John, will you do it again?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later, didn't you want to have a party with you're parents?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, come on hubbie\" she says getting up, she hugs her breasts with one hand holding you in them and you just sit there and wait. You feel her run downstairs and jump down the last few almost knocking you out of you're place causing you to scramble to hang on. She quickly corrects herself and you land back in, frightened but ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that\" you yell <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, i'm just excited\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well don't let you're excitement get the best of you, that's what happened this morning\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and it's why I ended up with you\" she replies skipping the last bit into you the kitchen. You're quickly fished out and Lina places you down on a counter, you just sit down and watch as Linda runs up to her mother. They have a heated discussion for 5 minutes and then they both squeal, you cover you're ears and Linda walks over and stares down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we need to get you ready for the ceremony\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? aren't we just having a party with you're parents?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah but my dad's a priest\" Linda says, she picks you up in one hand and runs upstairs, she plops you down on the bed and rummages through a box before finding a doll's suit and places it on the bed near you. She races out of the room and you look over, you strip and put on the suit which actually fit pretty well. You wait around and you hear footsteps, Linda slowly walks in humming here comes the bride and you just stand there stunned. She was wearing a more traditional wedding dress with a few modifications like ear and tail holes but it fit her so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she asks giving a twirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, very beautiful\" you say, she blushes and you continue \"well this sure is different from this morning\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i'm glad I found you\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I met you too Linda\" you reply. You walk onto Linda's offered palm and she holds you close and quickly runs down the stairs. You see Linda's mother standing there and you're passed over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to walk you up, is that ok?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's fine, I mean you'll be my mother in-law\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told myself I wouldn't cry when my little girl got married\"she says as she starts to tear up. She walks you forward and Linda's father was suprisingly calm and cooperative with the ceremony. When it came to the rings you had to use you're whole body to slip it onto Linda's finger and she slips yours around you're waist. Finally her father says \"I pronounce you husband and wife, you may kiss the bride.\" You lean forward to kiss her but she just pushes you back into her palm as she kisses you with all her might. Her mother rushes over and hugs her daughter yelling and there's a knock at the door, She runs and opens the door and says \"Oh ladies what are you doing here?\" you hear a bunch of voices and Lina hides you in her dress. you hear a bunch of voices and stick the tip of you're head out so you can see. You see an arcanine woman, a dragonite woman and a blaziken woman all standing around Linda's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's all the screaming about?\" the blaziken asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well Linda found herself a mate\" Trudy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful, so what was he a pikachu, raichu, probably a nice strong luxray\" the dragonite woman says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask her yourself?\" Trudy replies the 3 women look at her puzzled and you hide as they look in Linda's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda you look beautiful in that dress\" you assume the arcanine said as you didn't recognize the voice. Linda blushes and says \"well I have to look my best for my wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh breaking tradition and having you're parents plan the wedding, kids these days and their ideas\" the blaziken says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Linda shake her head \"actually i've already gotten married, my husband isn't exactly normal\" Linda says. She reaches into her dress and pulls you out, you hang in front of the 3 women and think \"this is a really weird way of meeting people.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi i'm John, i'm Linda's husband\" you say twirling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, it's a human\" the dragonite says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought they were just fiction\" the arcanine says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right back at ya\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you got married to Linda, are there more of you?\" the arcanine asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No there aren't\" you reply. Trudy comes up and starts pushing the women outside, \"well we should leave the newlyweds alone to do their thing\" she says. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Linda runs upstairs and into her room, she puts you down on the bed then shuts and locks the door. You start taking off you're clothes when Linda asks \"what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought pokemon wedding nights are like human ones, so you consummate the marriage\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but we just met, are you ok with waiting a bit?\" Linda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you say kind of relieved \"I\u2019m really glad you said that because I have no idea how it would work\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it would be my first time too so I guess when we're ready we'll learn together\" Linda says blushing. Linda slowly takes off the dress and lays out on the bed. 'John, do you mind rubbing my tail again?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all\" you reply, you climb onto her backside and gently start stroking her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh....that feels so good\" Linda sighs. You rub her tail for a few minutes getting a moan out of her every so often, finally you stop and just lay back. Linda however turns over so you fall onto the bed and she turns over again so she's facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure know how to pamper a girl\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's easy when the girls so beautiful\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you're such a sweetie\" Linda says pushing you over with 1 finger. \"Why are you so nice to me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we're stuck together might as well make the best of the situation, besides it's a guy's job to be nice to girls\" you say smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I might as well return the favor\" Linda says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok Linda, it's really not necesscary\" you say. She holds you down with 1 finger and says \"you're going to accept my gift and like it\" while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess if I have to\" you reply. Linda lifts you up and gently gives you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For being such a good little husband you get to pick where you sleep tonight\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, well I guess if I had to sleep somewhere it'd be where you first put me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, one comfy bed coming right up\" Linda says. She lays back on the bed and snuggles you into her chest until just you're head is sticking out. \"John, you're not going to hold what happened this morning against me are you?\" Linda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah there's no point, besides if you hadn't done that I wouldn't be here right now\" you reply snuggling yourself in further. Linda starts gently stroking you're head with one finger and you reach over and gently stroke her fur. You see a smile spread over her face and she lays a hand over you. You fall asleep cuddled in her warmth and you thank whatever higher brought you there. You wake up slowly the next morning, not really wanting to leave the warmth and comfort that was surrounding you. Finally the sound of a pidgey fully brings you to you're senses and you sit up. You look around for a second before you rememeber the past day and you look up at Linda. She was sleeping peacefully so you decided not to wake her. You walk over and get dressed quickly. You climb down the side of the bed and head downstairs although it took you a few minutes to get down the stairs. You walk into the kitchen and you find Linda's mom standing there in an apron making coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning\" you say as you scale up a chair and sit down on the breakfast table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning\" she replies, she grabs a cup and fills it with orange juice before setting it in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ok with coffee\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this kind of coffee\" Trudy replies taking a sip, she promptly gives off a small bolt of electricity and says \"see it's kind of blended for electric pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, juice is fine thanks\" you say dunking you're head and drinking you're fill. Trudy sits down in front of you and smiles, \"so I didn't hear anything come from Linda's room, what were you two doing last night?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really not much, I rubbed her tail for a bit, then we snuggled and went to sleep\" you say. You hear footsteps and Linda walks in half-asleep so she doesn't even register that you're there. \"Hey mom I had the weirdest dream last night, I dreamt I found a human and he ended up becoming my husband\" she says. You see a smile cross Trudy's face as she says \"yeah that's a weird dream alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so i'm a dream am I?\" you say. Instantly Linda becomes fully awake and she notices you sitting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....good morning\" Linda says trying to act like nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I let you sleep and when i'm not there you think i'm a dream?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh John i'm sorry\" Linda says. You turn around and say \"that's not good enough Linda.\" She reaches over and pulls you close, \"is that better?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then I guess i'll just have to find someone else to sleep in my chest\" Linda says getting annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then you can also find someone else to rub you're tail for you as well\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't want him anymore Linda?\" Trudy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't know why I went with him in the first place\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well then if you don't want him i'll take him\" Trudy says. She picks you up between 2 fingers and says \"don't worry, i'll make sure not to forget you\" while smiling. You spin around and you see Linda give a glance in her mother's direction. \"Don't worry, you can just stay with me and my girls\" Trudy says lowering you towards her chest. You didn't react as you were still processing what exactly was going on. Trudy just about to place you in her chest when you're grabbed and Linda hugs you to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom what do you think you're doing with my husband\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just said you don't want him dear\" Trudy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I want him, he's such a cute little guy and he's so kind to me, I used him and he still accepted me\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's this about you using him?\" Trudy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I kind of used him for my personal enjoyment when we first met and that's how he ended up becoming my first\" LInda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew I raised such a naughty child\" Trudy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Linda, no more fighting ok?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Linda says smiling, she lifts you up and gently gives you a kiss and you kiss her back. Her father comes down not a minute later and you all have a simple breakfast of bacon and eggs. Linda insisted that she needed to feed you by hand, as soon as her mother heard this she started giggling. You were more then happy to let her and soon the table was full of laughter and light-hearted conversation, Linda's father even cracked a joke or 2. Once breakfast was done Linda went into the living room and laid out on the couch, she snuggles you into her chest and says \"i'm sorry i'm such a troublesome girl John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's why i'm here, to watch over you and make sure you don't get into trouble\" you reply. She gives you a hug and says \"I still owe you something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't owe me anything Linda, you're happiness is my happiness\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well then would you mind giving my ears a scratch?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you say. She lifts you up onto her head and you stand there and scratch each ear for a good 5 minutes. The whole time Linda sighs in happiness, finally you stop and jump off her head landing in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had a very comfy landing\" you say. You hear the doorbell and Linda's mom goes to answer it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Those 3 women were standing there, Linda buries you as deeply as possible into her chest and covers them with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Linda, we came to give you and you're husband some wedding gifts\" the arcanine woman says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, but he went out with my father so you can just put them down on a table and we'll open them later\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that won't work our presents for him must be delivered personally\" the blaziken woman says and you can hear something in her voice, something you heard in Linda's voice when she first grabbed you. \"Oh shit\" you think, you tap on Linda's fur and she lowers her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not let them find me, they're in the same throng you were\" you whisper. She cocks her head to the side and stares at you confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're in heat and they want me for sex and a mate\" you whisper quickly. Linda quickly stands up \"well I think i'll go and prepare some food for you 3\" she says heading towards the kitchen. You feel her stop moving and just stand there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going?' the dragonite woman asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make food\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know he's here, I can smell him\" the arcanine woman says. You feel the air around you start to electrify and Linda throws you forward onto a pillow before discharging a giant bolt of electricity that hit all 3 women. Linda runs forward and grabs you off the pillow before running upstairs and locking herself in her parents room. You lay with her for a half an hour, she layed herself over top of you sheilding you with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda they've left\" Trudy says. Linda hesitantly gets up and walks to the door opening it to find Trudy standing there. \"What did they say?\" Linda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said they'll be back and you can't hide him\" Trudy replies. She moves toward the bed and pulls a briefcase out of it \"what is it full of money\" you think as you opens the latches and you're shocked to find it is. \"This is the money my father tried to bribe you're father with so he wouldn't marry me, he then gave it to him in the inheritance wishing us happiness. you 2 need it more then us so take it and go find a place of you're own\" Trudy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....but I was supposed to be able to stay with you\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd want nothing more, but you and him need to get away\" Trudy says. Linda hugs her mother tears streaming down her cheeks and her father shows up and gives her a hug. Linda hides you in her chest and grabs the briefcase, she follows her father downstairs and he drives you both into the city. You're dropped off at a well known realtor's and Linda walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you\" a girl asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes i'd like to get a house for a couple, no strings attached and able to be moved into right away\" Linda says opening the briefcase. You pretty much hear the pokemon's eyes widen \"I think we have just the property and it's already furnished\" she says. Linda sits there for a while you assume doing paperwork before the woman hustles her out of the room. She gets into a car and you drive for a while till the car stops and Linda gets up. She walks into the house and and the woman shows her around \"upstairs and downstairs bathroom, master bedroom and 2 others if you want kids, pool in the back and a modern kitchen, as well as a living room with a large couch and wide screen plasma tv \" the girl says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take it, my husband will show up later\" Linda says. She opens the briefcase and the woman takes an ammount of bills out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure doing buisness with you\" the girl says and you hear the door shut behind her. Linda waits a few minutes and pulls you out \"well hubbie welcome home\" Linda says. You look around, it was a quite spacious house with wood floors and a lot of windows. Linda walks around the house showing you everything, she turns the faucet on and much to you're suprise you already have electricity and water. Linda sighs as she lays back on the couch \"so how much is left in the briefcase?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A quarter and she said said the house cost $750,000\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that's a pretty big payout, i'm glad you're dad loves you're mom so much\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm well i'll probably have to get a job, probably at a power plant\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but for now let's just relax\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right we don't have any food, i'll be back in a few minutes\" Linda says grabbing a wad of bills and running out the front door, locking it behind her. You sit there and wait for her to come back, just laying on the couch and imagining it was her soft furry tummy. You spend the next half hour exploring the house and you just get back to the couch when Linda walks in arms full of groceries. \"Let me give you a hand\" you say getting up and starting to climb down the couch but she just holds you there with 1 finger \"it's the wifes duty to take care of the husband\" she says. She takes the groceries into the kitchen and within minutes a tantalizing aroma fills the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner time\" Linda yells, you run into the kitchen and climb up a chair. You find 2 bowls of soup set up, one for you one for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" you say walking up and talking a sip, it was very tasty and warm, best soup you've ever had. \"It's great\" you say, but Linda just looks down glumly. You sigh and walk up to her \"i'm sorry Linda\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? why?\" Linda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you never met me, you'd have a normal mate or be back home\" you say. \"So maybe I should go, you have this great new life set up and you can find yourself a real mate\" you say walking back to you're place so you can jump down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" she yells and you're pulled back and she hugs you to her chest. \"You....you...aren't going to leave are you? Linda says sniffling. \"Please....don't leave...I don't care.....just stay.....I....I love you\" she yells. You stand there stunned and she lowers her head to you and you see tears streaming down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh shh, if you don't want me to I won't leave because I love you too Linda\" you say stroking the pika girls head. You climb onto her head and gently start rubbing her ears trying to get her to calm down. She slowly calms down and you climb down, Linda hugs you tightly into her chest, \"you're my husband and I love you, so please don't ever say you'll leave\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I want you to promise me something though\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to see you cry, you look less cute when you do\" you say kissing her cheek getting a mouth full of fur. She picks you up and stares at you for a bit before gently kissing you adding more and more strength as she gets comfortable. You're able to hold the kiss for a few minutes before you needed to break it and Linda smiles at you. She puts you down and you both start eating, Linda finishes her bowl while you're only able to finish about a tenth of yours. Linda smiles and pulls out a thing of plastic wrap that she wraps around the bowl sealing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you do that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made this soup with my own two hands and you're not getting anything else till you eat it all\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough\" you say.</span></div></div>",

She puts you down on her stomach and you run up her onto her head. \"What are you doing?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you cry, so I definitley owe you a little happiness\" you say starting to scratch her ears. Linda sighs, \"that's...that's not necessary\" she says nestling herself into the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense\" you reply rubbing a bit harder. Linda lets loose a small moan and tries to cover her mouth but you just smile, \"Linda it's ok, glad I can make ou feel that good\" you say laughing a bit. You rubbed Linda's ears for the next 10 minutes and by the time you were done she was pretty much curled up, nestled into the couch cushions and you couldn't help but smile. You jumped down off her head landing in her chest and you heard Linda giggle a bit. She picks you up with 2 fingers and smiles at you, \"what did I do to deserve such a nice husband?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think i'm that nice, I mean look at all the trouble i've caused\" you say. Linda stares at you for a bit and all you can feel in that stare is gentlness, \"John you didn't do anything wrong and you've caused me no trouble\" she says. You're about to comment when Linda gently kisses you silencing you, you kiss her back and she gently runs a finger over you're back. She lays out over the couch putting you down on her stomach, you rub her stomach as she strokes you're back although you were winning the little contest as you got Linda to moan every so often. She picks you up and flips over and her tail smacks you in the face. \"Do you mind, it feels a bit lonely not getting any attention\" Linda says shaking her behind a bit. \"Not at all\" you say. You walk up and sit down on Linda's backside, you grab her tail as it swishes past and start gently stroking it. Linda instantly gives off an audible moan before covering her mouth, \"yep this is definitley you're weakspot\" you say continuing. Linda held it in for a few minutes until you started putting some more force then she let out a half moan/sigh and she just collapses on the couch, all you can see is this glazed look of happiness on her face. You stroke her tail for a good 5 minutes before stopping, instantly her head snaps up and she stares at you. \"Why'd you stop?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been doing nothing but lavishing you with attention for the past 15 minutes, I need a break\" you say laying back. Linda picks you up \"aww is someone tired?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just need to get some strength back then i'll take care of you\" you say. Linda lowers you onto her back and you lay there for a few minutes before getting back up and stroking her tail again. You stroke her tail for another ten minutes before falling back, Linda picks you up and smiles at you, \"thank you\" she says before kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" you reply getting comfy as she puts you down. Linda gently strokes you and you sigh being quite comfortable. You layed like this for a few minutes until you started trying to bury yourself into her chest, \"oh you like them that much?\" she asks. \"No, I just wanted some warmth that's all\" you say stopping. Linda smiles and parts her chest, \"well come on and get warm then\" she says. You tentativley walk in and Linda looks at you weird \"what you don't trust me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course I do\" you say diving forward, Linda gently pushes her chest back together compacting it a bit, you didn't mind however it just meant you were closer to the lovely girl you loved. You layed like this for a bit, when Linda picks you up and puts you down on the couch before she heads back to the kitchen. You just sat there for a few minutes and Linda comes back but there was something different about her, there were small sparks coming off her body and she well seemed to be walking more sideways then straight. Linda sits down on the couch and she smiles down at you all while blushing. \"Linda you ok?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohf cource I yam\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're drunk aren't you, how did you get drunk?\" you ask. Linda heads back to the kitchen and comes back carrying a bottle, \"Electric beer, when you need a real jolt\" it says. \"You bought alcohol our first night alone?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cource, it'sss not like we can't have shome fun\" Linda says picking you up. She runs upstairs to the bedroom and leaps onto the bed, you were thrown up but saved by one of the pillows. You just sit up when Linda pins you down with 1 finger and a smile on her face, \"come on why ish you still wearing thshese\" she says. She pulls on you're pants and you push yourself back, \"I can do that myself\" you say starting to undress although it was a little unnerving as she watched you the whole time. You sit there in you're boxers and Linda keeps smiling at you, \"you mished a peice\" she says giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not taking em off while you're drunk\" you reply. Linda stares down at you and picks you up between 2 fingers, \"sho you're going to d-defy me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am actually\" you reply. Linda smiles at you, \"well bad boysh nedd to be punished\" she says putting you down on the pillow. She then snuggles the pillow against her breasts making it somewhat uncomfortable as it was cramped. Linda sighs and starts rubbing against the pillow, you try to wiggle you're way out but Linda's weight holds you there. She stops after a few minutes, \"I think yoush hash been punished enough\" she says before falling over sideways. You walk over to her and you hear light breathing, \"hah you feel asleep, victory is mine\" you think before she wraps a hand around you and snuggles you up against her chest. \"Damn looks likes she had a bit fight left in her\" you think. You freeze as Linda leans down and starts licking you're back \"mmm, I always loved popsicles\" she mumbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit\" you think, you try to pull yourself out but she holds you tighter, \"slippery popsicle's not getting away\" she mumbles laughing a bit. You see her open her mouth and you really start struggling. Linda's grip falters for a second and you're able to push you're way out, you scurry to the other side of the bed and you see a disappointed look cross her face \"aww dropped my popsicle\" she mumbles before turning over. You sit there for a bit breathing heavily, \"she did not do that yesterday\" you say. You lay back against the remaining pillow, and despite the shock you just received you were soon asleep. You wake up the next morning surrounded by something very warm and soft but you still felt cold, you slowly open you're eyes and you look up to see that you were nestled in between Linda's breasts and covered in saliva. \"Found another popsicle, gonna savor this one\" she mumbles licking you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok this is gonna be talked about\" you say. You wiggle you're way out and get next to Linda's head, you start rubbing her right ear and she starts sighing. \"Come on sleepy wake up\" you whisper into her ear. She stirs a bit but doesn't wake up, \"come on, wake up Linda\" you say. She stirs again and you see her eyes flutter, you walk in front of her and they open and focus on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning John, wait how'd we get in bed, why are you in you're boxers, and why are you all wet?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story short, you got drunk last night and thought I was popsicle\" you say. Linda giggles, \"sorry but I do really like popsicles\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah don't I know it, no more getting drunk before bed, makes you sleep-act and i'd rather not have you treat me like a frozen dessert\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough\" she says. She tries to pick you up but moves back \"eww you're all sticky\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and who's fault is that\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need a bath\" she says.</span></div></div>",

She starts to sit up and you clap your hands loudly. \"Ow ow ow\" she says holding her ears and falling back into bed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, you have a hangover, just rest today and we'll go job hunting tomorrow\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah I need one too\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you are staying at home, i'll work\" she says. \"Look no offense but your a bit too small for any jobs, that and near every job requires one pokemon technique or other and you haven't exactly displayed any\" she says. You lower your head, \"go take your bath, and i'll get us a guard, ok?\" Linda says. You nod, \"make sure it's a good one\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best\" she replies. You nod, turn and shimmy down the bed. It took you a minute to get to the bathroom and by that time Linda had gotten up, and walked right past you out of the house, \"I still don't get why they don't wear clothes\" you mutter to yourself pushing on the door to close it a bit even though you heard the front door shut. You used a few supplies you found including some rolls of toilet paper to climb onto the toilet and jump onto the sink. You filled it with hot water as you could tolerate it and had your bath, mostly you just floated around for 10 minutes. You climbed out, drained the sink and got dressed again, climbing down you put everything back where you found it and you head downstairs and climb up onto the couch. You look at a clock and realize your bath took 10 minutes, climbing downstairs took 5 minutes, this was a big problem. \"Man I wish I had a bike\" you think to yourself. You heard the door unlock and you look over to see Linda, and a bundle. She turns, and gently closes the door and silently walks up, \"I have our little guard right here\" she says holding the bundle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, didn't know pokemon had pets\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no pokemon have no pets, that would make some of us second class citizens\" she says pulling the top away and you freeze, in Linda's arms was a female growlithe baby, orange and black fur, cream colored tail and mane, and a cute set of paws with a little collar saying \"hi i'm Abbie, if found call 568-2734.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh...adopted a growlithe baby?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I got some weird looks from the adoption lady, but then I told her you were an arcanine unable to have kids and we now have this little bundle of joy\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait...wait wait, why did you get a growlithe, wouldn't you know a pichu be better?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, you said you wanted a guard, and growlithe are dependable, loyal, and they have just the cutest eyes\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so you adopted a child, how are we going to explain to her that her mom is a pikachu and her dad, is like 3 inches tall and not even a pokemon\" you say looking at Linda. She shrugs \"you're just mad because you haven't seen her yet\" she says sitting down on the couch and putting Abbie into her lap. You climb down and stare down at the little girl you were now supposed to be the father of. She looked up at you with big hazel eyes and you leaned over \"aww she is pretty cute\" you say. Much to your suprise Abbie's gaze centers on you and she leans up and hugs you to her burying her head in your shoulder, she wraps around you and falls asleep. Your left laying there as Linda tries not to laugh herself to death \"get her off me\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww she already loves her daddy\" Linda says you were sure smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda get her off me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? she loves you\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but her fur is actually really comfy, and well, I might fall asleep\" you say. You were suprised as Linda started petting your back, \"just go to sleep\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What how can I go to sleep?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growlithe and arcanine identify their parents through bonding, as well they'd sleep together, parent wrapped around child\" she says. Linda lays out on the couch and curls up around you and Abbie, \"just take a little nap\" she says stroking you again, \"she'll probably be up in a few hours anyways\" she says. You couldn't fight her logic so you just decided to go to sleep \"man, how did this happen?\" you think as you fall asleep. You woke up in an hour and you looked over to see Abbie looking at you curiosity in her eyes, \"Hi Abbie\" you say not sure what else to say. Abbie opens her mouth and you pulled your head back as she looks up and lets out a flamethrower, \"Linda\" you shout and she jolts awake. Thankfully the flamethrower fell short and didn't hit anything but it really freaked you out, \"she..just shot out a flamethrower\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me check the guide\" Linda says sitting up and grabbing a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a guide\" you say, you freeze as Abbie turns to look at you and again her eyes soften and she buries her head in your chest. You didn't know what else to do so you started to pet her head and she nuzzles you, \"aww well isn't that nice, she already sees you as Daddy\" Linda says looking down at the two of you, \"also all the book says is keep a fire extinguisher handy.\" You nod and Linda lifts the 2 of you up and removes the blanket and Abbie shivers for a second before Linda hugs her and you. Abbie seems to sigh and gives you a nuzzle before getting comfy in Linda's embrace \"yay, she's accepted me as mommy\" Linda says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you, can I ah, be let go now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry\" Linda says releasing you from the hug. Abbie turns around looking for you and as she sees you moving away she starts to whimper and then cry. You turn as you hear her start crying and you quickly run back, Linda moving so you can run up her body. \"Hey hey, don't cry, don't cry\" you say getting close to Abbie. As if sensing your presence she turns and hugs you tightly blowing warm on you she curls up tightly around you, almost like she's afraid to lose you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did something happen to her?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is an orphan, she lost both her parents in a crash, they saved her by covering her body with theirs\" you say. You look down at Abbie \"welcome to the family\" you say hugging her as tightly as you can. In response she licks your cheek and buries her head in your shoulder again \"you make a pretty good father\" Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, i'm really not, I just can't stand to see anyone sad, it's why I didn't run from you\" you say. Linda lifts you up and smiles and you were both suprised as Abbie lifted her head up and started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, crap what's wrong\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's probably hungry, or well she pooed her diaper\" Linda says. You take a sniff and thankfully no diaper changing was necesscary, \"she must be hungry\" you say. Linda puts you both down on the couch and you gently pet Abbie to calm her which somewhat worekd as she just started whimpering as Linda comes back with a bottle. She picks Abbie up and feeds her, thankfully Abbie seemed to be old enough for formula instead of breast milk, otherwise well you would have been in trouble. Linda started rocking Abbie from side to side and she soon fell asleep although she kept making grabbing motions. Linda sat down and you walked up and leaned over and Abbie instantly latched onto you. \"Aww she really loves you, \" Linda says smiling \"you know I think you'll make a pretty good dad\" she says. \"Yeah well you already make a really good mother\" you reply and Linda smiled at you \"sweet talker\" she whispers. You pretty much fell asleep like that with Abbie attached to you and Linda holding the both of you although thankfully you were able to move up to the bedroom and lie down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slowly awoke from sleep and the first thing you heard and felt was breathing and the soft rise and fall of Linda's chest. You sit up and move so that you're closer to her face and smile as she was so cute while sleeping. You lower yourself and crawl up onto her forehead kissing her in the center before moving and kissing each of her eyelids \"come on beautiful wake up let's see those pretty eyes of yours\" you whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda starts to stir and you climb off her before she sits up rubbing sleep out of her eyes, she turns and looks down at you smiling \"thanks for the wake up hunny\" she says gently picking you up. \"No problem\" you reply as you had been waking her up like this even since Abbie had stopped crying at night. Linda gives you a gentle kiss which covered most of your upper body and she gently sat you down in her lap \"so where's our little bundle of joy?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should be here in 3...2...1\" you say and as if on cue the door to your bedroom burst open and in bounded Abbie. She had grown up into a quite cute little girl you and Linda decided to keep her cream coloured hair long so it swung behind her as she jumped onto the bed. \"Daddy\" she shouts leaping forward, she lands right in front of Linda and slowly extends her cupped hands like she had been taught. Linda gently passes you over and Abbie hugs you to her pink pyjamas before lifting you up and giving you an even gentler kiss then Linda. \"Morning Daddy\" she says her tail wagging happily behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning princess\" you say kissing her on the nose before gently patting it. Abbie smiles down at you and cuddles you up against her cheek giving you a chance to hug her. You turn as you hear Linda giggle \"you are both just so precious\" she says hugging the both of you. You were kind of squished as Abbie moved into the hug and Linda gave her a little squeeze. The hug broke after a minute and Abbie held you out letting Linda pick you up and put you down in her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abbie can you go and get dressed?\" Linda asks, Abbie nods and runs out of the room, Linda sets you down on small dresser near the bed, you walk over to your own little dresser filled with dolls clothes and opened it up, you chose just a normal t-shirt and pants and quickly got dressed turning to see Linda putting on a pair of jean shorts her tail disappearing for a second before popping out of the hole in the back of the clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice butt beautiful\" you say smiling up at her, Linda turns and glares at you \"I told you to stop staring\" she says picking you up and scowling at you for a second before giggling and hugging you to her chest, \"thanks for always complimenting me\" she says dropping the charade. It was your turn to smile, \"anytime Linda\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard giggling and you turned to see Abbie standing there in a cute yellow dress smiling, Linda blushes for a moment and Abbie walks up and hugs her leg \"Mommy and Daddy aren't fighting right?\" she asks. Linda smiles and pats her head \"of course we aren't sweetie, now come on let's go downstairs\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie reaches up for you and Linda passes you down, Linda hugs you to her and you feel her skip down the hall and down the stairs, in a few seconds you saw light again as Abbie put you down on the kitchen table and like every day ran over to the pantry and tried to get the toaster out. Like always she couldn't reach the cabinet until Linda came down and got the toaster out, Abbie sighing went and got some bread and put it in the toaster before sitting down in her seat in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Abbie, it's your first day of pre-school, your a big girl now\" you say. Abbie stares down at you and puts her head down on the table letting you walk up and stroke her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not\" she complains, \"I'm too little to help Mommy with anything\" she says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smile \"size isn't everything, I mean I'm a lot smaller then you are\" you say. You kiss her cheek \"besides Abbie, you help your mother watch over me every day, your always so gentle and caring and that's important\" you say. Abbie looks at you for a second before smiling, she sits up and hugs you again \"thanks Daddy I feel much better\" she says before putting you back down on the table. \"Your welcome sweetie\" you reply, you turn as you hear movement and Linda walks up carrying plates of buttered toast, she sets one down near Abbie who begins to eat while she waits for you to get near her spot before setting down her plate and sitting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda tears off part of the toast and hands it to you, you sit down and are about to start eating when your scooped up and Linda moves you between her chest and her plate. She leans forward and acts like it's no big deal she's pushing you into her chest as she takes a piece of toast, you finished your meal a lot faster then Linda because she kept smiling down at you obviously enjoying having you near her. You just lay back into Linda's chest and she giggles \"get out of there\" she says pushing you away with 1 finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww\" you say and you heard Abbie giggle \"mommy and daddy are funny\" she says. You turn to her and laugh \"I guess we are\" you say hoping she won't ask anymore, thankfully she just giggles some and waits with you as Linda finishes her toast. Linda walks over to the door with Linda and hands her a small backpack with her free hand and Abbie puts it on, Linda then drapes a sunhat on Abbie's head and smiles \"you look so cute Abbie\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie smiles and holds her hands out, Linda hands you over and she smiles down at the both of you \"now take good care of her\" she says to you. Linda then turns to Abbie \"and you take good care of Daddy\" she says before leaning down and kissing Abbie on the forehead and then kissing your upper torso. Abbie gently puts you down on her shoulder and she leaves the house. Before you're down the walk Abbie turns and both you and her wave to Linda who waves back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie starts to skip and you couldn't be happier as she was happier. Abbie quickly came up to a set of lights and froze as the cars rushed past, \"Abbie reach over and hit that button ok\" you say tapping her on the shoulder and pointing at the button on the post when she stares at you. Abbie nods and soon the street was safe to cross, Abbie walks across and sighs \"that was scary\" she says. You chuckled to yourself and pat her cheek \"It's ok Abbie, you did really well\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came upon 3 more sets of lights and Abbie patiently crossed all 3 fine which to you was a big relief, in a few minutes you came upon the pre-school. Abbie jumps up and down with glee causing you to have to clutch her dress, \"hey Abbie Abbie\" you say, she stops jumping and helps put you back on her shoulder \"sorry Daddy\" she says her ears drooping. \"It's ok, you just need to remember I'm here is all\" you say. Abbie nods and walks into the schoolyard, it was your basic schoo yad set up there was a playground, sandbox, swings all those kind of things. As Abbie walked up you noticed a female pokemon you realize must be her teacher.....</span></div></div>",

Her chest was at least a DD cup. Looking lower she has no fat but a well toned stomach. In fact no part of this beauty had an ounce of fat. It was all either muscle or breast weight on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You try and think on what to say to her to lighten up the situation. \"Uh miss I never got your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you a little surprised but she answers you saying, \"Oh don't worry about it for now.

Before you take note of anything she drops you to the floor and fills your vision with her feet. To you they weretwice your size and three times as thick as you. You just stared at in awe finally taking in on how small you are is when she says, \"I'm waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on what you should do you start to rub her feet. As you start to rub you find no faul odder coming from her feet but instead a more sented smell like.... cherries? Shacking that off you jut lay your hand on her skin and feel it's so smooth and soft that your one stroke cause her to moan in relax. Putting more pressure into it you can feel the her sigh this time. You keep this up on both feet hoping that this may give her the idea of keeping you and hopefully working you way as her friend or atleast not her snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finish she grabs you and pulls you into her face. \"Uh m-m-miss w what do you Uh see me as..\"</span></div></div>",

She started slipping you to the back of her throat, and you hurriedly tried to scramble your way back up, but the tonuge was so slick you felt yourself falling anyways, only to have her pull you back up at the last moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she stopped tossing you around, and tilted her head to the side, her teeth coming down, and resting on your small body, holding you down under their sharp whiteness.

You heard her swallow, and looked around, as her mouth opened again, and her hand reached in, picking you by your foot and pulling you out back onto her hand with a happy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do this all day! You're like the best candy I've ever had!\" She said, licking her lips.

She was looking over you very carefully now, and was apparently kinda worried. You swallowed your own saliva, and completely turned around now, though you felt rather aprehensive about doing so. You couldn't do much else anyways, and if she seemed worried about you, she have just been fooling around... The thought crossed your mind, but your logical side screamed at you, telling you she would eat you if given the chance, but why hadnt she yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, calm down. Geeze... I was just tryin' to tease you a bit.\" She said, starting to pout. Her ears fell back, thogh it seemed like she was hiding worry behind an upset facade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a little heavily, and licked your lips, cringing at the flavor of her saliva still coating you. \"Calm down? How was I supposed to know you wouldn't eat me or something!\" You shouted, half still in fear, and half in a rising anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on... You're far to cute and interesting to eat.\" She retorted, crossing one of her arms, propping up her breasts with it, while still holding you in her other paw. She sighed heavily and sat down on the bed, causing you to bounce a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen... I may have gotten carried away there, but if you're feeling alright, perhaps we can just start over?\" She said, more asking for premission. You hesitated, but nodded anyways, starting to stand up a bit more normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great! Well, uh. I'm Rea. I'm twenty years old, I kinda just live here by myself. I have two other roommates, but they are dorming in collage for the next few months until they graduate.\" She said, starting to lighten up more.

I... Don't know where I am, but I guess...\" You trailed off for a moment, unsure of what to say exactly. \"I guess... I enjoy reading and the like.\" You said, scratching your head, which was completely soaked wet. You grimiced, pulling away from your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John... Well, I think I should get you dried off... Uh, sorry. About before.\" She said, and started to move you. You were afraid she was about to try something else, when you were pressed above her chest, into her large fluffy mane. It was very warm here, and even softer than the fur you had felt on her paws. You couldn't help but sigh at the amazing feeling. She rubbed you around it for about a minute, before letting you just rest there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, I don't want you to worry. I'll take good care of you from now on. After all, If i'm going to be your __________ for the time, I should do it propperly, right?\"</span></div></div>",

As much as you'd like to go home, you didn't really see that happening any time soon. What had happened to you was completely random, and likely a once in a life time occurance. You'd never even heard of such a thing outside of fiction. You finally gave her a nod. \"Alright... I suppose, I mean. I don't have any other option do I? If... If you promise to be a little more considerate, I can go along with it.\" You said, feeling yourself suddenly moved once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you!

After only a few seconds, she let you out, and  set you down on the bed. \"Alright, dont even worry a bit darling. I'll be right back, I'm just gonna get a few things.\" She said, and began to walk around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you were actually able to examine the girl more closely. Aside from being huge, you determined you were only about three inches to her standards, she was also very pretty. Tall, dark brown fur with a few cream colored bits, one around her neck and the top of her chest, as well as the tip of her tail. She had deep brown eyes, and dark brown hair, pulled back in a large ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was extreamly curvy, with rather large breasts. You guessed around high D cups,  though she wore no clothing, instead having fur covering most of her more private areas. Going down, she decently slim, with a nice stomach, smooth and long. Her hips were rather wide, going down into a very nice ass, large, round and jiggly, bouncing with every step she took. It was actually hard to pull your eyes from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, she had very thick thighs, going down into long, long legs. Finally ending on her paws, large and rounded, with bright pink pads underneath. If they were anything like the ones on her hands, they would be very soft, and have an almost rubbery feel to them, though were still plush and comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, she came back, holding something.</span></div></div>",

And I figured, what better way to start this off right, than to clean you up! Eh... The right way, that is.\" She added, her ears seemed to fall a bit as her voice softened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly shook her head, grinning back at you as she walked away to another door by her bed, opening it and revealing a bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set the things down inside and quickly came back out, holding a hand down beside you to stand on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little less hesitantly, you climbed up onto her paw, letting her fingers curl against you, like a cage keeping you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over soon enough though, as she set you onto the skin, beside a hand towel, a bar of bright yellow soap, a bottle of some kind of shampoo and a loofah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understood what those were for of course, and looked up in time to see her hover over top of you, reaching for the tap and turning the water on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water came out in a rush, and she held her paw under it for a few seconds, until you saw steam coming from the tap, to which she too her hand out, and put a stopper on the drain, letting it fill up to the size of a large pool, to you, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you looked it over, leaning in to see the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and get undressed and hop in. I'll get your clothes cleaned up, and in the meantime I think I have some old doll's clothing that should fit.\" She said, turning away for a moment and fiddling with a closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little nervously, you undress, and set your clothes and shoes to the side in a neat pile, before slipping into the water, letting the hot bath surround you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt incredible, nice and warm and so deep too. You almost didn't notice as the shadow came over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked a bit, your head cocking up to see her massive face above you, holding back a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun? Hehehe~ Let's get you nice and cleaned up then.\" She said, holding the bar of soap and the loofah. She dunked them both into the water a few feet away from you, then pulled them out, lathering the puffball, until it was completely sudsy. Without any hesitation she took you into her other hand and lifted you from the water, rubbing the soapy puff over your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprisingly gentle with her motions, and you let her work the soap over you for a bit, until you were completely covered in suds, and let back into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dunked yourself a few times, wiping away the soapy water, and taking a breath as you came up, only to be met with her hand once more as she took you out again, pressing two fingers against your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat, fairly uncomfortably in her paw, as she lathered cold shampoo into your hair, careful to be gentle with you, but easily knocking you side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be trying to be gentle with you, but it seemed like she was having trouble controlling her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the rough bath was done, and she set you to rinse off again, before wrapping you up in the soft hand towel to dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks off as you dry off, feeling much more refreshed, and look up to see her setting down a few bits of new clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took them up as soon as she set them down, the fabric was fairly soft, what looked like a plain tee-shirt and dark gray sweatpants. You slipped them on quickly, dropping the heavy hand towel, and stretching out in the new clothing. When you opened your eyes, you saw her washing your current clothes, a simple bath in the water you'd been in with some soap, then she hung them up atop her towel rack, they'd probably get dry by tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to her now, a few thoughts and questions coming to mind.</span></div></div>",

She then brings him up to her face and smiles at John before saying,\" thank you little man.\" John just looked blankly at her. \u201cMy name is serine what\u2019s yours\" Serine said still smiling. \u201cJohn\" he responded a little peeved. \u201cWell john I had a great idea\" serine said as her friendly smile turned more into a lusty one. \u201cWhat is it\" John asked not really caring. Serine gazed down at him and said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be my boyfriend.\" John looked at her confused,\" why do you want me to be your boyfriend?\" she smiled and said \u201cbecause your cute and adorable\" John looked at her. Saying no would probably mean being her toy, or being thrown out into the probably also giant world. He sighed and said \u201cSure.\" Serine made a bounce of joy before hugging him against her chest. As John looks at her massive boulders serine smiles and says,\" They are E's and there all yours.\" She the squeezes him up agents them and giggles. \u201cI can't wait to show you to Izzy and Sam\" she said excitedly.\u201cWho\", John asked nervously. Serine stops hugging him and starts to look a little serious,\" they're the ones I share this house with. Sam is my sister and Izzy is my friend. Sam is a glaceon and Izzy is a luxray.\u201d, she said. Zac nodded,\" so where are they\" he asked. \u201cBusy\" serine paused\u201d which gives us some alone time.\" She starts smiling again before licking John all over his body. This happens for a good 30 minutes before there is some movement at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the door opens John\u2019s jaw drops in amazement. Walking into the door was a hug busted huge assed Luxray. He couldn't help but stare her breast which was at the least twice as big a serine's. They were so big if she stuck both her hands strait out in front of her she'd be squishing her breast, and to add to that she had and extremely curvy body leading to her huge ass. John didn't even notice when serine had handed him to her. He only noticed when he finally looked into her eyes. They looked like she was mad at him. Though when she spoke her voices was quite soft and gentle. \u201cso your name is John\" she asked. John only nodded. \u201cIsn\u2019t he just the cutest\", serine said. Izzy only shrugged before saying,\" he looks more like food to me.\" Izzy opened her mouth wide showing John her long sharp fangs before closing them again. She then glared, or what John assumed was her glare because she always looked like she was glaring, and said,\" that\u2019s a warning, don't go staring at me again or you'll regret it!\" John nodded before Izzy dropped him gently into serine\u2019s hands. Serine quickly hugged John close to her chest and said,\" You wouldn't eat him would you?\" Izzy looks at John again and with a stern look and says,\" knowing you I don't want him near my mouth, but if that little perv keeps staring at me I will.\" She then starts walking away. John didn't dare look at her as she walked, but couldn't anyways because serine covered him with her tail so he couldn't. <br>\r\nWhen Serine heard a door open and close she finally put her tail down. She then looks at a shivering John who is clamping on to her boob. She then strokes his back with her finger repeating, \" it will be ok she won\u2019t hurt you.\" She then keeps this on until they hear something at the door again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry my sister will be a lot nicer. She then pries John of her boob (which really didn't take much effort), and holds him out in her hand. John was pretty calm now but wasn't sure he could handle another experience like Izzy's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        When the door finally opened a glaceon walked in. \u201cThat\u2019s my younger sister Sam. Don't worry she's a lot nicer than Izzy.\" Serine said. Sam walked over wondering what Serine was holding. She gasped as she saw the small man in Serine\u2019s hand. John flinched as he saw Sam's giant hands quickly strike at him, but when he was expecting a swipe he didn't feel anything. He looked up to see Sam was offering her hand for him to get on to. He was surprised at her gentleness, or at least control, as she brought him up to her face. \"Hi\", Sam said looking at John. John shivered as Sam talked. Not because he was scared of her but her breath literally was causing him to shiver. Sam noticed and held him away from her mouth \u201csorry\u201d, she said. \u201ci-its ok-k\" John responded. At his distance John could get a good look at Sam's upper body. She had about D sized breast and had really beautiful eyes. Sam handed John back to serine a little upset their first meet ended the way it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Serine smiled taking John to her breast and said,\" I can't wait to spend all night with you.\" Sam looks at them and says,\" Um Serine you do remember right?\" Serine looks at Sam confused. \u201cThe three, well now four, of us were going to have a small party....\" Sam said. Serine gasps,\" I totally forgot\" she said. Just then Izzy walks in and says \u201cwell its nine are we going to start?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had been staring at the giant eevee pokegirl for some time now and you noticed that while her bust was atleast D-E cup her voice sounded so young you weren't sure of her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you,\" she says scooping you up and squeezing you against her chest. She holds you out in front of her and you rub the back of you're head. \"Um...no offense Diana but how old are you?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm 18 why?\" she replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason, but i'm the same age\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's great\" she says she then puts you down on the bed and says \"i'll be right back.\" She runs out the door and all you can hear is her yell \"hey mom I got a boyfriend\" You look around the room and it's all pink, you are sitting on a big four poster bed and there's a desk on one side of the room. The wall across from Diana's bed has a TV on a stand and there are multiple stuffed animals scattered across the room. The left wall has a closet in it and there is a small bedside table next to the bed. You hear Diana come back into the room and you turn, she's followed by an espeon pokegirl who's a head taller then her. \"Where's this new boyfriend Diana?\" the espeon Pokegirl asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's on my bed i'll go get him mom\" you hear her say. Her mother looks at her like she was crazy but she runs up to the bed and scoops you up. Diana carries you over and says \"Mom meet my boyfriend John\" before uncupping her hands and leaving you standing there looking up at this giant espeon. She looks down at you stunned for a few seconds until you smile at her and say \"hi\" she seems to calm down as she hears you talk. She bends over so her face is parallel with you and she asks \"so how did you meet my daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just ended up here and you're daughter found me and took care of me\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you and says \"Well welcome to the family John, just make sure to take care of her\" she says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..uh what do I call you, Mom?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm Juliette\" she says smiling back at you, \"and if you ever get sick of my daughter i'm just a call away\" she says giving you a quick poke before turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom\" Diana yells, her mother giggles then exits the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um was she serious about that?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Diana looks down at you and says \"sadly yes she is, my mother is the reason I haven't had many boyfriends, well her and my sisters\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have sisters?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah if you haven't noticed i'm an eevee, and my mom wanted one of each kind of child so I have 7 sisters\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they all like you're mother?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they are but they're all off at college so it's just you, me and her\" Diana says. She then brings you close to her and says \"although i'd much rather have it just you and me/\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Diana what kind of things do you like?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well I love pink, and small cute things like you\" she answers \"I also love having my back, stomach and feet rubbed\" she says. \"So what about you John\" Diana asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um well before coming here I was just a normal guy, my interests are reading, video games and well...girls\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So John what do you think of me?\" she says smiling down sweetly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look really sexy Diana\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw thank you\" she says bringing you up and giving you a kiss. She then lays down on the bed and places you on her back, \"John would you mind?\" she asks. \"Sure Diana\" you reply leaning down and starting to rub her back, she sighs as you get to work and you begin to think. \"Well this is not what I had in mind when I was playing pokemon this afterrnoon, oh well this is already more fun, and a lot better looking then my life back home\" you think. After 20 minutes you had given her a full back rub and she was giving off a soft mrring sound.  She turns her head head and sighs, \"thanks John\" she says still lying down you jump down next to her and she rolls over onto her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So John why aren't you freaking out or anything\" she asks staring at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I freak out?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're not exactly a pokemon which probably means you've never seen one before\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually I have, you reply but i've never seen such a large pokemon before\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we're not larger then normal you're just really small sweetie\" she says giving you a small push and giggling as she pushes you over. She then reaches over and hugs you close to her snuggling you in between her breasts. \"So John, did you have a girlfriend back home\" she asks smiling down at you seductivley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wait till now to ask that?\" you reply \"but the answer is no\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their loss\" she says pulling you out from her chest and rubbing you against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Diana\" you say, \"but why are you being so nice to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually when I found you there was a group of vulpix holding you and they were going to take you home\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you fought off other pokemon to meet me?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes\" she says blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the nicest thing anyone has done for me\" you say giving her a hug. She leans over and pulls you close to her she then gives you a big lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blech, what was that?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll tell my mom to stay back at least for a bit, and besides you taste really good\" she says giving you another lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....Eevee's are vegetarians right?\" you ask getting a bit nervous<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we are besides you're way too cute to eat even if we weren't\" Diana says leaning down and giving you a kiss this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well thanks\" you say giving a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now sweetie\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm kind of hungry, but i'm not sure if you're mother would try anything\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She shouldn't try anything as long as i'm around\" Diana says.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Diana scoops you up in one palm and walks out of her room. She walks down a hall and you see what you assume must be her sisters rooms as you walk past and you assume her mother's room is the one on the far side of the hall. She walks downstairs and you walk past a living room with a big screen tv in it and you enter a very nice looking kitchen. Juliette is sitting at the table drinking something, she puts her cup down as her daughter walks in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you did come down, I thought you'd lock yourself in you're room for a while and have some fun with our guest\" Juliette says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez i'm not you mom\" Diana replies putting you down on the counter and rummaging around through a fridge and cupboards. She pulls out a few foodstuffs and quickly has a sandwhich made. She places the sandwhich in front of you and you quickly start eating, You get about a quarter of the sandwhich done before you feel like you're going to burst. Diana watches while you eat the sandwhich smiling the whole time, when she sees you stop eating and push the plate away she quickly snatches the sandwhich up and eats the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the food\" you say smiling up at Diana, she picks you up, walks over to the table and places you down, laying her head down in front of you. You feel a poke from behind you and you turn seeing that Juliette is also watching you. \"So how did you get here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not say, you'd think i'm crazy\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, you're sitting here right in front of us cutie\" Diana says giving you a little poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging you say \"ok, fine just don't hate me for what you hear.\" You take in a deep breath \"in my world there are a lot more people and a lot less pokemon, actually there are no pokemon and people are more normal sized. In my world pokemon are fictional just video game or anime characters, I was playing one of my pokemon games when my screen glowed bright white and I blacked out. I woke up to you staring down at me\" you finish. Diana looks shocked and says \"so in you're world there are no pokemon?\" you nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually there's only people and we seem to be doing a really crappy job of taking care of the place\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm so glad I got you from those vulpix\" Diana says hugging you against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you're not mad?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we're not John, in fact it's the exact opposite in our world, humans are seen as fictional, my daughter always fixated on them and always wanted to meet one\" Julliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the feelings mutual gorgeous\" you say laying you're head down on Diana's stomach. Diana hugs you as close as possible her big fluffy tail curls around her body and covers you both. She just stands like that for a bit holding you until her mother gives a cough and says \"I don't want to interrupt but Diana maybe you should do that in another room, i'm getting a bit jealous\" Juliette says. Her daughter nods in understanding and walks off into the living room. she lays down on the couch with you on her stomach and she starts stroking you. You lay out on her stomach trying to snuggle as close to the warm fur as you can, you feel her tail swish over you and eventually she lets it fall over you covering you as a big fluffy blanket. You feel her lay a hand over you're back and she gently strokes you. You can't help but sigh and you say \"this is heaven,\" you fall asleep after saying these words. You wake up and stretch still covered by Diana's tail you try to just lay back down when Diana sits up and looks down at you. \"Have a good sleep?\" she asks, with a big smile on her face. \"Yeah it was great, I don't think i've ever had a comfier sleep\" you reply, \"how long was I out?\" you ask. \"You were asleep maybe half an hour, you really are cute while sleeping\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're just cute in general\" you reply. Diana brakes out into a big grin and says \"flattery will get you no where, little man.\" \"Who said I wanted to go anywhere when i'm already near perfection\" you reply. In response Diana lifts you up and gives you a kiss, \"you sure know how to sweet talk a girl\" she says placing you back down on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say so, actually i'm usually very unsociable\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? this wonderful person I see before me is unsociable\" Diana replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, back home I was very unsociable, but I just feel like I can be myself near you\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any particular reason?\" Diana asks running a finger down you're back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're the most beautiful thing i've ever seen, and well even though we just met you've been so kind to me and...\" you say trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the last thing you were going to say\" Diana says giving you a little poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll weird you out and I don't want our relationship to be wrecked before it starts\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John nothing you can say will change my view of you\" Diana replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though I just met you, I love you Diana\" you say hiding you're face in her fur as you do. You look up and she's looking down at you dumbfounded. \"I knew I shouldn't have said that\" you think, \"now she'll probably hate me.\" After thinking this Diana quickly pulls you up and kisses you, again and again, pushing you back into her palm. after she pushes you into her palm she begins to rub you against her cheek. After a few seconds of this she brings her hand out in front of her face so she's staring at you face to face and says with pure joy in her voice \"I'm so glad you said it first John, because I love you too precious\" she says before kissing you again and this time you have enough sense to return the kiss. You stay like this for a bit when Diana gently breaks the kiss and looks down at you. All you can see in her eyes is happiness and all you can do is smile as you look up at her. She gently hugs you to her chest and then runs up stairs. She gets to her room and closes and locks the door. She then places you down on the bed and lays down so you're trapped underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana what are you doing?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my mom's right I should have some fun with you now that you're my lover\" she says, \"oh and my weakspot is my ears\" she says pushing you towards one. Taking it as a cue you walk up and begin massaging her ear. Instantly she gives off a cute yelp, so you stand behind her head and gently pull her other ear closer to you. You massage both of her ears and she gives off a purring sound the whole time you're doing it, after a minute you stop and she turns around and stares at you, only then do you realize she her breathing was more heavy. She looks at you and her eyes look more like that of a predator and she jumps forward pushing you with her so that you're under her breasts. She then props herself up so you're trapped under her stomach with her arms blocking her sides and her breasts blocking the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana what are you doing?\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my prisoner, the crime is making a girl fall in love\" you hear her reply, you assume she must have been smiling. However you feel you're prison starting to get smaller and Diana says \"you're punishment is you have to give me a tummy rub before there is no room left.\" Knowing she was just playing but still not sure of what she was capable of yet you begin rubbing Diana's stomach. You hear a moan come from outside the \"walls\" and you increase the strength and speed of you're rubbing. You even tickle her stomach a bit causing her to laugh. After a minute you Diana pulls herself up and lays down next to you. You climb up onto her chest and lay down on her stomach. \"So am I forgiven for my crime?\" you ask,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More then forgiven, I owe you something now\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and say \"would you mind if I slept with you from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was decided the moment you said you loved me, come up with something else\" Diana replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since I did it for you, would you mind giving me a back rub?\" you ask. In response Diana flips you over, gently pulls off you're shirt and starts rubbing you're back with one finger. She actually starts singing while she's doing it. \"Diana you have a great singing voice\" you comment. She stops for a second and you turn to see her blushing. She hides her face behind her tail and gently pushes you back down and starts rubbing you're back again and singing with more enthusiam. After a few minutes Diana had finished and you were laying between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John I am so glad that I met you\" she says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The feeling is mutual Diana you're wonderful\" you say.</span></div></div>",

You look up and say \"hey diana is there a bathroom around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'll take you there\" she says. She takes you into a normal bathroom with just a toilet and bathtub, she closes the door and leaves you to you're buisness. You yell out the door \"i'm done Diana\" she opens the door and scoops you up. She walks back into her room leaving the door slightly ajar and sits back down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So John, you ready for bed?\" she asks. You nod and she snuggles you into her chest, she wraps herself up in her tail covering you and her in warmth. \"Good night John\" she says. \"Good night Diana\" you reply. You quickly hear her fall asleep and you just lay with her for a half an hour. You then wiggle out of her grip and slide down the bed, you squeeze through the ajar door and walk down the hall. You walk down the hall over to Juliette's room, you find the door slightly ajar almost like she expected you to come. You enter and you find her sitting on a large 4 poster bed, you pull yourself up and she sets down the book she was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did come after all, I knew you couldn't resist me\" she says showing off her body a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here for advice nothing more\" you say sitting down, this suprises her and and she lays out in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of advice?\" she asks giving you a little poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relationship advice\" you reply \"Diana is my first girlfriend and I already care for her a lot but I already feel like I screwed up\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way you could do something like that, i've never seen my daughter so happy as she was laying on the couch watching you\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she told me that one of her fantasies was to have her boyfriend sit next to her and stroke her back while he whispered about how beautiful she was to her, I couldn't exactly do that due to the size difference and she looked really dissappointed.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's nothing, she'll forget about it by tomorrow\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but it feels like I failed in my first real act of being her boyfriend\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you really are serious about her\" Juliette says, you nod in reply. \"Hmm well there's only one thing I can think of that would an expectation of her boyfriend.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'll do anything\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her father used to prepare breakfast for the whole family so they'd have atleast some time together before he passed so that's the only thing I can think of\" she says, \"i'll prepare the necesscary ingredient and equipment but the rest is up to you John\" she says. \"Don't take too large a risk now, I really don't want you leaving this world before I get a chance to have some fun with you\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um thanks?\" you say in reply. Juliette scoops you up and slips downstairs, she gets everything set up for scrambled eggs, bacon and toast and you see her glow for a second. \"Try not to make too much noise, i'll go shut my daughter's door, and best of luck John\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and get to work, you work through the night and finally you have a wonderful breakfast all set up and ready. You even squeezed some juice although that took almost 2 hours and a lot of work. You lay back for a second when you hear Diana shout \"Mother\" you hear running upstairs and a door crash open. You hear them talk for a bit and you see a brown blur race down the stairs. She runs in and you smile saying \"good morning Diana, breakfast is all ready so you don't have to worry.\" She stands there stunned for a second and then slowly walks up the counter and lowers herself so she's face to body with you. She just looks at you for a second and you see tears start to well up in her eyes. \"Thank you\" she cries hugging you to her chest and holding you there for a minute. \"But why and how did you know?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I felt kind of bad for not being able to fufill you're fantasy of a boyfriend and I got some help from you're mother\" you say. Juliette walks in at this time and says \"you got a real catch of a boyfriend there Diana, he rejected my advances and was solely focused on you when he came to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're such a sweetie\" Diana says lifting you up and giving you a kiss, \"I really owe you one now\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no big deal although if you don't mind i'm gonna go to sleep\" you say before collapsing in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're half consious and you hear Diana say \"Hey, hey what's wrong\" she asks giving you a poke. \"Don't worry Diana he's just very tired since he stayed up all night making this for you\" Juliette says. You fully fall unconsious after hearing this and wake up maybe half an hour later. You wake up covered in Diana's tail with her looking down at you, you slowly get up feeling a lot more rested but still a little tired and ask \"so how was the breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"we haven't eaten yet, we decided to wait for you to wake up first\" Diana replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it'll be cold by the time we eat it now\" you say, \"Yeah but i'll feel bad if I didn't eat it with you beside me\" she says giving you a squeeze. She walks back over to the table and she places you down at her spot. She picks up the plates and says \"hey you didn't make any for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I was kind of just hoping to mooch off you're plate\" you say with a tired smile on you're face. You all dig into the meal, Diana insisted on feeding you you're part and you didn't really want to or have the energy to complain. After breakfast Juliette says \"Diana I envy you, you look like me and you're father when we were younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna try to steal him are you?\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i'm not, and that's the reason, although a suprise will be showing up today if I remember correctly and that may cause a problem\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't think so\" you say giving off an audible yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww are you still sleepy John, just give me a second and i'll have the most comfy bed available set up\" Diana says. She picks you up and walks over to the couch, she then lays down and situates you so that you're surrounded by her chest. She covers you with her tail and begins gently stroking you and singing, you instantly fall asleep and wake up to find....</span></div></div>",

You kiss her back and you stay like that for a while till you hear a doorbell, \"I'll get that\" Juliette says walking over to the door. She opens it and says \"Jolty, today was the day you got back from college.\" Instantly Diana covers you completely with her tail hiding you and you hear a pair of bags being dropped and a sweet voice say \"it's good to be home mom.\" You hear footsteps get closer and you hear the voice say \"how you doing squirt, did you manage to get a boyfriend while we've been away from college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't say yes Diana\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I do have a boyfriend Jolty\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and where is he?\" she asks, \"he'd have to be pretty small-minded to want to go out with you.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting mad you push you're way out from under Diana's tail, \"how about small in general\" you yell at her. Jolty looks down at you with a look of shock on her face, \"is that a human?\" she asks staring down at you intently. \"Yes he is and he's mine\" Diana says, \"Oh i'm sure I can convince him otherwise\" Jolty says. \"Hi little guy, i'm Jolty, Diana's big sister\" she says giving you a good view of her rack. \"Nice to meet you Jolty, but you're sorely mistaken if you think i'll leave Diana for you\" you say. You see a frown cross her face and Diana's pulls you back and you feel Jolty's hand cut the air in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jolty what are you doing\" Diana says, \"he just disrespected me, i'm just going to teach him a lesson\" Jolty says. \"So just hand him over and you'll get him back when i'm done with him\" she says. Diana backs up and holds you tight to her chest \"back off Jolty, you are not touching him in anyway\" she says. \"Oh yeah\" Jolty says, you feel electricity start to gather in the air and Juliette yells \"Jolty stop it,\" you feel the electricity dissipate and Jolty looks away, she then grabs her bags and heads upstairs. Diana sits down and sighs saying \"thanks Mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Jolty always was a handful\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she like that all the time?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's just she gets annoyed when someone rejects her, although i'm gonna have to watch you even closer now, Jolty is even more aggressive then my mother\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well that's good to hear\" you say. \"Although I have no problem with you watching over me\" you say smiling a little. Diana sits up and you lay down in her lap, Juliette sits down next to her daughter and says \"so John, I guess Diana has told you about her sisters.\" You nod and she says \"yeah well this is the month where they all graduate from college so things may become a bit tougher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can handle it\" you say say giving Diana a hug. She gently hugs you back and says \"yeah mom we made it past you so i'll think we'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you're making it sound like i'm a bad guy\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stole more boyfriends from me then my sisters combined\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm sorry for that\" she says \"but I won't steal this one, i'm all for you 2 being together\" Juliette says. Diana leans over and gives her mom a hug, you watch and smile at the display. Diana scoops you up and heads back to her room, she places you down on the bed and says \"i'm gonna grab some fruit, you still look a little tired and it'll help you wake up.\" \"Thanks\" you say laying back on the bed. Diana leaves the room and you hear footsteps. You look up and see Jolty standing in the doorway, you move back a bit as she walks into the room but you know you really don't have anywhere to go. She sits down on the edge of the bed and says \"i'm sorry John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you say, \"i'm sorry for what I did in the living room\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm done, but why did you keep stealing Diana's crushes?\" you ask moving so you're sitting next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe the fact that I never really had a boyfriend when I was in high school and all the men I knew after wanted me for only one thing\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I can see how that would leave you a bit jealous\" you say, \"but it's still not right to take out you're problems on you're little sister\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" she says hanging her head, \"it's just that i've never really had a guy that cared, even you don't seem to like me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you didn't exactly leave a good first impression\" you say. \"However i'm willing to forget our first meeting if you promise not to be mean to Diana\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you being nice to me?\" she asks. \"You're sister was kind to me when we first met, so I might as well do the same\" you say giving a smile.  \"Besides you might be my siste in-law in the future\" you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", she says \"although I don't even know you're name\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's John, Jolty nice to meet you\" you say lifting a hand which she shakes with 2 fingers. Diana walks in carrying a tray of honey dew melon, and stops when she sees Jolty sitting there. \"Jolty what are you doing?\" she asks eyeing her sister suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just talking to him\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Diana she hasn't tried anything\" you say. She walks forward and puts the tray down passing a piece of melon over to you and her sister. Jolty leans closer to you and says \"hey sis you might want to watch over this guy or I might just fall for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John what did you do?\" she says staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything, we just talked, and she opened up to me a bit\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolty pretends to look innocent and says \"he's really a beast under that exterior, I came to say hi and he jumped on top of me and tried to do things to me.\" She turns away and pretends to cry and to you're shock Diana seems to believe her as she stares down at you angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm innocent I swear\" you say, \"even if I wanted to she's a hell of a lot bigger then me, she could just hold me out in front of her with 2 fingers to stop me\" you say. Diana picks you with 2 fingers and dangles you in front of her face to prove it to herself, she then moves you close to her face and licks you from head to toe in one long lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you sweetie\" she says giggling a little, \"I just wanted to mess with you a little\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny\", you say still dangling, she puts you back down on the bed and you grab you're piece of melon and drag it over to the other side of the bed. You turn away from Diana and continue eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww come on it wasn't that bad a joke\" Diana says staring at you, she crawls over till she's right behind you and gives you a soft poke. \"Please forgive me John\" she says. You just continue eating you're melon when she snatches it out of you're hand. She then scoops you up and places you in the center of the bed before laying down trapping you under her chest, you can hear Jolty laughing as she does this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana what are you doing, let me out\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kept staring at a piece of melon instead of my melons and I can't have that John, besides you're not getting out till you've forgiven me\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then we're going to be here a while\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why John, what I did wasn't that bad\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was kind of a mean joke, besides for that small amount of time it honestly seemed like you thought i'd do something like that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm sorry John\" she says leaning down and giving you a kiss, when you don't kiss her back she gets up and sits behind you, her tail drapes over you and you lay there for a minute before sighing and getting up. You walk up and give a little squeeze on her tail, she turns and you climb onto her lap and sit down. \"I forgive you Diana just promise me you'll never do something like that again\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise sweetie\" she says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww well since you 2 made up i'm go take a shower\" Jolty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you an electric type?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but remember electric is good against water\" she says before walking off. You feel Diana's tail wrap around you and \"i'm sorry sweetie, let me make it up to you\" she says. She lays down and positions you in her chest then she squeezes it around you. She repeats this a couple of times before removing you from her tail and giving you another kiss. However this time for some reason she takes a long whiff of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John when was the last time you took a bath?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Day before coming here so probably 2 days ago\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you stink\" she says holding her nose, \"after Jolty is out you're going and having a shower\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but wouldn't it be better if I had a bath?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also need a shower John, you piece it together\" she says with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush as the realization fully hits you, \"um...are you okay with me being with you while doing that\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would take it as insult if you weren't with me\" she says smiling, \"besides I need to pay you back a bit for the joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just being near you is payment enough\" you say trying not to sound cheesy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you're just too nice John, but it's decided as soon as the bathroom is free it's gonna be just you and me\" she says giving you a light poke.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hear the shower shut off and after a few minutes you hear feet padding across the floor and Jolty yells \"Sis, showers all yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like it's out turn\" Diana says smiling down at you. She scoops you up and holds you to her chest so you can't escape. You hear her walk into the bathroom and you see a bit of light as she lets go with one hand for a second to shut the bathroom door. She places you down on the counter and quickly has you strip till you're standing there naked. Diana picks you up and steps into the bathtub and shuts the opaque shower curtain before placing you down in the soap dish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for the best view of you're life?\" Diana says. You don't answer so she just turns the shower on. You had to admit watching the water flow over her fur making it flatten really accentuated Diana's curves. You couldn't help but stare and she turns and smiles \"i'm flattered John but you might want to cover the little guy up\" she says . You look down and quickly cover you're crotch area. Diana grabs a shampoo bottle and pours some liquid into her hands and rubs it over her whole body creating a coat of lather. She then stands under the shower and washes all the lather down the drain. She turns to you again and says \"like the show?\" All you can do is nod as you were covering yourself up\"well good because now it's you're turn\" Diana says before picking you up. She picks up the bar of soap and says \"pokemon only really need this for our feet and hands but it'll work just fine on you.\" She rubs the bar over you quickly coating you in suds and then she holds you under the water. You end up spitting as some soap got into you're mouth and she holds you against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know John we're all alone in here\" Diana says, you're pretty sure she had a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No taking advantage of the situation\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine\" she says in a huff, she turns the shower off and grabs a towel off the rack. She quickly dries you off and holds you so you're still in the towel and pretends to forget about you. She dries herself off rubbing you against her most sensitve areas and then places you and the towel down on the sink counter. You wiggle you're way out and she pretends to gasp \"Oh John so that's where you got to, I can't believe you wanted to cop a feel that bad\" she says but her intentions were revealed by the giant grin she had on her face. \"What did I say about taking advantage of the situation\" you say quickly getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but it's just so hard not to, you're just so cute and it's fun to play with you\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for me it isn't Diana, look part of loving someone is giving them the respect you want them to give you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry John\" Diana says her ears drooping and her tail hanging between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I really don't want to keep having to forgive you for this stuff because otherwise we're gonna have a rocky relationship, so before you try anything like a joke ask yourself if you'd like it if the roles were reversed ok?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does that mean i'm forgiven?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does Diana just remember what I said ok\" you say. Instantly her ears spring up and her tail starts wagging like a dogs, she scoops you up and hugs you. She runs out of the bathroom rushing past Jolty and into her room where she shuts the door. \"John I think I owe you something\" Diana says walking over to the bed and putting you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe me nothing...\" you trail off as Diana was kneeling down staring intently at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you staring at me like that?' you ask, she slowly moves forward till she's almost poking you with her nose. \"Ok seriously what are you doing\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Distraction\" is all she says before you feel her tail wrap around you, she then crawls over to the center of the bed with you wrapped up in her tail and she drops you into the middle of the bed. You're about to protest when she lays down trapping you in her chest. \"Don't even think about protesting John, you're going to stay there and you're going to like it or else\" she says, You pop you're head out and say \"or else what?\" being defiant, you get a lick for you're defiance. \"I'm going to lick you everytime you defy me\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not much of a punishment\" you reply getting another lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not, but then again this isn't supposed to punish you\" Diana says laying down so you're stuck between her compacted breasts and her body. You're able to wiggle you're way out and say \"haha I defy you to the last\" but she just leans over and licks you're whole body. \"Fine there's only 1 thing left to me, to shut the mouth that tongue is coming from\" you say leaning over and kissing Diana on the lips. She eagerly kisses back and after half a minute breaks the kiss saying \"I have been defeated, you may now command me as you see fit\" smiling the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't think of anything\" you say, \"I mean I have the most beautiful eevee in the world as my girlfriend and she even lets me sleep in her wonderfully warm tail, i'm at a loss\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww well aren't you just a sweetie\" Diana says, she leans over and pulls you close to her. \"I really do owe you one now John\" she sas staring down at you lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is letting me snuggle up next to you at any time, and letting me stay by you enough to make that even?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is John\" she says with a smile on her face. You hear a knock on the door and Jolty enters, \"Hey sis it's time for dinner, so you and him need to come downstairs\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Diana says sitting up so that you fall into her cupped hands, she follows her sister downstairs and you see Juliette cooking when Diana walks into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good now that we're all here we can eat\" Juliette says, she places 3 plates of meat and veggies and 3 glasses of milk down. She then places down a thimbleful of milk and you're food was served on a little doll plate. \"Sorry John it was the best I could think of\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you 2 have been alone alot, you had sex yet?\" Jolty asks. You choke on the piece of pork you were eating and had to wash it down with mile. You turn to Diana who you see was flaring bright red, \"no we haven't Jolty\" you say weakly trying to stare at the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not, i've never seen 2 people more in love then you 2\" Jolty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I love diana but we've only really known each other a few days, besides I don't think she could have my kids so what's the point\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it feels so amazing, you 2 have to try it\" Jolty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jolty stop pressuring you're sister into having sex\" Juliette says. She turns to you and says \"John it's you're and her choice if you want to do it, but if you are going to be gentle with her.\" The rest of dinner went on with a kind of awkward silence and afterwards Diana quickly scoops you up and runs upstairs. She reaches her room, shutting and locking the door and places you down on the bed. Thing is she had that same predatory look in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So John about what my mother and sister were saying\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana i'm not gonna pressure you, if you don't want to do it we don't have to\" you say. You see the look in her eyes shift back to normal and she says \"thank you John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought since my mother and sister had mentioned it you'd want to have sex and well i'm kind of scared because all my sisters said their first time really hurt\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do it when you're ready Diana\" you say. She walk over to the bed and lays down sweeping you up in her tail she brings you into arms reach and then hugs you to her chest. \"Thanks John\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime my precious eevee\" you say. \"Hey Diana do you have anything like a pair of pajamas I could use?\" you ask. She silently walks over to one side of her room and rummages through a box, she comes back with a set of red doll pajamas. \"Will these do John?\" she asks. \"Perfectly\" you say slipping the pajamas on. Diana lays out on the bed and you climb up onto her and lay out just above her breasts. Diana then covers you with her tail, and you and her with the blanket tucking it up under you're chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night John\" Diana says, \"Good night Diana\" you reply. You fall asleep quite quickly snuggled up in the warmth.</span></div></div>",

There is a pair of red eyes staring down at you yet you saw some kind of gentleness in them. You're just about to wake Diana when you're scooped up and you're mouth is covered. Whatever it is silently exits the Diana's room and enters another one confirming her as one of Diana's sisters. A light switch is flicked and you end up staring at an umbreon pokegirl. Her rings weren't glowing but what you saw were her 2 round eyes, she had a very nice hourglass figure like Diana and had a slightly smaller chest C or D instead of E but they fit her slim body really well. She walks over to the bed and places you down, you look around noticing the room was actually quite bare, there was a tv in one corner and a book case on one wall but otherwise nothing. The umbreon girl stares down at you for a few seconds before you say \"hi?\" As you say this her eyes light up and she dives forward snuggling against you and rubbing you against her cheek. You're able to push yourself back a bit and say \"ok who in the heck are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm Diana's eldest sister, my name is Trixi\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm John\" you reply, \"well Trixi I have to get going\" you say getting up. You're pushed back down and held down with one hand, she lays her head down next to you \"aww where you going cutie?\" she asks in a cute voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to bed\" you say pushing against her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh welll you can just sleep with me\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense but I already have a girlfriend, Diana so if you'll just excuse me\" you say breaking free you start to slide down the bed sheet but are quickly grabbed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you're trying to run away that is so cute, but that won't work\" she says still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look no offense but I already had a few problems with Jolty i'd rather not have problems with you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There'll be no problems\" Trixi says crawling over her bed and curling up, and holding you to her breast. \"Now go to sleep John, because you're not going to outlast me, I am a night pokemon\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with all of you and stealing people Diana likes?\" you ask,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well the others were because I like having all eyes on me, but you i'm going to keep all for myself\" she says looking down at you. She gives you a lick and moves back a bit \"blech you taste like my sister, well i'm just going to have to override her\" Trixi says starting to lick you. She licks you for 2 straight minutes before sniffing the air and saying \"good you're mine now\" before curling up again and falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow and I thought you were a nice pokemon\" you whisper to yourself. You try to push you're way out but even asleep she has you stuck in an iron grip, so you just lay out an go to sleep. You wake up to the sun and Trixi looking down at you, \"good morning\" she says really happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning\" you reply, you hear Trixi's door open and Jolty walks in, \"Trixi mom says to come down for breakfast\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" you yell, Jolty hears you and turns noticing you \"hey trixi why is John in here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's mine now\" she says getting between you and her sister, \"this guy's really cute, and i'm not giving him up without a fight\" she continues. You feel the hair on you're neck stand up and run to the other side of the bed as a bolt of electricity jumps off Jolty's fur and hits her sister. Trixi falls backwards stunned and Jolty scoops you up and bolts downstairs. She runs downstairs and into the kitchen where Juliette was consoling Diana since you had well disappeared. She drops you in front of Diana and a smile instantly springs to Diana's face however you freeze as you knew Trixi had reached downstairs. You slowly turn and she's standing in the kitchen entranceway, all of her rings glowing and a fiery look in her eyes. You dive forward and hide behind Diana but Juliette stands up and says \"what's going on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" she asks calming down, \"i'm just going to take him back to my room and continue what I was doing last night.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so it was you who stole him\" Juliette says staring down the umbreon girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did, he's so cute, and I will have him\" Trixi says, however Juliette stands between Trixi and Diana. \"Do you have any idea how worried you made you're sister, she thought she had killed him\" Juliette says. She stops for a second and looks down, \"Really?\" she asks. Juliette nods and Trixi calms right down, she slowly walks over to her sister who pushes you out of arms reach and says \"i'm sorry Sis.\" Diana looks away and you just sit there, finally Diana sighs and says \"I forgive you Sis, but never do that again, ok or I will make you pay.\" Trixi nods and you sigh. \"Hey Jolty can you come here\" you say, she walks over to you and you indicate for her to lean over. She does so she's near you and you reach up and give her a peck on the cheek, \"thanks for giving me a hand\" you say. Diana just looks at you dumbfounded, and Jolty blushes a little. \"What? was that a bad thing to do?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just kissed my sister!\" she yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she gave me a hand, is it that big a deal?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what next are you going to make out with Trixi or my mother?\" Diana yells clearly agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ok with that\" Juliette says but a withering glare from her daughter quiets her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look i'm sorry, I didn't think you'd think it such a big deal\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just give it back\" Jolty says leaning down and kissing you. You swear her eyes shifted from brown to red for a second and she stands up. Her ears and tail droop and she rushes past her sister and mother and runs upstairs, you hear a door slam a few seconds afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, someone's in trouble\" Jolty says, you just stare at her and sigh, You jump down from the table onto a chair cushion and shimmy down the chair leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John where are you going?\" Juliette asks, \"to fix this\" you reply. It takes you a good ten minutes to get upstairs and then another minute to get to Diana's door. You're able to just squeeze under the doorframe by sucking in you're chest and you stand up in pitch blackness. Thankfully Diana's bed was straight from the door, that and you heard sniffling noises in front of you. You walk across the floor and climb the bed sheet, you're eyes slowly start adjusting to the light and you see Diana curled up around a pillow with her head buried into it. You walk over and give her a gentle poke, she turns and stares at you for a bit before snuggling you to her as tightly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blech, need air, can't breathe\" you say and she lets up a bit letting you take in a few large breaths. \"Look Diana i'm sorry, it wasn't one of my better judgement moments, so can you forgive me?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" she says shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you say snuggling up against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John I said no what are you doing\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I could snuggle with you at any time and i'm doing just that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No John go away\" she says pushing you away with one hand. You however just situate yourself next to her stomach and she pushes you away again. Getting up you walk around her and she seems to settle down, you reach the back of her head and reach up and start scratching her ears, she gives off a cute yelp and so you continue. After a minute you feel her tail against you and it wraps around you, you're then whipped forward around so that you're hanging in front of Diana's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you use my weakness against me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling better\" is all you say in reply. She blushes a little and nods before leaning over and giving you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blech you taste like Trixi\" Diana says, she spends the next few minutes licking you then she drops you on the bed curls around you trapping you in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I forgiven?\" you ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes cutie you are, just never do that again\" she says. \"I won't\" you reply, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you going to pay me back?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I already said I was sorry\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, have it you're way no more tail blanket then\" Diana says. \"Oh come on that's cruel\" you reply. \"Fine\" you say getting up you walk over and kiss her, \"not good enough\" she says, you were pretty sure she was smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you just tell me what you want Diana\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to give me a tummy rub\" she replies turning over so she's laying face up. You climb up and start rubbing and instantly she starts giving off a purring sound, you rub slowly making sure to pay extra attention to any spots that intensify the purring sound. After 5 minutes you sit down and ask \"so can I have my tail blanket back?\" You feel her tail droop over you and she says \"what do you think cutie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well then i'm going to sleep for a bit since my rest was interrupted by Trixi\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok John have a nice nap\" Diana says, as soon as you let you're breathing space out to fall asleep you feel her gently rub a finger over you're back. You fall asleep and wake up to</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up and the lights are on and you look over and see Jolty standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you 2 just adorable\" she says walking over. She walks over to the bed and sits down, \"Mom wanted me to come up here and check on you, glad you 2 made up\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how could I stay mad at someone so cute\" Diana says giving you a stroke not realizing you were awake. You just lay there trying to look asleep and Jolty asks her sister \"so what do you think about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's wonderful, I\u2019ve never had someone who cares for me more. He also seems to love how fluffy I am\" she says the last part with a giggle and gives her tail a flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmm, I wish that luxray I dated had been as nice\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find someone nice one of these days\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he has a brother\" Jolty says laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah then we could have a double wedding\" Diana says laughing alongside her sister. You take this opportunity to sit up and pretend to yawn. \"Did we wake you?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it's fine, what are you talking about?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we were just talking about how it would be nice if you had a brother\" Jolty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice\" you say laying back against Diana's stomach. Jolty just stares at you, \"hmm I wonder if we could get him to use double team, then there could be one for each of us\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I can't use any pokemon moves, besides I thought those were illusions\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" Jolty says her ears drooping a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw sis I can't stand to see you sad like that\" Diana says, she picks you up off her chest and passes you over to Jolty. \"Give him a hug it always makes me feel better\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I you're boyfriend or you're pet\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boyfriend of course\" Diana replies \"all you're doing is helping my sister.\" Jolty looks down at you before squeezing you tightly against her, after a bit you actually felt her start to loosen up and she places you down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Diana, thanks John\" she says before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Diana and say \"I hope she finds someone who will take care of her, that luxray sounded like a real jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't sleeping were you?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was until Jolty turned on the lights\" you say standing up and walking closer to her, she turns over and looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you have a brother?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah a twin actually, kind of miss him, he'd love this place, I know he'd take good care of Jolty\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hopefully he'll show up one day\" Diana says, you smile at the thought and say \"I hope he does too.\" You lay down next to her and she picks you up and nestles you in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So John what part of my body do you like the best?\" Diana asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to pick just one?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and it can't be my tail\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say any of my other answers then, they're all kinda perverted\" you say blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you only like me for my body?\" Diana asks raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, you're funny, kind, energetic, cute, you took care of me without even knowing me, besides you make a good pillow\" you say snuggling yourself as far into her fur as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I\u2019m just a really big pillow?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, geez do you have selective hearing or what\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah it's just fun to play with you, I know you love me, and I love you too\" she says curling herself up so you're surrounded by her body and her warmth. She looks down at you for a bit before saying \"John wanna play a game,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you reply. She places you down on the bed and says \"the game is simple if you can keep from being caught for a minute you can request something, if not I get to request something, oh and the playing area is the bed.\" \"That is so cheap\" you say before she yells \"go\" and dives at you. You jump out of the way and run for the top of the bed, she grabs onto you're foot with 2 fingers but you pull yourself out. Thinking you won't win this by conventional means you wait for her to dive again. She does and you dive toward her catching her off guard, you land near her arm and quickly climb up her back and onto her head. You begin rubbing her ears and instantly she goes limp giving off a small mrring sound. You rub her ears till you've counted to 50 and stop rubbing. She quickly stands up and you fall back onto the bed with an \"oof,\" winded but not hurt. She looks at you and says \"that's cheating using my only weakness against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look who's talking Ms limited playing area and much larger size\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you win this round, what's you're request\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I think i'll just save it for later\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're just going to have it so that I owe you one?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly\" you reply \"now let's start the next round so I have 2 favors instead of one.\"  You walk over and stand on the other side of the bed and Diana yells \"go\" again. She slowly crawls forward like a cat stalking it's prey and she quickly has you stuck between herself and a pillar. \"You're mine now\" she says smiling. She dives forward and you're just able to dodge when you feel yourself land against her tail. Instantly it curls up around you and you're lifted up and held at face level. \"Guess I win this round\" Diana says smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah let me down\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I think i'm just going to keep you there and save my request for later\" Diana says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's totally against the rules\" you say, \"this is revenge for taking advantage of my weakness\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are totally taking advantage of the size difference\" you say not really being able to do anything. You feel her tail let go and you fall into her waiting hands. She just looks down at you for a bit before snuggling you close to her chest. \"Do you mind the size diffrence now?\" she asks and even though you couldn't see it you were sure she was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course I don't mind it like this\" you say, she pulls you back and says \"well then you shouldn't mind the other stuff\" before giving you a kiss. She stands up and walks downstairs where Juliette and Trixi are watching tv, Diana sits down next to her mother and puts you down between her and Trixi. You just sit there watching tv for a bit till you feel a weird feeling and look up and see Trixi staring down at you. \"You're just so cute\" she says leaning over and pulling you closer to her. You try to move back near Diana but she just holds you there and Diana seemed too involved in the show to notice. Trixi leans over and whispers \"if you ever want to have some fun all night long just come find me\" she says before giving you a quick nuzzle and sitting back up. You climb up into Diana's lap and just sit there for a while however you feel yourself lifted up after a bit and you float over more towards Juliette. You land in her lap and she reaches down and starts gently rubbing you're back with one finger while petting you're head with another. You started gettting a little peeved, not that you minded the attention but that fact that it seemed like you had to be the instigaor for Diana to get mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Diana\" you say, she turns and sees you in her mother's lap, her petting and playing with you and she just smiles and says \"Mom aren't you nice to take care of John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it\" you say, you stand up and shimmy down the edge of the couch you then proceed to climb up the stairs even though it took a few minutes, you slipped under Diana's door and walk under the bed and lay down starting to think. A few minutes later you hear the door open and Diana walks in, she looks under the bed and spots you then asks \"what are you doing down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"being mad at you\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sister and mom were flaunting over me, you saw you're own mother petting me and you said \"oh aren't you nice taking care of John.\" I know you care for me becuase of how mad you got when I kissed Jolty but a little reciprocation is necesscary\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying you want me to get mad at my mother and sisters when they show you a lot of attention\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well atleast like say hey or something I mean guys don't mind when they're girlfriend tells another girl to back up as he's already taken\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a very good girlfriend am I\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good girlfriend just kind of oblivious at times\" you say. You stand up and walk over to the edge of the bed, you climb up and motion for her to lay down next to you. She does so and you climb up her back and onto her head and rub her ears for a bit before giving her a back rub. \"That means I forgive you\" you say once you're finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so nice John, how'd you get stuck with a girl like me\" Diana says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have to say the same thing Diana\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks you up and holds you close before laying down trapping you underneath her. \"I'm never letting you go John, are you ok with that?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally\" you say, she leans down and gives you a kiss before laying her head down and falling asleep trapping you underneath her you fall asleep soon after as the combination of warmth and comfort was just too much.</span></div></div>",

She stares down at you and gently pulls you out from between Diana's breasts. You look up at her and are about to say something when she covers you're mouth with one finger and makes a shushing motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the human Trixi texted us about, she's right you are cute\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the compliment, now if you'll excuse me that was really comfy\" you say getting up and starting to walk back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you won't even talk to me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just give me a second, you jump onto Diana's head and start rubbing her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" the flareon whispers but stops as she hears Diana start to give off a faint mrring sound, \"wake up sleepyhead, if you do you'll get all the ear rubs you want\" you whisper into her ears. You jump down and you see her eyes flutter open, she leans forward and kisses you pushing you into the matress before looking up. She notices the flareon and sits up \"Karen\" she yells and tackle-hugs her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you too Sis\" Karen says, pushing her sister off. \"So this is John\" she says indicating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah this is my boyfriend\" Diana says pulling you close with her tail, she leans forward and gives you a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you gonna try to steal me like Jolty and Trixi tried?\" you ask bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No John she isn't, Karen was the one person who gave me her full support\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright then\" you say, you walk forward and reach out you're hand \"I'm John nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Karen\" she replies reaching forward with a finger and shaking you're hand. she leans further forward and quickly has you in a hug. \"You're just so cute I can't stand it\" she says giving you a lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen put him down\" Diana says, Karen does so and Diana pulls you back and surrounds you with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what was that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" Karen says blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen's problem is she is very liberal, and she doesn't try to steal my boyfriends but become more like a friend with benifits\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok, well i'm ok with the friend bit not so sure about the benifits part\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now it's not that bad to diversify\" Karen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...now that I think about it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen stop giving him weird ideas\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a problem with me being with more then just you at one time\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do\" Diana replies, \"you're mine and mine alone. I'm not letting anyone else have you, you will sleep with me, bathe with me, and eventually be my children's father\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's you're answer Karen\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis that's no fun\" Karen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care Karen, he's mine and mine alone, besides what happened to those keckleon brothers you were seeing?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They weren't too happy when I suggested a few different ideas to them\" Karen replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't want to know\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Karen we'd rather not know about that kind of thing\" Diana says, Karen leans over staring right at you, \"Diana can I hug him again?\" she asks. You hear the door open and Jolty, Trixi, and Juliette walk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so this is where you were Karen\" Jolty says. \"You're not bugging Diana and John are you?\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just suggesting some ideas\" Karen replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on sis we should leave them alone\" Jolty says, she grabs Karen's right arm and Trixi grabs her left arm. They start dragging her out of the room but she breaks free and dives toward you, she grabs you and jumps onto a window ledge. \"Karen what are you doing?\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sis, but he's just so cute, i'll bring him back in an hour\" she says jumping out the window. You don't even scream as she falls and lands unfazed, she holds you close and you feel her speeding up as she uses agility. You feel her stop running after a while and you look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what are you doing?\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry John, you're just so cute, don't worry I won't try to steal any of you're firsts\" she says snuggling against you. \"All I want is to do is hold you for an hour, is that ok?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess so\" you say. She snuggles you into her chest and wraps herself up in her tail like Diana does. You lay there for a 5 minutes till you hear a rustling in the bushes, you and Karen look up to see a group of 3 vulpix staring down at her, Karen quickly gets up and jumps back. Without warning the 3 vulpix shoot out a combined flamethrower that Karen just dodges. \"What the hells they're problem?\" Karen says as she starts running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember Diana saying she fought off a group of 3 vulpix when she first found me\" you say, Karen keeps running as why they were there was obvious, they wanted you back. Karen runs into a park and she turns toward the 3 vulpix who quickly caught up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the sister of that girl who took him from us, just hand him over and you can leave unharmed\" the leader says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I can't do that, my sister loves him and he loves her\" Karen replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I guess we'll have to do this by force\" the lead vulpix says, they start advancing when the one in the back is blindsided by a shadow ball, the 2nd one is hit by a thunderbolt and the leader starts floating in the air. You see Jolty, Trixi, Juliette, and Diana running toward you and Juliette stops near the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughter said he's already spoken for, so are you going to leave now?\" she asks. The vulpix nods and Juliette lets her down, \"this isn't over\" she yells as her and the other 2 run away. Karen holds you out for Diana and she scoops you up in a hug, \"are you ok?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly fine, she didn't try anything, just wanted a really long hug\" you reply. Diana lowers you into her chest and turns to her sister and stares at her \"he seems ok, and you didn't just hand him over to those vulpix so I guess I can forgive you\" Diana says. They hug and you say \"still here, no room, need air,\" they break the hug and Karen giggles. \"Sorry John\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez you're more dangerous then you're sisters\" you say trying to pull yourself out but you can't. Diana giggles and you assume they started walking home, you had to admit it was really comfy where you were if a bit restrictive. You all reach home and Diana fishes you out of her chest, \"did you like the ride?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offence but next time let me sit on you're shoulder or something it was comfy yet way too cramped\" you say moving around trying to get rid of the stiffnes sin you're back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, well let me fix that\" she says, she places you down on her palm and starts rubbing you're back with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels great\" you say as the rubbing removed all the tension and cramps in you're body. She stops and you sit up, \"that felt great, although i'm a bit hungry\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well that's easily taken care of\" Diana replies. She walks into the kitchen and puts you down on the counter before grabbing a jar out of a cupboard, \"Mom says my sisters aren't supposed to know about this jar but you're not any of my sisters\" she says. She opens the jar and inside is a bunch of pokeblock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can eat that, that's more pokemon food\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, let me see\" she says running her finger over a bunch of jars she grabs one that looks like a wailord and opens it. \"Ahh here we go\" she says she pulls something out of the jar and puts it back. \"Here you go\" she says and passes you an oatmeal-raisin cookie as big as you were. You quickly eat about half the cookie and lay back stuffed as can be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't eat another bite\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell mom I gave you that cookie, those are kind of her cookies and she doesn't like people eating them\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on it can't be that bad\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last time someone ate one we had to scatter and hide out in the woods for a few days\" Diana says.

Juliette walks forward and smiles down at you \"well if you do the crime then you have to do the time\" she says smiling wickedly. She picks you up between 2 fingers, then she runs upstairs into her bedroom. Juliette shuts the door behind her and puts you down on the bed before laying down in front of you staring intently at you. You just stand there frozen in fear till she starts laughing her head off, you go from being scared to being confused in under a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you 2 were so scared\" she says still laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not going to do anything to me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i'm not, you mean a lot to Diana so I won't touch you, although i'll need you're help with a plan\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you saw how scared of me she was, that really saddens me as a mother, plus you saw how easily she gave you up to me\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so did you actually make them scatter the last time you found someone eating a cookie\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that was the day the girls went off to college and they tricked Diana into believing that story, she hid out in the woods for 3 days because of it\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So John, my plan is for you to well just scream and sound like you're in pain or anguish so Diana comes running\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to trick her\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could always put you in real pain\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, I get the point i'll go along with you're plan\" you say. \"Good boy, I can see why Diana likes you\" Juliette says tapping you on the head with a finger. \"Just give me a second\" Juliette says, she sits down in a meditative position and a few seconds later you hear someone outside the door and you hear Diana whisper \"John are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliette pushes you over so that it seems like she was crushing you under her chest and she whispers \"start screaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start screaming you're head off trying to sound like you're in as much pain as possible. Not even a second after you start screaming Diana busted through the door and had tackled her own mother. You look up and you see a look of pure anger on Diana's face and you run up and pull on her tail. \"Diana settle down, i'm ok, she didn't hurt me, it was a trick\" you yell. Diana turns to you and her expression quickly changes from anger to relief and she jumps toward you and lands on the bed. Diana starts crying and cuddles you against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....thought....she'd......kill....you....I....thought.....I'd. .....lose....you\" Diana cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh,shhh, it's ok, Juliette didn't hurt me\" you say petting her cheek. You hug her and she slowly calms down as her crying turns to sniffling. \"What's going on in here?\" you hear come from behind you. You look behind you and see Jolty, Trixi, and Karen standing there. Karen instantly runs up and hugs her sister \"Diana what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was seeing what Diana would do if I \"hurt\" John\" Juliette says. 'Do you three remember when you tricked you're sister about that cookie jar\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah that was a good one Jolty\" Trixi says, she gets a withering glare from Juliette and says \"yes and?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it made Diana kind of afraid of me, she's not anymore\" Juliette says reaching down and rubbing Diana's back. Diana cuddles you against her cheek tighter and tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blegh, too..much...worry, can't...breathe\" you cough out. Diana lets up a bit and you take in a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, for making you worry so much\" you say looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you knew her plan didn't you, if you'll excuse me I have to go punish my boyfriend\" Diana says getting up. She carries you in her palm and walks into her room. She places you down on the bed before locking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Diana what are you gonna do?\" you ask as she looks down at you with a mischevious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, but you have 1 minute to remember one of the first things I told you otherwise you'll be punished\" Diana says laying out on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm lets see...no boyfriend...mom and sisters steal....\" you think \"she must mean some kind of thing she likes or.....weakness\" you smile as you realize what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10...9...8\" she counts down. You climb onto her back and run over her, you start rubbing her ear just as she says 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....you did remember\" Diana says trying not to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how could I forget something about my girlfriend?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I won't punish you\" Diana says, she turns around quickly and you're sent flying upwards. You land on her face and she picks you up gently with 2 fingers. You see her face turn serious and she says \"never do something like that to me again okay John? you really scared me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't Diana, you crying is the thing I want least in this world\" you reply. She snuggles you up against her chest and says \"that's what makes it so hard to stay mad at you, you're just so cute and caring\" Diana says. \"You know what? If I just let you off you'll probably think you can manipulate me, so i'm going to punish you after all\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait a min....\" you're interrupted as she starts licking you. She licks you slowly making sure her whole tongue covers you, \"mmm you really are tasty John\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well this is not becoming a regular thing if I can help it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww why can you get all close to me but I can't lick you?\" Diana says pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you don't mind if I snuggle up with you but I mind if you lick me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I snuggle with you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...no\" she says hugging you, \"hmmm so then how am I supposed to punish you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could you know always not\" you say hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then you'll think i'm easy to manipulate and you can take advantage of me\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like 20 times my size, there's no way I can take advantage of you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right\" she says smiling. She lays down and traps you in her chest, \"I came up with you're punishment\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....what is it?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to be my personal caretaker, taking care of me from head to paw\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well that doesn't seem like much of a punishment\" you say smiling, relieved that was all she came up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it isn't really meant as a punishment, more as an excuse to keep you close to me\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I accept my \"punishment\" with vigor\" you say. Diana curls herself around you and gently strokes you're back, \"John never leave me okay?\" she says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't Diana\" you reply. She snuggles you deep into her chest and falls asleep, you just lay there with her as you were sure the worry you had caused was why she was worn out. You hear footsteps and a voice says \"hey Diana i'm back from college\" you see a shadow fall over her, you look up and see a</span></div></div>",

And don't think about trying to steal him either, he's mine only. Don't worry sis, I won't try anything. Well I'll leave you 2 lovebirds alone and check on you later. Wow, your sister seems really nice., John said. Yea she is, most the time. But your stillon your punishment, John. But I thought we cleared all this, Diana. Sorry but you still have to pay the price. \"You mean to someone as cut, sexy, charming, funny, caring, and fluffy as you.\" You then saw her blush a very red color and then gave you a long, romantic kiss. She then decided to trap you by putting you in her bra. \"Hey, let me out.\", John screamed. \"Then you have to give me a back rub, caretaker.\" Ok then. \"Then after that you have to take a shower with me.\" \"Umm.....\" is all you could say. \"Unless you want to be trapped under my boobs dearie.\" Fine you win, Diana.  <i>After the backrub</i>  \"Well that felt good, John.\" \"Thanks for the compliment\" \"Time for our shower, John\" </span></div></div>",

Much to you're suprise it seems she didn't notice you, seems Diana covered you totally with her breasts and just the top of you're head was barely sticking out probably covered by Diana's hair. \"Come on sleepy wake up or i'm gonna start playing with you\" the leafeon says smiling. She leans over and gently starts rubbing pushing Diana's chest together compacting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, if that girl doesn't know i'm here this could get really painful\" you think. Luckily the leafeon's only able to compact them together twice before Diana starts to stir and she sits straight up, you were just barely held in place between the 2 large orbs surrounding you. \"Anna, you're back\" Diana says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am, now where's this little guy I heard so much about\" Anna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap\" Diana says fishing you out from between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" you say sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, HE\"S SO CUTE\" Anna squeals grabbing you and rubbing you against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can talk, eeeeee he's the cutest thing ever\" Anna says smiling before rubbing against you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let...go...please\" you say, Anna slowly hands you back to Diana and you take in a large breath as you were slightly winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi i'm John\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Anna\" Anna replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John this is my cute thing loving sister Anna\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....is that why you groped you're sister in her sleep? you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? how did you?\" Anna asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sleeping in there\" you say smiling. Anna flares red before staring open mouthed at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to punish him somehow\" Diana says and you turn to see a slight smile on her face. \"Speaking of I don't think you're punishment is over\" Diana says. \"So what's the first thing you should do as my caretaker?\" Diana says smiling down at you mishcheviously. \"Oh I know, you can give my ears a rub then maybe i'll let you take care the rest of me\" Diana says lifting you up to her head. You jump on and start rubbing Diana's ears causing her to sigh and fall forward onto the bed, you don't stop for a second as you feel her hit the matress and she starts giving off a purring sound. You take care of her right ear for 5 minutes before switching to her left and spending 5 minutes on them with Diana purring and sighing the whole time, stifling herself once or twice when you hit a sweet spot. Anna watches all this, \"wow i'm not sure who has who trained\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me of course\" Diana says before collapsing as you rub her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one has anyone trained, I love her and she loves me\" you say happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little jealous sis, all the guys I meet are jerks but this guy has to be one too right, probably just looks at you lustily and without respect\" Anna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop as Anna says this and Diana sits up \"John's great, he stayed up all night preparing breakfast like dad did when he couldn't fufill my wish, he's taken all my mean jokes in good stride, and he takes good care of me and I take good care of him. I do right?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too sure, I might need some convincing\" you say smiling. Diana pushes you over with one finger and falls forward on you wedging you into her chest totally forgetting about her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy now?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is very comfy\" you reply from between her breasts \"but what about Anna?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Diana says quickly sitting up and staring at her sister. \"Sorry\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, although now i'm definitley jealous\" Anna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now you're like everyone else\" Diana says smiling now forgetting about you but you weren't complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when was you're first date?\" Anna asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Date?\" you reply suprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know the thing couples do\" Anna replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually just showed up here a few days ago, we haven't gone on a date yet\" you say sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't gone on a date, and you're sleeping in her chest, you little perv\" Anna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a perv, am I?\" you aim the question at Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, you haven't done anything I haven't wanted you to do\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? you're still getting really close to her without even having a date\" Anna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna stop judging us just because you're jealous since we love each other\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I think she has a point, we really should go on a date I mean we've barely left the house\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you're staying in there so no one knows about you\" Diana says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile up at her and ask the first question that comes to mind \"Hey Diana I know you're fur covers up any sensitive areas but why are all the pokemon i've seen naked?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well our fur keeps us warm in the winter and we cool off naturally in the summer so we don't need clothes, besides they let us get to our loves quicker\" she says smiling down at you. She picks you out of her chest and smiles at you giving you a long lick and giggling as you wipe yourself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I say about licking me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww but you're so cute like that\" Diana says and you hear Anna giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you 2 gonna go on that date\" Anna asks. Diana nods and gets up making sure you're in her palm before running downstairs, she heads into the living room and finds Karen and Trixi there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, hey John\" Karen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, um do either of you 2 know of a good place to go too if you were on a date\" Diana asks nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh finally taking the little guy out to see the town, about time\" Trixi says. Juliette walks in at this time, \"what are you talking about?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana finally wants to take John on a date\" Trixi says and this gets a smile out of Juliette. 'My little girl's finally growing up\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what kind of date do you 2 want to have\" Karen asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't care as long as I get to be near her\" you say rubbing against Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, well there's always that new resturant, ooh or you 2 could go check out the amusment park that opened a few months ago\" Karen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not one for amusment parks, I was apprehenisve of riding most of the rides when normal sized\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh I have the perfect idea\" Juliette says and you see a sly smile cross over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it'll take me calling in a favor or 2 and me driving you 2 for a few minutes but it'll be perfect\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure\" you say looking up at Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever as long as you're happy John\" Diana says.</span></div></div>",

Juliette comes back in 5 minutes smiling, \"everything's set up, so just follow me\" she says. Diana snuggles you into her chest and puts one finger over you, \"hey what are you doing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I have to hide you so no one finds out, now just enjoy it\" Diana says following her mother. You quickly got accustomed to the bouncing of the walls surrounding you and you heard a one door open and shut then another. You felt Diana sit down and you try to get up but she gently holds you down \"just stay there, don't worry I won't let you get hurt\" she says. You heard an engine start and felt a seatbelt fall over Diana as it felt a bit tighter. Juliette drives for about ten minutes and it starts to get a bit uncomfortable, you try to get up, to move at least a bit but Diana pushes you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on it's cramped in here\" you say. She looks down at you, \"fine you can come out for a second\" she says pulling you out. True to her word all you had time to do was stretch before she put you back in. After another 10 minutes have passed you start grumbling to yourself, finally after another 5 minutes you hear the car stop. Diana sits up giving you a little room to stretch and she exits the vehicle. You felt Diana walk up an incline of some sort she walks for a few minutes and you heard whispering, Diana walks until you hear Juliette says \"this is the place\" and she stops. Diana pulls you out and much to you're suprise it's not only night out but there was a full moon and tons of stars. \"Whoa, how long were we walking\" you ask confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that long, mom just knows a solrock and lunatone pair\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright whatever thought those things were just psychic, but guess not\" you think to yourself. You look around and you notice Diana is standing on a hill overlooking a lake with a single oak tree, and set up under the tree was what looked like a picnic cloth. Diana walks over and sits down on the cloth and you look around, \"where'd you're mom go?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted to let us have some time alone\" Diana says. She lays out on the blanket and puts you down on her stomach, you walk around and stretch a bit. \"Geez I told you it gets uncomfortable being in there for long periods of time\" you say stretching and hearing something make a cracking noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you don't like my breasts?\" Diana asks sounding hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean yes I like them but it's cramped in there\" you say sitting down and looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind when i'm laying down\" Diana says snuggling you into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like this gravity works with me not against me\" you say. Diana sits up to prove the point and she finally notices you have to hold yourself up a bit to keep from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken\" she says taking you out. She puts you down on the cloth and moves a giant picnic basket over. She takes out various foods from small finger sandwiches to a cake. Soon the cloth was laden with food and you both stare at each other for a bit. You immediately head for the cake but Diana pushes you back, \"no cake until you've had some actual food\" she says. You sigh \"fine\" you say grabbing one of the mini sandwhiches with both hands and starting to eat. \"John do you ever regret being brought here?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never had the time to think about it, but no I don't, I kind of miss my folks but otherwise I really can't complain\" you say. You were sure Diana liked you're answer as she pushed the plate with the cake towards you. You finished you're sandwhich before digging in, you took out a sizeable chunk of the cake before laying back and sighing. Diana smiles down at you before starting to pack up the food, \"that it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope we still have one part\" Diana says. She quickly finishes packing and picks you up in one hand and the basket in the other. She walks down the hill and approaches the lake and as you get closer you find out what you thought was just a brown dot was actually a rowboat. Diana slowly steps into the boat when you get close enough, being careful not to drop you or the basket. You're instincts kick in \"don't worr...I can't row\" you say sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry John i'm fine doing it\" Diana says sitting down putting you down next to her. She starts rowing and you soon reached the center of the lake, Diana lays back over the wooden slats and puts you down on her stomach, you walk up and lay down on her collarbone. \"It looks really pretty\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not as pretty as you though\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cheesy\" Diana says pushing you with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well it's true\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John....do you love me?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you're the most beautiful eevee i've ever seen\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks John\" Diana says, you lay there for a bit just enjoying being near each other. Diana lifts you up and smiles at you before starting to lick you. \"Hey stop that\" you say laughing a bit as her tongue tickled, \"no you're at my mercy\" Diana says licking you for a minute before nestling you into her fur. \"So John how much do you love me?\" Diana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana I love you from the bottom of you're cute paws to the very tips of you're ears\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You big softie\" she says picking you up again \"but I wouldn't have you any other way\" she continues before kissing you. She seems to think for a second before putting you down on her breast, \"hey Diana you missed\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't\" she says gently hugging you into the soft structure, you try to get up but she just pushes you down \"aww don't you want to enjoy them\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but on my terms\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, you don't get terms\" Diana says. She holds you there for a few minutes and you did have to admit it was really soft and comfy, Diana pulls you off and snuggles you back into the space between her breasts. Diana sits up and starts rowing, \"aww does that mean the date's over?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid so, mom said she'd be back in an hour and it's been 55 minutes\" Diana says. You quickly reach shore and Diana you assume picks the basket up and she gets onto shore before walking back to the hill. You heard Juliette's voice, \"did you two have fun?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots, John's just a bit tired\" Diana says. You try to speak up but she quiets you, \"oh well that's ok, so how was you're date?\" Juliette asks as her and Diana walk back to the vehicle. \"Very fun, John's such a little romantic\" Diana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, i'm glad to see you 2 are doing so well\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, why aren't you trying to steal John like all my other boyfriends?\" Diana asks sitting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He already showed me he only has eyes for you\" Juliette replies starting the vehicle, \"besides you deserve someone that nice after everything we've put you through\" Juliette says. You mumbled to yourself the whole car ride back and you tried to get up atleast 10 times but every time Diana just pushed you back down. By the time you got home you were cramped, sore, and very very irritable. \"Well I think we'll just go to bed as we already ate\" Diana says. Diana runs upstairs and pulls you out from her chest when she gets into her room and you....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Diana puts you down on her bed and you turn to her \"Diana why didn't you let me out?\" you ask her trying to stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were really comfy in there\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy, comfy, I told you not 5 minutes before that, that it's uncomfortable, I have to hold onto you to stay up\" you snap. Diana looks down at you shocked, \"sor, sorry\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"no, no you're not, you talked to your mother like I wasn't there, I was right there and you spoke like I was somewhere else\" you shout. Diana actually takes a step back she was so startled. \"I'm sleeping downstairs tonight\" you say climbing down the bed. You walk over to the door and crawl under and as soon as you do, you hear the sound of sniffling coming from behind you. You sigh and head down the stairs which took a few minutes. The girls walked past you without even noticing so when you got downstairs everything was dark, you walked along easier to dodge at your size and you climb up the couch and lay out in the little groove at the top. You lay there for a good hour as you hear muffled sounds every so often from upstairs and you knew it could only be one thing. You finally lay down and your just about to go to sleep when there's a light behind you, you turn to see a bunch of glowing rings and 2 glowing yellow eyes staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Trixie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, me and Diana had a fight is all\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fight, but I saw you 2 come back from your date, you were both beaming\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well Diana didn't exactly listen\" you say. You jolted as Trixie picked you up and looked at you sternly \"you march right up there and say your sorry\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" you reply flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we've stolen countless boyfriends from her, I will not have it so when she's finally happy, you steal that from her\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so only you can steal her happiness\" you reply and she looks at you suprised but undeterred. She puts you down and whispers angrily \"I said march, and so help me Arceus if you don't ,the next time Diana will be crying is at your funeral\" Trixie says her eyes changing from yellow to pure red. You back up and head upstairs as quickly as possible, you slide under the door and walk across the room. You climb up the sheet which seemed to support your weight better and you find Diana curled up on the bed, tear stained quilt clutched to her chest. You slowly walk over and everything about her was tense, even her tail was curled up inside itself. You walked up to her head and sighed \"i'm sorry Diana\" you whisper stroking an ear. \"I made you so sad, all because I was uncomfortable, maybe I should just go\" you say standing up. You were suprised as her paw darted out and pinned you and Diana stood over you, \"don't...don't go\" she sniffles. \"Please John, i'll hold you, and cuddle you, and stroke you and make sure you never suffer again. All I want is for you to pet me, and stroke me, and kiss me, and love me, as I do you, I love you\" she says tears falling from her eyes anew. You look up at her and you start tearing up \"i'm sorry Diana, I made you cry\" you say. She shakes her head and lowers it, \"i'll stop if you promise me you'll stay\" she says. You nod, \"nothing would make me happier, i'm sorry I got so mad\" you say. She smiles down at you and lowers herself covering you, \"that's ok, I was being very inconsiderate of you\" she says. You hug her cheek which was now a bit damp from the tears \"it's ok beautiful\" you say. Diana lifts you up and she sits up and lays back, \"here you go\" she says nestling you in her chest. \"This is your spot, got that, I dont want to see you leave it unless I say so\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah whatcha gonna do to stop me\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess my tail will just have to be lonely\" she says looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, but aren't I already your caretaker?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and you better do a good job\" she says wrapping herself up in her tail. You look up at her and get comfy, \"I love you Diana\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too\" she replies getting comfy. You quickly fell asleep in her warm embrace, you woke up to the sound of a bunch of girls going \"aww.\" You looked up and Diana was tightly curled around you, you're head was just sticking out of her chest and her whole family was looking at you. At the front was a glaceon girl, she seemed quite intent on you and she smiled as she saw you stir. You looked her over and from what you saw like the rest of Diana's family she took very good care of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" she says as you sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Gina\" she says leaning over and offering a hand. You lean over and she accepts your hand and she pulls you forward lodging you in Diana's chest. She turns over and mumbles and Gina laughs, \"sorry, sorry\" she says smiling. Diana stirs again and she lifts you up out of her chest, \"geez how did you get in there?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know, must have somehow ended up there\" you reply. She smiles and licks you \"blech\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you 2 made up?\" Juliettte says eyeing you. You nod and she smiles \"that's good, I was getting a bit worried\" she says leaving you a non too subtle hint. Diana sits up, \"is anyone else hungry, i'm starving\" she says. Karen nods and everyone gets up, you ride on Diana's shoulder and you bury yourself in her hair and fur. \"So how many sisters are left?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think 3, Jenna, Paulie, and Kellie\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So vaporeon, espeon, and leafeon\" you reply. She nods and you lay back, \"well they should be fun\" you say. As you get downstairs you start to smell bacon cooking and Trixie walks up, \"can I borrow him for a second?\" she asks. Diana nods and passes you over, she walks to a corner and smiles down at you, \"so you made up with my sis, I better not see anything like that again\" she says sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Trixie, but you'll keep our little conversation secret right?\" you ask. Trixie nods, \"go get her tiger\" she says walking over putting you back on Diana's shoulder. Diana smiles down at you and licks you again, 'geez stop doing that\" you say. Diana giggles and rubs you against her cheek, \"i'm so glad your not mad at me anymore\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was never mad, it just hurt that you well seemed to ignore me\" you say. Diana licks you again, \"well come on, let's go eat\" she says. She walks into the kitchen and suprisingly there was plates of bacon and eggs at a place for each girl. \"Doesn't that usually take like a lot longer?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when you have a flareon as a daughter\" Juliette replies. She sits down and Diana sits down at her place, she digs right in and you have to tap her on the arm. \"Oh sorry\" she says cutting off part of the food for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you 2 going to do, the other 3 are going to be showing up soon, and they're a lot more agressive\" Karen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look if they're as bad as Jolty was I think i'll be fine\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Jolty says, \"I wasn't that bad was I?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you weren't but you were very agressive\" you reply. Jolty nods and in 15 minutes everyone was done breakfast.</span></div></div>",

Diana smiles down at you \"fine, but we're just having a movie night at home\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey no way, my favourite show is on in like 20 minutes\" Karen protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and there's a show I wanted to watch in a few hours\" Jolty adds in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you 2 I think Diana and her boyfriend deserve atleast one day where they get the last say\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mommmmmm\" Jolty and Karen whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts for the next few hours Diana and John get exclusive use of the living room\" Juliette says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" you say smiling at the espeon. She waves a hand at you and Diana \"just take good care of my daughter\" she says. \"Thanks mom\" Diana says, she picks you up off the table and moves into the living room putting you down on the couch \"just wait here, I'll be back in a few minutes\" she says. You just sat there wondering what she had in mind, you heard the sound of a microwave being turned on and the unmistakable sound of popcorn being popped. Diana comes back after a few more seconds carrying a dvd case and a giant bowl of popcorn which she puts down on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts the DVD in and picks up the bowl putting it down on her chest before motioning for you to come up as well. You slowly start to climb up her body stopping around her stomach \"silly what are you doing down there you'll miss the movie\" she says. 2 fingers gently close on your back and Diana lifts you up to her shoulder laying back against the couch. She puts a popcorn kernel near you \"ready?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I'll ever be\" you reply. She picks up a remote and turns the DVD player on noise blaring in the speakers, you lean up against Diana's neck using her like your own couch you start to pet her cheek. Diana starts to softly growl almost purr as the movie starts.  It quickly becomes evident that this is one of those girly romantic movies and you sigh to yourself, Diana however apparently hears you and she giggles bouncing you up and down for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the movie quietly enduring it, I mean it wasn\u2019t a bad movie but the plot was so predictable you could have said each Pokemon\u2019s line before they even said it. Diana however seemed to be enjoying it so what were you supposed to do? After a good hour or 2 you really weren\u2019t able to keep track of time due to the fact that you didn\u2019t have a watch the movie entered the cliche sad kiss scene where the hero in this case a Raichu going off to war kisses his girl goodbye. Diana starts to sniffle so you gently start to pet her hoping that it\u2019ll keep her from bawling her eyes out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiana don\u2019t worry he\u2019ll make it back\u201d you whisper to her. You however knew that he wasn't going to so you climbed on top of her head and started to scratch her ears hoping the attention would keep her from bawling her eyes out when the news came. As you expected the scene came up in a few minutes and Diana started to sniffle and shake, before she could start all out bawling you slid down her nose grabbing onto the edge, she was so surprised her attention shifted entirely onto you. Diana lifted up a hand which you stepped onto and you gently petted her nose \"Diana everything's ok\" you say, however this was the wrong thing to say as that somehow made her think back to the movie and she started to bawl then hugged you to her cheek. \"Shh shh Diana it's alright\" you say hugging and stroking as much of her cheek as you could. Diana holds her hands out and looks at you \"promise you'll never leave\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise\" you say. She leans forward and kisses you, you return the kiss although all you did was kiss her upper lip, you held that kiss for a good few minutes till you both heard an audible \"awwww\" and Diana jumped a foot in the air. You went flying and thankfully Juliette caught you with her psychic \"aren't you two just precious\" she says gently lowering you back into Diana's waiting hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't scare me like that\" she says before gently petting you \"you're ok right?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little startled, but fine\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you 2 are so cute I could just eat you up\" Karen says, you stare up at the flareon with a dead serious glare, \"I mean....um, sorry bad choice of words\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on John\" Diana says standing up, \"you can have the living room back\" she says walking up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too frisky with him\" Jolty yells up at Diana. Diana sticks her head over a small railing and sticks her tongue out at Jolty before walking into her room, shutting and locking the door and setting you down on the bed. She smiles down at you \"Jolty is right John, we haven't gotten any where past kissing\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and me sleeping in your chest as well as staying as close as I have isn't past kissing?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe it is\" Diana says blushing a bit, you smile up at the giant eevee \"look I'm fine with going as fast with this as you want to, if you don't want to take that step for years and years, well then I'm fine with it\" you say. Your mind however was kicking you in the butt \"what are you saying that for?\" you asked yourself. You shook the thought away as Diana sat down near you and gently picked you up \"thank you John, your so nice\" she says gently cuddling you. You hugged her cheek and she started to lick you, \"hey hey\" you say as she doesn't stop the licking. She finally stops after a few minutes \"John your clothes are all soaked, well you'll just have to take them off\" she says smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I'm fine they'll dry in a few minutes\" you reply. Diana held you up by the edge of your pants so that you literally fell out of them into her waiting palm \"you can either take off the shirt and underwear or I'll take em off for you\" she says smiling. You grumbled to yourself as you removed your clothes but you heard that same section of your mind yell \"helly yes gonna get some.\" You set the clothes down and Diana quickly moved them off to the side and smiled down at you \"see, now your the same as me\" she says. You shiver \"yeah well you have fur, I don't\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your cold, let me fix that\" she says gently hugging you to her chest, she flops backwards onto the bed and starts to gently pet you \"see isn't this nice John?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is\" you say the soft stroking as well as the fact you were surrounded by warmth and soft fur making you feel like you were in heaven. \"Just one problem, aren't I supposed to take care of you?\" you ask. Diana giggles, \"it's a give and take thing\" she says starting to give off that almost purring sound again. You started to fidget as DIana seemed to start to heat up and you heard her breath start to shorten, \"no, why now\" you heard her mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana are you alright?\" you ask. You felt her entire body freeze, she even stopped breathing \"everything's perfectly fine John\" she says. You however don't buy it and try to get up but she holds you down \"no, I can't see you right now\" she says. \"Diana what's wrong?\" you ask freezing as the smell hit you, the only word to describe it was carnal. Diana starts to almost sob \"I, I just started my heat cycle\" she says. You push against her hands again and this time she relents, you jump down onto the bed and walk up to her face and gently start stroking her cheek \"don't worry Diana, I'm here, and if you truly wish to, I promise I'll make your first time special\" you whisper. Diana turns to you....</span></div></div>",

He loves you for who You am! As youI think this you grab some pjs and change in the bathroom. (just for some private time.) You then start to talk to John as you get changed. \"John this was the greatest night of my life,\" I say, \"the only thing you can say that tops this moment is you becoming my boyfriend.\" You then listen but you don't hear anything from your room. Not sure if John said something, and you finished changing, you walk out to the bed. You see John staring at something. You start to think 'What can he be staring at?' You say, \"So John what was your favorite part of tonight?\" You don't get an answer so you grab John and make him star at you as you asked him, \"Were you listening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were angry at her for keeping you in her breast through out the whole car ride home. So you turn away from her and stopped listening to her. You just keep staring the other way you hear her voice. You then see something on her dresser. It looks small, pinkish and human like. You then lose your anger and replace it with wonder. 'Is that another human?!?!' you think to yourself. It's when Diana grabbed you when you stopped focusing on that other Person. She says, \"Were you listening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her and think for a moment. You don't want to tell her that you were ignoring her so you look up and say, \"No I was waiting for you to get changed and I thought I saw something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you and said annoyed, \"What did you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer back, \"I think I saw another human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

Jhon's brother then walked over to Jolty , who look alittle distraunt from being left out of their conversation, and stuck is hand out to her \" the name's Zac\" he said. \" Jolty\" she said back to him giveing him a finger to shake as well. Zac then looked at Jolty and said , \" So since my bro and Diana are with each other I gess I have nowhere to stay.\" Jolty quickly grabs him and says \" You can stay with me.\" Zac looks at her , \" Well that is a kind offer thank you.\" She the quickly runs out of Diana's room and into her's.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    ( did i say POV i ment more like folow Jolty and Zac's story) Zac was suprised at how fast Jolty ran to her room it felt like only seconds befor this girl and her giant rack was in front of him. She was stairing him down in a way he didn't like. His body was shakeing, it felt like he was about to be hunted down like prey. Then jolty's look softened and she said \" Im sorry did I scare you?\" Zac then looks up and says \" Its ok,  it's more your size then how you look\" he pauses \" I don't know why you'ed ever think someone was scared of your looks. Your too beautiful for that.\"  Jolty looks down at him oddly and says \" what are you up too?\" Zac smiles and says \" I heard you were open for a relation ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She then laughs \" I'm sorry but I don't let just any runt be my boyfriend. You have to prove your self\" she said looking down at him. \" Ok how\", Zac responded. \" hmmmmmm\" she began to think \" you're going to have to find my week spot.\" she finaly said. \"Your what?\" Zac asked confused. \" The one spot where if you scrach it i'll just fall over and probably start to yelp. Trust me you'll know when you hit it.\" She aaid as she layed down on her belley. So of corse Zac starts with the belley which only makes her giggle. After awile he gets off her belley and thinks. \" Give up?\" Jolty ask. Zac shakes his head no. \" You're not going to find it\" she teases. \" Gess you'll have a full body run then\" Zac responds in a smooth tone \" i'll find it sooner or later.\" Jolty eyes him and says \" you really want to be my boyfriend that bad? Zac nods. She shrugs and ceeps laying there. Zac then looked at her intire gigantic body Her face, her lips, her neck....... \" wait her neck!\" he thinks to himself. He then asked her to flip over, which she did, and tryed to climer the side of her. Though he ended up climeing her head. He then goes over to her neck, he looks at it for awile, for her neck was a white color instead of yellow like the rest of her body ( they are look it up). He begins to scrach the left aide of it and she instantly beginns to relax and make a releaf niose. Zac then spends about 15 minnets scraching her there befor he stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Jolty smiled at him and said, \" vary good you made it pass the test you can be my boyfriend.\" He smiles at her befor she lowers her head to him and they kiss for a good minet. Zac looked at her , \" so what now\" he asked. \" This\" she sais befor she starts to lick him for a good 10 minnets. After that she yawned. \" Are you tired\" Zac asked. She nodded and said , \" And your going to sleep with me\" He nodded as she took him into her hand and put him close to her face. She was laying on her side. Zac starts to sleep but he opens his eyes and says \" May I sleep betwean your....\" he trails off. Jolty giggles \" Why?\". \" Because I'm afraid your sisters might steal me and if i'm safly put inside there they might not dare do it.\" He says alittle worryed. She laughes \"Sure you little perv\" She then lifts up one  of her massive bolders and lets Zac crawl in. \" hay\" Zac says , \" you still let me\" She roles her eyes bedor droping her breast on him which knocks the wind out of him. \" You ok\" jolty asked worryed. \" Im fine \" zac said \" i didn't expect them to be this heave, or soft...\" Jolty starts lift it up to free him \" I can let you out\" She says. Zac responded\" Nah just don't drop it on me next time. She giggles \" you mean like this\" she giggles as she drops her massive bolder on you. Zac lays there winded again but not minding it. Jolty then pushes on her rack to sqish you , but not enough to break your bones. \" You only had to find my week spot not ceep scraching it, so I have to repay you\" She then lays on her back and massages you betwean her breast for about 20 minets befor she says \" now how was that\" She asked Zac but he was already asleep.

Jolty smiles and waits for him to wake up. It only takes him around a minute to wake up since she can't sit still.  \"Good morning handsome\u201d she says to him. She giggles when he seems a little startled \" thought I was a dream didn't you?\" Zac looks up at her and says, \u201cwell yes, but I\u2019m glad your not.\" She smiles at him \u201cgood that\u2019s what I wanted to hear.\" She then starts to squish him between her breasts, \"you\u2019re lucky because all of this is yours.\" She quickly stops when she hears Zac start to cough. \u201cSorry\" she says a little upset. \u201cNah it's fine, I liked it up to the point where I started to loose some air.\" he said as he smiled at her. He tried to get out from between her breast but it was still too tight for him since she was still laying on her side with her boob on top of him. She moaned at bit at his struggles but still let him out after awhile.  He crawled out and walked up to her face to kiss her. She kisses back and they stayed like that for a good minute before she got up causing Zac to fall over. She looks at him and says \u201cwell I guess I should introduce you to the rest of my family.\" Zac nods and she caries him out of her room and into the kitchen where Juliette, Trixi, and Karen are talking. When Jolty runs in they all look at her, not paying much attention to the fact that she is holding her hands together. \u201cSomething wrong\" Juliette asks. Jolty shakes her head\u201d, did Diana tell you\" she ask .Trixi\u201d tell us what?\" Trixi says confused. Jolty opens up her hands to reveal Zac sitting there in her hand \u201chay\" Zac says as they all stare in amazement. They all look at him until Juliette asks, \u201cso who is this?\" \u201cThis is Zac John's brother\u201d she says proudly\u201d and he has chosen to be with me.\" Karen looks at him disappointed, \u201cthat\u2019s no fair.\" Zac looks at her and says, \" hay first there was only John and now there's me, so maybe even more guys will come.\" This brightens the look on all of their faces. Jolty looks at them and says \u201cHe\u2019s mine so you better not take him from me!\"  Juliette smiles, \" don't worry we learned from John that their quite loyal to there lovers\" as she finished she gave Trixi and Karen a warning look. \u201cThanks mom \u201cJolty says to Juliette. As jolty starts to walk off Trixi makes a grunt noise and jolty looks over at her. Trixi looks at her and says \u201caren\u2019t you going to introduce us to the little guy?\"  She blinks \" oh yeah, sorry heh\" she pauses \u201cZac this is Juliette, trixi, and Karen.\"  Zac looks at them and says \"good morning\" they all respond with there own good mornings before Jolty takes them out of the kitchen and into the living room. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe then lies down on the couch and puts Zac on her belly. \u201cSo do you have any other sisters\" Zac asked. Jolty nodded \" yeah but the only other one here is Anna\" she responds as she starts to make herself comfy. Zac starts to cuddle up to her warm fur and sighs. \u201coh and I like how you said I belong to you\" Zac says not really annoyed but acting like it. \"hm\" is all she can say. \u201cYou know back when you said that I\u2019m yours and told your sisters and mother not to steal me.\"  She looks at him \u201cwell I don't want to loose you\" she says. Zac smiles and hugs as much of her as she can,\" I know, some might think that it's a lack of respect, but I know its cause you love me.\" Jolty smiles before hugging him softly for awhile. Jolty then turns on the T.V. and they watch some random reality T.V. show.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter awhile Juliette comes in, \" Jolty go tell your sister's it's time to eat\" Jolty nods putting Zac on her shoulder and quickly , but taking Zac into consideration, up the stares. She first reaches Anna's room where she quickly looks inside and sees Anna awake but groggy, \u201ctime for breakfast\" jolty says before running off to Dianna\u2019s room. When she opens the door and she sees that Diana is asleep. Jolty smiles before tiptoeing over close to Diana and signaling Zac to be quiet. \u201chay Diana\" she says it quietly slightly shaking her. Diana grunts a bit. Jolty smiles and then yells \"Diana!\" this causes Diana to almost jump out of her fur only to see Zac and jolty laughing at her. Diana quickly looks at John only to see him in the same condition as she was only he was a little sick probably from being jiggled around a lot when she jumped. She looks angrily at jolty \u201cthat wasn't funny\" Jolty smiles and says \" aww c\u2019mon you have to admit that it was a little funny.\" Diana says ,\" well what if john was wrapped in my tail I could have tossed him across the room because of what you\" she is cut off by Zac who said , \" what we did.\" Diana looks at him,\" you mean you let her do that!\" Zac shrugs,\" it's not like I could stop her\" he says before looking at John \u201cYou ok bro?\" John looked pretty annoyed and said \u201cyeah\" before trying to get out from between Diana's breast. Diana helps him out before looking back at Jolty,\" why are you two in here anyways\u201d, she asked. Jolty had stopped grinning by this point,\" oh yeah it's time for breakfast\", she said before heading out of the room with Zac still on her shoulder.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLittle after jolty and Zac sat down Dianna and John came in and sat down. They sat down and Dianna glared at them. Juliette gave jolty a questioning look at Jolty who just smiled. Zac on the other hand walked up to Diana, took a breath, and spoke as clearly as he could, \" Dianna I am sorry for not stopping Jolty from scaring you I know how much pain you would have gone through if we had caused my brother any harm it was a quick not thought trough joke and I am extremely sorry.\" Zac then looks back at Jolty who said,\" yeah sorry for scaring you\" in a more awkward tone. Diana and John look at each other and then Diana says,\" we accept your apology.\" Zac then walks over to Jolty and Juliette seems pleased that things got sorted out. When Zac makes it back over to Jolty everyone starts eating and making small talk. Jolty didn\u2019t give Zac anything so he sat there smiling. Halfway through the meal a lot of her sisters were eyeing her, especially Diana. She then looks up and says \"What?\" As if on queue Diana breaks off a peace and hands it to John who is also looking at Jolty. Jolty then quickly looks at Zac who was just laughing at Jolty now. Jolty gives him a few broken off pieces before she gets a little quiet and eats slower. Jolty spends the rest of breakfast quiet until she\u2019s finished and the walks away. Zac tries to follow her but stops when she does pick him up. He then watches her walk out of the room. Trixi looks at him and says,\" you aren\u2019t going to follow her?\u201d Zac puts his hand behind his head and says,\u201d well I would but I am afraid of heights so.... anyone want help me down?\" Zac looks at Juliette who picks him up and gently sets him on the ground. He nods his thanks to her before running off to get to Jolty. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt takes him about ten minutes to get up the stairs and over to Jolty\u2019s room. Zac then climes her bed grumbling to himself before reaching the top of the bead. He looks over and see's Jolty\u2019s face buried into her pillow. He walks over to her face. He taps Jolty\u2019s face and she looks at him. Zac had his arms crossed and was looking at her as he said,\" And what are you doing in here?\" She gets off the pillow even more and looks at him sniffling,\" what do you mean?\" He looks at her, \u201cThis isn't the Jolty I know.\" Jolty sniffles again, \u201cBut I forgot about you.\" she says starting to get calmer. \u201cYeah once, believe me I understand why you could.\" Jolty looked at him,\" I know your still upset about it.\" Zac laughs,\" yeah but I don't hold it agents you, so what if you forget about me every once and awhile I'll always love you.\" He then hugs Jolty who returns him with a kiss. She then picks him up and lays him on her tummy. Zac Smiles and says \u201cPlease don\u2019t get upset over small things like that ok?\u201d Jolty Smiles and says, \u201cok\u201d before they just laid there silently together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a little bit of a nap Jolty stretches and looks down at Zac who was cuddled into her fur still where she left him. She rubs a finger down his back to wake him up. He moves a little but stopped when he feels Jolty's finger down his back again. Jolty giggles and says, \u201cget up Zac.\" Zac looks at her, \" aw but it feels good\" he said in a playful pouty voice. Jolty then sighs and keeps rubbing his back. After about a minute she stops \u201cok now get up\", she said in a soft but assertive tone. Zac gets up and looks at her waiting for what to do next. Jolty then picks him up with two fingers and brings him to her face. Zac looks at her and says,\" why two fingers?\" Jolty shrugs and says \u201cI just wanted to see how small you are.\" Zac shrugs as Jolty puts him in her hand. \u201cC\u2019mon we're going to take a shower\u201d, Jolty says as she gets off her bed. Zac looks surprised and says,\" wait we?\" Jolty nods and says '\" not to be mean but I\u2019m sure if I left you in there you'd fall down a drain or drown I bet.\" Zac agrees as they leave the room and get into the shower.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Jolty closes the bathroom door behind her she sets Zac down before turning on the shower. She takes of her bra off and sets it on the counter as she waits for the shower to heat up.\" Hay jolty\u201d, Zac asked. Jolty looks at him,\" yes\" she says. Zac pauses a little before saying, \u201chow come you only wear a bra?\" Jolty laughs before saying, \u201cwell I may not need cloths but I do need something to hold these up.\" Zac nods a little embraced from asking. Jolty has an odd gleam in her eye but only says, \"Take your cloths off.\" Zac obeys before hopping into Jolty\u2019s hand as she steps into the shower. Jolty places Zac on the soap dish and smiles down at him \u201cAlready excited before I even start the show\u201d, she laughs. Zac looks down and blushes he covers his crotch area. Jolty giggles and takes shampoo bottle squirting some into her hand and starts to wash herself. Zac stared at her extremely curvy body which only made Jolty prolong her shower by taking longer on her 'feminine' parts. When she was done Zac barely noticed when Jolty picked him up. He only came back to reality when a giant soap bar was being rubbed on his face. Jolty smiled \u201cdid I have you under my spell?\" Zac nodded before the soap bar crossed his face again. Jolty then proceeds to his back and began washing him again. After she was done she looked at Zac and gave him a big lick across his entire body. Zac just laughed as her tongue slid across his body. After a few more licks she turned off the water.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJolty pocks up a towel and dries Zac off first. She then puts him in her cleavage before drying herself off. When she is done she places Zac on something soft, but he didn't really notice as he was looking at Jolty still. She looks at him before smiling and 'accidentally' drops the towel. \u201cops\", is all Jolty said before bending down to pick it up. This gives Zac a perfect view of Jolty's ass as it shakes a bit before she stands back up. She turns around and sets the towel on the counter before moving over to where Zac was. Zac was about to say something but stopped as he saw Jolty\u2019s breast get closer and closer. He sat there a moment before realizing he was on her bra! He tried to crawl over to the side but it was too late he was trapped between a giant leather wall and a giant furry boulder. He tried to move but the bra suddenly got tighter. Zac struggled to move but he couldn't. He heard Jolty moan for a second which really made him mad, but that anger turned into confusion when he heard things being set on the counter.  \u201cShe couldn't have forgotten you in her\u201d, Zac thought hopefully. Zac spent the next 30 minutes hearing moans, brushes, and spraying and he still was hoping she didn't forget about him. When he finally lost all faith in her he felt the bra loosen up. \"Freedom\" he cried on his mind. He saw part of the bra open up and two fingers sliding in to take him out. The two fingers led him up to a blushing yellow face. \u201cSorry\u201d, was all Jolty to him. Zac sighed and said,\" I know you could feel me.\" \u201cyeah well it took a lot of will power to not leave you in there\", Jolty responded bluntly. \"why did you leave me there anyways\", Zac asked.\" well if I let you out it would have ruined the surprise.\" Zac looked at her not buying it \u201csurprise?\" Jolty nodded before placing Zac on the counter and posing for him. Zac looked at her and gasped \u201cYou spiked your neck hair!\" (Like a real Jolteon) Jolty nodded proudly,\" I didn't do it before because I didn't have anyone to impress.\" This sent a grin on Zac face as he looked at her. He practically jumped into Jolty's hand before she even set it down. Jolty brings him up to her face and they kiss. They stay like that before there was a knock on the door and Dianna's face pops through. She takes one look at Jolty's neck before surprise quickly disappears as soon as it appeared. \u201cIt\u2019s time for dinner\", is all she says before walking out. Jolty carries Zac into the kitchen where they are greeted the same way Dianna looked at Jolty. Zac looks over at Jolty who looked a little distressed. During dinner Jolty's siblings, excluding Dianna, seemed extra nice to Zac today which only added to his worry. After Dinner Jolty quickly walked up to her room with Zac in her hands and quickly went to sleep after stuffing Zac between her breasts. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zac waited until he was certain Jolty was asleep before he tried to get out from between Jolt's breast. It was really hard for him to get out considering his small size compared to jolty. It took him a good 10 minutes to squeeze out from between her breast. Once he finally got out he looks at her before walking over to the edge of the bed. He sighs before saying,\" I hate heights.\" he then grabs hold of part of the blanket that was hanging off the bed. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for jolty\" he repeated to himself as he slid down the side of the blanket. Once he reached the bottom he headed towards the door. Once he reached it he slipped under the door and into the hallway. He looked around and headed for the only open door. Once he reached it he saw Juliette lying on her bead broadly. When Zac walks in she apparently notices him and says \" it's about time you got here. I assume your here to ask about why we were all silent at dinner.\" Juliette uses psychic to get Zac onto the bed and Zac nods once she is sets him down. \u201cWell it pretty much started with her first boy friend. Now back then she didn't do much with her mane so when her boyfriend told her he thought she would look pretty the next day she spiked out her mane. That was the day her boyfriend dumped her too, do you can assume she would be upset. This happened a lot with her other boyfriends too. I think she lost a few of them to a habit of that too\", Juliette said looking down at Zac. Zac nodded before saying,\" so your saying she will try to dump me when she wakes up?\" Juliette shakes her head and says,\" oh no she won\u2019t try to dump you she'll get really clumsy tomorrow , a little moody, or a little bossy because that\u2019s how she would probably loose you. Zac nods again and says \u201cok, thanks for telling me.\" They say there goodbyes before Juliette place him on the ground and Zac runs back to Jolty's room. He then climes back up the blanket still scared of heights but determined to make it to Jolty. Once he reaches the top of the bed. He quietly sneaks back between Jolty's breast and falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zac wakes up the next morning he is all alone. He looks around for Jolty but can't find her. After a bit of debating on whether or not to leave Jolty walks into her room and smiles at Zac before saying \u201cI was just spiking my mane again. I need to fix it up every day.\" Zac nods before she picks him up and heads down to the living room. Zac tried to talk to Jolty, but soon changed his mind as Jolty seemed to have almost dropped him 3 times, almost sat on him when she set him down on the couch to watch TV, and forgot him when it was time for breakfast. When Diana reminded Jolty of him she quickly took him to the breakfast table, but then at breakfast she forgot to give him any food (though her sisters gladly shared there food with him) and almost gabbed him with a fork. At the end of dinner Jolty was almost in tears and Zac was getting a little paranoid. Jolty excused them from table early and ran up to her room where she closed the door and set him on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJolty looks at Zac sniffling before saying,\" I'm sorry I'm not cut out to be with you, I might kill you....\" Zac looked at her and said,\" I might have gone along with that if I didn't know you were doing this on purpose. \"Jolty glared at him \u201cYou think I'm what\" she said glaring at him. Zac calmly looked at her and said,\" your mother told me about your former boyfriend problems. You\u2019re doing this on purpose because you\u2019re not used to someone not trying to dump you when you spike your mane up.\" Jolty looks at him, blinks slowly, then sighs before saying,\" your right, I don't want to hurt you I\u2019m just not used to someone not liking me without wanting to have sex.\" Zac smiles and says,\" Well who wouldn't want to have sex with you your beautiful.\" Jolty looks at him caught between embracement and offence. She then laughs before picking him up and giving him a sly smile. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you\u2019re after huh? You want me just for my body then too huh\" she said in a joking but lusty tone. \u201cI never said such a thing I only stated how beautiful you are\", Zac said trying to not look nerves. \u201cOh yeah, I bet all you care about are these\" Jolty then shoves her breast in Zac\u2019s face. Zac only looks at them before he starts to clime one. Jolty gives him a questionable as he climes higher onto her back. Zac climes to the side of her mane and scratches her neck. Jolty then relaxes fully giving a sigh of relief.  He scratches it for a good fifteen minuets before he stops. Jolty smiles and says,\" If you remember that you truly do love me, not my body\" Zac only laughs in <br>\r\nresponse,\" don't get me wrong there are many things I would love to do to you but I won\u2019t because it would make me no better then your old boyfriends.\" he says. Jolty picks him up and brings him to her face and says, \u201cGood.\" She then kisses him almost sucking him into her mouth before letting him go and placing him back on her neck. Zac then spends a good while scratching Jolty\u2019s neck until.</span></div></div>",

Jolty remained silent, shocked and pleasures from her defeat.<br>\r\n\" are you ready my love k give it to me then ?<br>\r\nShe gently smiled and moved a good distance from him to the headboard of the bed<br>\r\n\"Begin\" came her smooth pur<br>\r\nZac was panicking now, he was hoping that she would be worried and make a mistake, no such luck.

She also has a very nice and sexy hourglass figure. Heck, her whole body just makes her look even sexier. She's also bipedal with human like arms and legs with the golden ring around her belly. Arceus just giggles as you continue to look over her. You then take a look at where you are. It seems like you were in a bedroom. Everything in there seemed to match Arceus's color. There was the usual stuff, but what were were wondering about is what were you on. It seems like you were on the bed. It had pure white blankets with some golden patterns all over it. You soon look back up to Arceus with hundreds of questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" You ask looking at the huge female Arceus, trying to look at her face then at her sexy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in the Hall of Origin, or to be precise, my bedroom. High above the Sinnoh region.\" She said is a smooth, calm voice. It calmed you down a bit hoping that she is as nice as she sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I here?\" You continue to ask, because... you don't just wake up in a new world without trying to figure why the heck your doing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been quite lonely for years and years and I needed some company, so i've teleported you from your world into mine.

He, with some strength, forced himself up, and his jaw dropped as he really WAS Face-to-face with Arceus, her giant lips that could crush him or suck him up pursed into a smile, towering above him. \"Arceus, how small am I?!\" he yelled, not sure if his voice would carry. \"You're an inch tall or something, I was never good with shrinking people to exact heights.\" \"This seems like alot smaller then an Inch-oof!\" John was interrupted by a large finger pressing him down into what, after looking around, John would guess would be her breast. \"Lighten up, John!\" the godess said, as if this was completely normal. \"You need to have a little fun, and I'm gonna make you have it!\" John felt the pressure ease up, but it was replaced by pain as Arceus flicked him across the mass of flesh like a bug. He found himself tumbling down her massive boobs, and before long, he got caught in between them. \"Hah!

And you see that the two 'mirrors' you've been staring at are actually two gigantic eyes, with black eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are staring at a huge, green creature that has human features. Totally female, you deduce from her plump breasts. This creature has also elongated arms, with perfectly manicured hand, which are of a light green color, while she has short, dark green legs. Looking at her face, you notice two feelers on her forehead and a big mouth, that is curled up in a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" the creature asks, in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n\"W-who are you? Where am I?\" you finally find the courage to talk.<br>\r\n\"So you can talk after all! And, to answer you, my name is Celebi. And you're in my forest,\" the creature, whose name you learned is Celebi, answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down. You notice that Celebi is actually sitting on a tree branch - a high tree branch - and she's holding you in front of her. <br>\r\n\"W-wait, your forest, what does this mean?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, I guard this forest. You know, make sure no one threatens it, that kind of stuff. Now, tell me a bit about yourself. How did something as tiny and cute as you end up in my forest, alone?\" Celebi asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, tiny?\" <br>\r\n\"Yup, you're as small as my fingers little one. Now, can you answer my question?\"<br>\r\n\"Um, my name is John. And I don't know how I ended up here, shrunk and alone,\" you answer.<br>\r\n\"Well, nice to meet you John. What kind of pokemon are you? I've never seen any species like you.\" Celebi states curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pokemon? No, I'm not, I'm a human. Pokemon don't exist,\" you state, more and more confused.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm pretty real, do you agree? And I thought humans didn't exist. Apparently, you come from another dimension. You somehow got here,\" Celebi explains.<br>\r\n\"And do you know a way to bring me back?\" you hopefully ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Celebi shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but... I really don't know...\" she says. You lower your head.<br>\r\n\"But if it makes you feel better-\" she continues \"You can stay with me as much as you want. I'll take good care of you, promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of deciding, you decide to take the offer. You're alone in an unknown dimensions, so tiny that you could be mistaken for a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your affirmative response, Celebi cheers and hugs you.<br>\r\n\"John?\" she then asks.<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n\"Well...</span></div></div>",

You lay down and enjoy the softness pressing up against you, after a minute you grab one causing her to stop, then you squeeze and this causes her to moan a little. \"oh so you do feel pleasure from something like this\" you say. You massage her breasts for a bit to repay her, she moans for the whole time, after 5 minutes she picks you up and lays you down on her stomach. \"Um....when you called me a nummy wummy you didn't think of eating me did you?\" you ask her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never think of doing something like that, you're too cute to eat\" she says in a hurt kind of tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Serina\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's what that lopunny called you, my name's John by the way.\" you tell her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you John\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too serina, I can say without a doubt you are the best looking gardevoir I ever saw\" you say to her.

She slowly pushes her breasts together so as not to hurt you. \"So John..,do you want to go back to my place?\" she asks looking away a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it's not like I have anywhere else to go\" you reply. Slowly Serina stands up so you fall in her lap and then gently picks you up and places you in her hand. She begins walking and you see a cottage ahead after 10 minutes of walking through forest thankfully without running into anymore pokemon. The cabin standing before you is a typical log cabin with a door in the centre of the front and a window on each side of the door. Serina walks in and you quickly notice just how old-fashioned the cabin is. There is a fireplace on the right side of the cabin with a chair facing it, a stove stands in the far left corner while a bed is a few meters off to the right of it. There is a table and chairs in the centre of the cabin and on the left wall are 3 dressers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not much but it's home\" Serina says breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it looks great, easily big enough for you and me\" you reply. Serina walks over to the bed and slowly lowers her hand to the bed allowing you to jump off. She walks over and grabs a pot, she heads outside and you hear an old water pump before she walks back in and puts the pot on the stove. She walks over and sits next to you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought i'd make you something to eat and drink since I don't know if you have already\" she says. You walk over and hug her and she puts a hand next to you and lifts you up so you're standing on her lap. You lay back and she slowly starts petting you like you're a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Serina I have to ask, why are you treating me so nicely? I mean I hardly know you and vice versa\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do have the ability to sense feeling and you seem like a nice gentle person, it also gets really lonely out her by myself\" she says. Content with her answer you just lay there till you hear a whistle from the pot. Serina gently picks you up and moves you and pours part of whatever is in the pot into a thimble. She also grabs a single oran berry and hands you the thimble while putting the oran berry next to you. She sits down and you begin to drink what you quickly realize is tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great\" you say, you begin eating the oran berry while Serina just sits there content with watching you. After about 5 minutes you finished off the berry drank the last of the tea. Serina takes the thimble from you and places it near the stove. She then gently picks you up and raises you to face level \"John do you want to play a game?\" she asks you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure what game\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we could play hide and seek, however the loser has to do something the winner asks of them.\" Serina replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but on the condition you can't use you're sensing power to find me\" you say trying to tilt the game more in you're favor. Serina agrees and you set the time limit at 30 minutes with her giving you one minute. You quickly think of using the stove as a hiding place, but then a lot of worst case scenarios pop into you're mind, this also rules out the fireplace. You decide to hide in one of the dressers, you somehow open the door enough to fit through and dive into a pile of soft clothing as you hear the door opening. You hear Serina searching for a good while, after what you assume to be 20 minutes she seems a lot more frantic in her search rather then worried. You peek out of the dresser and you see her sit down in the chair looking very sad. \"I hope she didn't think I ran away\" you think to yourself. You wait for the next 10 minutes for the time limit to be up then you get out of the dresser and silently fall to the floor. You walk up to her and poke her leg shocking her because you make no noise with you're weight. She looks down and sees you and her face instantly brightens. She picks you up very hurridley and rubs you against her face. This is when you see a tear roll down her cheek, \"hey her why are you crying me winning isn't that big a deal is it?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" she says wiping the tear away \"I was just afraid that I was going to be left alone here again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina then slowly lowers you until you're in between her breasts, then she applies a little pressure to them causing you to hang there without actually hurting you. You pull yourself up and out after a bit and lay down enjoying the soft feeling underneath you. Serina puts up with this for a bit then gently lowers you into her lap. \"So Serina what should I get you to do?\" you ask her. She looks at you suprised obviously forgetting about the bet. \"Hmm what thing should I have you do\" you say, instantly a few more perverted things cross you're mind causing gardevoir to blush having felt you're emotions. \"I have the perfect idea, since I have no place to stay and you're always lonely how about you let me stay here for as long as I want.\" you say to her. This causes Serina to break out into a huge smile, she lowers her head and kisses you before picking you up and nuzzling you a bit more. After a few hours it gets dark outside and Serina says it's time for bed. \"So where do I sleep?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After how happy you made me today John, you get to sleep with me\" Serina says. She picks you up and lays down on the bed before placing you on her stomach, you sit there for a bit till you ask \"What about pajamas?\" This causes her to lift you up and place you on the bed, she then she rummages through a dresser till she finds what she's looking for and returns with some doll pajams. You quickly put them on while she looks the other way (although you know she peeked at least once) then she lifts you back up onto her belly. You walk up and situate yourself so you're mostly lying on her collarbone with you're legs in between her breasts. She lowers both her hands over top of you and you whisper \"good night\" to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night John\" Serina says \"you've made me so happy i'm never letting you go\" she says. You fall asleep hoping she never will.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up to the sound of a pidgey chirpping...wait a pidgey? you ask yourself as the events of the last day re-enter you're mind. You feel around and soon find out Serina is still holding you tightly. You try to get up but her hands weigh more then you can lift, you notice where you are and wiggle so you're down further and start moving around. This causes Serina to start moaning a bit then she moves first one hand then the other so you can stand up. You then have to think about how you're supposed to wake a giant gardevoir up, looking around you can't see anything to help you, so you decide to wake her up like you'd want to be woken up. You move next to her head and slowly shake her head, \"Serina wake up it's morning,: you say. You try this method for a few minutes with little success finally you decide to try a more direct approach, you stand next to her and leaning over you kiss her on the lips. This actually causes her eyes to flutter for a bit so you continue, slowly her eyes open until she fully spots you and what you're doing. They shoot open as well as she quickly pulls back causing you to be sent sprawling backwards. \"Ouch\" you say \"well that's some way to thank the guy who woke you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh John i'm sorry\" Serina says picking you up and pulling you close, \"it's just you frightened me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can we come up with a way to wake you up without me frightening you\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....actually if you tickle me on my right side I won't move but i'll laugh a lot and that'll wake me up\" Serina says. Hoping to get some revenge you dive off her so you're on her right side and you begin tickling sending her into bursts of laughter. You continue this for 2 minutes then you slowly stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for knocking me over\" you say to her. Serina gently picks you up and kisses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for the tickling\" she says gently smiling before hugging you close to her. Serina lays back down and lays you down in between her breasts, she slowly covers you with one hand and you both just lay there for a while content to be in the others company. She gets up and slowly the red horn in the centre of her chest transforms so its sitting flat underneath her breast. She picks you up and gently places you so you're sitting on the little platform as she gets up and begins her daily chores. You're with her ever step as she cleans and does other chores although you have to kind of hold on/hang off the protrustion when she bends forward. She places you on the table and makes a pot of tea, once again giving you an oran berry while giving herslf a whole basket. You move so you're back is resting against her and she smiles gently at you telling you it was alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Serina what are we going to do today?\" you ask her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kyle I need to do something and I was hoping you could help me with it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with that Serina\" you tell her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok good we'll do it after breakfast\" she says. You finish eating and wait for her to finish. She puts the thimble you used as well as the plate and glass she used in a cupboard you hadn't noticed till now. Serina gently picks you up puts you back on her little platform and grabs something out of a cupboard although you can't see what it is because her breasts are in the way. She walks out the door of the cabin and walks until she reaches a clear pool with a waterfall feeding into it, the sound level was alright where you were although you knew you'd probably go deaf or drown if you got near the falls. You hear Serina giggle behind you and she holds up a mini pair of swimming trunks which you take, and then go change behind a tree. You hear Serina plunge into the water and you run and dive in after her. You see her floating in the centre of the pool, and so you swim up to her. You bob although you always though small things were supposed to sink. She playfully splashes you causing you to splutter, you dive and get behind her but quickly realize that was fruitless as even if you did splash back it wouldn't do much. She slowly walks out of the pool and she comes back carrying something squarish but smelled really good. Serina quickly places you on top of it and you realized it was a bar of soap. She smiles at you and then moves herself to the shallow end of the pool so her front end is only submerged in the water. After she gestures to you, you start rubbing the bar over her slim back and long sexy white legs causing her to sigh in content. She then flips over and allows you to do her front although she moaned and blushed a good bit as you went over her breasts and nether regions. She washes off in the pool and sits next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So was that all you brought me here for?\" you ask her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I wanted you to see this beautiful place and if you and me each got a little \"extra\" out of it that's ok\" Serina replies. Then she smiles that warm gentle smile at you and you just can't stay mad. \"Besides John I know you liked that as much as much as I did, besides what kind of boyfriend likes his girl smelling bad\" she says. This kind of shocks you for a second as you didn't realize she saw you that way already. Serina lifts you up and gently snuggles you against her breast, you just lay there enjoying the warmth and calmness she gave off. You curl up in the little platform she created and she slowly starts rocking back and forth starting to sing a very beautiful tune which you didn't recognize yet soothed you to you're core. You quickly fall asleep and she just sits there staring at you, when she too falls asleep. You wake up and quickly have the bejeesus scared out of you as you swear you saw atleast 1 pair of eyes staring at you from the tree above. You slide down Serina's body and start tickling her to wake her up. \"Hey Serina there's nothing that would find me or you a threat would there\" you say to her. As you say this she instantly wakes up, scoops you, you're pajamas and the bar of soap up and she rushes back to her cabin. When inside she quickly shuts the door behind her and puts you down on the bed. She then slowly lays down but you notice that she is laying in such a way as she is between the door and you. \"Hey Serina are you ok?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not entirely\" she says \"yes there are no things that would try to hurt you but I felt you're fear and what it was about and it sounded like another pokegirl like Trish who was that lopunny before\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so bad about that?\" you ask her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm one of the nicer pokegirls and so was Trish, no pokegirl would ever hurt someone like you although they would use you for their own pleasure\" Serina says. She pulls you right in between her breasts and slowly pushes them together so they surround you and she whispers \"John you are the most wonderful man i've ever met and i'm not letting anyone else have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Serina\" you say causing her to almost hug you with all her might till she remembers you're size and stops. She moves you so she's looking at you mostly face to face, pulls you close and kisses you. It's such a soft, gentle kiss it takes you a second to realize it's happening and you quickly return the kiss. You fall asleep with her holding you tight against her chest protecting you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up to the same pair of eyes you saw in the tree, and freak out pushing yourself backwards and diving behind Serina's head. \"Hello nummy wummy\" you hear from behind, you peak yourself out from behind Serina's head and see that's it's Trish the lopunny. \"How did you get in here and how did you know Serina called me that?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I followed you 2, i'm not going to leave something as cute as you alone\" Trish says. She then moves foward and quickly grabs you from behind Serina's head, you're about to shout for help when Trish covers you're mouth with 1 finger and whispers \"relax i'm not here to hurt you I just want to play a bit\" She then starts running 1 finger down you're back and you hate to admit it but it felt really good, causing you to sigh. \"Oh that feels good does it? Well then you'll love this\" Trish says as she pushes you in between her furry breasts. She starts slowly pushing them together and moving them apart like Serina had done (proves she was spying) and you had to admit it felt heavenly. At this moment however Serina wakes up and she looks down quickly realizing you're not there while Trish stands there stock still. Serina turns around and notices Trish and that you're in between her breasts. Suddenly you feel yourself lifted up and you fly towards Serina. She catches you in one hand, gently kisses you and lowers you onto her transformed horn. She glares at Trish who just stands there sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you have an explanation\" Serina asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I followed you 2 and I saw how happy this little guy has made you and I wanted to have some fun too.\" Trish says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's John by the way\" you yell at trish, she just nods in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm sorry but you can't play with him he's mine\" Serina says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Serina you won't share a man with you're best friend\" Trish replies,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when he's my boyfriend i'm not\" Serina retorts causing Trish to just stare in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's you're WHAT!!!\" Trish yells<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my boyfriend and if you have a problem with that you can leave Trish\" Serina says turning around. You climb up onto Serina's shoulder and see that Trish is nearly in tears after getting a shock like this. You slide down Serina's side, causing her to laugh a bit, land on the floor and walk up to Trish. You gently hug her leg since that's all you could do at that size, She stops crying and stares down at you in disbelief then lowers herself down towards you. She lifts you up and ever so gently like Serina hugs you to her chest. Getting up she hands you back to Serina and heads for the door. \"Trish I guess if you're that lonely you can play with the both of us as long as you only get to play with him under my supervision\" serina says as her friend walks away. Trish turns around and tackles her friend sending you flying. Thankfully you land on the pillow of the bed only getting the wind knocked out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm so sorry\" Trish says as she and Serina rush up to see if you're ok. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm done\" you say \"besides i'd much rather have more giant pokemon who like me rather then hate me\" you say grinning. This causes them both to smile at you and then they both sit next to you, one on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I?\" Trish asks Serina who nods. Trish lays down on the bed and gently picks you up, she lowers you so you're in between her breasts, which you had to admit were a bit bigger then Serina's and she starts squishing them against you. After a few minutes you look at serina and she nods at you knowing you're intentions, you start massaging 1 of Trish's breasts then the other causing her to start moaning but she keeps her hands to her sides. After a few minutes Serina picks you up obviously a bit jealous of you showing her friend this kind of attention, so she lays down and starts breast-massaging you. You lay down as the feeling of security Serina gives off surrounds you and Trish just stares in disbelief at how close you are. You start massaging Serina's breasts after a minutes but she is easily able to control herself enough to gently pet you as you massage her. After a few more minutes you move down and sit in Serina's lap telling her she can get up which she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing Serina, do you really care about him that much already?\" Trish asks her friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do Trish\" Serina replies. This prompts Trish to lay down on her stomach and just stare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis starts to creep you out after a bit so you ask Trish \"what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Serina was always a very shy person, since she can feel emotions she could feel good as well as bad and this made her stay in a kind of bubble, i'm one of her few friends. So how did you in less then half a week turn her into this\" she says, indicating to Serina in the last bit, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I guess it's because when we first met she wanted some company and I needed help so we just kind of clicked\" you reply. You turn to look at Serina who is blushing a bit and she kind of hides herself as you look at her. Trish picks you up with 2 fingers and starts examining you from top to bottom. Sighing she puts you down and then 'accidentally' she lays down on top of you, not causing any harm although you're squished under her breasts. Serina feels you're heart beat quicken and she turns seeing you underneath Trish's cleave she uses Pyshcic on her friend and lifts her off you. Serina just leaves Trish floating there for a bit and she slowly positions and lowers herself so you are surrounded by her breasts with no weight on you. She stays like this for 10 minutes before picking you up and kissing you while letting Trish down. Trish looking annoyed at Serina grabs you and kisses you right in front of her. This causes Serina to and grab you back as she gently lowers you in between her breasts and onto the little platform she had created. To kind of tick Trish off you curl up so that she sees you can sleep right in between Serina's breasts. Trish figures out she is defeated and sarcasticly bows to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have one this round Serina but i'm not gonna give up on John that easily\" she says before walking out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina giggles as she sees her friend leave, you start giggling with her however you both stop as you hear Serina's stomach growl. Blushing she covers her stomach and puts you on the table. \"I'm sorry John, but breakfast is going to take a bit today\" she says to you grabbing things out of cupboards and getting water from the pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Serina take as much time as you need\" you reply. You watch her run around and prepare things for about half an hour. Serina walks up and places a plate in front of you and you're eyes widen as you realize what it is she made. \"Pancakes\" you yell in shock, Serina smiles and sits down in the chair in front of you and you begin eating. After you're both finished Serina stands up and asks you.</span></div></div>",

This causes Serina to blush, obviously she thought you'd go with the garden. She lifts you onto a basket and carries it out to the river. \"I just need you to wash these for me and i'll come back in a half an hour and you can hang them up\" she says walking away. You start sorting through the clothes and this is when you realize 2 things which you had thought for a while. Serina does wear a dress which you kind of confirmed when you saw her legs stick out, but she also wears underwear like a normal girl, and they were all white. You then try to figure out how you're going to clean this stuff, suddenly you notice a rustle in the bushes and out pops Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi John, fancy seeing you here\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Trish, hey could you help me with this\" you say to her. Trish notices what you're watching and she pokes you \"naughty boy\" she says. \"I'm helping Serina with this, now you going to help me or what?\" you ask her. Sighing she grabs an article and starts cleaning it, you're only really able to clean the bottom part of the underwear beacuse it's the smallest part. After about 10 minutes with Trish's help you were about half way done, you notice Trish is looking at you every so often but you don't really mind that much. After 20 minutes is done you sti down on top of the clean clothes and say \"thanks Trish for all the help, Serina will be back in 10 minutes so you can just wait with me till then if you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking you up and placing you on her chest she says \"well if we have some time to kill you might as well do it comfily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait..wait you know i'm Serina's boyfriend, besides didn't you promise not to play with me when she isn't around\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right on both accounts but i'm not trying to play with you\" she says. \"I'm trying to seduce you and make you mine\" Trish whispers towards you. She slowly starts massaging you with her breasts and you try to struggle which just makes her want you more and so she pushes you under her breasts the using her weight although she gives you room to breathe. \"You're never escaping me nummy wummy, i'm going to play with you forever and ever\" she says lowering her head, she licks you then kisses you. You try to struggle however you can't move even an inch and she just giggles at you're struggle. Suddenly her face becomes serious and she asks \"am I really that bad to be with compared to Serina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you say \"no you're not, you're furry, beautiful, comfy, and warm but I have feelings for Serina and I don't want to betray her\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're just so cute\" she says releasing you from her breasts, lifting you up and nuzzling you. Flailing about you grasp onto and scratch one of her ears and she just releases her grip on you causing you to try to grab onto her ear scratching it more, then she just collapses. You look at her and you scratch her ear like you would a dog and a look of pure happiness crosses her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you're ears act as some kind of aphrodisiac\" you say stating the obvious. She turns and looks with you with her big lopunny eyes \"only the inside of my ears\" she whispers prompting you to scratch them and her to lay out in complete joy. Serina shows up at this time quickly walking up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\" she asks you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh trish was just helping me with the laundry and I found a way to keep her under control\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, how?\" she asks you. You shake you're head, \"i'm not telling you unless you tell me another secret about yourself\" you say trying to get her to open up after hearing what Trish sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you she bends down and whispers to you, \"actually that red horn I have when not transformed is really sensitive\" you nod and she lifts you up, you accidentally fall forward grabbing on to the horn as you fall causing her to give a little yelp confirming what she said. She picks you up and glares at you for a bit before kissing you and putting you next to you're ear. Trish by this time is standing next to her friend and thought the yipe had come from you falling, she looks up at you with big pleading eyes, so you sigh and say \"i'm sorry Serina but I told Trish I wouldn't tell anyone.\" Serina looks disappointed but to make up for it you say \"well if you ever need to convince me to do something just let me stay within you're breasts for a bit and pet me, that is heaven\" This causes Serina to smile a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" she asks you and Trish listens in because she wants to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a kind of aversion to chocolate, if you're a good person i'll instantly like you, and if I like you enough which I do both of you even at this size i'm willing to die for you is about all I can think of\" you say. As she hears the last bit Serina snuggles you against her breasts and Trish actually hugs you with one of her ears. Serina grabs the laundry and she lets Trish carry you inside as she goes and hangs the laundry. Trish puts you down on the bed and blows on you a little knocking you backwards. \"Hey\" you say, she just smiles at you and kisses you. Serina walks in and picks you up, for the first time since meeting her she actually opens her dress a bit and puts you square between her breasts on top of that little horn platform. You at this time noticed why you didn't realize she was wearing clothing becasue her dress was so thin it felt the same with the dress on or off,You realized when she had you on the outside sitting on the platform was like sitting on a really thin bean bag chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, do you like being right next to my breasts John\" Serina asks. In response you squeeze one of her breasts causing her to moan a little. Serina pulls you out and places you on the bed and the platform turns back into the her horn. Trish settles up next to you on you're other side, they both stare at you with a weird look in their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Serina can I stay with you and John if I promise not to steal him\" Trish asks.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sure Trish, since you're going to keep showing up anyways, as long as I get most of the time with him\" Serina says. You look at Serina angrily and she just stares back sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so now i'm just some toy am I?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently picking you up Serina looks you square in the eye and starts humming. You are overcome by that same feeling of familiarity, and comfort and you let yourself go limp as she lowers you into her palm then she gently kisses you, \"no you're not a toy, you're very precious to me and you bring me so much happiness, I just want to share that happiness with Trish\" she says. You can do naught but nod as she lowers you gently onto her lap while Trish begins petting you with one her ears. \"This is heaven\" you think, you start falling asleep but Serina gently pushes you keeping you awake. \"You can't go to sleep yet John, I want to know all about you and I think Trish does too\" she says. You sit up and sigh \"alright\" you say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Serina moves you to the center of the bed, she then lays down with her head on her hands off to you're left side and Trish lays down to you're right. \"So John tell us about yourself\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....I used to work a really crappy job and didn't really have a direction in life before coming here, also I hate spicy things they just don't sit well with me and I love reading\" you finish saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a job?\" Trish asks you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second before replying \"A job is where you go to work under someone and you have to do it wether you like it or not and well my job really just sucked\" You must of started giving off some negative feelings becuase Serina leans over and pats you on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok John, you're with us now\" she says continuing to pet you're head as Trish leans over and starts stroking you're back. \"MMM...so what about 2\" you ask them back as you sit there enjoying the treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well obviously I was born a buneary and my parents raised me till I became a lopunny\" Trish says. \"I've always loved small, cute things, like you\" she says slightly poking you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born a ralts and quickly turned into a kirlia\" Serina says. \"After that it took a few years for me to become a gardevoir because I was a bit afriad of the feeling sensing ability but i'm not anymore\" she says the last bit staring at you. \"It's how I noticed that you were near me John otherwise I may have missed you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good then\" you say. You look up and notice that they had slowly gotten closer to you while talking so that they now surrounded you. You just lay back down and smile asking \"so, any other reasons why you decided to keep me around other then being cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that I love you\" Serina says poking you, you nod towards her and then look expectantly at Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish lowers herself so she's looking face to face to you, she then slowly moves towards you and kisses you. \"John I've fallen for you just like Serina\" Trish says she then scoops you up and squeezes you against her breasts \"and you're just so cute\" she squeals. Serina looks angrily at Trish who says \"oops\" and places you back on the bed, you're a bit winded but ok due to how fluffy she is. Serina then looks at you with a longing in her eyes then gently hugs you against her breast, she keeps you there for a good 30 seconds before putting you back down on the bed. Trish and Serina look at you with expectancy in their eyes so you stand up and walk over to Serina. You weren't sure how sensite her horn was so you just started stroking it with one hand while rubbing her chest with the other. She gave off a little moan every so often indicating you were doing at least something right, Trish however gets impatient, reaches over and pulls you close to her. You start gently rubbing the inside of her big fluffy ears and she lies down with a look of pure happiness on her face. Serina looks over and sees this and begins petting Trish's other ear causing her to start moaning. After a minute you stop and Trish jumps on top of Serina and starts rubbing the horn sticking out of her chest to get revenge. Serina begins panting a bit as it gets to her and you just sit back and watch \"I am so glad I was brought here\" you think. Trish stops after a minute and they both turn and stare at you with an almost primal hunger in their eyes. They slowly crawl towards you then both jump forward and you are stuck between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm John it looks like you've been missing the fun\" Trish says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry lover we'll fix that\" Serina says as she uses Psychic to lift you up. She then places you on top of Trish's breasts although you quickly sink down. Trish pushes you to the front of her breasts and Serina moves forward trapping you between the 2 pairs. \"Isn't this nice\" she asks you with a smile on her face, she then leans down and kisses you on the head, trish on the other hand leans down and gives you a big lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arghhhh....Why do you keep doing that?\" you ask Trish<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my little nummy wummy\" she says leaning down again and nuzzling you. They squish their breasts together compacting you a bit but they do it gently so they don't hurt you. They repeat this a few times then they pull their breasts apart and they let you fall. Trish begins pulling you toward her nether regions caught up in the moment but Serina uses Pyschic to pick you up and pull you to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish that's taking it too far\" Serina says hugging you against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Trish asks back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty much using him since he's so small\" Serina says glaring at Trish who looks down regretfully. Serina puts you back down on the bed and you walk over to Trish, climb up onto her lap and start rubbing her big furry tummy. \"Thank you John\" she says as she begins petting you to pay you back. \"Can you still be my nummy wummy?\" she asks you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want to call me that?\" you ask her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just so cute and I like licking you\" she says picking you up and doing so before putting you back down in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you come up with something better?\" you ask her a little annoyed that she keeps licking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come up with a nickname for you too?\" Serina asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with using my name, I mean I don't just call you by you're pokemon names do I\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but it will make you even more cute\" Serina says with that calm smile on her face. You climb off Trish's lap as she says this and just sit in the center of the bed brooding. \"Oh John would it be so bad if I called you little cutie\" she asks you. \"Go ahead, Gardevoir\" you reply although you were still a little angry at Trish and her and this showed in you're emotions and you're tone of voice. As you say this you regret it as you instantly see Serina's eyes mist up and she hides her face in the pillow. You get up and run to her side&gt; \"I'm sorry, Serina I'm sorry\" you say as she is now obviously crying.  She turns away from you and looks in the opposite direction. You climb over her and hold yourself up against her chest. \"Serina, I'm sorry please stop crying, you were just messing around and I shouldn't have gotten angry about it\" you say starting to cry. Trish moves over and hugs her friend, she then plucks you off puts you on the opposite side of the bed and goes back to hugging Serina. You just sit there for a while depressed then curl yourself up, but you can't get to sleep. You just lay there for an hour and a half regretting you're actions. Suddenly you feel yourself picked up and you are pulled forward till Serina is looking at you, and she looks angry which is the first time you had ever seen her like that. She grabs you out of the air, somehwat violently as the wind is knocked out of you and then just stares at you. You look down, as she glares at you then says \"don't be so depressed cutie\" as the smile returns to her face and she leans down and kisses you. Trish looks at you and says \"John we'll call each other by name except when alone like this ok?\" she asks you and you nod at the compromise. They both lay down and get really close together. Serina then sticks you in between their squished breasts and you all quickly fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

Wiggling about for a minute you causing some slight moans you free yourself. You jump onto Serina's right side and begin tickling her causing her to laugh until she opens her eyes. She turns over and yawns, almost squishing you but you dodge \"hey watch it\" you yell at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry John\" she says picking you up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we came up with that wake up method to avoid stuff like this\" you say, \"anyways someone is at the door so can you go get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina places you down next to Trish who by this time is up, Trish smiles at you and pounces on top of you trapping you between her breasts. \"Good morning nummy wummy\" she says giving you a big long lick and then rubbing her cheek against you. \"Grrr\" is all you can do in response to the giant pokegirl as you had accepted her behaviour by now, and it's not like you were in a place to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rydia, what are you doing here\" you hear Serina say from the door. Trish quickly takes you out from between her breasts and places you on the bed then joins Serina at the door. From what you saw of Rydia she was an anthro rapidsh, she stood maybe 5ft 6in only an inch taller then serina and 2 inches shorter then Trish (you get good at judging sizes when you're small). She looked very pretty, like Trish she didn't wear clothes although you couldn't really tell it and the flames sprouting off her accentuated her hourglass shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came to see how you were doing Serina\" Rydia says.\"Oh Trish what are you doing walking up from Serina's bed\" Ridia says, \"does that mean you and Serina are lovers\" Rydia says jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Serina can stop her Trish says \"no Rydia we both have a man who treats us just fine.\" Rydia instantly rushes forward and looks around \"where is he, I can't see him\" Her view passes right over you a few times before settling on you, \"hey Serina there's a bug on you're bed\" she says. \"I'm not a bug\" you yell back, somewhat regretting you're actions as she instantly charges forward and looks down at you intently. \"Hi there little guy, I'm Rydia\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm John\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rydia back off he's ours\" Serina and Trish say at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but he's so cute\" she says picking you up and nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina by this time had walked up next to Rydia and she plucked you out of her grasp. \"I already have to share him with Trish I don't want to share him with anyone else\" she says sticking you in between her breasts, and then crossing her arms so they hold you in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on Serina, let me play with him a bit\" Rydia says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're treating him lika a toy\" Serian says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please\" Ridia says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but you have to ask him first\" Serina says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRydia leans forward so her face takes up you're whole vision and asks \"John can I play with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but Serina and Trish decide if you're taking it too far\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina passes you to Rydia who places you down on the bed and lays down herself. She just stares at you for a while with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm are you going to do anything?\" you say getting kind of creeped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John do you like horses?\" she asks you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah horses are pretty cute\" you say back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wouldn't mind me being around?\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not really\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she gets really close to you, \"so how do I look\" she whispers to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarted you can only stammer out \"you look really good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you\" Rydia says hugging you to her chest. This is when you notice she's about as large as Serina is in the chest area, so she's atleast a c-cup going on D-cup. \"Serina i've decided i'm going to stay with you and John from now on\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second Rydia, I said i'm not sharing him with anyone else\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he said I looked cute\" Rydia replies, as she says this you are lifted away from her and brought back over to Serina through psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it really be that bad if she stayed?\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I wanted to there's no room left with Trish here\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's why I came here\" Rydia says \"I was kicked out for eating all the best food\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou burst out laughting at this, given you're knowledge of how competitive rapidash were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRydia then leads everyone outside and you see a fire red tent sitting next to the house with a little fire pit already created in front of it, you look inside and all that is inside the tent is a sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeaaasseeeee\" Rydia says begging her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Serina says \"fine Rydia you can stay, but no abusing John and he decides if you're taking it too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay I get to stay\" Rydia says grabbing you from Trish and diving into her tent and sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!!\" Serina shouts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just letting John get acquainted to my house she says placing you in her chest, then zipping up the bag so you're stuck there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rydia let him go now\" Trish says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are some how able to wiggle out of Rydia's breasts but you are still stuck in the sleeping bag. You move around so that you fall against her back and you slide down her spine due to her sweat. Instantly you feel yourself moved to the side as she just lays back, \"What happened to you\" Trish says as you hear her trying to unzip the sleeping bag. You reach over and run you're hand over Rydia's back and she instantly goes limp and gives a sigh. By this time Trish had unzipped the sleeping back and she lifted you out. Looking at Rydia she says \"what did you do to her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rub her back, and see what happens\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish does and smiles at the result. \"Hey Serina, Rydia's back is her weak point\" she yells out the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's being mean you 2\" Rydia says getting up slowly. \"You've had a lot more time with him then I have\" she says sitting up and pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine how about we have a party to break the ice\" Serina says, \"besides it'll keep you within our sight\" she says looking at Rydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina goes back into the house, with Trish following and Rydia in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have much choice in this do I\" you say to Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't, you'll probably get another nickname too\" Trish says smiling at you. You sigh as you are brought in, Serina is off to the side preparing food so Trish places you down on the table and then goes to help. Rydia walks up and sits down in front of you \"I'm sorry John\" she says lookng down \"I shouldn't have done that.\" You walk up to her and you say \"fine then I want you to show you're sorry.\" Rydia moves forward and kisses you, you gently kiss her back and say \"there now we're all square.\" This causes her to break out into a smile and hug you. After about half an hour of waiting Serina comes up and says</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"First we're going to eat then we're going to play some games\" Serina says as she and Trish place plates of food on the table. You take you're spot and a plate with small portions of each item is placed in front of you which you begin eating with vigor. You sit back after a bit and ask \"Serina could I please get a drink.\" She stands up prepares some tea before putting it into the thimble and giving it to you. \"Thanks\" you say as you begin to drink, then sit back as everyone else was still eating. After a few minutes they finish and Serina cleans everything up, you are sitting in the middle of the table however as soon as Serina moves away from the table all attention shifts to you. Trish gently picks you up and moves you to Serina's bed. Rydia follows Trish and Serina comes and sits down once she has put everything away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um so what are we doing?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're playing duck,duck, goose and you're it John\" Serina says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok?, I think i'm kind of at a disadvantage given the size difference\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no you're not, the person who you pick gets to do one thing with you, within reason\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a no option for this do I\" you say looking up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't\" Serina says giving off that kind smile. You circle around, following the rules of the game and you pick Serina as the goose. \"Hmm what should I do\" she says \"oh I know.\" gently she picks you up and kisses you before gently squeezing her chest against you. She then puts you back to the ground and you're about to just pick her again when she says \"Oh and John you're not allowed to pick the same girl twice until everyone has had a go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang psychic types\" you think to yourself as you go around and you pick Trish this time and save Rydia for last. \"Yay, come here nummy wummy\" Trish says indicating you need to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call him?\" Rydia asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my little nummy wummy\" Trish says patting you on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish you were only supposed to call him that when we're alone\" Serina says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops\" Trish says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, can I call him something too\" Rydia says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but you can't call him 'little cuite'\" Serina says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't get a say in this?\" you ask, but just get three stares in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I know you'll be my little flame\" Rydia says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" is all you can say in response<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someones just acting up\" she says and then gently blows on you, like she's putting out a candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please come up with something better?\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine how about 'ittle man?\" Rydia says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about just Dear?\" Rydia asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll accept that\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you forgot it was my turn\" Trish says scooping you up. She then places you on top of her breasts and gently starts stroking you. You lay back, very much comfy as and you don't see this but Trish gave off a look like \"ha, game is mine.\" You stretch and fall in between her breasts causing her to give a soft yelp as you get stuck legs up, she pulls her breasts apart and you fall face first into her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok time's up\" Serina says scooping you out and placing you back in the center of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay it's my turn\" Rydia says. She quickly scoops you up and nuzzles you, \"I love you dear\" she says causing you to blush and Serina and Trish to gasp at hearing her say it so quickly, \"We love you too John\" they both shout causing you to smile a bit. However starting with Rydia was where you were going to get some revenge. You wait till she moves you up near her shoulder then jump over, you land on the pillow behind her and quickly run up to her back and begin rubbing. Rydia arches her back as you start rubbing and she sits there, you can hear her breathing getting heavier and heavier. You stop after a minute and she turns and just looks at you. \"Thank you dear\" she says lifting you up and kissing you \"that felt wonderful.\" Rydia then places you back in the center of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn my plan backfired\" you thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok John you can pick someone at you're own will now\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't u guys be it now?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Serina says, \"I'll go first then.\" She scoops you up and then gently kisses you before dropping you inside her dress. \"I'll just let you explore around in there for a bit\" Serina says giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cry foul\" Trish says, \"we can't see what's happening, you could be doing something weird with you're psychic powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Serina says as she fishes you out, she then places you in her lap ang gently starts stroking you're back. You can't help but sigh as her slim fingers travel down you're back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Trish says \"time's up Serina\" you are then moved to the center of the bed again and Trish picks you up this time. \"If you thought what Serina did was nice you'll love what i'm going to do\" Trish says. You somewhat gasp as after saying that she wraps you up in her ears and then hugs you to her chest. You've never felt anything so soft and warm in you're life. You quickly try to snuggle into her ears as much as possible quickly leaving only you're head sticking out. \"I'm soft aren't I\" Trish whispers to you, all you can do is nod in response as you try to surround yourself in the warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes Rydia says \"It's my turn Trish\" and you had to admit you were a little sad to be released from the warmth. As if reading you're mind Rydia says \"don't worry dear, i'll make sure you're nice and warm\" she says gently hugging you to her chest. She then slowly becomes warmer and warmer till it's almost like you're surrounded by a giant perfectly set temperature. Rydia then sends small hot yet not unbearably so pulses of heat from her so that they wash over you and all you can do is sigh in contentment. Rydia for her part just smiles down at you and she gently pats you're head with one finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again after a few minutes serina says \"time's up\" and you are placed back on the center of the bed however at this point you're so content you just curl yourself up and pretty much fall asleep. Serina gently pokes you and says \"hey you can't go to sleep yet we have to come up with sleeping arrangments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" is all you can say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you going to sleep with tonight?\" Serina asked. You didn't want to betray Trish and Serina but after how comfy that was you wanted to sleep with Rydia. Serina sensed this because she said \"fine do as you wish\" and turned away. You turn to Rydia and ask since Serina obviously knew what you were thinking \"could I sleep with you.\" Rydia instantly gives a squeal of joy and picks you up and runs back to her tent. Diving into her sleeping bag Rydia says \"don't worry dear you'll get that treatment from me all night\" as she zips the bag up but leaves enough room for you to have air. Rydia then places you on her chest and begins radiating heat like she had before and you had to admit it took maybe 10 seconds for you to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

You crawl out form between her breasts and out the little space she had left in the sleeping bag for you to get air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rydia get up\" you say pushing her head and then stretch again. \"Geez why is everyone I know a heavy sleeper\" you think before diving back into the sleeping bag. You get under Rydia's back and begin rubbing, she arches upward and you keep rubbing until you hear her start breathing very heavily. Thinking she must be up by this time you stop and have you're thought confirmed as she doesn't fall on you. You crawl out from under her and out the sleeping bag. Suddenly you're pulled backwards and Rydia kisses you and nuzzles against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Kyle, that was the best wake up call i've ever had\" she says nuzzling you some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing but we should really go in and have some breakfast\" you say. Rydia pulls herself up and stretches before picking you up and heading towards Serina's house. You both enter the cabin, Trish just stares at you somewhat angrily from the table. Rydia places you down on the table and then sits down herself as Serina comes up with plates of food. She places a plate of bacon and eggs in front of Rydia and Trish, and for you....a plate of crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Serina what's this?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's breakfast John\" she says sitting down and beginning to eat herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you mad about last night?\" you ask her, you get silence as a response. Getting up you walk over to her and say \"I don't care about the food but I don't want the silent treatment from you.\" Serina says nothing and looks away as if in thought. \"Come on, was what I did really that bad?\" you ask, turning to Trish who looks away and Rydia just shrugs. \"Fine\" you say, you jump down onto Serina's lap and then crawl down the side of the chair and begin walking across the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John where are you going\" Rydia says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving, you 2 can follow me if you want but there's no point staying here if Serina hates me now\" you're voice starts breaking as you say the last bit and tears begin streaming down you're face but you don't dare turn back. You look down to hide you're face and you keep you're mouth shut because even though you're small the room is deathly quiet. You make it to the edge of the door before you turn around, the sight in front of you nearly makes you stop but you keep walking. You make it about 10 feet away from the house before you realize that you're not moving anywhere. \"Great I can't bring myself to leave\" you think, turning you're head you see a tree, and think \"might as well live here since i'm not leaving\" You start climbing and make it up to the first branch, you look down and see Serina standing there staring up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John what are you doing in that tree?\" she asks you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm living here from now on\" you say turning around and climbing higher up the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need to live in that tree\" Serina asks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want me anymore and I can't leave since I care about you too much\" you yell back, not meaning to say the last bit you start climbing again but the bark comes loose and you find yourself falling. You don't even scream as you fall, all you can think is \"oh well, she probably won't even cry once i'm gone.\" Suddenly you feel yourself stop falling, you open you're eyes and see the blue sky, \"why aren't I dead\" you think. You feel yourself land on something soft and you turn to see Serina staring at you, tears are streaming down her face as she looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" she yells, hugging you as tightly as possible to her chest as she can, \"i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry\" she keeps saying it over and over as she looks at you. Finally after a minute she stops for a second to lean down and gently kiss you before pushing you back against her bosom. You just let her cry it all out, you notice Trish and Rydia watching from the doorway and they respect Serina and give her the time she needs. Finally after about 5 minutes you get kind of sick of hearing the one you care about cry and say \"Serina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets brings her face forward so she's only a small distance away from you and says \"yes John?\" You lean forward and kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ever do that again ok?\" you say. Serina breaks out into a smile as you say this and she kisses you with all her might pushing you back into her palm. \"Are you still hungry?\" Serina asks you. As she asks this you're stomach gurgles and she giggles and smiles again. \"There's the Serina I know and love\" you say causing her to blush and head back to the cabin. Serina walks in and places you down on the table and returns with a full size plate of bacon and eggs. \"Serina I don't think I can eat all that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I worked very hard putting all my love into this meal now you're going to eat until you explode\" Serina replies smiling at you. Trish and Rydia are watching you 2 from the door and at this comment they both burst out laughing. Serina begins cutting up the bacon and eggs and feeding them to you. You eat about a fifth of the plate before you feel like anymore and you're going to be sick. Serina nods and finishes off the rest of the food herself, Trish and Rydia by this time had moved to the chairs nearest both of you and were staring intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you 2 done making up or do we have to watch more of this soap opera\" Trish says. Serina turns and glares at her before you say \"Yeah we're back to normal.\" You then walk up to Serina and give her a big hug and she gives you a gentle squeeze. \"Come here nummy wummy\" Trish says grabbing you and giving you a big long lick. \"You're not allowed to cause anymore trouble or else\" she says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what?\" you reply, Trish then licks you a bunch of times and says \"or i'm never gonna stop licking you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine I give\" you say, she puts you back down on the table and you sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really glad you 2 made up\" Rydia says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....John can I have you do me a favor\" Rydia asks picking you up and carrying you over to the bed and laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you say \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an itch on my back I can't get at so can you scratch it for me\" she says. Smiling you begin scratching her back, \"Lower...right...up\" she says so that you're situated right on her spine. You begin scratching the place she led you to with vigor and she just sprawls out and gives a giant sigh of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I have an itch too\" Serina says lifting you up with psychic and pulling you in between her breasts. \"You know what to do\" she says, you nod and begin rubbing the horn sticking out of her chest causing her to moan and squeeze you into her. \"I love you John\" she says before passing you over to Trish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you nummy wummy\" she says before holding you against her ears so that you can rub the inside, her foot starts tapping as you do so and she has a look of pure joy on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish puts you down on the bed and they all surround you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Serina can we all go out and have a picnic or something to celebrate us all making up?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" she says</span></div></div>",

Serina goes off and starts rummaging around producing a basket, a blanket and random foodstuffs. She then begins preparing a bunch of different dishes while Rydia and Trish stare at you. Suddenly Trish grabs you and starts licking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask staring at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm punishing you\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you already did that?\" you ask still being licked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was for causing trouble to Serina, this is for me.\" she says giving you one really long lick and setting you back on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"blech well I have to agree that was a punishment\" you say turning and smiling at Trish. This comment makes her glare back kind of angrily at you but before she can do anything about it Rydia picks you up and nuzzles you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for my punishment\" Rydia says smiling at you. She then places you behind her and says \"you have to give me a back rub as punishment.\" You begin rubbing her back and she sits straight up and starts sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what about this is a punishment\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not really a punishment per say\" she says arching her back as you hit a sweet spot. After a minute you stop and she turns around, \"now it's time for the real punishment\" she says flopping herself down on top of you trapping you in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey got off me\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear you know I can't do that until you've been properly punished\" Rydia says smiling at you, she begins slowly pushing her breasts together till you give a shout telling her she's hurting you then she pushes them apart. She repeats this about 10 times before pushing herself off you. \"Dear I only did that because I love you\" she says picking you up and kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure whatever\" you say laying down in the middle of the bed after she puts you down. You lay there kind of broody until you feel a slim finger run down the length of you're spine. You look up and see Serina staring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go John\" she says, you nod and she picks you up. \"So I heard the others talking about punishing you for what happened\" Sabrina says looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already said i'm sorry geez not like it also affected me or anything\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh John but you haven't been punished by me yet\" Serina says, she then places you in her dress and crosses her arms trapping you in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't much of a punishment\" you yell out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you rather it was worse?\" you hear Serina reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think to yourself for a second and yell out \"no this is fine.\" You feel Serina start moving, indicating they had started walking, you're \"punishment\" wasn't really that bad so you just wait to reach the meadow Trish was talking about. After maybe 10 minutes of walking and bouncing you feel Serina stop and she reaches into her dress and pulls you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you think of you're punishment\" she asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never make you cry again\" you state solemnly \"although as punishments go it wasn't that bad\" you say smiling. Serina just smiles down at you and places you and the basket she was carrying on the ground. Trish and Rydia walk up besides the basket and sit down, you're left to you're own devices while Serina sets up the picnic spot but it's a meadow so what are you gonna do. You lay back in the grass almost concealing yourself but then decide against doing that after Trish almost steps on you. You walk up next to Rydia who by now is just sitting on the grass waiting like you were and you climb up into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I owe the honor\" Rydia says staring down at you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason\" you say sittting down and laying back against Rydia's stomach, She starts petting you with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meadow's really beautiful\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is, just makes all you're cares and worries go away\" Rydia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey stop being philisophical you 2 and come eat\" Trish yells. Rydia picks you up and brings you over to the blanket Serina set up and sets you down. Sitting in front of you are plates filled with different types of food. A lot of it was cut up fruit because it was easy to carry and you assumed they were all mostly vegetarian but there were a few different types of sandwiches scattered about. You start heading towards the watermelon when a bunch of strawberry pieces are placed in front of you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The watermelon is for later\" Serina says smiling at you. You turn and begin digging into the strawberry in front of you. Suddenly Trish picks up the piece you're digging into and stares at it hungrily, not liking the look in her eyes you let go and land back on the blanket without any injury thanks to the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about\" you yell at Trish who is now looking at you with that same look. Suddenly she jumps at you and you just dodge. You run towards Serina and dive so that you're hiding under her crossed legs. \"What the hell is wrong with her?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back nummy wummy\" Trish says, \"I just want to lick you.\" Trusting her you step out from behind Serina who by this time has a shadow ball pointed at her friends face. She bends down and licks you across you're whole body. She then steps back and goes back to eating, although she's now eating you're strawberries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Trish and ask \"What in all holiness was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" she replies bowing her head, \"it's just I wanted to lick you really badly and well if you hadn't jumped off that piece of strawberry I might have done something bad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as you realize what she might have done, you sigh however and say \"Trish if you think like that I might not get near you, do you want that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you with pleading eyes \"no I don't want that, I love you nummy wummy\" she says picking you up and hugging you to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too Trish\" you say causing her to put you at arm's length and stare at you for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what about me?\" Rydia yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you as well Rydia\" you yell back, although you had to say it twice because she was too far away the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Serina is standing next to Trish and looking down at you \"what about me John?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish passes you over to Serina and you look up at her.\"Of course I love you Serina, you were the first pokemon I met and you're so kind\" you say. After saying this she snuggles you up against her chest while running one finger down you're spine. She holds you like that for a few minutes when a voice says \"Oh hi Serina\" she turns around and standing there is a....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Serina turns around and you see a dragonair girls standing in front of her, Serina had to look up a bit so the dragonair girl was maybe 5ft 9in. She had a slim figure like Serina which contrasted her large E-cup breasts. Her lower half was a pair of long slim legs out of her, there was a long tail sticking out from her behind that was topped with the little blue ball they have at the end in pokemon form. Serina quickly hides you behind her and says \"Tina what are you doing here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just checking out the field when I noticed you and Trish and decided to come say hi\" Tina says, \"oh and who's the rapidash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Rydia, she's staying at my place because she was kicked out of her home\" Serina replies. Tina walks around Serina to go say hi to Rydia but she turns to say something and notices Serina holding something in her hands, namely you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Serina what are you holding?\" Tina asks. Quickly Serina brings her hands to her front and pushes you up against her chest trying to conceal you. \"I'm not holding anything\" she replies. \"I saw something moving in you're hand what is it?\" Tina asks getting close to her friend. Suddenly Serina bursts off running, Tina however being taller and more athletically built quickly catches up and tackles her friend, Serina holds you tight though so you don't go flying. Trish and Rydia run up, worried about what's happening and wether you'er ok. \"Let me see what you have?\" Tina says pulling her friends fingers apart. \"Nooo\" Serina says trying in vain to hold her hands together to hide you. Finally Tina pulls her hands apart and gasps as she sees you. You were still squished against Serina's chest and as you hear the gasp you turn around and stare up at the dragonair girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" is all you say with a smile on you're face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?.....Who is?....How?\" Tina blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina lifts herself up and holds you in her palm. \"Tina this is John, John this is Tina\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you\" you say giving a little bow. Suddenly you're snatched up by her and in a move reminiscent of Trish she hugs you into her chest. \"You're sooo CUTE\" she squeals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick him he tastes good too\" Trish says getting an angry glance from Serina. This prompted Tina to do just that and say \"wow tasty in more then one way\" before you are lifted out of her reach and fly back to Serina. \"Tina I need you to settle down\" Serina says placing you on her shoulder where you sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds Tina calms down and asks \"so what exactly is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day I was walking along in the forest and John actually appeared right in my hand\" Serina says \"Trish saw him and after awhile decided to stay with me and then Rydia showed up and decided to stay too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind a fourth guest?\" Tina asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do actually, I already have to share my little cutie with the other 2\" serina says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No calling me little cutie in public \" you whisper into Serina's ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Serina\" Tina says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No and I mean it\" Serina says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but he's so cute and I wouldn't hurt him\" she says. She then turns and looks directly at you \"please John, you just look so cute I want to hug you forever and ever\" You begin thinking it wouldn't be so bad to let her join you. Serina picks up on you're thoughts and sighs saying \"you can join on the condition you can pass a test\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure what's the test\" Tina says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to feed him\" is all Serina says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well that's not so bad\" Tina replies as you walk back towards the picnic spot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to feed it to him mouth to mouth\" Serina says as you all sit down on the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait a minute\" you say. Serina gently picks you up and whispers into you're ear \"Tina is a very shy person there's no way she'll be able to do it.\" You nod as Serina puts you down and this is when you notice Tina's face is glowing a shade of pink which becomes deep red when she realizes you're looking at her. You walk forwards and sit cross-legged in front of her, waiting for her to start. She picks up a cherry and holds it between her teeth, she lowers herself till she's pretty much face to face with you and you just lean forward and take a bite out of the cherry. You eat the whole thing and she lifts her head up. Serina then hands her a seedless grape which she has to hold directly between her lips since there is no stem.  You eat straight through the center of the grap and then being eating the edges. Everytime you're lips touch hers she gives a little shudder. Finally Serina hands her a glass of lemonade and says \"this is the last phase if you can do this you pass.\" Tina drinks some of the lemonade and leans forward to kiss you. She picks you up and you lean forward and she kisses you as you drink as quickly as possible. Once all the lemonade is gone she continues kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina you passed\" Serina says but she still doesn't let go and you by this time are feeling pretty woozy as you aren't getting a lot of air. Suddenly she breaks off the kiss and you step back and take in as large a breath as you can. \"Sorry about that\" Tina says \"If I get too embarassed I kind of lose all inhibition\" she says putting you down and turning away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok\" you say, \"at least you let me go\" you walk up to Serina who has Trish and Rydia seated next to her. \"She passed?\" you ask and Serina just nods \"ok well then where is she going to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's room in my tent\" Rydia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Rydia that should work\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish picks you up this time and places you on her breasts. she then covers you with one ear. Trish walks over to Tina while Serina and Rydia pack up the picnic stuff. \"Come on Tina you're gonna be staying with us from now on\" Trish says offering the girl a hand. Tina takes it and looks down at you snuggled against Trish under her ear. You look up to see a sly smile on her face as you are quickly yet gently yanked out from under the warmth by Tina's tail. \"You're travelling with me for a while\" Tina says holding you up in front of her face then placing you on her chest with you're back against the blue ball hanging from the collar thing on her neck. You always wondered what this ball was for so you lean up and gently stroke the thing. Instantly she gives a little cry of pleasure \"wow aphrodisiac that was the last thing I thought that would be\" you think. Trish stares angrily at Tina but lets you stay there. Tina and Trish walk over to Serina and Rydia and they all start heading back to Serina's house. Tina rubs you're stomach with one finger the whole time you walk back getting angry glances from the other 3. You make it back with no trouble and Rydia takes you from Tina so that...</span></div></div>",

Tina places you down on the floor of the tent and says \"so tour guide show me around.\" \"There's not much in here other then Rydia's sleeping bad and I guess we have to get you one so there really isn't much here other then 2 (in the future) sleeping bags\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well can you show me the sleeping bag?' she asks with a look of actual curiosity on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.....well I think you can find that out for yourself\" you say heading back towards the tent flap but Tina stops you with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a request John\" she says staring sternly at you. You don't do anything for a few seconds so she gets impatient and quickly yet carefully picks you up and moves over ot the sleeping bag herself. She buries you between her breasts and dives into the sleeping bag zipping it up after herself trapping you. You at this time are quite peeved because you knew Tina wasn't a bad person but she was definitley overstepping some boundaries. \"Hey Tina you're going too far\" you yell at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you and says \"Oh i'm sorry John\" she says before squishing her breasts lightly together compacting you. \"I guess you haven't realized my true beauty yet but you will\" she says running a slim finger down you're back while she holds her breasts together trapping you with one arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina you're overstepping some boundaries\" you say to her getting visibly irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm sorry cutie\" she says leaning down and kissing you \"I just can't help myself around you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to wiggle out and you say \"you're going to regret doing that Tina\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and how so, John you aren't exactly...in..a..place..to\" she trails off as you latch yourself onto the blue orb situated under her neck. \"Hey John let go of that it's very sensitive\" she says. \"Oh really?\" you say running a finger down the orb and causing her to give out a small cry of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John don't it's...sensitive\" she says giving out another small cry at the end as you run another finger down it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to let me go or am I going to have to continue?\" you ask her. She bows her head and unzips the sleeping bag flap. You walk out and she grabs you and hugs you to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry John\" she says and you feel something wet hit you're head. You turn around and see that she's crying, \"oh come on what I did wasn't that bad\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's just i've probably left a terrible impression on you, you probably hate me\" she says falling to her knees and dropping you on the tent floor as more tears flow out and she covers her face with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a bad person Tina you just let yourself get caught up in you're emotions\" you say but the dragonair girl continues to cry. You walk up and lift yourself up onto one of her legs then walk it's length so you're next to her stomach. You hug her and this is when Rydia, Trish and Serina finally get into the tent. They take one look at you and Tina and go back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Tina stop crying I don't hate you\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really\" she says through sniffles \"but I..I..I\" she can't finish the sentence as she fights back more tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina lower you're head and look to me face to face\" you say, she does so and you walk up and kiss her. Her eyes widen in shock and she quickly sits back up and just stares down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" you ask. She then quickly picks you up and kisses you with all her strength. \"Thank you, thank you, thank you\" she says rubbing you against her cheek and then kissing you some more. After maybe half a minute of this she stands up and walks out of the tent with you in hand. Serina and Trish half smile half glare at Tina as she walks out of the tent but she bows forward and presents you to both of them with her arms forward. \"I tried to do something I shouldn't have in there and i'm sorry\" she says keeping her head down. Tina and Trish's frowns slowly turn to smiles and they say \"we forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to commemorate you joining us you get to give Kyle a nickname\" Rydia says. You stare angrily at her but she then says \"the taken names are little cutie, nummy wummy, and dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who calls him nummy wummy?\" Tina asks bursting into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I think he's an adorable nummy wummy\" Trish says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you'll be my little hero\" Tina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok now that's actually a pretty good one\" you say \"I accept\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a bunch of glares from the other 3 however you hear a rustling in the bushes and....</span></div></div>",

You hear the girls startled cries as suddenly everything goes black, you can hear the thump of the heartbeat as the pokegirl runs. You try to break free and she pins you against her making it so you can't move. You are about to bite her when you realize you're on top of her breast and stop yourself. After maybe 5 minutes of running the pokegirl slows down to a walk. She unpins you and holds you up with 2 fingers she starts waving with her other hand at 2 other pokegirls in the distance. As you are held there you notice you're kidnapper is a pachirisu, and as the other 2 girls get closer you notice one to be a milotic and one to be a chikorita. The pachirisu was maybe an A-cup but she had a really slim body due to all the running and her fur crackled every so often with electricity. The milotic had an hourglass figure which helped to show off her rather large chest, you had to admit she looked really beautiful. The chikorita girl would be mostly seen as average, she had a c-cup chest and she wasn't really skinny or fat but you were fascinated by how the light reflected off her skin making her seem to shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow he does exist, good work Cindy\" the milotic says to the pachirisu. \"Thanks Amanda\" Cindy says, she turns to the chokirta and says \"hey Chia isn't he just so cute.\" The chikorita nods in return and you say \"um....excuse me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can talk!!\" Cindy exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can, now just let me go and i'll be heading back now\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back where?\" Amanda asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he was with Serina's group before but you'll like it a lot better with us\" Cindy says smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I won't now let me go\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it seems our little guest is cranky\" Amanda says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no i'm all peaches and cream you just FUCKING KIDNAPPED ME!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well someone's being very rude to their benefactors, you have to have a time-out\" Amanda says plucking you from between Cindy's fingers and putting you into her chest. The thing is unlike the others she didn't try to hold her weight back so it was really hot and cramped in there. \"You'll get out in a few minutes\" Amanda says crossing her arms trying to seal you in. However you had already had this happen to you a few times and Amanda's chest was a bit bigger then the other's. You're able to slip out and grab onto her leg as you begin falling. You quickly slide to the ground and start running back towards where you assume the pachiru girl had come from. Suddenly you feel yourself wrapped up in a vine whip as you're brought back to the chikorita. \"Sorry, but you're just so cute so we can't have you leave\" Chia says looking away a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go\" you yell trying to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....please don't make this harder then it has to be\" she says gently lowering you into her palms. \"So what's you're name little guy?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't tell kidnappers my name\" you say turning around. She pushes against you're back with one finger, \"we're not kidnappers\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and why not, you took me from those who cared about me, sounds like kidnapping to me\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugs you to her chest and says \"i'm sorry little guy but soon you'll come to love us just as much,\" you had to admit the sheer sincerity in her voice did calm you down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's John\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you John, I'm Chia and this is Amanda and Cindy\" Chia says indicating to each of her friends as she says their name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah nice to meet you now let me go, because there's going to be 2 endings to this, I'm back with the others or i'm gone period\" you state with a stern look on you're face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we reallly that bad\" Cindy says with tears welling up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not in fact if we had met differently we probably could have been really good friends\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh who cares what the \"toy\" say\" Amanda says reaching past her friend and lifting you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amanda he's not a toy, he'll never like us if you treat him that way\" Cindy says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care how he views me as long as he brings me what I want\" she says smiling. Bringing you up close to her face she says \"Hear that, you're just my toy and you're going to make sure i'm well pleasured\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah not happening....BITCH\" you say winding up and punching her in the eye. She obviously drops you but Cindy dives and catches you. \"Wow you have guts John\" she says before hugging you to her chest and moving back a few metres from her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him back to me Cindy, i'll make sure he never disobeys me again, and if he does i'll break him\" Amanda yells obviosuly pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't treating him right Amanda he was in his rights, the plan was to get him to like us and then anything else was supposed to be extra remember\" Chia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You naive girls I used that as a ploy to have you help me kidnap him, when I show Serina that I have her man and i'm using him as my toy she'll regret what she did\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did Serina do?\" you yell at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She stole my crown from me and even though I look a lot better she was always more popular.\" Amanda yells shooting a water gun at Cindy who dodges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy runs over near Chia and says \"i'm sorry we got you involved in this John\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, i'll forgive you both as long as you get us the heck out of here and get me back where I belong\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy nods at you and turns to Chia saying \"come on we're getting out of here.\" She then starts running with you once again held against her chest and Chia runs behind her with Amanda running after shooting water guns after you.</span></div></div>",

She keeps running for a minute and quickly reaches the door and pounds on it. Trish opens the door, Cindy and Chia barge in and you yell \"Close the door\" she quickly shuts it with a water gun hitting the door soon after. \"John you're back\" Serina yells running up to Cindy and scooping you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hey Serina do you know of a milotic called Amanda?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she was always competing against me in high school, although I never understood why\" Serina replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well she tried to kidnap me, I got her pissed and she's outside the door right now\" you reply. You see Serina's face change and she places you on her shoulder. She then walks toward the door and opens it and calmly walks outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you finally decided to come out Serina that's good now you just have to watch me do what I wish with him and i'll leave\" Amanda says. You look up and you see something behind Serina's eyes, she looks mad, different then when she was mad at you, this was a fiery anger that would rest on no less then the sheer elimanation of the one the anger is pointed against. Amanda looks proud of herself but her look quickly turns to shock as she is lifted up by Serina's psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just say?\" Serina says actually growling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I..said nothing\" she replies quickly becoming scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were going to make me watch as you did what you wished with him\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I think just this will scare her enough to not try anything again\" you say trying to calm Serina down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to you and says \"It's ok John as soon as she's gone everything will be ok.\" You see Amanda lifted up into the air and now she's visibly scared, shaking and trying to plead with Serina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serina stop this, you made you're point so stop already\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I don't eliminate her now she'll just come back and try to hurt you again\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what happens to me,\" you yell \"but I couldn't deal with you hurting someone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you and slowly the fire in her eyes softens and she hugs you close to her while Amanda descends to the ground. \"Amanda i'm not going to hurt you, so just leave\" Serina says. Amanda turns around and walks off, Serina walks inside where Trish and Rydia had been questioning Chia and Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRydia turns around as Serina enters and says \"they admit to their part in the kidnapping, but they did protect John\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry\" they both say with their heads bowed, \"we'll just leave so you can forget about us\" Chia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you 2 going?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just wander for a bit, we were staying at Amanda's place but I don't think we'll be welcome there anymore\" Cindy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina sighs and says \"Well I guess there's room in Rydia's tent, and I could lend you some sleeping bags\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy and Chia both break out into giant smiles and they jump up and hug Serina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much\" Chia says. Suddenly you feel yourself whisked off Serina's shoulder as Cindy hugs you in her big fluffy tail. \"John I promise you won't regret this\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my decision\" you say. She just hugs you tighter into her tail until you're pulled out by a vine whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll make sure to help as much as we can\" Chia says lifting you up to face level and smiling. Serina taps her on the shoulder and you're handed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope these are the last few houseguests\" Serina whispers to you, \"I don't know if there's anywhere we can have some 'alone' time\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well the more the merrier\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok girls, since you're joining us there's something you should know\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no, no\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone gets to give John a nickname\" Serina says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just had to tell them didn't you\" you say, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be my little spark or just sparky\" Cindy says wrapping her tail around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be my little flower\" Chia says smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk well now that that's sorted out</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mood in Serina's cabin quickly lightens as she and Trish prepare food and drink and Rydia gets everyone else set up in her tent. You however are just left on the bed to watch and you watch the preparations with a lot of excitement. Finally after maybe 30 minutes the table is adorned with food and drink and Rydia, Chia, and Cindy re-enter the house. You however are still on the bed and they actually seem to have forgotten you as they begin eating. You wait a minute thinking it's a joke but then you realize it isn't a joke and that they really have forgotten about you. You walk up to the side of the bed, slide down the sheet and slowly walk over the floor. You walk up to Trish and poke her leg but get no response, so you walk over to Serina and try the same thing again getting the same reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting fed up you start to climb Serina's leg and she notices you, a look of pure shock crosses her face as she realizes she had forgotten you, you are then quickly scooped up and she places you beside her plate. \"Sorry John\" she says, looking down a bit sullenly. You grab a berry off her plate and go sit more near the center of the table. This is when the others notice you and like Serina they hold their heads down. Serina gets up and fills a thimble with juice before placing it near you, you get about halfway though you're berry when you decide to look around and all of the girls even Chia and Cindy who just showed up look really sad that they forgot about you. Sighing you put you're half-eaten berry down and you walk up to Serina, you tap her on the arm and she moves it a bit, you walk up and give her a hug, you do the same with each of the other girls and instantly the mood lightens. Chia grabs you off the table with her tail and she squeezes you against her. Trish and Rydia start talking and after being let back on the table and being hugged by Chia you go and sit next to Serina. She cuts off small pieces of her food and feeds them to you. After all the food and drink is gone you lay back against Serina's chest content, she scoops you up and carries you over to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls follow Serina however you just get comfortable as Serina sets you down on the bed. You are quickly poked to keep you awake, you look up and their all smiling down at you. \"We're sorry\" Trish says, \"what for forgetting about me?\" you ask. Trish nods and you sigh, \"I forgive you all\" you say smiling. \"Ok so should we do this like last time?\" Trish asks. \"Sure\" Rydia replies, \"What happened last time?\" Chia asks, \"Well it's like duck duck goose but the person John picks gets to do one thing within reason with him\" Trish says. So you walk around and pick Serina first. She gently lifts you up and snuggles you in between her breasts then gently pushes them together a few times. She then lifts you up and gently gives you a kiss before placing you back down on the bed. You pick Trish next and like the first time she picks you up and surrounds you with her ears. This time however she holds you into her chest and curls around you so that you're entirely surrounded by warmth, you snuggle yourself in peeving Serina off a bit in the process. Trish holds you like this for a bit before letting you fall a small bit landing unhurt back on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRydia is the next one to be chosen and she changes things up, she has you rub her back for a few seconds before quickly scooping you up and nuzzling you for a while. After that however she does the same thing as before holding you up to her body and slowly raising the heat around you till it feels like you're surrounded by a giant furry electric blanket. She then sends pulses of heat over you that start to lull you to sleep but she pokes you after 10 seconds to keep you awake. She gently places you back on the bed and you choose Cindy as the next goose. Cindy picks you up and curls her tail around you, \"you just look so cute John\" she says giving you a kiss before curling up around herself with her tail holding you right in the center. She gently gives off a discharge of electricity that makes you all tingly for a bit before she gently starts stroking you're back with one finger. You for you're part just take what she dishes out, after half a minute she uncurls her tail letting you drop on the bed, she gives you another kiss before pushing you back to the center. Tina is next up and she quickly picky you up with her tail, \"you're all mine for right now cutie\" she says giving you a kiss. \"Yeah but remember I know you're weakness\" you reply, this seems to pacify some of the mischief in her eyes and she gently places you down on her chest her tail then starts stroking you as she actually starts singing. You were kind of entranced by the song so Serina had to tap Tina on the shoulder to tell her that time was up. Tina then gently picks you up with her tail and places you back on the bed. Chia is the final goose and you can see her eyes actually light up with excitement as you pick her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly picks you up and asks \"ready to have some fun John?\" You nod and she quickly squeezes you against her chest, she starts running one long finger down you're back she starts using grasswhistle making her give off a very soothing and calming tune. After a bit she places you down on the bed and lays down next to you laying the leaf on her head on top of you. \"You should feel honored I did that John\" she says \"a chokoritta will only lay her leaf on the one she likes\" she continues. She continues to stroke you for a little bit longer before getting up and pushing you back to the center of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well John now even though it isn't night yet, I think you should make you're sleeping arrangments\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around for a bit, but you remember what happened last time so you say \"alright Serina, i'll sleep with you and Trish today and Rydia, Chia, Tina and Cidy tommorrow ok?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina nods but Cindy pouts a bit saying \"why can't he sleep with us today, I want to curl up around my little sparky\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't you feel even better tomorrow then\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well since we still have time let's do something else\" Tina says.</span></div></div>",

The other girls turn towards you with smiles on their faces and they all quickly agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say John should go first\" Trish says, \"so John truth or dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have a girlfriend before coming here and if you did how far did you get?\" Trish asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow right for the jugular\" you thought, \"I actually didn't have a girlfriend back home, I was kind of a loser\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth or dare Trish\" you reply putting her on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth\" she says suprising you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you honestly think of me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are just a small human.....but you're also my cute little nummy wummy and I love you to death\" Trish says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied you nod and turn to Tina, \"Truth or dare John\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth\" you reply, you see that Tina was hoping you'd pick dare so you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which of us do you think is the most beautiful?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it over for a second and say \"I think every one of you is beautiful in some way more then the others so you're all the most beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's actually a little stunned by you're answer so you ask \"Truth or dare Tina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare\" she quickly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok you're dare is to like Trish express you're true feelings right here and now\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John the instant I saw you, I knew I wanted you, you would be my most prized treasure and I would take care of you forever and ever\" Tina says blushing as she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to do that with all of us?\" Serina asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you turn to Serina, \"truth or dare John?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare\" you say thinking Serina couldn't come up with anything good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly regret thinking that as you see a smile creep across her face and she says \"You're dare is to lick some honey off my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks over and grabs a pot of honey, she sticks a finger in and smears a big over her stomach. She lays down next to you and asks \"well do you accept the dare?\" In response you  walk up and begin licking her stomach, Serina instantly bursts into laughter and she continues laughing as long as you licked. It was actually kind of dangerous as she almsot hit you at full force a couple of times. After licking up all the honey you stare at Serina and say \"truth or dare\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell everyone what you were feeling when you first met me\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I felt the kindness coming off you and you just suddenly appeared in my palm, I think I feel for you the moment I met you\" Serina says grabbing a pillow and hiding behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and turn to Cindy, \"Truth or dare\" she asks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks for a second before saying \"you're dare is to come get snuggled on my tail.\" You smile at the simplicity of the dare and quikcly get curled up on Cindy's tails, she gently parts her tail so you fall into it and are surrounded by it. \"So truth or dare?\" you ask Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you go against Amanda and help me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what Amanda what amanda was doing wasn't right, besides you're a lot cuter then Amanda and I already don't regret what I did\" Cindy says reaching down and lightly stroking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and get up off Cindy's tail and walk up in front of Rydia \"Truth or dare John\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dare is to survive the hell fire guantlet\" Rydia says scooping you up and walking outside. She lays down in a patch of dirt and instantly along random spots of her body flame pops up. The others follow to watch what happens. Rydia places you on the ground and you slowly just walk over her body avoiding the fire however at the very end she coves her whole neck with fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rydia what are you doing, you're going to hurt him\" Trish yells. You turn to the others and shake you're head. You walk forward and pass through the flames unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try but not gonna work on me, a rapidash's flames won't hurt those it cares about\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A man has to have a few secrets, and that answered my question so we only have one pokemon left\" you say jumping off Rydia's chest she stands up and you walk over to Chia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth or dare John\" she asks you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever felt any urges about us?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stunned this time and you actually stand there dumbfounded for a few seconds before recovering. You think for a few seconds before saying \"I would be lying if I said I never had thought of doing that, but i'm not acting on those urges because I feel it's not necesscary and becasue even if we did I couldn't be the father of you're children.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChia and the others nod and so you ask \"Truth or dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you honestly beleive it's necesscary for me to act on those urges, oh and this question is aimed at everybody not just Chia\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all look at each other and collectively say \"NO\" the next few minutes are them giving multiple reasons as to why you're perfectly fine without having sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looks up at the sky and notices it's getting darker. \"I think it's about time for bed\" you say. The others nod and Tina, Cindy, Chia, and Rydia head for the tent while Trish scoops you up and head back into the cabin. Trish carries you over to the bed and she puts you down, Serina passes you you're pajamas and they both turn around all though you knew by now they atleast sneaked 1 peek. Both of them lay down on the bed, one on either side of you. Trish and Serina pull themselves so close that they're surrounding you. Trish wraps her ears around you and Serina gently lays a hand over top of you and she starts singing a lullaby. You start drifting off to sleep and you hear Trish and Serina whisper \"good night John,\" \"good night you 2\" you reply before fully drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in the middle of the night from a horrible dream, all the pokemon you had met, just left and you were still living in the cabin but you were all alone. Then Amanda showed up and started tormenting you, you cried out and woke up in a cold sweat and you see Serina looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John what's wrong?\" she asks in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just had a horrible dream, you all left me and then I was tormented\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John even if we left you we would come back I promise, besides we're with you right now so don't ever fear\" Serina says, she then leans down and kisses you and snuggles up against you so you're still under Trish' ears but Serina hugs you close to her chest and gently starts humming and you fall asleep to her heartbeat.</span></div></div>",

Instantly they all gather around her and stare down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to help\" they say in unison, waking Serina up, since she sits up and you see her rub the sleep out of her eyes. She turns to Trish and says \"you find out about last night?\" her and the others nod and Rydia asks \"what was the nightmare exactly?\" \"It came down to all of us leaving him all alone\" she says, you actually see the shock and dismay on each of their faces. You're then scooped out of Trish's ears and placed in the centre of a ring of pokegirls. Collectively they hug you and instantly any fear or thought of that nightmare as well as the nightmare itself disappeared from you're mind. The circle breaks up after a few seconds as you had completely broken down, Chia starts freaking out \"oh geez, why the dream really that bad, did we just make it worse\" she says. You hold a hand up and she stops freaking out \"These are tears of joy\" you say \"I've never been loved by anyone other then family this much before and I just want to say I love each of you just as much\" you continue as the tears start to dry up. You're then passed from girl to girl and they each give you a hug that lasts about 5 minutes. Finally you're placed back into the center of the bed and you all hear an audible gurgle come from Rydia, \"Sorry I guess i'm hungry\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, I think some food will do us some good right now\" you say. Serina and Trish stand up and go over to the pantry and stove and start fixing up breakfast. You look up and you see Tina staring down at you, her tail gently wraps around you and she lifts you up to face level, she just stares at you for a few seconds before gently squeezing you with her tail and tickling you're face with her tongue. You're then passed over to Chia who plops you down in her chest and squeezes her chest together so that it surrounds you. \"as long as I can do this i'll always take care of you\" she says. You're passed over to Cindy who instantly has her tail curled around you and she actually throws you upward with it and catches you. \"Just remember we'll always be here to catch you when you fall\" she says giving you a little kiss. \"Can we just go with a metaphor next time\" you say sitting up. \"I liked my way better\" she replies with a smile on her face. Finally you're passed over to Rydia who holds you close to her and she starts radiating heat, the thing is she covers the part where you are with flame, \"Oh let me guess this represents the you're fiery love\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now be quiet and enjoy it\" Rydia says flaring up in heat for a second causing you to jump. She places you back down on the bed however you don't stay there for long as you feel yourself lifted up by Psychic and you float behind Trish and Serina as they set plates of food down on the table. You are set down in front of Serina's place as she sits down and leans forward trapping you between her chest and the plate. \"What are you doing?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making sure you can't get away\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why in the name of everything good in the world would I want to leave\" you say. Serina then gently leans down and gives you a kiss, \"that's the right answer\" she says smiling. You smile back and for the next few minutes the table is silent as everyone eats, you eat you're alloted portion of serina meal and just lay back against her once you're finished. As soon as everyone is done eating you stand up and say \"I've known some of you longer then others, but all of you have taken care of me and opened you're hearts to me, and all I can say is thank you\" you say before sitting back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey stop getting so sentimental on us, you aren't going anywhere for a long time\" Trish says smiling. Everyone else nods in agreement and you get a little squeeze from Serina. After the plates have been cleaned Serina is sitting in her chair by the fireplace with you on her lap when Tina walks up and says to everyone in the mood \"no offense guys but this place feels a little dreary let's all go play somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright well where should we go?\" Rydia asks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the forest clearing?\" Trish suggests. Everyone shouts their enthusiasm and soon you're off with Serina carrying a small basket of food one arm and you in her other hand. You quickly reach the clearing and Serina sets up a blanket. You lay down but are quickly surrounded, \"Come on John we want to play\" Chia says grabbing you with a vine whip. However you're grabbed out by Cindy and she scampers up a tree with you held in her tail. She stops on the highest branch and hides in the leaves. \"Well John looks like it's just you and me\" she says smiling at you. She nuzzles you for a bit and places you down on her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey isn't this kind of hogging?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is, but I really don't mind\" she says giggling, \"besides I can carry you in my tail all I want\" she says. You feel gravity leave you and you fly out of the trees. Cindy jumps out after you and grabs you out of the air. She starts glowing as well and you both float down to the ground. \"Cindy no hogging John\" Serina says as you land on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mom\" she replies sticking her tongue out at Serina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there anything we can do together?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could just take a walk through the wood\" Trish says. She scoops you up and you just start walking around, you see a waterfall, a river, and a number of other clearings but actually you don't see any other pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how come we haven't seen any other pokemon?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well pokemon here are very spread out, the fact you've met so many different varieties is actually really suprising\" Tina says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, so why are all of you so close together?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all like the forest, it's peaceful and supposed to be large enough so you don't run into any other pokemon\" Chia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm glad you all chose to live in the forest\" you say. You walk back to the clearing and have a snack which was just a few oran berries. They were pretty much a meal for you though, you spent the next hour playing tag, thing is it was more like capture the flag with you as the flag. You were passed around so many times in that hour you thought you were gonna be sick a couple of times. You're about to leave the forest when suddenly</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group walks out into the small clearing between the forest and Serina's house and as you approach Serina's house you see a bunch of figures standing near Rydia's tent. The group quickens pace and as you get closer you see it's a group of about 10 rapidash and ponyta pokegirls. Instantly Trish holds her hands to her chest and covers you with her ears, there's a little place where the ears meet because they're in a v-shape that you stick you're head out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina runs up and says \"who are you? and why are you here?\" The rest of the group quickly catches up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the rapidash turn as a whole and a ponyta walks up to Serina and says \"we're looking for my big sis Rydia.\" Rydia walks forward and the little ponyta runs up and hugs her. You smile for a bit before Rydia says \"Jane what are you and the rest doing here, go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but we came to bring you back\" Jane says and you see tears welling up in her eyes. Rydia just turns around and the ponyta girl starts crying. \"Aww Rydia you made her cry\" you yell and instantly regret it as not only does the ponyta girl stop crying but all of them are now staring at Trish. You quickly hide yourself cursing you're actions and you just lay there. You stick you're head out a tiny bit and you see that they have converged around Trish, the largest rapidash of the group steps out and says \"Hello Trish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mrs.Flametail\" Trish replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to see you all doing well, so what was that voice we heard\" Mrs.Flametail says cutting to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just me, my voice cracks when I yell really loud\" Trish replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and why are you holding you're chest then dear\" Mrs.Flametail says walking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing...\"Trish says before turning around and making a break for it. Being a bunny she heads for Serina's cabin and jumps landing on the roof. The Rapidash surround the house and just stare up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just show us what you're hiding dear and we'll leave\" Mrs.Flametail says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you're just going to try to steal it\" Trish says, you were a little offended being called an it but you know why she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think prolonging it will just make it worse\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but they're not getting you as long as I live\" Trish whispers back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you trust me, jump back down and let me down on the ground, I can handle this\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish makes an amazing jump landing near the others who had convereged as a group, the rapidash and ponyta run up and Trish slowly lets go of her chest and places you down on the grass. You motion to Rydia to come over and she scoops you up and walks forward, \"this is the reason I haven't come home, his name is John\" Rydia says. The group lets out a collective gasp and then Jane runs up and says \"he's so cute\". She makes a motion to her sister to pass you down to her and Rydia just raises you above her head, \"no way pipsqueak he's too fragile for someone like you to be near him.\" You feel yourself lifted out of Rydia's palm and you float over to Serina, Cindy and Tina stand on either side of her acting as bodyguards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you saw why i'm not coming back, go home\" Rydia says to the herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can we let you keep something so cute to yourself\" Mrs.Flametail says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't keep him to myself I have to share him with the others, besides he's happy with us\" Rydia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest a contest to see how this goes, if we win we get to atleast play with him a bit, if you win we'll leave\" Mrs.Flametail says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We control everything, just go away mom, I know you've been lonely ever since Dad died but stealing him won't fill the hole\" Rydia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what's this, the cabin is made of wood, oh and what are we a herd of fire pokemon\" Mrs.Flametail says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BITCH\" you yell, Serina walks up and says \"John chooses to be with us, Mrs.Flametail please leave I don't want this to get ugly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't have to be dear, Rydia just has to beat me in a race and we'll leave\" she says smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, Mrs.Flametail was it?\" you say standing on the edge of Serina's palm she lowers her face and says \"yes dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you are causing us a lot of problems, please just go away, no offense but if Rydia thought you could be trusted near me we would have met on much better terms.\" you say. You're pushed back by a snort of warm air and she whispers \"you either race or we burn the house down and once we win i'm going to have so much fun with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting pissed you yell \"Rydia take the challenge and take this bitch down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRydia nods and says \"fine we accept what's the course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be a sheer test of speed so from here to that tree\" Mrs.flametail says indicating a lone tree on the edge of the forest. In a moment the 2 were at the starting point and the race began, you saw Rydia trail behind for a second as Serina yelled \"start\" but she quickly caught up and overtook her mother reaching the tree first. The herd starts walking away as soon as Rydia wins and you had to admit you felt kind of bad for Rydia's little sister since she didn't seem so bad. Rydia runs up and you jump over to her giving her a hug \"great running\" you say, \"thanks\" she replies. \"So why is you're mom such a bitch?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's not normally it's just ever since Dad died she fixates on any man she sees\" Rydia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she was going to burn Serina's cabin down or if she won had some \"fun\" with me in air quotes\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then it's a good thing I won isn't it\" Rydia replies smiling. The others run up and hug Rydia and you go inside the cabin, when you get in Serina places you down on the floor and you notice that the door of the closet you had hid in was open. You look inside and see something cream colored sitting there curled up, you call Tina over since she was closest and she opens the door fully. Sitting in the closet was Rydia's little sister Jane, she slowly gets up and you can feel the daggers coming off Rydia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane what are you doing here?\" Rydia yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to see John\" she says looking down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww don't be so hard on her, she doesn't seem so bad\" you say. You're scooped up by the girl and hugged against her face way too tightly \"aww you're so cute\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just let you eat you're words for a bit John\" Rydia says smiling. The young ponyta girl proceeds to try to pet you, almost sit on you and generally be a young annoying girl. Finally Tina whips her tail around you and pulls you away from the little girl right as the door to the cabin bursts open. Standing there is Mrs.Flametail, she quietly walks in, grabs her daughter and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch\" is all you say rubbing you're slightly bruised limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you she was rough\" Rydia says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time I am definitley listening\" you say, Tina hugs you to her chest and tries to stroke you're back but you give out a cry causing her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" you say \"i'm not really feeling all that good after that\" you continue. Chia and Cindy walk up with giant smiles on their faces, \"we were going to save this as a suprise but since you could probably use it now we'll tell you\" Chia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's a small mountain range near here and one day me and Cindy were just out exploring and we found something\" Chia continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please just say it\" you say being a bit tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found.....Hot springs\" Chia says. Instantly you spring up and say \"Let's go then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone else fine with that?\" Cindy asks. They all nod, and you set off although Serina grabs a few towels out of a cupboard before you leave.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cindy picks you up and you leave for the hotsprings, she leads the group for about 10 minutes till you reach the mountain range she was talking about. Cindy holds you close to her as she starts walking up a small path and within 2 minutes the air becomes more moist and warmer. She rounds a turn in the rock and sitting right in front of you are the hot springs. Cindy lowers her hand to the ground as the others round the bend, Tina lets out a small gasp as the hot springs were gigantic filling a large crater and a bunch of smaller ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Serina do you have anything like a pair of swimming trunks?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No John I don't, guess you're gonna have to skinny dip\" Serina says with a large smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fine\" you say starting to undress, although you move further away as Tina, Cindy, and Chia were staring at you. You walk behind a rock and strip placing you're clothes on the ground you run and dive into the water. You sigh as you're head exits the water and Trish slips into the water near you and gives off a sigh. The other girls enter the water each giving off a sigh as they immerse themsleves in the warm water. You lazily swim around trying to hide as much of yourself as possible however Trish simply dives and swims underneath you. She surfaces and giggles a bit \"you're so small\" she says between giggles. For some reason this comment really depressed you so you stop swimming, close you're eyes and let you're weight carry you under the water. You feel yourself lifted up and you open you're eyes and you're on Trish's palm with her looking down at you. \"I'm sorry about the comment John don't be depressed\" she says hugging you. \"It's ok Trish, just can you keep comments like that to yourself next time\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright John, but you do remember I like small cute things?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do Trish\" you stand up and dive off her hand into the water and start swimming again. You see a shape quickly move through the water and Tina pops up in front of you. \"These springs are great, they take the stress right out of you\" she says laying back in the water giving you a full view of her body. You blush and just keep swimming but she pops up quickly in front of you so you run into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well aren't we bold\" Tina says smiling, she lays down in the water and indicates for you to climb onto her back. You do so and she says \"hold on tight.\" Diving under the water she starts well flowing through it like a dragon would. She completes a lap around the edge of the spring and then stands up letting you fall back into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now you're trying to get a peek at the rest of me you little perv\" Tina says jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well, i've never seen such a beautiful dragonair\" you reply causing her to blush. Chia cannonballs into the spring pushing you under with her wave but she pulls you out of the water and close to her with a vine whip. \"Aww well aren't you cute with no clothes on\" Chia says giggling. She hugs you close to her chest and slowly let's her body fall into the spring till she's mostly sitting down but you're still above the water. \"This is just heaven\" she says sitting there \"good friends, soaking in a hotspring and a cute little man all for me\" she continues smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I am no pet\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine my little flower, but you're not getting away from me\" Chia says smiling. You resign yourself to you're fate and turn around and lay back. You had to admit it felt really good being surrounded by the warmth of the hot spring as well as the warmth Chia was giving off. You lay like this for a while till you feel something fall over you're back. You look behind you and Chia had fallen asleep from the warmth of the spring, you feel the same feeling on you're front this time and look around. You notice Cindy's tail sticking out of the water and that it was hitting you before it hits you again. Suddenly the rest of her pops out of the spring and she looks down at you \"having fun?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am actually, what can't get you're tail wet?\" you ask as it still hadn't touched the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no I can't it's where all my electricity is stored\" Cindy says, she sits down with her tail on the rock and sighs \"wish I could though my tail always feels kind of lonely not being able to swim with the rest of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then why don't I keep it company\" you say, you get out of the spring and Cindy grabs a towel which she hands to you, you dry off quickly and gently tap her tail with you're foot. You're not electrocuted so you lay down and get comfy while Cindy splashes her feet in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks John, my tail feels a lot less lonely\" she says giggling. \"No problem\" you reply, you look around and everyone was just sitting around enjoying the spring. You didn't notice Serina however and you just turn to look behind her and she's staring at you at close range. \"Ahhh\" you yell and jump back a bit startled, she giggles and says \"you're pretty cute like that John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that\" you say, Serina laughs out loud this time and Cindy turns around and notices her. You feel Cindy's tail wrap around you and Serina says \"aw come on Cindy everyone's gotten some time with him but me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's with me right now Serina come back in 10 minutes\" Cindy replies. Serina gets up and walks off and Cindy leans over and gives you a hug. You lay back against her tail and Cindy lays down facing you, she gently strokes you with a finger and you had to admit the combination of the warmth of the spring as well as the comfort of her stroking and tail were quickly lulling you to sleep. You stay awake however and Serina shows up after you assume the 10 minutes saying \"ok cindy it's been 10 minutes let me have some time with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Cindy says picking you up off her tail and passing you to Serina. Serina walks into the spring and her horn transforms into that small platform she places you on top of it before submerging herself. She lays back and you're weight holds you on the platform, the water covers you up to you're neck so you just sit back and relax. Cindy reaches over and strokes you're back and you give off a sigh, \"Chia was so right, this is the good life\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you're enjoying it, we should come here atleast once a week\" Cindy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be excellent\" you say standing up. You all laze around the hot springs for a few hours not doing much. You went from from sunning on Cindy's tail to having mini races with Tina and Rydia to just laying in the spring with Trish, Chia and Serina. Finally as the sun is setting you pack up and head back to Serina's cabin, Serina had picked you up and started walking into the cabin when Rydia taps her on the shoulder. \"Where do you think you're going with John?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bed of course\" Serina replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John gets to sleep with us tonight rememebr?\" Rydia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerina looks down glumly before saying \"don't do anything too bad with him ok? i'm trusting you on this.\" She hands you over to Rydia who nods and heads into the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls follow into the tent and Rydia says \"ok well since John had a nightmare last night we should stay close to him any objections?\" No one objected and they quickly surround you. They set up the sleeping bags in a square around you, each girl covered you gently with one hand while you used Cindy's tail as a matress. You had to admit it felt really very safe and you quickly fell asleep. They all quickly fall asleep and you just lay there for a bit worried that you'll have another nightmare. Finally you fall asleep and you had the same nightmare. You wake up and figure out you really need to get this sorted out. You fall back asleep quickly becuase of the feeling of safety and you figure that you need to confront whatever was causing these nightmares.</span></div></div>",

You notice Tina stirring and she slowly stretches, she looks over at you and you see a frown spread across her face. She reaches over and gently picks you up off Cindy's tail and lovingly hugs you into her chest, \"I'm sorry we couldn't help John\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" you ask feigning ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had that dream again didn't you, you're eyes are all red\" Tina says. She snuggles you further in and whispers \"John i'm sorry if my teasing bothers you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina it's ok\" you say as you lay you're head forward and say \"thanks for noticing though, i'm gonna need each of you to help me beat this.\" Tina nods and puts you back down on Cindy's tail, she then starts shaking each of the others girls awake. They all start awakening with Rydia mumbling something about just getting to the good part. They all turn towards you and within seconds you're in the middle of a 3-way hug, after a minute they let go and you just sit back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John are you ok? it's not us is it?\" Cindy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not you, I think meeting Amanda made me realize just how powerless I am and that it's you're kindness that's saved me\" you say. \"In essence i'm scared of losing you all and then ending up at the mercy of someone like Amanda\" you continue. You feel Cindy's tail wrap around you and she leans over \"we're sorry John if we weren't so selfish this wouldn't have happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not you're fault, besides i'd rather have the fear then not me you and Chia\" you reply. Rydia reaches over and scoops you out of Cind'y tail, \"Serina needs to hear about this\" she says placing you in her palm and standing up. Rydia exits the tent and heads into the cabin as the other girls follow. Rydia walks up to the bed and shakes Serina awake, she opens her eyes slowly till she notices you and her eyes snap open. She reaches forward and gently pulls you out of Rydia's hand and snuggles you up against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had that nightmare again didn't you John?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you reply, Trish starts to slowly get up and she looks around kind of confused that everyone was just standing there letting Serina hug you. You turn to her and she instantly rushes forward and hugs you close \"ohhh John\" she says holding you tightly yet not tight enough to hurt you. You just lay you're head down and stay like that for a bit before Trish places you down on the bed and they crowd around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John do you really want to get rid of this?\" Serina asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do, this is really bugging me because honestly it is making me fearful when I shouldn't be\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well I can help but you're going to have to trust me\" Serina says she walks over to a drawer and pulls out a flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey isn't that the azure flute?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is\" Serina says starting to play the flute, you're vision starts to black and you seem to wake up in a field of flowers. You lok around panicking for a second as there seems to be nobody, you calm down as you see a figure in the distance. You quickly recognize the figure as an anthro version of Arceus easily recognizable by the yellow ring around her chest. You had to admit she looked very beautiful as her body was proportioned perfectly and you couldn't stop staring. She keeps walking towards you and seems to not notice you till she's standing right in front of you. She bends down and lowers her palm to the ground, you climb on without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the one I brought over, you're cuter than I expected\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you Arceus sir....uh mam\" you say correcting yourself quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about the pleasentries just call me Arceus\" she says smiling. \"Well no one ever shows up here just to talk so what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you probably know about everything that's happened to me and that incident with Amanda the milotic\" you say slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She always was a drama queen\" Arceus replies \"and?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can say this since i'm talking to you, it left me not only afraid of being left alone but well also of the inhabitants of you're world in general\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're afraid of pokemon now? but you didn't hesitate when getting near me?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well only those I don't really know, and you're Arceus I wouldn't even be here if not for you plus you're always depicted as a very friendly pokemon\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you\" she replies, she seems to think for a second before saying \"well I could just get rid of you're fear but I keep hearing men don't like having things given to them\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just help you conquer you're fear, you'll get a reward if you do\" Arceus says smiling gently. You're teleported you assume about 10 metres in front of Arceus and she starts transforming soon standing in front of you as Amanda the milotic and she's about 10 times as large as she was and you were scared enough of her as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you have to do is be able to punch her\" Arceus-amanda says smiling down at you. You however just stand there frozen in terror, \"move, this is Arceus not Amanda she won't hurt you\" you say. A hydro pump that would have annihalated you hits the ground about a metre next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're just gonna stand there i'm going to get more accurate\" she says. \"There's no way I can do this on my own, heck the only reason I was able to stand up to her was because I had Cindy and Chia's help\" you think starting to let yourself fall in despair. You hear Arceus' voice in you're head \"relying on others isn't a weakness, let it be you're strength\" she says. Instantly in you're hands appear 6 shrunken pokeballs, you hit the buttons and throw em, out pops Serina, Trish, Cindy, Chia, Rydia and Tina. They lean down \"we believe in you John, we have you're back\" they say before disappearing. Instantly you feel 1000x more confident, you turn towards Arceus-Amanda and yell \"You're going down.\" You charge towards her closing the distance suprisingly quickly, she moves to punch you but you don't stop and she hits in front of you. You jump onto her arm and run up it jumping off at the shoulder. You sail towards her and punch her square between the eyes with all you're strength, you start falling back towards the ground but you're caught in Arceus' open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww, that actually hurt\" she says rubbing the place where you hit with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why be sorry, that just shows how much you believed in them\" Arceus replies. A young growlithe pokemorph appears in front of her and Arceus gently hands you over. You just sit there as the growlithe licks you, you then climb up onto her head and give her an ear scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you seem cured\" Arceus says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I feel a lot better, thank you\" you say bowing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courteous as well as cute, I may just keep you for myself\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that wouldn't be so bad but I think it would make all those pokemon who care about me a bit sad\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right besides it's about time for a change of scenery\" Arceus says. You start wondering about what she means when you're vision blacks again. You wake up and you're laying on Serina's bed with them all staring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John you're ok\" Serina squeals gleefully as you wake up \"you passed out right after I played the flute what happened?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I met Arceus, she helped cure me and then said something about a change of scenery\" you reply. Suddenly there's a knock on the door and you stand up \"no way\" you think to yourself. Rydia runs to the door and opens it, standing there in the flesh was the goddess of all pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I come in?\" asks Arceus, everyone including you just stands there stunned. She slowly walks in, \"why do you all look so shocked especially you John I told you i'd like a change of scenery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect you to come here\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but you're just so small and cute besides why should everyone but me get some fun with you\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Ms Arceus?\" Serina asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Serina\" Arceus replies, Serina backs up a bit obviously shocked at being called by name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....we're sorry but there's no room for you here, we were already stretched thin using the tent in the yard\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well we can't have that\" Arceus says, you all float outside the cabin and she walks out and snaps her finger turning the cabin into.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A mansion, as the light fades you instantly recognize the shape and size of the building. Thing is this was no ordanairy mansion, this was one fit for Arceus . For a normal sized pokemon it would have been huge but to you it was like a small country. Arceus sets everyone but you down, you float over till you're right in front of her and she just holds you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just do to my house?\" Serina yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Serina but i'm kind of picky about where i'll live\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....it's ok I guess but why does it have to be so big, I mean what if we lose John in it?\" Serina asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that won't be a problem\" Arceus says, you feel a heat around you're neck and you see a ring with a small arrow appear on each girls finger. You look down and there's a red collar around you're neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, those rings will always point to where John is even if he's near one of you\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh what's with the collar?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it'd look cute on you\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take it off\" you say. You feel the same heat and you look down and it's gone. You look up and Arceus is staring at you \"why didn't you like my gift?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't deal well with people trying to assert some kind of dominance over me\" you say, \"i'm fine with being friends or more but due to free will not because one person has power\" you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noble little guy aren't you\" Arceus says. She leans over and kisses you \"I think this will be a lot of fun\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, Arceus can we tour the mansion now\" Serina says. You turn and you can see her holding the anger back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's a great idea\" Arceus says. She walks forward with you floating next to her and everyone follows. The mansion had entirely marble floors, a giant kitchen with a center island, indoor pool, 2 game rooms one for things like pool and much to you're suprise one filled with various game systems, there was a bedroom specalized for each pokemon like for example there was a bunch of pillows Cindy could lie on or bury into in her bedroom. \"So where's my bedroom?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you need a bedroom?\" Arceus asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if i'm not sleeping with anyone I should probably have my own bedroom\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you're sleeping with someone silly, me\" Arceus says pushing a door open. In front of you is that same field you remember meeting Arceus on, the only difference is there's a waterfall in one corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I object\" Serina yells and it's echoed by everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you objecting?\" Arceus asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John is ours\" Trish says walking up and plucking you out of the air \"not even you are taking him from us\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're misunderstanding something, I don't want to steal him I just want a chance to be with him, the bedrooms will become one after tonight\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure\" Trish says wrapping you up in her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't be that bad, I mean she is Arceus so it's not like she couldn't just steal me for herself if she wanted\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess\" Trish says. You turn to see Arceus smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you John, most humans i've observed are very selfish and mean but all i've seen from you is kindness\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you must have caught me on one of my good days when you chose me, i'm pretty sure i'm just as selfish as any other human\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you were but I felt a true love of pokemon when I saw you, and you haven't done anything except care for those around you since you arrived\" Arceus says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I love each of them\" you say stroking Trish's ear and she gently strokes you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but you didn't when you first showed up\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I kind of considered this as a chance to start over, to become the kind caring person I always wanted to be but human society mostly rejected\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww John\" Rydia says, she plucks you out of Trish's ears and gives you a hug. You hug Rydia back and you feel her start to slowly heat up. You hear you're stomach growl and say \"sorry, it's been a while since I last had anything to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get him something to eat\" Chia says grabbing you with a vine whip and running off. She runs straight for the kitchen and starts looking around. \"Is there anything you'd prefer Hohn, meat, bread, maybe some vegetables?\" Chia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some veggies sound good\" you reply. She grabs a few strawberries and other various fruit and a knife and she quickly has a fruit salad sitting in front of her. She places the bowl down in front of you and you climb onto the side. You grab a piece of strawberry and sit there eating it while Chia grabs and eats a piece of melon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think of Arceus?\" Chia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems very nice\" you say, \"why do you all keep questioning her, I thought she was you're protector?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is, and that's the problem, we're all a bit jealous, if you have her why would you need any of us\" Chia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop eating for a second to think \"Chia, none of you could be replaced, even by Arceus\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean that?\" Chia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you're each an individual and I love each and every one of you\" you yell to get you're point across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We love you too\" you hear come from behind you. You turn to see everyone else standing there staring at you, they run up and you're scooped off the fruit bowl and passed around each girl hugging you in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all can go play with him till the night\" Arceus says. Cindy who was holding you leads the pack as they run to the video game room and you're put down. Cindy starts the system up and grabs a controller while she passes you one that's you're size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, since when do pokemon know how to play video games?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like we don't have them, it's just I live in a secluded forest so I don't have electricity\" Serina says. You spend the next hour against Cindy in some kind of pokemon fighting game. Problem was all the characters were female so Serina would try to block you from seeing the tv every time one of the characters used anything she though made them too bouncy or too revealing. Finally you had enough, \"I surrender\" you say putting the controller down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww but it was just getting fun\" Cindy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but Serina keeps getting in my way\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only trying to keep you from staring at other girls\" Serina says giving you a little push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if we switch the game type?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure and player switch\" Tina says grabbing the controller from Cindy's hand and sitting down. She switches the disk and opening screen for a fantasy game flashes onto the screen. You play as an adventurer which was a human male, this suprised you and Tina played as you're travelling companion. The thing that confused you most about the game was that you could fully customize the female character from name, to 3 sizes, to pokemon type. It seemed to be a regular fantasy game although with pokemon and much shorter then most of the ones you remember as working together you got to the final boss within 3 hours. Much to you're suprise the final boss looked like Amanda, needless to say you took her down very quickly making sure to use the most powerful attack you had to finish her. The game ended with you're character and Tina's character sharing a kiss then walking into the sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was with all ths customization options and why was the character a human male?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not everyone believes in the existence of humans, but for those that do it's their dream to meet one and for him to fall for them\" Tina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry i'm not what's shown in this\" you say indicating the ending scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok John, you're perfect just the way you are\" Tina says picking you up and hugging you. You spend the next hour going against Cindy, Chia, and Rydia in a pokemon version of brawl and then Serina slips a game in and everyone gathers round. The machine starts up and much to you're suprise it's a dating simulator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not the very best at these\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on John, this game was specifically made for a human just in case one showed up\" Rydia says. You spend the next 4 hours playing with everyone watching and every so often making a comment on you're action or how you spent your time. Finally you reach the conclusion of the game and much to you're suprise since you thought you could only get 1 girl in a dating sim all the girls had accepted each other and you got a harem ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Epic\" you think as the game closes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John it's time for bed\" Arceus yells, you can hear anticipation in her voice.</span></div></div>",

You find Arceus' door open and Serina puts you down and you walk through before she shuts it behind you. You walk through the field staring at most of the flowers as you pass them, you find Arceus in the center of the field and she turns as you walk up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good you did come\" she says lowering a hand which you step on. Arceus drops you on her stomach before laying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love places like this, they really show just how beautiful everything is\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, so what do you think of me?\" Arceus asks, but before you can answer Arceus shifts right before you're eyes, her chest becomes a set of Ds, her figure becomes an hourglass and her fur started to sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...you look gorgeous\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I aim to please\" Arceus says, she lays a hand over you and starts stroking you're back. You snuggle up into her fur and it almost felt like it was getting softer...and longer \"wait a minute\" you think and you look up to see Arceus getting bigger and bigger until her fur was over you're head and it was like you were in a forest. \"Hey....hey like i'm not small enough already\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh, this is only temporary, now little man you have to reach my face or else, oh and don't worry there's no time limit\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what?\" you say and you hear and see her paw hit her stomach below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get running\" Arceus says smiling devilishly and you do so. \"Why is she doing this? she out of anyone knows I hate anyone who does stuff like this\" you think while running. You dive and just enter the space between her fingers as she lowers her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, looks like you need to hurry up\" Arceus says. You start full on sprinting and quickly reach the crevice between Arceus breasts but much to you're suprise she lowers her hand between her breasts \"you have to climb over\" Arceus says. Sighing you start climbing her right breast, you hear her sigh as you climb up and you slide down the other side and you hear her moan. You walk the rest of the way and Arceus seems to have resigned herself to her loss as you reach her head. She smiles and raises her head before starting to shrink down to more normal size, \"you win\" she says picking you up. She smiles at you before you jump and punch her square in the forehead, you land on her chest and she stays laying down completely shocked and staring at you. \"You out of anyone know why I did that\" you say before jumping off her stomach. You start walking across the field and you feel that same sense of sadness you felt when Serina was mad at you. You look down at the grass because you were worried if you looked up you'd see Arceus, you run into something and you look up to see Arceus sitting in front of you, you turn and start walking around her but she just cups her hands around you, picks you up and holds you facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John?\" she says, you turn in the opposite direction, \"Arceus, you were the one out of everyone who knows I hate feeling powerless more then anything. You put me in a position where I not only felt like that, but you were the one who was making me feel that way, i'd only be more hurt if it was Serina doing it\" you say looking down. \"John\" Arceus says and you can hear, no, feel the sadness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...just leave me alone\" you say starting to stand up but Arceus wraps her hands around you and holds you to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon\" she says in an authoritative voice, you turn even though you don't want to and you look up to see the goddess of pokemon crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus?\" you say suprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm \"sniff\" i'm sorry\" Arceus says hugging you to her cheek, the tears start flowing and you feel you're anger replaced by regret as soon as you see the first tear fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus, stop crying\" you say. She starts floating in one direction and you in another, \"goodbye John, i'm one of those mean girls who you hate so i'll just leave\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you fucking dare!\" you yell and she stops and you float towards her. You reach in front of her and walk forward like there's an invisible staircase till you're standing right in front of her face \"you are Arceus, the one pokemon I expect everything from but even you have faults\" you say. \"You are not leaving because that's running and I won't allow that, now be the beautiful, kind, loving pokegirl I love, and even if you aren't I still want you by my side\" you say kissing Arceus' lips. You float back and she smiles at you \"thank you John\" she says wiping a few tears away. \"You're not gonna tell anyone are you?\" Arceus asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm I don't know, I mean having something over you is a pretty dig deal\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please John\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine on 2 conditions. First never do that again I really don't want to hate you Arceus, but I just can't forgive people who use power for their own pleasure\" you say and she nods. \"Secondly, I just want you to be yourself, that and I just want you to be one of the group, don't flaunt you're power just use it when necesscary, or if you to do something like want make an apple out of the air i'm fine with that too\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\" Arceus says a giant smile on her face before she leans over and kisses you, \"I knew you were a good choice\" she whispers as she leans back. She starts walking and lays down in the center of the field, you float behind her and you land on her stomach again. Arceus gently lifts you up and smiles at you, kissing you again before placing you down into her chest. \"Oooh you feel really comfy down there\" she says and much to you're suprise you see that gold ring around her start spinning, It slows down and stops and you feel Arceus' chest compact around you. \"Oooh that feels great, it's been so long since I had any company, much less some that felt so good\" Arceus says sighing. You wiggle around and she starts giggling \"stop.....stop....that...tickles\" Arceus laughs. Of course you just wiggle more and finally Arceus is just able to lift you out between fits of laughter. \"Geez not listening to me\" Arceus says laughing, \"I think you should have to do me a favour now\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm I know\" she says, you float up and down really quickly making you severely disoriented. You land on Arceus' stomach and you stumble around, \"now where will you head\" Arceus says. You walk towards where you hear her voice and you feel her finger under you before you trip and land face first in her breast. \"Oh well aren't you just a naughty boy\" Arceus says giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny\" you say woozily, \"ugh...feeling sick\" you say hugging the soft breast before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohh, you're not supposed to actually touch\" Arceus says lifting you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then don't make me queasy\" you say. A lightbulb goes off in you're head, \"hey Arceus what's you're name?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I don't have one, everyone's just called me Arceus\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I gave you one?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, now let's heart it\" she says leaning on one shoulder and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....Annabelle...Clarisse....how about Veronica?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No too stuck up\" Arceus replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inari\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too japanese\" she replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh that's cute, i'll take it\" Arceus says. She snuggles you into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John can I ask you to hold onto something for me\" Belle says. Part of her ring breaks off and flys over to you wrapping around you're arm. \"You said you didn't like feeling powerless, well just say my name and that'll give you power\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I say Belle or Arceus?\" you ask and it glows as you say Arceus before she touches it. \"There's you're answer\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about before\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright since you said you'd never do it again, now good night\" you say laying you're head down. You were sure Arceus was smiling as Arceus lays a hand over you and you the sky changes from day to night. You quickly fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

Cindy was curled up in her own tail, Trish and Serina were each spread eagled which gave you a quite good look at their bodies. Rydia and Cindy were laying on their backs and you saw Rydia's tail as well as Cindy's leaf sway from side to side. You looked up at Belle and smiled as she was still sleeping, \"knew it, she does just look like any other cute girl when she's sleeping\" you think. You walk up and sit down on her shoulder just watching her sleep for a bit before jumping off and walking through the grass. You make it to the door in a minute and are soon out into the halls, \"ok a toilet is where?\" you think, instantly you see a neon sign pointing in a direction. \"Works for me\" you think before following the sign, it takes you about 5 minutes to run through the mansion and get to the bathroom making it just in time. You do you're buisness and decide to explore for a bit, you find a sauna, a bath area, and what seems to be a room for afternoon naps or something as the floor was covered in pillows and there was sunlight streaming in from tons of windows. You walk around for a bit before you hear the trample of feet, \"he should be around here\" Serina yells. You freeze and they actually miss you, \"hmm this might be fun\" you think grinning a bit. You run back to Belle's room and hide among the grass, you heard the sound of feet and you sit up pretending to yawn \"what's going on? why's everyone running around\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, the rings just went a bit haywire is all\" Cindy says walking up. Cindy sits down next to you and wraps you up in her tail, \"so did you have a good sleep?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, although I wouldn't mind going back to sleep\" you reply getting as comfy as you can. Cindy lifts you up and gently strokes you're back, \"while i'd love for you to sleep in my tail, we have things to do\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what things?\" you ask suprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have to devise schedules and plans and everything so we all get equal time with you\" Serina says walking up and scooping you off Cindy's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just you know share?\" you ask looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls look at each other and smile, \"well if you insist handsome, I guess we can\" Trish says. You look around, \"where's Belle?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle?\" Serina replies puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus, she let me name her last night\" you say sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh watch it Serina you just might have some competition\" Trish says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle, went to the bathroom\" Serina replies staring down at you. Before you could say a word Serina had dropped you into her dress and she held you firmly between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" you shout up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry John, but you're not coming out of there for a while\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair\" Trish says pushing Serina playfully causing her chest to compact around you. The wind was slightly knocked out of you and you tried to grab onto the first thing you could which was Serina's other breast. You pull yourself off and you heard her give off an audible moan, you look over and quickly take you're hands off, \"sorry\" you yell up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"don't be\" she replies, \"in fact go back to doing what you were doing\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, would rather not\" you reply, you were yanked out of Serina's dress and you couldn't tell what was happening for a second. All you could feel was wind and someone's hand around you as well as the sound of yelling and running feet. It stopped after a second and you were plopped down onto a pillow, or rather a bunch of pillows you were back in that sunning room or whatever it was. You look up to see Trish looking down at you with a closed door at her back, you were about to say something when she flops one of her ears over you shushing you. By the time you got her ear off the sounds of the others had disappeared and Trish was smiling down at you slyly yet happily. She lays out over the pillows and smiles at you, \"finally we're alone\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you just do that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I don't like sharing you with the others and they don't like sharing you with me, so I wanted some alone time\" she says pulling you to her chest and wrapping you up in her ears. \"Even just this feels a lot more romantic, now that it's just me, and you\" she says proving it by nuzzling against you. You did have to admit, it did feel nice to just have some more intimate time with each girl, but then you thought of everyone else feeling left out so you shook that away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish, come on, you share me because there's 7 of you and only one of me\" you say. Trish looks down at you and sighs, \"fine, I guess i'll share you, but I want you to answer a question first\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, what\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of me?\" Trish asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at first I kind of didn't like you beacuse you well kept following me, but after you moved in, i've gotta say I love ya to death Trish\" you reply. Trish hugs you a bit too tightly as the wind was knocked out of you and she stands up and is about to exit the room when you were pulled out of her grip. You were dragged along by what was easily recognized as Tina's tail by the ball on the end, she ran through the mansion till she runs into a side corridor and heads straight for a room. You look around and were shocked as the room looked like it was made for a princess, \"Tina where did you take me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My room, Arceus does a really good job\" she says sitting down on the bed but still holding you in her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you uh let me down?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's more fun like this\" Tina says lifting you up to her face. She smiles and kisses you, \"ooh you're just so cute\" she says wrapping her hands around you and hugging you to her chest, \"I just want to hold you and never let go\" she says softly rolling from side to side. You didn't mind the attention you got from each girl heck you loved it, but you did kind of wish they'd act more....unified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 minutes you push yourself up, \"Tina shouldn't we go find the others\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna, we can just lie here together\" she says whining a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you wouldn't the others to hold me from you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Tina says standing up, She walks out of the room thankfully carrying you in her palm instead of by her tail and you both find everyone else in the kitchen. Tina walks up and puts you down on a counter and everyone makes a grab for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop\" you yell and everyone freezes. \"Look i'm glad that all of you like me this much, that you'd well fight over me. I'm getting sick and tired of being snatched by one person or another and then them having to go into hiding for me to not be snatched back. So here's my proposition, can we just stay as a group, like we did yesterday that was actually really fun, where although it was mainly interaction between 2 of us everyone was involved\" you say. Everyone looks at you kind of dumbfounded.</span></div></div>",

You nod and look up at Belle \"so other then video games you got any group activities here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course, there's swimming pools, sports courts, a golf course, there's even a steam room\" Belle replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh a steam room, can we go there?\" Chia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not\" you reply. Cindy picked you up and the whole group started to walk through the mansion with Belle at the front. You went through how many twists and turns before suddenly the walls shifted from stone to wood and you came upon a wooden door. Belle without skipping a beat opens the door and everyone walked in, the room was well a normal sauna except there were racks of towels near the front. Serina grabbed 2 towels and laid one down on the seat, Cindy puts you down there and suprisingly you find a tiny towel your size on the larger one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok John you've got to strip now\" Belle says smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on this is a sauna, no one wears clothes in a sauna, look even Serina's getting undressed\" she says. You turned and that was really a bad idea as Serina was removing her dress and you got an eyeful of her whole lower body as you looked right when she needed to bend over. You quickly turned back and you heard Belle giggle, \"see anything you like?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't reply, instead you start to undresss you were nude and you wrap that mini-towel around your waist before you lay down on the towel. You felt more then heard Serina sit down next to you and you heard and felt the first cupful of water being poured on the coals as the room started to heat up. You looked up to see Serina sitting there in just a towel \"don't get to see you like this much\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm what do you mean?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well other then when you've bathed your always in that dress of yours\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I love it, it looks very good on you, but I don't know it's good to see you out of it every so often\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like what you see John?\" Serina asks and before you can react she had dropped the towel filling your vision with her body now covered in sweat. Your mouth dropped open and she giggled \"i'll take that as a yes\" she says before putting the towel back on. You looked away only to see Tina sitting on your other side, you felt her tail slowly wrap around you and she lifts you up into her lap. \"Come lay with me John, i'm sure you'll be comfier that way\" she says laying out on one of the benches and putting you down on her stomach. You did have to admit it was really comfy as at your size her skin acted like a floor and as Tina heated it up it was like you were laying on a giant hot water bottle. Tina starts to gently stroke you and she sighed \"ahh now this is comfy\" she says. You started to rub her stomach and Tina sighs even more \"ooh that feels heavenly, now this is happiness\" she says. You rubbed her stomach for 5 minutes before you were plucked off Tina's stomach and Rydia put you down on her shoulder. You looked at Rydia and sighed as the sauna was really starting to heat up \"how do you stand it, you have fur!\" you say. Rydia giggles \"i'm a fire type remember, heat like this is nothing\" she says. You looked around and you couldn't see Trish or Cindy \"those 2 left already, too hot for them\" Rydia says. You let out another sigh \"I think it's getting too hot for me\" you say. You look over and you saw Serina and Tina sweating about as much as you were yet Belle was sitting there calm as can be. You were getting pretty close to passing out so you tapped Rydia's shoulder, \"can I ya know get out of here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess\" she says sighing. She walks over to the door and opens it putting you down on the ground. You walk out and you find Trish and Cindy as well as Chia sitting around a table drinking water and milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghhh too hot\" Cindy says sitting back, you climb up the leg of the chair and gently pull on her tail. Cindy turns around, picks you up and puts you down on the table, you looked up at the glasses of water, \"man I wish I had one of those\" you think. You heard Belle's voice in your head \"your wish is my command\" then a giggle and a glass of water appeared in your hand. \"Uh wow, thanks\" you think. \"No problem\" you heard Belle's voice in your head agian before it disappeard. You sat back and drank your fill of water as the cup never seemed to be empty even though you knew you should have emptied the glass 4 or 5 times. You were lifted up by a vine whip and Chia brought you over to her and hugged you \"too hot for you as well?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean i've been in saunas before but it got a lot hotter for me due to size\" you say. She nods and starts fanning you with the leaf on her head \"better?\" she asks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much thank you\" you say. You started to absentmindedly stroke the nearest thing to you which happened to be Chia's breast. She sighs and the fanning actually increased, \"mmm that feels great\" she says. You knew what you were doing but you had finally stopped being embarassed and self-concious about it. You felt something lay over you and you looked up to see pink and then you heard a giggle. \"John where'd you go? come out come out wherever you are\" Trish says. You push her ear off and then rub it for a bit. Trish instantly sighs and she slowly turns her head so she's facing you a stupid grin on her face. You heard the sound of steam and out of the steam room stumble Serina and Tina who fall onto the ground with Rydia dn Belle following them. \"Up you 2 come, I told you that you shouldn't stay in that long\" Rydia says dragging Serina over to a chair as Belle drags Tina. The 2 of them are put down in the chairs and Chia walks over and starts fanning Serina and Trish offers Tina a glass of water which she drinks. They slowly come out of the minor heat stroke they suffered and Serina falls forward onto the table and she sighs. Belle sits opposite you and pulls you back till you were resting on her stomach. \"Hey how'd you ya know last that long, I mean you aren't a fire type\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am Arceus, the area around me never changed from around body temperature\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez should have stuck near you then\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where's the fun in that, besides you did say we need to share you\" Belle says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true\" you say laying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe hey John your forgetting something\" Trish says. You look up at her and then back at yourself and you realize you were still wearing just the towel. \"Belle do you have some clothes I could borrow?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww but you looks so cute like that\" Belle says. You frown at her and she sighs \"fine here\" she says and a bunch of clothes as well as a tiny room appear on the table. \"Thanks\" you say before grabbing the clothes and quickly getting changed in the room. You come out and Serina and Tina had finally recovered \"anyone got a specific thing they want to do now?\" you ask.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think we should go swimming\" Chia says flopping out on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds awesome\" Trish says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you just want to go from a steam room to a pool?\" Rydia asks. Everyone including you, nods and she sighs \"well I don't wanna\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine we're doing this democratically\" Serina says. \"Everyone who wants to go swimming raise their hands\" she says, everyone but Rydia raised theirs. \"Alright everyone who wants to do something else\" Serina says, only Rydia raised her hand. \"Alright that's, 1 undecided, 1 against, and 6 for swimming, looks like swimming it is\" Serina says. Rydia sighs but just gives in \"fine we'll meet at the pool, Belle can you take John there, and no doing anything\" Serina says picking you up and passing you over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your no fun\" she replies sticking her tongue out at Serina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks off down the hall and you look up at her \"don't you need to change into a swimsuit?\" you ask. She smiles down at you \"now John why would I deny you this gorgeous body by covering it up\" Belle says. \"What about you, aren't you going to need to lose the clothes\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah I guess, you'll just whip me up another changing room right?\" you ask looking up at her hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, see you naked, or get you a changing room, it's such a hard decision\" Belle says staring down at you mischeviously. You glare up at her and she sighs \"fine I'll make you a little changing room\" she says right as you were blinded by the sun. Belle walked out onto a small deck that overlooked a rectangular pool that could easily fit about 20 pokemon. You assume you were now in the backyard of the building but you really weren't sure, for all you knew Arceus just changed the front. She walks down a small set of steps to the concrete area that surrounded the pool and she sits back in a lawn chair. \"Ahem, aren't you forgetting something\" you say. Belle gives a small sigh and a small room appears on the table, she lifts you up, putting you down on the table. You walk into the room and find a pair of black swim trunks, you quickly look around even pressing against the mirror to make sure it wasn't a one-way viewing screen before starting to change. The swim trunks as you had expected fit perfectly, you peaked your head out once you were done and Belle looked over \"finished?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, where do I put my clothes?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just leave them there, it's not like anyone's going to steal them\" she says. You sigh and walk out of the changing room, just then you hear the sound of giggling and you look up at the balcony and your mouth utterly drops. Serina w wearing a very cleavage revealing one piece suit. Trish was wearing a two piece bikini, although from how tight it looked on her you guess it was a size or two too small....on purpose. Rydia was wearing a fiery red one piece like Serina although hers showed a little less cleavage. Chia and Cindy were both wearing two piece swimsuits although there's seemed to fit their forms perfectly, Chia's being a dark green and Cindy's had white and blue stripes. Finally there was Tina, she was also wearing a one piece, although hers was a deep sea blue, although it was very form fitting, it looked more like a racing suit than a casual swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls I think John approves\" Belle yells up at the group, you blushed and turned away. You however didn't have long to be embarassed as you felt yourself lifted off the table \"h-hey!\" you shout as you were lifted up in the air. You were soon face to face with Serina \"hi John, so do you like our swimsuits?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all look....very nice\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on John you can tell us what you really feel, we're sexy as sin aren't we\" Trish says walking up a big smile on her face. You looked away and started to whistle before she picked you up \"John you don't have to lie, even if the answer's no we won't be mad\" Trish says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....that answer's yes, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you only think we're sexy or something more?\" Trish asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitley more\" you reply a hint of a smile forming on your lips. Trish smiles as well before hugging you to her cheek for a few seconds \"then there's no problem\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, didn't we come here to swim\" Belle yells up at them. Before you knew what was happening you were surrounded by the blue glow of Serina's psychic and you shot out to the center of the pool before promptly being dunked. \"First one to get to him gets a reward\" Serina yells. All the girls rushed down the stairs, thankfully none of them slipped and it became a race to get to you. You were a bit freaked at first but you decided to play along and dove underwater. In a few seconds Tina's hand tries to grab you but you deftly move to the side, you somehow kept the same lung capacity as if you were normal sized so you were able to dodge for about half a minute before needing to come up for air. As soon as you did you felt yourself lifted up by 2 vines and Chia smiled at you as she brought you over \"hah I caught him\" she says. The others sighed but swam over to her and stared down at you, you by now were smiling fully immersed in the game but you stared up at Serina. \"That was really dangerous you do know that\" you say adding an angry undertone to your speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do?\" Serina says sounding honestly hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you have done if I couldn't swim?\" you ask. Serina's mouth opens for a few seconds and then closes \"John I am so sorry, it seemed like a fun game idea, but I didn't even think...\" she trails off as you hold up a hand. \"It's alright, it's not like that happened, can you just ya know be a bit more careful, I know I don't act like it affects me but I am still a lot smaller than each of you\" you say. They all nod \"we're sorry John\" they say one at a time, you nod as each says it and then Chia pipes up \"i'm sorry too.....so what's my reward?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I kind of thought you'd come up with your own reward\" Serina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I've got the perfect idea then\" Chia says, you expected her to lower you but she lifted you up till you were sitting on the leaf on top of her head. \"You're coming with me for a swim\" Chia says before swimming off towards the empty side of the pool. Good thing about her being a grass type was she wasn't exactly the greatest swimmer in the world, bad thing about it was the exact same thing. She was a quite....shaky swimmer meaning you had to hold onto the leaf to keep from falling off. Finally Chia seems to notice this as her leaf droops after a few minutes and you slip off into the water. You look up at her and she smiles down at you \"I'm not the best boat you've ever been on, am I?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your not\" you reply, she smiles and lifts you up \"well I'm the best boat that can give you this service, I know that much\" she says before kissing you. \"Hey everyone get over here, time for another group activity\" Belle yells. Chia as well as everyone else swims up and Belle smiles. </span></div></div>",

Get out here!\" you hear coming from outside. Serina, who was still hugging you to her breasts, hands you over to Tina who places you in her cleavage. The second Serina opens the door she is blasted into the opposite wall by a hydro pump. \"Serina!\" everyone yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda slowly walked into the house causing everyone to look at her. \"Hahaha!!!! She didn't see that coming did she?! I came back with some new 'friends',\" Amanda said as a Nidoqueen and Blastoise walked in. The girls and you looked at them in shock. You quickly squirmed your way out from Tina's cleavage and run over to the barely conscious Serina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nidoqueen suddenly tried to punch Trish, but she jumped backward barely dodging it. \"Where did you meet these two?!\" Chia asked Amanda. Amanda just smirked at her. \"Way before I met you two. These two are the ones I call when I need a lot of help on something,\" Amanda explained. Suddenly Amanda was blasted backwards by a watergun from Tina and hit from the side by a vine whip from Chia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda growled as she got back up and shot multiple water guns at Chia, then ran at Tina, dodging all of Tina's attacks, and kicked her in the face. Cindy looked on in shock before growling and shooting a thunder at Amanda who easily dodged it. Amanda then looked around and saw you near Serina. Amanda slowly walked over to you, but before she could get over there, Rydia stepped in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move horsey or I will take you down,\" Amanda told her. Rydia glared before jumping into the air and coming crashing down on top of Amanda. Amanda knocked Rydia off of her back and hit Rydia with a water gun.<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________<br>\r\nWhile all of this is taking place, you are trying to wake Serina up. \"Serina please wake up!\" you yell, but all you hear is mumbling. Suddenly a shadow comes over you making you look up and see the Blastoise. She is 6'0 tall, has an hourglass figure with a large shell on her back, large GG-cup breasts, and a small turtle tail. \"So you're the little guy Amanda was fussing about when she came back huh? Why hello I'm Shirley,\" Shirley introduced herself shocking you with how nice she's being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um I'm John,\" you introduce yourself while being scared out of your wits. Suddenly Shirley picks you up and smiles at you again. You wonder what the hell is wrong with her considering how she can go from hitting someone with a hydro pump one second to being the nicest person ever the next when a somewhat familiar stench hits your nose. 'Is that alcohol on her breath. I haven't smelt that since I was on Earth. Great she's drunk now what?' you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel a large rush of wind go pass you and a crashing sound. You turn your head and see Trish lying on the ground hurt. \"Trish!\" you yell in worry, but you are suddenly hugged to Shirley's breasts smothering you. \"Aw you're so soft and cute,\" she says. The Nidoqueen groans angrily as she walks over to Shirley and smacks her on the head making Shirley drop you on the floor giving you a sprained ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shirley you idiot, you found some alcohol here didn't you?\" the Nidoqueen asked Shirley. \"It was in the cabinet Mabel, I couldn't help it,\" Shirley told the newly named Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the Nidoqueen and see that she is the same height as Shirley, she has a long blue tail, EE-cup white breasts, some blue spikes coming out of her back. Mabel looks down at you and smiles seductively causing you to be scared. Right before she can grab you, she is sent flying out of the house by a bounce attack from the hurt Trish. Shirley just smiles and waves,\"Bye bye Mabel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish looks down and sees. She picks you up and puts you between her breasts. \"Trish are you okay!\" you yell up to her. She just smiles down at you and nods, but you can tell she's lying.<br>\r\n______________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smirks as she picks up the beaten up and unconscious Rydia. \"Weakling,\" she said as she threw her to the side. She looks over and sees the unconscious Serina. \"Now to finish her off,\" Amanda said, but she felt her body go light and then she finds herself staring at Arceus, the creator of all. \"A-A-Arceus?!\" Amanda yelled in shock. Arceus just smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams were heard by many people for the rest of that week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Serina's cabin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley was unconscious on the ground. Seemed she passed out from drinking too much, but she was tied up. Trish was nursing her injuries with rubbing oil she found in the bathroom. Rydia was asleep in her tent with Tina doing the same thing. Cindy and Chia were with you while you looked after the unconscious Serina who was the most injured of you all since she took a hydro pump with her guard down full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she's okay,\" you say. Chia starts massaging your back with her finger to calm you down. \"Don't worry John she'll be fine when she wakes up,\" Cindy told you. John nodded his head and looked back at Serina.

Latias doesn't look someone who's preparing for landing, which gives you some time to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to talk to her, but she used a finger on her second hand to shut your mouth. She used telepathy to tell you that she won't hear you t this speed and that you shouldn't waste your mouth... whatever she means by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long and quite crazy flight Latias finally landed somewhere on the grassy field. You thought that she'll be kind enough to carefully put you on the ground, but she started to play with you by tilting her hand, causing you to grab her skin and hang for your dear life. She felt a little pain and started to wave her arm, launching you to the sky. Before you were able to fall, Latias extended her leg, letting you fall on her soft foot. She then lowered it, creating a chute on which you slid to the ground. You turned around to look at her whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there's not many things to say about her appearance, she's just anthro Latias. But man, she's hot. She has long red hear, a nice pair of breasts and very slim body, her main color is red, with an exception of her belly, palms and soles of her feet- they are all white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you, smiling- it's a good sign. Her face, however, is quickly replaced by her foot- it's a bad sign. You wanted to run, but her foot was too quick. To your surprise, though, she didn't want to squash you. Then why is she doing it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>\"Hehehe, see something you like?\"</i></span> Her cheerful \"voice\"- she's using telepathy again. <span class=\"clred\"><i>\"I took you from that Gardevoir, because she wanted to turn you into her personal foot toy.
