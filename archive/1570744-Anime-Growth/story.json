            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Sakura! If you have some free time would you like to go get some ramen? My treat!\" Naruto asked hoping against hope that Sakura would finally say yes. Even if it was hopeless he still felt like he had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Sakura said pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see. Well if you change your..mind..wait..r-really?!\" Naruto felt like this was to good to be true. Wait..\"Release!\" he shouted sending out a burst of chakra to dispel the genjutsu he was under. But it was proven not to be a genjutsu when Sakura smacked him upside the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S REALLY ME YOU IDIOT!!\" she shouted in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow..wait that hurt.\" he realized \"Then that means this isn't a dream either. S-so that must mean-\" he made the hand seal for the Shadow Clone jutsu \"Your an imposter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your greatest fear is ghosts.\" she said flatly wanting to quickly put an end to this nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you promised not to tell that to..anyone..\" it was starting to dawn on him that this was real as he only ever told that secret to his teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't. It's really me Naruto.\" she said more patiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was in complete shock and Sakura couldn't really blame him as she has gone on record saying that she would never go out with him, even if he was the last boy on Earth, that her heart was only for Sasuke and no one else. But that was before she had been put on the same team as him. And ever since she became his teammate she has seen Naruto rise up to every challenge that came his way. Even if things seemed hopeless like when he faced off against foes like Zabuza, Orochimaru, Neji and most recently Gaara, he never gave up and found a way to claim victory from the jaws of defeat. His battles against Neji and Gaara were what especially made it clear that there was far more to Naruto then meets the eye. As in those fights he had little to no help from his team or Kakashi-sensei and had to rely on only his own skill and will to win. Neji was a prodigy to one of the best ninja clans in the world and Gaara was a ruthless killing machine that almost no one could even touch let alone defeat, there was no reason to believe that Naruto could win against either of them, let alone both of them in the same day. But he did. His fight against Neji was an inspiring underdog story. And his battle against Gaara was like something out of a legend.(in this story she was able to stay consensus and see the fight) So she felt like a date was the least he deserved..especially after the way she treated him for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the longest time Sakura thought that Naruto was just an immature brat that had no talent in being a ninja. But who could blame her for thinking that? In school he had the worst grades, he could barely preform the most basic techniques, he pulled childish pranks and ditched class all the time and he failed the graduation exam 3 times. But the more she thought about it, and she has a lot of time to think this last month, it seemed that in some ways school just held Naruto back from reaching his true potential. For one thing he had more chakra then her, Sasuke and Kakashi-sensei combined, so using skills that required little chakra, which was all they taught at school, was very difficult for him. Plus his teachers, besides Iruka and Kakashi, didn't seem to even want to teach Naruto anything. If fact being an orphan Naruto probably had to teach himself the most basic skills like how to read and write, so by the time he could all his peers already learned how to channel their chakra. So it was amazing that he was able to become a ninja to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sasuke was the golden boy of the village and with good reason. He was smart, handsome, talented and no doubt wealthy thanks to being the sole heir to the most powerful clan in the village. He was every girls dream boy, especially hers..or at least he was at first. While he was a great ninja for his age he was also arrogant and cold to everyone, even his teammates. In the bell test he believed that his team would only slow him down and that he could pass all by himself, she thought so too. He was buried up to his neck for it. He believed that because he had the Sharingan that he was unbeatable, she thought so too. Rock lee handed his ass to him on a platter. With the Chidori he believed that he could beat Gaara when no one else could, she thought so too. Naruto had to save his gloomy butt when Gaara went berserk.(a bit of a pattern isn't it?) So maybe Sasuke wasn't as perfect as she thought. Plus a girl could only be rejected so many times before it finally becomes clear that maybe he's just not into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere as Naruto was always supportive and kind to her, even when she was at her meanest. And if she was completely honest pretty handsome too. So with all that in mind she felt it was only right to give Naruto a fair chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we going now or do you want to meet up later?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um..how about I meet you at the stand in an hour? I need to change into better clothes.\" he said bashfully gesturing to his filthy jumpsuit, no doubt caused by a day of intense training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. See you then.\" she waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah see ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It seemed that Naruto did own more clothes then orange jumpsuits as he came running down the street in a pair of black shorts and a white t-shirt with a orange spiral on the front. Not the best wardrobe for a date, but leagues better then the jumpsuit in Sakura's opinion. And from the smell of things he also took a shower and put on deodorant, which meant that he really wanted to make a good impression on what was quite possibly his first date ever. This made Sakura happy as she put in just as much effort into her appearance with a white t-shirt with sakura petals decorated on the front and nice black skirt. And she had to admit while she waited for him the ramen that was cooking smelled delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there! Did I make you wait long?\" Naruto asked hoping he didn't mess up already. Sakura saw how nervous he was, this whole thing really meant a lot to him. It warmed her heart to see how much he really just wanted to make sure he did this right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I just got here about a minute ago.\" Sakura said honestly. This made Naruto breath a sigh of relief. They walked into the ramen stand and sat down at the booth to order their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you be having today?\" The waitress Ayame asked with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two pork ramens please.\" Sakura answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up.\" Ayame wrote down the order \"Dad I need two pork bowls stat!\" she said to the cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" he said joyfully knowing that their favorite customer was finally on a date with the girl he always had his eye on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at Sakura a little surprised.\" I thought that you were on a diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. Just a much healthier one for a ninja now.\" she said with a knowing grin as Naruto has told her many times before that starving yourself was not the best thing to do when you want to be a ninja. But she always told him he didn't know what he was talking about before hitting him on the head. This thought caused Sakura to feel a wave of guilt at her past behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good to see you took my advice!\" he said with a bright grin \"After all your going to need all the energy you can get if you want to be an even greater ninja!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreater ninja? That implied that she was a great ninja already and she knew that wasn't true. \"That's sweet of you to say Naruto, but I'm not a great ninja. Hell I'm barely a ninja at all.\" she said with shame \"At best I'm an annoyance and at worst a liability. You, Sasuke and Kakashi-sensei are the ones doing all the work while I'm just in the background doing nothing. Just a week ago you saved the whole village from Gaara while I was pinned to a tree. Does that sound like a great ninja to you? *Sigh* The truth is Naruto..that I'm useless-\" her depressing monologue was cut off by Naruto smacking her upside the head. \"Ow what was that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as you give me a smack whenever I act like an idiot it's only fair that I can do it too.\" he said sternly \"Because Sakura..you ARE a great ninja. I can name 3 examples off the top of my head that prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Really? *Chuckle* Well this should be good.} she thought with grim amusement at what was no doubt going to be a weak defense for her skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One you're smarter then Sauske and me combined. You were able to solve most of the questions on that impossible written test. And I'm pretty sure that's most of the reason as to why your so talented in chakra control.\" Naruto actually had a good point. Since chakra was made Physical and Mental energy it made sense that her natural intelligence made it easier for her to control. But smarts alone does not a great ninja make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fair enough, but you have to admit that I'm useless in combat.\" she said certain that there was no way he could defend her subpar skill in fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay it's true that your taijutsu could use a lot of work, but that doesn't mean your useless. Which leads me to my second example. You got a lot of will. I mean that's how I win most of my fights.\" True but that didn't mean- \"And you broke free of Ino's Mind Transfer jutsu. From what I heard not a lot people have the willpower to do that.\" ...Point taken. \"And you saved our lives in The Forest of Death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now your just grasping at straws. Lee and Team 8 were the ones who saved us. I barely did anything to slow the Sound Team down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did Lee and Team 8 from what I heard. And they are all strong in their own right, especially Lee.\"...Point taken again. \"Besides who watch over me and Sasuke for days making sure nothing killed us in our sleep? You did. Who put the time and effort to set up traps to buy us more time and catch the enemy off guard? You did. Who risked her life and endured a savage beating to save me,Sasuke and Lee? You did. Risking our lives, using any means to complete the mission and making sure that our comrades live to fight another day. That is what great ninja do. That is what you did Sakura.\" Naruto said with conviction and surprising wisdom that it stunned Sakura to silence. \"And my third example, you want to get better. Any average ninja would just settle with just becoming a chunin, but I can tell that you got ambition and a lot of untapped potential. If you really knuckle down on your training, in no time you will become one of the best ninjas in the world!\" he said with his trademark fox like grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..You..really think so?\" was all Sakura could manege to say for her state of pure awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked her straight in the eye and said \"I guarantee it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sniffle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sakura looked to see the Ichiraku's watch the scene with tears in their eyes and heartfelt smiles on their faces. \"That was so beautiful.\" Mr. Ichiraku said barely holding it together as he placed their meal on the table \"Just for that eat up as much as you want if you want more. It all on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REALLY!?!?\" Naruto beamed \"Alright!! Time to dig in!\" he wasted no time doing just that and probably broke the record for the fastest time eating ramen as in ten seconds flat his bowl was empty \"More please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up! Ayame give me hand here we've got a Naruto too feed!\" Mr. Ichiraku said in high spirits and his daughter was more than happy to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating to their hearts content Naruto and Sakura went of to enjoy the rest of their date. Which consisted of them just walking around the village talking for hours about everything and nothing. Sakura was amazed in how much fun she had just spending time with Naruto. She couldn't help but think as to why she never gave him a chance sooner.{Oh yeah..because I was so focused on Sasuke.} The more she thought about it the more she realized that she wasted so much time chasing a childhood fantasy and it cost her, her best friend and nearly got her to fail becoming a ninja at all. In fact the only reason she even became a ninja was so she could continue to chase Sasuke. But that's changed now. Now she actually wanted to contribute to the prosperity of the village. But most of all she wanted fight along side Naruto as an equal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what seemed like no time the pair found themselves in front of Sakura's house with the sun setting over head. \"I had really good time today Naruto.\" she said sincerely \"We should do this again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do this again? Does that mean-\" Naruto was cut off by Sakura giving him a kiss on the cheek and warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow honey.\" she said with a cheeky wink as went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's shrieks of joy could be heard from space.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been two weeks since Sakura and Naruto started dating and it had been nearly two weeks since they last seen each other. Four days after their date Naruto came to her house telling her that he had to go on a very important mission. He said that he had to go find someone to help Lee and Sasuke get better. When she asked Naruto about what happened to Sasuke he told her that Sasuke had tried to kill Itachi Uchiha. The same Itachi that killed the entire Uchiha clan all in one night and was classified as one of the deadliest men in the world, on par with Orochimaru who they barely survived against in The Forest of Death almost two months ago. The same Itachi that also effortlessly fought off four jonin just this morning, THAT Itachi Fucking Uchiha. Yeah it went as well as you would expect, with Sasuke in a coma, he was lucky to be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly everyday since Sakura had come to the hospital to check on Sasuke and Lee. She visited Sasuke mostly out of obligation then for any lingering feelings she had for him. She enjoyed spending time with Lee and she knew that being stuck in the hospital was torture for him so she always made time to visit him everyday for a few hours. When she told Lee that Naruto and her were dating Lee was cool with it, sure he was a little sad that the girl he had a crush on was with someone else, but it was someone he highly respected and knew would treat her right so he wasn't bitter. Though he did say that he will fight Naruto when he's made a full recovery as hearing that Naruto managed to beat Neji and Gaara got Lee pumped up to test his skills against him. Naruto vs Rock Lee..now there was a fight that Sakura had to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Sasuke well..since he's in a coma was not much for conversation. Then again he wasn't much for conversation when he was awake either, especially with her. When they first became a team Sasuke made it very clear that he thought that she was annoying. Just before The Chunin Exams he told her that she was weaker then Naruto. And looking back at it Sakura could see that he was right. At the time all she cared about was getting Sasuke's attention, and using any means to get it. And when she really thought about it one of the main reasons she thought Naruto was annoying at first was because Sasuke thought he was annoying. Everything she did from the way she dressed to the way she thought was all in attempt to impress Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about her past behavior made her sick to her stomach, especially her treatment towards Naruto. But Naruto made it clear time and again the he had forgiven her. And even told her how he impersonated Sasuke when they first became a team just to let her know that there were times where her hated for him was justified. Hearing this of course surprised her and made her angry at him, so much so she didn't speak to him for two days, but after sometime to cool down and think back to that day only with Naruto looking at her with those same warm eyes that she saw and saying how much he wanted to kiss her forehead like he was reading her mind, it made her realize just how much Naruto actually knew Sakura better than she thought. So she told him that she would forgive him on the condition that he would kiss her forehead. Naruto was more then happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess who's back!\" said Naruto entering the room with a very beautiful woman in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naurto!\" Sakura got up from her chair and rushed to embrace her boyfriend. Breaking the hug Sakura looked to the woman curious as to who she was and wondering to herself why she seemed oddly familiar. \"Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade Senju, Fifth Hokage at your service.\" she introduced herself with a polite bow and warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Lady Tsunade?!?!\" Sakura was in shock and awe. She was meeting arguably the greatest kunoichi in the history and one of the most beautiful women in world! The woman that all young girls in the village aspire to be like. And from the looks of it the stories of her beauty were not exaggerated. In fact they didn't do her justice! If flawless skin and a gorgeous face wasn't enough, she had a figure that was fit for a goddess. Her most attention grabbing feature being her enormous breasts that were not only bigger then her head but still round and perky. {What did she eat to get a bod like that?} she thought to herself with a mixture of awe and jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I take it that is Sasuke Uchiha?\" she asked in a professional tone pointing toward the boy on the bed. All Sakura could do was nod \"Very well then, if you will exuse me.\" As she walked toward the bed to work her magic Sakura looked to her boyfriend with the same stunned expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?!\" was all she could say. From what she heard Tsunade vowed to never return to Konoha. Yet here she was not only personally healing Sasuke but saying she was the new Hokage?! How did that happen?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had a wide grin on his face. \"Boy do I have a story to tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't kidding. He gave her the abridged version of his mission to retrieve Tsunade and Sakura almost couldn't believe it, but when he made a Rasengan before her very eyes she found, as well as remembering the fact that he summoned a giant toad to battle a giant sand raccoon, she found her self willing to believe just about anything now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tsunade was done with Sasuke she asked the couple to follow out as she had something to say. \"So your the Sakura Haruno that Naruto wouldn't shut up about.\" she said with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was caught off guard \"What did he say about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only that you were apparently the smartest kunoichi of your generation, exceptionally talented in chakra control, the prettiest girl in the world.\" she listed with growing amusement all the while Sakura got redder by the second \"But what really interested me was that he said such great potential that the only way that you could reach it was by becoming my apprentice.\" Hearing this rocked Sakura to her core. Becoming Tsunade's appertince?! What an honor! \"Now normally I would never even think of such thing. Especially since I'm going to be very busy not just being Hokage, but also the Head of the Hospital.\" Sakura knew it was to good to be true. \"But since Naruto gave you such an ringing endorsement and I owe him a big favor I'm willing to make an exception.\" Sakura was going to rock Naruto Fucking World! \" However! I will give you this only warning. If you decide to receive my training there is no going back. If you really want to be my student the you will only have two options available to you. Become a medic ninja or die!\" This made Sakura's heart stop. \"And this is one time only offer. If you decline then you never get it again. So Sakura Haruno..do you have what it takes to be my apprentice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..To be honest My Lady probably not. But since this idiot has such faith in me-\" she looked at Naruto with a fire in her eye before turning to look at Tsunade \"then I can't afford to let him down. So if my only options are to become a medic ninja or die, THEN I WILL BECOME A MEDIC NINJA OR DIE TRYING!!!\" she roared with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade smiled \"Good answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Author's note: Sasuke hasn't left the village yet and some of the filler arcs, that don't involve finding him, and the movies are canon in my story. Thank you for reading.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tsunade said the only options Sakura had were become a medic ninja or die, she wasn't kidding. Their first lesson consisted of Sakura doing everything she could to dodge Tsunade's full power attacks. Tsunade made it clear that the most essential skill a medic ninja most have is the ability to avoid taking damage. Since it was a medic's duty to save lives on the battlefield, where there are most likely attacks coming from all directions, a medic must be able to make it through No Mans Land to provide medical aid. So with that in mind Sakura's training consisted of her trying to stay alive while dodging punch's that can flatten mountains everyday. And that's just her MORNING training! She also had to study constantly, human and animal anatomy, poisons and antidotes, history of medical science, how many diseases their are and all the ways to treat them, just to name a few things. Sakura felt like her head was going to explode with all the new knowledge she had to learn. But that wasn't the most difficult thing she had to do, oh no, on top of all this she had to constantly channel any excess chakra she had, even when she is fighting or asleep, into her forehead to complete the Strength of A Hundred Seal technique. And she had to do this for a minimum of 3 years!! It's fair to say that Sakura's life was hell..but the results were worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she started seriously training Sakura's skills and contribution to the battlefield sky rocketed. It turns out that she was a born medic as she saved her teammates lives just as many times as they saved hers. Plus she was also learning the secret behind Tsunade's legendary strength so Sakura could now more then hold her own in a fight. And maybe Tsunade was also secretly teaching her the secret behind her legendary beauty as Sakura's figure had really started to fill out. Her waist was a little thinner, her hips a little wider, her legs a little longer with some thicker thighs, a plumper ass and best of all a fuller bust. She was almost as big as Hinata now and she had DD-cups at 13 years old!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even with all the crazy missions and training Sakura still found time to be with Naruto. She didn't care if it was eating ramen, seeing a movie or just sitting together on a bench she would enjoy anytime they had like finding an oasis in the desert. It was the only thing that kept her going when things got tough. In fact we now find her sitting under a tree with her head resting on his shoulder after a long day, just enjoying the rare time to catch her breath with her boyfriend who was just as content as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all good things come to an end far too soon as their alone time was interrupted by Sasuke challenging Naruto to a fight. Sasuke's attitude had been getting colder and more hostile lately, especially to Naruto. Most if not all the arguments they had were started by Sasuke now instead of the other way around and Naruto was getting fed up with it. And now that Sasuke had rudely intruded on his quality time with his girlfriend it was the last straw. So they engaged in a brutal brawl more intense then any of the sparring matches they have had until now. It was almost like they were trying to kill each other, which was proven to be true when they charged at each other with a Chidori and Rasengan. But just before the attacks collided Sakura grab both of their wrists and threw them into nearby trees that were of course obliterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT\"S ENOUGH!!!\" she roared in fury at their stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't concern you Sakura! Stay out of it!\" Sasuke said ready to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a medic! The wellbeing of my teammates is my number one concern!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of my way or I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you'll what?\" said the familiar calm voice of Kakashi-sensei. Even though his voice was calm you could see the anger and disappointment in his eye.\"I think you and I need to have a talk.\" he said as he grabbed Sasuke by the shoulder and Body Flickered away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph serves him right.\" Naruto said with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you're of the hook mister!\" Sakura turned her fury to her idiot boyfriend. \"If your attacks collided there's no telling what could have happened! What were you thinking?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura you know that he totally had it coming-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's beside the point! The point is that if I didn't step in when I did you would have killed each other!\" tears started to fall down her face cutting off any argument that Naruto could come up with. \"Look, I know that you and Sasuke have a lot to settle between yourselves, but your rivalry is not worth your life. If anything were to happen to you-\" she put her hands on her face and started to sob \"I don't know what I'd do!\" Naruto wrapped his arms around her in a strong embrace, wanting to ease her worries. \"It's because of you that I became the person I am today. It thanks to your support that I am able to make it though my hellish training with Master. It because you saved my life so many times that I'm even her to begin with! Without you I'm nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true!\" Naruto firmly but gently grabbed her chin a lifted her face to look her straight in the eye.\"Maybe I did help you from time to time and maybe I made it easier for you to become Granny Tsunade's student, but I know without a doubt that in time you would have impressed Granny enough to make you her student anyway.\" he said with such certainty that it made Sakura swoon \"At the end of the day it's your incredible brain that allows you to understand all those things that Granny makes you study. It's your insane strength and skill that flattened some bad guy faces and saved the day on some of those missions we've been on. And it's your will to improve that keeps you going, that pushes you to better everyday. Sakura..your amazing. You just have to be reminded of that fact sometimes.\" There was no doubt in his voice. He meant every word he said. But that's Naruto for you, what you see is what you get with him. All this helped prove to Sakura something she felt for a while but wasn't quite sure, until now. She loved him. Not liked she \"loved\" Sasuke, oh no, this was real, she could feel it in her very soul. She truly, deeply, loved him. And there was only one way to show how much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto..make love to me.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the first day of the new school year when Gwen Tennyson woke up from her rather restless slumber. It was weird, at the start of the summer she couldn't sleep through Grandpa Max and Ben's snoring, now she can't sleep without it. It had been a week since she came back home and she was surprised on how much she missed Max and Ben. Well Max was a no brainer on why she missed him, he was her favorite Grandparent. But Ben?!  Her Cocky, Selfish, Nut-Brained, Smelly, Doofus of a cousin Ben?!. At the beginning of the summer she would've given anything to be anywhere else in 100 miles of Ben's person, but now (even though she would NEVER admit it) she would give anything to see his dorky but handsome face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen eyes widened and her heart stopped for second {HANDSOME?!?!} she screamed in her head as she grabbed her head with both hands and toss and turned on her bed {What is wrong with me lately?! Ever since that dweeb almost destroyed the universe and we..hugged I can't get him out of my head. And what's worse, it's getting harder to ignore how much he's grown up.} she stopped moving and just stared at her ceiling lost in thought. It's true that while Ben is still cocky and selfish at times (to be honest most children are especially if given an all powerful weapon) he has also risked his life to save people time and again. He has also saved her life many times and even comforted her when she was at her lowest, in his own Nut-brained Ben kind of way. And while they may still argue and fight, it's not with any hostility anymore. It's more so out of habit and honestly it's fun for them to mess with each other. As she thought back on all the time that she and Ben had spent together over the summer, even all the times they fought, Gwen had a fond smile on her face and made the occasional giggle when she thought of Ben making a complete doofus of himself, which was often. All the while a warm, fuzzy feeling filled her heart as it now always did whenever she thought of Ben, which was almost all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben..\" she sighed blissfully to herself before realizing what she was doing. A hot blush went across her face as shook her head trying to get these gross thought's out of her head. She got out of bed and went into her bathroom to splash cold water on her face. \"Get a hold of yourself Gwen.\" she said to herself in the mirror \"You're acting like a bigger dweeb then Ben! And we don't want that now do we?\" she then noticed something while looking in the mirror. The buttons on her pajamas around her chest were tighter. \"Speaking of bigger.\" she fondled her breasts that were now almost too big for her hands. She smiled rather smugly at the fact that she was now not only taller then Ben, but maturing faster then him too. A fact that she couldn't wait to rub in his face when she sees him at school. She finished her morning routine and dressed in her favorite outfit (just like she wears in the cartoon only with bigger breasts) but she notices that her B-cup bra was a little tight. But it wasn't anything she couldn't handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lunch time when finally saw Ben again. She was about to run up to him and surprise him with a tackle, but she noticed that Ben was being approached by school bullies Crash and T.J. She was about to intervene but decided to let Ben handle it {He's faced far worse then these losers even without the Omnitrix} she thought confidently. And her confidence in her cousin was not misplaced as he effortlessly dealt with his former tormentors. He didn't even use the watch as he blocked, dodged and redirected every thing the bullies threw at him. She noticed that Ben was using some of the moves she taught him over the summer to help him fight better when he couldn't go hero and fight even better when he could {Looks like the dweeb was paying attention to my lessons after all} this thought made Gwen very happy, probably happier then it should have but she was too happy and proud of Ben to care. After a minute of getting there butts handed to them Crash and T.J finally had enough and ran off with their tails between their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! You better run! This is what happens when mess with Ben 10! You get your butt kicked 10 ways to Sunday!\" Ben gloated as he often does, not prepared for Gwen tackling him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that right?\" Gwen asked smugly as she had him pinned \"Does that mean your going to kick my butt now?\" she asked while giving him a noogie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GWEN!! Get off of me!\" Ben squirmed under his cousin. Normally she would continue to torment him, but she decided to be nice since she was in a good mood after seeing Ben again, but don't tell him that. She helped him get back on his feet and wrapped her arms around him in a warm hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you Ben.\" she said sincerely with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Uuuhh yeah it's good to see you too.\" he said awkwardly as he patted her on the back a little weirded out by the sudden show of affection. But it wasn't unwelcome as he even started to return the hug with a smile of his own when noticed all the other kids staring at them. \"Uh Gwen I think that's enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? OH!! Right!\" she blushed and quickly broke the hug and took a few steps back in embarrassment while Ben scratched the back of his head with a blush of his own.<br>\r\n\"Ahem..So..Ben 10 huh? That's what your calling yourself now?\" she asked the first thing she could think of to ignore her heart pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's catchy!\" Ben defended his namesake \"I've even been working on a theme song.\" he said proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" she raised an eyebrow in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Check it out.\" he pulled out an I-pod and pressed play (insert Ben 10 theme song here) \"Pretty cool huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that was pretty good.\" she said genuinely impressed \"Quick question though. How did you make it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help from my good old friend Grey Matter.\" Ben answered showing off his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but who did you get to sing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Snort*..*Giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just means..that you sing like a girl!\" she pointed and laughed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr..That's it! Your dead meat!\" Ben chased Gwen around the playground until he finally tackled her to the ground and they started to rough house like they always do when Ben accidentally put his hand on one of Gwen's breasts. Time seemed to freeze as the cousins looked at each other in shock. \"Ahh!\" Ben jumped off Gwen in fright \"Gwen I'm so sorry I didn't to-\" The lunch bell rang letting them both know that class was almost about to start again. Ben look at Gwen not sure of what to do \"I'm sorry!!\" he cried as ran away in shame at what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben wait!! It's okay!\" she called out to him but he either didn't hear her or was too afraid to listen. As she watched her cousin ran off all she think was in that moment when had his hand on her breast..she didn't mind it. In fact all she could think was that in the moment when Ben was on top of her..as she look deep into his emerald green eyes..she wanted to kiss him. \"What is wrong with me?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gwen barely payed attention to the rest of the school day as all she could think about was these weird feelings that she now had for Ben. 3 months ago the thought of being anywhere near him made her want to puke, it still does, but for completely different reasons now. Every time she thought about him her heart would skip a beat, every time she remembered him saving lives it made her knees weak, whenever she would think to all the times Ben nearly died it scared her to death and when she remembered all the times he had her in his arms, as Ben or an alien,(even Stinkfly) she felt safe and warm, like even if the world was ending everything would be okay. Because Ben would always be their to save the day. Even now as she thought back to earlier, when Ben had his hand on her breast, she didn't feel mad or disgusted like she would have 3 months ago. If fact, remembering his touch made her heart pound and her face hot with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening to me?\" she whispered to herself as she pulled her backpack out of her locker to head home for the day. After putting all her stuff neatly in her backpack she went outside to walk home, she felt like some fresh air would help clear her head. But before she left the school grounds she noticed Ben talking to another girl, not just any girl either, but the prettiest, richest, most popular girl in school Jessica. Seeing this made Gwen's blood boil as Jessica was also one of the most evil kids in the world next to Kevin 11. She quickly and quietly went behind a nearby tree to hear what they were talking about and plan for a way to save Ben from Jessica's clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to say Ben, the way you handled those losers during lunch was really impressive.\" Jessica said with a honey sweet voice that made boys swoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw it was nothing. Those dweebs totally had it coming.\" Ben replied with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very true. Hey if your up for it maybe you could help me deal with another dweeb who has it coming, what do you say?\" she batted her blue eyes at him that made all the boys bend to her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..that depends. Which dweeb are we talking about here?\" he asked wanting to make sure that she wasn't trying to trick him into hurting anyone innocent. He had learned his lesson from his first battle with Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nobody special. Just that dorky cousin of yours.\" she said like it was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwen?! I mean I know she's a total dork but what did she ever do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Gee thanks Ben. You sure know how to make a girl feel special.} Gwen thought to herself sarcastically, before shaking her head again to try get these stupid thoughts out of her mind {I mean..not that I care about what you think of me!} she thought in denial with a blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had a dark look in her eye\"That little twerp thinks she better then me just because she got herself a boob job? Well we'll see who's laughing when I pop those little balloons of hers.\" she ranted to herself as a twisted smirk went across her normally pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was really confused and a little freaked out at Jessica's rant. \"Boob job? What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked at Ben like he was a complete idiot.\"I'm talking about those stupid little hooters that she got over the summer! Duh! She thinks that she's impressing anyone just because she somehow got plastic surgery? That little twerp has another thing coming.\" she said with hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was even more confused.\"But Gwen never got a boob job. She just..kinda..filled out is all.\" he said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked him in disbelief before being replaced with a look of understanding \"Oh I see..wanting to protect you cousins reputation by keeping her secret. How sweet.\" she said with mockery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at her \"It's the truth! And your not going to do anything to Gwen!\" he stated with firm resolve. Gwen was touched by Ben's defense of her honor and pissed at Jessica's assumption that she got a boob job. A Boob Job! At 10 Years Old!!! What kind of sick mind would jump to such a conclusion?! Jessica's apparently. As for Jessica she just laughed at Ben's statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I am.\" she said with all the confidence in the world \"And you are not going to do anything to stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would I do that?\" he asked not intimidated in the least. Jessica was surprised at Ben not backing down, but figured he only needed to be reminded of who he was up against before remembering his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because at this school what I say goes. I have the entire football team at my beck and call. I can whisper the right words to the right people and turn you into a social pariah. I can do anything I want. And you can't do anything about it with suffering the consequences. Now..you are going to be a good little boy and stay out of my way as make your geeky little cousins life a living hell. Understand?\" she said with full belief that she was untouchable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was absolutely livid. How dare this harpy threaten Ben like that?! Oh she wasn't worried about herself, she could handle anything Jessica could throw at her. Compared to Hex and Charmcaster this Queen-bee was child's play. But she had the nerve to threaten Her Ben like that?!{This Bitch Is Going To Pay!!}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POW*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica found herself on the ground in shock and pain as she felt her sore cheek no doubt starting to bruise. Gwen was in shock too as before she could give Jessica what she deserved someone beat her to it. That someone being Ben. \"I don't care what you do to me. I can take it. But no one threatens Gwen in front of me. Anything you do to her, I'll unleash on you 10 fold.\" he said with cold fury.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Make that 10,000 fold.\" Gwen said finally revealing herself surprising Ben and Jessica. \"You don't scare either of us Jessica. So go ahead spread rumors about us, sick your football dunderheads at us, do whatever want. Because all you will be doing in the end is making it easier for us to humiliate you over and over again when everything you do backfires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica couldn't believe what was happening. All her threats and supposed power was meaningless. Every other kid in school was terrified of her, but these two just looked at her with completely fearless. She tried to muster what pride she had left as she stood up.\"You will regret this.\" she said as threateningly as she could before storming off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm not likely.\" said Ben unfazed. That was until he felt Gwen kissing him on the cheek. He froze solid as his face turned bright red and heart felt like it was about to burst. Gwen wasn't fairing much better.

And..thank you for sticking up for me.\" she said genuinely with a warm smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't..mention..it..\" he said in a daze. Gwen just giggle at the silly grin on his face.</span></div></div>",
