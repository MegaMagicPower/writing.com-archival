The Inuzuka had expected it to happen, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fatter ninja had invited Kiba out to lunch in celebration of the dog ninja's 18th birthday. Kiba figured he could always do with a free meal, so it wasn't much of a problem for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmf... Kiba... Why aren't you eating anything?\" Choji questioned, a large stack of empty bowls next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Inuzuka had already had two, but it was clear that didn't mean a whole lot in his companion's books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...

Celebrate your birthday, why don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Choji...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed a bit at his friend, admiring his large belly a bit. He reached out one of his tanned hands, and gently rubbed it while he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh... You sure, Kiba?\" Choji asked, not seeming to mind having his flab rubbed at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know...\" replied Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! I saw you admiring my body a bit...

Bring out all the ramen you got!\" As his meal was being prepared, Kiba smirked toothily. \"Naruto's not the only one who can put it away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji blinked as several bowls were brought out to Kiba. His stomach growled hungrily, but decided to wait and see how Kiba would make out. He might have a fellow glutton on his hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kiba grabbed a pair of chopsticks and began slurping the noodles up. He went at it crazily, not stopping for a second. Every time he finished a bowl, a new one was brought out. As Kiba downed 6 bowls, Choji looked on, mildly impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba continued feasting, his stomach began growing, bulging slightly with every bowl of ramen he consumed. Choji looked on, now very intrigued, as Kiba's stomach steadily grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter at least 30 minutes, Kiba finished his last bowl and downed the broth, slamming it down on the counter. He sighed in contentment and leaned back, smiling and closing his eyes. His stomach was now a rather large bulge pressing against his black jacket, which Kiba began rubbing with a hand. Kiba laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'd like to see Naruto beat that!\" the dog-nin sighed happily. He stood up and stretched, turning to Choji. \"So, Choji, whaddaya think?\" he asked, gesturing to his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji scrutinized his fellow ninja's gut. \"Hmm... fine, but you could do better.\" Chuckling at Kiba's shocked expression Choji left his seat. \"Tell you what, I'll meet you again for lunch tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked. \"Really?\" He stretched and yawned; the massive, fattening meal had made him a bit sleepy. \"What didja' have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Choji replied. \"It's a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaw dropping, Kiba protest. \"Hey, what the hell? Why won't you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji waved him off. \"Trust me, you'll love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to placate Kiba slightly, but he still shrugged. \"Eh, alright. Well, talk to ya tomorrow, Choji; I need to go get Akamaru from the vet.\" He began walking off, arms behind his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji watched Kiba leave with a smile. \"I hope you're really hungry tomorrow, Kiba...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba walked toward Choji in the village square, Akamaru at his side. He smiled as he walked up to the corpulent ninja, his own stomach still very large and prominent, and still pressing against his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Choji, what're we doing for lunch?\" Kiba asked the other ninja.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why couldn't Choji just tell him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got his answer sooner than he expected. Choji leaned in towards Kiba's ear, and whispered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured we'd find some of the others, plump 'em up, then eat them when they're nice and big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gasped, stumbling back and nearly tripping over Akamaru. \"W-what?! The hell are you talking about, Choji? We can't do that, that's cannibalism!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji chuckled, shaking his head; he'd expected this reaction. \"Relax, Kiba, it's not as bad as you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choji,\" Kiba growled, \"How can it not be bad? We're eating our comrades and friends alive!\" He shuddered at the thought of doing such a thing to Hinata, or heck, even Shino...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji didn't seem bothered in the least. \"What I mean is,\" he began, thumping his stomach, \"Is that they'll be alive even after we've eaten them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought Kiba up short. \"Wha...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be better to just show you,\" Choji offered. Abruptly, he pointed to Kiba. \"First, lift up your jacket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked. \"Uh, okay...\" he grasped the bottom of his black jacket and lifted it up a bit, exposing his protruding, net shirt covered stomach. \"Okay, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lift up the net shirt, too,\" Choji instructed. Still confused, Kiba nonetheless did as he was instructed, exposing his bare stomach to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Choji, I've done it, but I still don't...\" Kiba was cut off as Choji lunged forward, palm pointed outwards. Kiba's cry of shock was choked off his Choji struck his stomach, HARD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Grunting in pain, Kiba fell back onto the ground, clutching his stomach in pain. Angrily, he glared at his fellow ninja. \"Choji, what the hell was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Choji answered him. \"Secret Akimichi jutsu.\" He held up his palm, showing an odd symbol was drawn upon it. \"When I hit your gut, the inside of your stomach was changed a bit. That way, even after you've eaten someone and digested them, their chakra will stay inside your belly.\" He pointed to his own concealed stomach, indicating that he'd done the same to himself. \"Once you're done, all you need to do is draw the symbol I just showed you on the ground, smear a bit of your blood on it, and...\" He spread his arms wide. \"...Everyone you've eaten will appear, not hurt in the least. Of course, if you're still hungry, you can eat them again, summon them, eat them again, bring them back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, who had been listening to this explanation, had been growing more intrigued, his mouth eventually twisting upwards into a smile. This became a full-on grin once Choji got to the final part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was great! He could eat as much as he wanted, and not feel guilty about hurting anyone else! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba pulled his net shirt and jacket back down, got up, dusted himself off, and looked at Choji. \"Well, when you put it like that...\" He smirked. \"I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji laughed heartily. \"Great to hear that, Kiba! Now, who do you want to go for first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba thought for a minute. \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'll be a nice morsel to start us off!\" A thoughtful expression came across his face. \"How are we gonna get him to fatten himself up, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow. \"That is actually a good point; I doubt he'd listen to us.\" He smiled, rummaging around in his pocket. \"Good thing I got these.\" He pulled out fifteen colorful strips of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji's eyes widened. \"Are those what I think they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded. \"Yeah, coupons to Ichiraku's. Each one's good for three extra-large bowls of ramen with the works. If Konohamaru really wants to be like Naruto, he'll go all out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji smiled broadly, pleased at this turn of events. \"By the way, where'd you get these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"You know that eating contest I was in a while back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji blinked. \"You mean the one Hinata won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog-nin grimaced. \"Yeah, that one. Didn't think she could eat so much and not have it go to her gut...\" Kiba shook his head; he was getting off-track. \"Anyway, I only got 20 or so bowls down before fainting.\" He rubbed his stomach absentmindedly. \"Got a nice gut there, too.\" He turned his attention back to the coupons. \"Anyway, everyone who didn't win got these as consolation prizes. Of course,\" Kiba laughed, \"Naruto went through his in a day.\" He laughed again, this time with a slightly derisive tone. \"You shoulda seen him, Choji. His jacket was open (the baka's gut probably forced it open while he was eating), his gut was stickin' out from under his shirt, his fly was down and his button was undone...\" Kiba paused to take a breath. \"And still the idiot was smiling, laying down and rubbing his gut like he didn't have a care in the world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kiba?\" Choji cut in. It's not that he didn't want to hear about Naruto stuffing himself; in fact, he wouldn't have minded fattening Naruto up as Kiba had described him before swallowing him whole, but he wanted to hear what Kiba had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh,\" Kiba started. \"Anyway, I was thinking we could leave these where the kid could find them, keep an eye on him, and just watch how things go from there.\" Kiba smirked. \"And I know just where to leave 'em...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Konohamaru scratched his head, reaching into his mailbox. He'd just gotten home from another mission (he was beginning to see why Naruto-niichan hated chasing after cats,) and had just been about to go inside when he saw brightly colored strips of paper sticking out of the metal box's side. He grabbed the strips and held them up to his eyes; as he looked at the characters inscribed upon them, his confusion quickly became elation. \"Free ramen! All right! I can finally beat Naruto-niichan and eat more ramen than he ever has!\" Without pausing to think about why the coupons were in his mailbox in the first place, he darted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji and Kiba peeked out from the side of a nearby building. Kiba gave a short laugh, a smug look coming across his face. \"Step one: completed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Konohamaru was sitting at Ichiraku, eating furiously. He was only five bowls in, but already his stomach was starting to take on a slightly rounded appearance. Konohamaru took no notice of this; the minute he was done with his fifth extra-large bowl (about three times larger than a typical one), he set it aside and called loudly for the next one. As he started on his sixth bowl, he failed to notice Kiba and Choji watching from nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba whistled. \"Damn, look at that kid go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji raised his eyebrows. \"Wow, he really does eat like Naruto...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled. \"Like that's bad for us?\" He turned to Choji. \"C'mon, Choji, let's move a little closer and see how he does.\" He started off. Choji, all too happy to comply, soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Konohamaru was about 20 bowls in, and he wasn't showing any signs of stopping. From their place next to him, Choji and Kiba watched in growing (ha!) anticipation. They weren't worried about being spotted; the kid was way too engrossed in his ramen to notice anything else. At present, their eyes were trained on the genin's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past few minutes, they had watched as the boy's belly had grown, increasing slightly in size with every bowl that he finished. At present, it now stuck out a good two inches or so in front of him. The front of his pants had become slightly strained, and his shirt had risen up just enough to show a tiny bit of skin, just above his increasingly strained pants button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting good,\" Choji whispered to his fellow glutton, who smiled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is. Glad I thought of it.\" Face lighting up, he turned to Choji. \"And just think; he still has 25 bowls to go. He keeps this up, we'll be eating great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it was at this moment that Konohamaru abruptly stopped. Dropping his chopsticks, he groaned, clutching his swollen gut. Teuchi, from his position on the other side of the counter, frowned. \"You're looking a little sick there, kid; you wanna take a break? You don't have to eat all the bowls now, you know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Choji grimaced in horror; their plan could go wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the two gluttons, Konohamaru opened his eyes. \"N-no! I'm not gonna let Naruto nii-chan eat more than me!\" He sat up straight, slamming his hands on the counter. \"Bring out the next bowl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi, his face full of unease, nonetheless complied, and his hungry patron resumed eating with fervor. Kiba and Choji breathed a sigh of relief; their plans were still on track!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty bowls later, Konohamaru was still eating. His belly had swollen further, and it showed on his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants button quivered ominously, looking as though it were about to give. His shirt had risen up considerably, exposing more of his growing belly; any higher and his belly button would see the light of day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing his twenty-first bowl, Konohamaru lifted it to his mouth, and tipped it as he proceeded to drink the broth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, his button, no longer able to take the strain, shot off with an audible POP! It flew into the bottom of the counter and ricocheted off. Akamaru yelped in alarm as the flying disc shot by his massive head, barely nicking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely oblivious to this turn of events, Konohamaru continued eating, even as his fly rapidly pried itself open and his stomach, belly button and all, surged forth. When he'd finished his fourty-fourth bowl, his shirt was all but resting on top of the bloated mass that was his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, he glanced at the final bowl, a look of resignation coming across his face. Teuchi seemed almost relieved, while Kiba and Choji waited with bated breath; could the young ninja do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir question was soon answered. Konohamaru, steeling himself, grabbed the full bowl and tipped its contents, noodles, fixings, and all, down his gullet. Once it was all down, he slammed the bowl onto the counter and leaned back, arms hanging at his sides. Kiba and Choji gazed with barely-contained excitement at his stomach, the bare skin of which was now pressed against the counter, and the size of which forced his shirt to rest completely on top of it, unable to cover it lest it start to rip. Then their eyes wandered to the boy's face. Konohamaru wore a smile of pure contentment and satisfaction, his eyes closed as he breathed deeply. It occurred to the two gluttons that the boy had fallen asleep, moments after finishing the last bowl. Suddenly, another thought occurred to them: this was their chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and assuring Teuchi that they'd carry him home, Kiba and Choji hefted the boy (with some difficulty, owing to his distended belly) between them. They carried him throughout the streets, trying not to notice the baffled looks of the villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting with exertion, Kiba looked up at his fellow ninja, a hopeful expression on his face. \"So, uh, Choji, can I take this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji looked a bit reluctant, but nodded anyway. \"Eh, why not. This is your first people-meal, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering his thanks, Kiba continued to carry the stuffed genin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few minutes before they reached a secluded field where they could proceed without interruption. They laid the unconscious Konohamaru, watching his stomach (which, blessedly, had shrunk in the least,) rise and fall as he snored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gulped. \"Alright, Choji, how do I...uh...do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling in understanding, Choji instructed the dog-nin. \"Pick him up...no, head first, that'll make it easier... hold him up...ok, now open wide...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba followed his instructions, picking up the younger boy by his midsection (or at least part of his midsection) and repositioned him so his head was facing towards Kiba. Then, the dog-nin opened his mouth wide, while Akamaru watched, anxious. He really hoped Kiba knew what he was doing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one last uncertain look at the Akimichi, Kiba began slowly moving the fattened genin towards his gullet, feeling a shudder come over him as the boy's head entered his mouth....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Kiba smiled. \"So, Choji...\" he began, looking around the restaurant. \"What should we start with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji looked thoughtful for a minute. \"Hmm... let's start with the biggest thing they have, then just keep on ordering until all the food's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, patting his belly. \"Sounds good!\" When a waiter came by, they ordered a massive platter of assorted meats. As the waiter went to the kitchen to put the order in, Choji looked at Kiba's belly; his jacket was unbuttoned, but his net shirt still remained, still covering his bloated gut. \"Kiba, you sure you don't want to take that off? It might get a little uncomfortable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged. \"Ah, it's okay. It'll probably burst by the time we're done here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji laughed to himself. At least Kiba was thinking on the same page as him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the raw meat was brought out and placed on the table-grill to cook. It wasn't long before it was done to their satisfaction. Nodding at each other, they went at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba ate like a wild animal (somewhat fitting, actually,) shoving both large and small pieces of meat into his mouth and chewing noisily before gulping them down. However, he hadn't forgotten about Akamaru; every third piece he came across, he tossed to his buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji ate with a fervor that was equal to, if not greater than, Kiba's. He shoveled meat into his mouth at an alarming pace, only chewing enough to swallow without choking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, both ninjas had finished the meal, and were now lying back and patting their stomachs. Choji's already sizable belly had increased in size, manifesting as a bulge, albeit not as big as Kiba's, against his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's stomach had also swelled in size, and was literally just an inch away from pressing against the table. His net shirt had, surprisingly, not burst yet, but it had nonetheless ridden up over his belly, exposing the bare, pink flesh of the stomach and the navel situated at the center of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba patted his belly in satisfaction and looked at Choji. \"Damn, that was good...\" Kiba sighed. Choji, rubbing his own belly through his shirt, just smiled and nodded in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Kiba, any ideas on what to get next?\" Choji asked his fellow ninja. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba almost looked thoughtful before replying...</span></div></div>",

Can we get the same meal?\" he called out to the waiters. \"And add twice as much meat to it!\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of minutes before the massive meal was laid out before them, causing the two prospective gluttons to drool a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji wiped his mouth. \"Wow, this looks sooo good...\" he mumbled in sheer anticipation and bliss. He was right; most of the meat was still sizzling and bubbling with grease, just waiting to be devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, though he was excited as well, hesitated. \"Something wrong, Kiba?\" Choji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed. \"It's nothing.\" Even as he said this, he reached down to his waist, fiddling with his pants button before finally getting a good grip on it and unbuttoning it. Almost immediately, his stomach bulged out slightly, finally beginning to press against the table. This also caused his zipper to undo itself slightly, although his pants still remained partially zipped. \"Okay, now I'm ready. You ready, boy?\" he asked Akamaru. The large dog woofed happily in affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji grabbed a pair of chopsticks, grabbing several pieces of meat with it. \"What are we waiting for? Let's eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba needed no second bidding; he set upon the large meal with an unsettling ferocity.

However, they were in for quite a surprise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\" Kiba asked, upon seeing the blonde ninja sitting on one of the stools, happily eating his ramen (as usual.) Upon hearing Kiba's voice, Naruto turned around. He blinked his eyes in confusion. \"Kiba? Choji? What are you guys doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba replied, \"What do ya think, idiot? We're hungry.\" Naruto bristled slightly at the joking insult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji nodded. \"This is only our first stop, actually.\" He chuckled at Naruto's confused expression. \"We're gonna eat out the entire town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAAAT?\" Naruto practically yelled, disturbing the ramen shack's owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Uh huh. And we're already off to a great start; yesterday, I ate more bowls than I've ever seen you have,\" he boasted as he gestured at his bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Naruto's confused expression became determined. \"Yeah? Well, I bet I could eat even more! Hey!\" he called out. \"Give me 10 bowls of miso ramen! And don't stop bringing them out until it's gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji and Kiba started at this, even as they took their seats.

He whispered something to Naruto, who's face lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An eating contest?\" he exclaimed, beaming as his first few bowls were brought out. \"You're on!\" He immediately began slurping up his ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a short amount of time, Kiba and Choji had ordered their own bowls and were ravenously devouring every bowl brought out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wins?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba and Choji ate as fast as they could, but Naruto was at the top of his game that day. For every five bowls that the two prospective gluttons downed, Naruto downed two more. Kiba and Choji did not fail to notice this, and ate even faster, bowls continuing to pile on their side of the counter, but Naruto always managed to stay two bowls ahead, even with Akamaru laying beneath Kiba and Choji to pick off any stray noodles that fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three were so caught up in trying to stay ahead of one another, they only took peripheral notice of their bellies, slowly growing with the sheer amount of food being ingested. Kiba's already bloated stomach slowly but surely grew even more, forcing his net shirt up and exposing his belly. Choji, feeling an uncomfortable tightness around his stomach, clumsily reached an arm around his back and undid the clasp holding his chestplate to his body, before grabbing the undone straps and tossing the armor behind him. He immediately resumed eating, his already apparent stomach forming an ever-growing bulge under his shirt, the flesh beginning to peek out just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's belly,however, went even further; first, it slowly swelled, pushing against his jacket and forming a rather large bulge. Then, as he continued gorging himself, it grew even further. This, apparently, caused a fair amount of discomfort to Naruto, if his wince was anything to go by. He quickly rectified this by taking one arm (the other still shoveling ramen into his mouth) and unzipping his jacket, revealing his bloated stomach, still covered by his black shirt (bearing the insignia of the Leaf, of course.) This released a good deal of the pressure, causing Naruto to sigh happily before returning to eating in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, his belly was far from finished. As its owner continued shoveling noodles into his mouth, it expanded more still, causing his shirt to begin rising up. As Naruto's stomach continued growing, more and more of his stomach saw the light of day, until at last his shirt rested firmly on top of the large protrusion. As the ramen started coming slower (due to the shop once again starting to run out of ramen,) it began expanding less noticeably, but still began creating some more pressure on his pants. Naruto, even through his frenzied eating, did not fail to notice this, and used one of his arms to unbutton and unzip his pants. The release of pressure did two things; it made Naruto once again sigh happily, and caused his stomach to bulge out, no longer under restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the last bowl had been consumed, and the three stuffed ninja began running a tally of their bowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got 34 bowls,\" Kiba called, leaning back and placing his hands on his stomach. \"Hell yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate 39,\" Choji announced, smacking his stomach, a decent amount of which was now visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked at Naruto, who was serenely leaning back and massaging his belly with both hands. Suddenly, his eyes shot open and called out his number, to the dismay of both of his fellow ninja:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"62!\" The blonde ninja laughed, before noticing something about Kiba. \"Hey, Kiba, your pants look a little tight. You wanna do something about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Kiba frowned angrily at this, but then felt the tightness around his waistline. Mumbling a reluctant thanks, he reached both hands down and undid his pants, causing his stomach to bulge, much as Naruto's had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Naruto returned to rubbing his stomach, smiling at the soothing sensations and ocassionally rubbing a couple of fingers over his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laid back, rubbing his own belly in much the same fashion, but not paying much attention to the feeling, pleasurable as it was. \"I got beaten again,\" Kiba thought, making a disgruntled face. \"I thought I could eat more than that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was startled by someone nudging his side. Blinking, he turned to Choji, who was also rubbing his belly, but with only one arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba, may it's not so bad that we lost.\" Choji reassured him, placing a hand on the dog-nin's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, clearly confused, simply stared back. \"What do ya mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" Choji replied, gesturing discreetly at Naruto, \"Is that we could use this to our advantage. I mean, look how big Naruto's belly's gotten. He ate more than either of us. So, what do you say we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He glanced at Naruto, still massaging his stuffed gut and grinning. Against his will, Kiba found himself licking his lips. The size of Naruto's belly...the way its smooth surface expanded and contracted with each breath...having that inside of his own belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a thought cut through Kiba's longing observations. \"Wait a sec, Choji; How are we both gonna eat him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portly ninja thought this out. \"Huh. You do have a point, Kiba...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Choji had a thought of his own. \"Actually, there's a way we can both eat him... and we can do it for days!\" Choji looked absolutely ecstatic about this prospect, much to Kiba's confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choji? What do you...\" He didn't even finish the sentence before realization struck him. \"Oh yeah, his Shadow Clone Technique!\" Kiba smiled slightly, which grew even more as he realized the implications: tens, dozens, maybe even hundreds of Narutos, each with engorged bellies, sliding down his throat and into his stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it; it was decided. \"Wait here for a second, Choji.\" Getting up from his seat, he made his way over to Naruto (he did so with some difficulty, due to his incredibly stuffed belly). Taking a deep breath, Kiba made his move. \"Hey, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped massaging his gut to look up at Kiba. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba groaned inwardly at Naruto's blank look, before shooting a glance at Choji. \"Me and Choji found something really cool earlier. You wanna come see it with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Naruto's eyes brightened. \"Sure! How cool is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shared a sly look with Choji. \"Trust us, it'll blow your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it for Naruto. With speed surprising for one so stuffed, he leapt to his feet, his stomach shaking as he did so. \"I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Kiba replied, grinning. He gestured to the left, without any real destination in mind. \"It's this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for Naruto; steeling his body, he took his first running step...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to stop short, as his own belly, even more swelled than Kiba's, stopped him, causing him to stumble. His stomach shook again, the mass of exposed flesh rippling as Naruto tripped and desperately tried to regain his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Choji watched their fellow bloated ninja with increasing interest as he regained his balance, lost it, got it back, and lost it again. This was gonna be good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
