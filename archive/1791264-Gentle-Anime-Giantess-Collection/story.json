You got into bed and slowly went to sleep thinking of kagome and mentally wishing that she was here in the real world with you. As you dreamed of your crush, there is a shooting star flying over your house and it glowed in response to your mental wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was morning, you woke up hearing your phone alarm plus the rays of the ball of light shining in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Another dream that won't come true.' You thought before getting ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were getting ready, your thoughts were replaying the dream of you meeting your dream crush and your phone was going off again like a message from someone or call coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d You asked wondering who was calling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, (Your Name), it's Alex.\u201d They said and you nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, phone and the glaring ball of hot gas woke me up.\u201d You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother dream of your crush?\u201d They asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d You said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we can hangout today till something happens.\u201d They said as the call ended and you went to finish getting ready for your day with your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, your wish was granted and you and your friend will be with the person of your dreams. A person standing on the roof of the apartment building you live in eating an apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoon you will have your chance.\u201d They said before fading into the wind like a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you walked outside wearing a white windbreaker, black muscle shirt, dark blue jeans, and red runnimg shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm glad it's getting closer to winter.\u201d You said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, (Your Name)!\u201d Alex called out and you turned around to see a person wearing a grey jacket, yellow shirt, black pants, and blue combat boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Alex.\u201d You said and they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you went to get something to eat for breakfast and after that you two went for a walk in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were talking about your dreams of your crush to Alex and you were getting tips about the dreams about what they could mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the walk, both of you found a stone built well and you recognize it as the Bone-eater Well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was never here before now.\u201d You said walking around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's the well?\u201d Alex asked and you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you were examining it before the ground shook with enough force to make you two fall into the well. There was a glow of the well before it faded and the well with it. Everything went black for you two.</span></div></div>",

Although you do not consider yourself to be up to the ranks of Yugi Moto and Seto Kaiba, you surely consider yourself better than the scrubs that populate your city. There was one girl you respected however. Her name was Akiza Izinski and she was perhaps one of the best duelists out there. You arrived at her house, knocking on the door in anticipation. As you waited, several strategies flew through your head on how to be Akiza. You and her were practically even in terms of battle strength and being the competitive man that you were, didn't like that. There had to be away to destroy Akiza without breaking a sweat. You just knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flew open and Akiza's smiling face was reveled. You on the other hand were not smiling. You were determined to beat Akiza once and for all. You thought about all the cards in your deck: Dark Magician Girl, Dark Magician, Swords of Revealing Light, Change of Heart, Pot of Greed, Black Luster Solider, Red Eyes Black Dragon, Labyrinth, Mind Control, F.G.D., Judgement Dragon, Acid Trap Hole, Trap Dustshoot, Kuriboh, Cyber-Stein, Stardust Dragon, as well as many other cards that would finally seal the demise of Akiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Akiza. Enough of the friendly face. Let's duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ryan. Always so eager to duel. Just come in. Let's talk...as friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. Not until I beat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minor conflict caused Akiza's tattoo to glow a reddish hue. Her body slowly began expanding. Her arms got wider and longer, as did her legs and head. Her body expanded in all directions. It looked like Akiza was growing in height right before the eyes of her rival! Akiza pushed you out of the way and ran out of her house into the middle of the sidewalk. You could only sit and watch at Akiza's transformation. Akiza's height shot up to seven feet. Then ten. Then fifteen. Then twenty-five. Akiza stopped growing at a whopping fifty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Akiza said. \"How did I get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely speechless. Akiza turned her giant head towards you and stared you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still wanna duel?\" Akiza taunted.</span></div></div>",

M-maybe t-tomorrow.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza shed a giggle, shaking the ground into a light earthquake. You, being scared out of your pants, quickly used your duel disk to activate a duel with yourself, and summoned Stardust Dragon to fly away. \"Ryan. Where must you be going?\" Akiza said, plucking you from Stardust Dragon's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaah!\" You yelled, being held by Akiza's fingers. \"Why are you so scared Ryan?\" Akiza asked. \"Oh, you're so tiny compared to me! You're just so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza is obviously deciding to try and play around with you, so you had to make a drastic plan to get away. \"<i>It's either now or never.</i>\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stardust Dragon! I activate you're second ability to Mirage Synchro (A New type of Synchro that allows any Dragon to synchro with another dragon in the deck, tuner or not) you with Judgement Dragon!\" You said. \"Rise!

While Ash was busy taunting, Misty took this time to appreciate the finer things in life. These woods were home to some of the most exotic pokemon. She looked up into the trees, but didn't spot any pokemon. What she did spot, however, was another type of wild life.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHanging from the dark brown branch of a low tree was a golden berry. Misty, naturally curious, plucked the berry and marveled at it's shiny plate. Misty brought the unique fruit up to her nose and sniffed. It smelled just like any other berry. Curious if it contained a exotic flavor, Misty bit into the berry. Instantly her tongue tasted a magnitude of flavors. Cherry, vanilla, banana, chocolate, blueberry, even a couple of flavors she couldn't even describe. However, her tongue wasn't the only thing undergoing a transformation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMisty slowly grew. Her legs, torso, and everything that was her expanded in proportion. Her height slowly grew. 7 feet. 8 feet. 9 feet. 10. But then her height gradually began to grow as the flavor in her mouth faded. 15 feet. 25 feet. 40 feet. As the flavor from the golden completely depleted, Misty stood in awe as she was fifty feet tall.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Um...Ash.\" Misty whispered.</span></div></div>",

She then opened her eyes, not able to sleep, and decided to go see the Deku Tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Deku Tree, however was sleeping, and Navi saw the Kokiri Emerald, which had been returned by the fair Princess Zelda, which should now be called as Queen Zelda, as she is the true ruler of the Hyrulian Land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi saw the Kokiri Emerald wiggle, and wiggle, and eventually begin to fall off. She tried to catch it, but due to lack of true hands, she ended up having to hold it with her entire form. A green glow come from the Kokiri Emerald blinded her sight, and gave her the power to---allow her to change into a human like fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her body touched the Kokiri Emerald, there was a flash of light and to her everything looked smaller. She flew to a mirror and she looked to see her new form. She is 6\u20193\u201d, has light tan skin color, transparent blue and white wings, ocean blue eyes, wearing a set of clothes with different shades and tints of blue, and has sky blue hair. She is also wearing a gold necklace around her neck with little emeralds, gold bracelets on her wrists with little rubies, and gold ankle bracelets with little sapphires in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll right, so this is after the Deku Tree has woken up, seeing Navi in a human state, knowing it is her because her wings are out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi, is that you, how art thou is such a humanly form as the Hero of Time? Was it my Kokiri Emerald that did that to you?\" Deku Tree asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi looked at the Deku Tree before blushing with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is me Great Deku Tree. The Emerald did this to me.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Navi, why have thou done this. Does thou wish to see thine Hero of Time once again? Is this why thou had used the prowess of the crystal to make you a human-fairy hybrid?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just shook her head and shrug her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just happened and I don't know why the crystal changed me into this form.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Maybe it wishes for thou to do something with its powers. Well, whatever it may be, will you accept the challenge?\" Deku Tree asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her body before looking back at the Deku Tree with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I will accept the challenge head on.\" She said with determination<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mine mind has known of thus challenge for years, if thee are willing, I shall tell it to you.\" Deku Tree said. \"First, you must returnith to me with the other Spiritual Stones, as you know, the Goron Ruby, and Zora Sapphire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will return with the Spiritual Stones.\" Navi said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I expect thee to come back successful.\" Deku Tree said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi nodded before flying out of the forest to avoid being noticed by the Kokiris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she does well.\" Deku Tree said, before falling back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi flew till she reached the entrance of the Kokiri Forest and she looked back into the forest remembering Link and Sara, but her form start to switch between fairy and human. Soon her body is human only with her wings and she started to walk toward goron's mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to make it to the Goron Sanctuary before I fully change back to fairy, and this challenge would be for nothing.\u201d Navi said, switching between flying and running towards Kakiriko Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Navi was running/flying to Kakiriko Village, a person notice her and he was running to catch up to her. He was wearing a tan cloak with his face covered and covering his clothes, he looked to be a head taller than navi; but he has black clothes under his cloak and his face is Hyrulean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Navi asked, panting from running, as it was her first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a traveler passing through and I think that you may need some help with your challenge.\" The man said with a smile before picking up Navi and putting her on his back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...do you know of the...challenge? I thought only the Deku Tree knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled before picking up speed as she wrapped her arms around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He still does, but as for how I knew; it\u2019s one of my gifts and I can tell that you will need a hand reaching the top of the mountain.,\" the man said as he reached the stairs and ran up in a flash into the village and onto the gate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help.\" Navi said to the man, now at the base of Goron Mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I possibly get your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was thinking for a moment before setting her on the ground and a sword appeared on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Fado Zheitk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may still need my help.,\" He said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the assistance. Let's continue up the mountain shall we?\" Navi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded before running up the mountain with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's.\" He said as he pulled out his sword ready for anything<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ran up the mountain, Fado taking on any fire Tectites with his sword, until they finally reached the Goron Sanctuary by nightfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help. It was...helpful. I guess I could say.\" Navi said, shaking hands with Fado. \"I'll go get the Goron Ruby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi walked into the sanctuary and went to speak with the leader of the gorons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have come for the Goron Ruby.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Goron Ruby?\" Darunia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you ever want such a thing? Sure I have it, but it's with my son Link in the Fire Temple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a challenge from the Deku Tree and I need the Goron Ruby for it.\" Navi explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Darunia said simply, pushing the statue he stood in front of to reveal the door to the Volcano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the way Navi.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded with a smile before she walked into the volcano to get inside the fire temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Thank you Darunia.\" She said before leaving for the volcano<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi entering the Volcano, got extremely sweaty, and then soon collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too...much...heat. I must keep going though\" Navi said, continuing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it to the Fire Temple, and met with Darunia's son, who was named after Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dad told me you were coming, let me lead you to the Goron's Ruby.\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes thank you, Link.\" She said following him to the ruby<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink the Goron led Navi through the Fire Temple, took the Goron Ruby out of a Wall, and gave it smiling to Navi without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very, Link. I shall now leave.\" Navi said, leaving with the Goron Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon navi left the temple and the volcano with the goron ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Darunia for the ruby.\" Navi said stopping by the leader of the gorons and leaving to meet with fado outside of the sanctuary.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-XII, XXIV-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA normal day of winter passed over Kokiri Forest, it has been a full five years since the legendary Hero of Time stood his own against the Gerudo King in battle. Peace had returned to Hyrule in the time and seasons began to make realm-goers fully aware. The Great Deku Tree's offspring, who went simply by the name Deku, given to him by Queen Zelda when she returned the Kokiri Emerald; was waiting for a familiar blue fairy to come for her daily visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small blue light flying to the offspring of the Great Deku Tree and it was the fairy, Navi. \"I'm sorry Deku, I made you wait too long.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright Navi.\" Deku smiled. \"How are you feeling lately? It's been five years since you left Link, are you still depressed you can no longer see him?\" Deku asked that question every day, but never really got a reply. He wondered when it'd be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed at the thought. \"Yes, but I think I will see him again if I was on a quest. I'm feeling ok as usual, but I still miss him.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then Navi, do come closer.\" Deku said, as the small fairy neared him. \"I was going to send Saria on a journey to Castle Town across Hyrule Field for an errand.\" Deku muttered. \"How about instead of her regular fairy partner, you assist her this time around.\" \"Come back tonight for she'll leave tomorrow.\" Deku said. \"I'll have a present to behold you with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi was surprised to hear that Deku would send on with Saria on an errand to the castle, but she nodded and she felt happy. \"Thank you, Deku. I will come back tonight for your gift.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-XII, XXV- (Midnight)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku stayed awake for the time being, waiting for Navi to arrive. He planned to give her a brand new form she could change in and out of at will by giving her the power in the Kokiri Emerald. She would become slightly human, while retaining Hyrulian and Kokiri skin color, she'd also gain height and bodily features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light blue light coming to him and it was Navi like she promised earlier in the day. \"I had to wait for everyone to fall asleep before coming here, Deku.\" Navi said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is quite alright Navi.\" Deku smiled. \"Now do you see the Kokiri Emerald hung upon the Sacred Branch?\" Deku smiled as the Kokiri Emerald swung from the Branch and fell towards Navi, slowly reducing in size, and falling around her like a jewel necklace. \"Focus your energy and power.\" Deku said. \"Focus, and then behold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Deku.\" She said. She did as he asked and focused her energy and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi began to focus her energy, and her body began to form from a light of a fairy to a Hyrulian body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and was startled by her new form, but still kept her focus on her energy. \"Is this your gift Deku?\" She asked looking over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my dearest Navi.\" Deku smiled down to her, as she was not able to fly up to his face. \"However might I suggest putting these on.\" Deku dropped her a female Kokiri outfit remodeled and recolored to fit and style her. It was an aquatic blue dress skirt with blue leggings, a belt that drooped down a tad, and her shirt brinking just off her shoulders and being able to button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had looked down and noticed that she was naked before making an 'eep' sound. She took the clothes and went behind the Deku tree before putting on the clothes. \"Thank you, Deku.\" She said with haste before coming out into his line of sight wearing the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome Navi. I just thought you might want some clothes so you don't go running through the forest naked. While they be eternal children, the Kokiri are still kids, they aren't, como de' say, 'ready' to see a naked body.\" Deku explained. \"Now go find Saria, I've informed her you'd be unfamiliar, but go now Navi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi nodded and she ran off to find Saria. \"I'll see you later, deku; after we have completed the quest.\" She said before running off to find Saria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria waited in her home, twiddling her thumbs and waiting for Navi. The Deku Tree had called Saria saying Navi would soon come and look very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough there was a knock on the door. \"Saria, it's me, Navi.\" Navi said through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria opened the door, and saw the new Navi. \"Navi? Well, Deku was right, you do look way different.\" She giggled. \"Come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi came in as Saria closed the door. \"It was his gift for the trip to the castle.\" Navi said smiling. \"How is being a sage, Saria?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little tough. Being a kid and having to act like an adult I mean.\" Saria said. \"But I guess I have to learn to grow up even if I can't do it physically.\" She smiled. \"Anyway, I was gonna head out as soon as you got here.\" She said, walking over to a chair where a light sack lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you miss link after he saved you in the Forest Temple?\" Navi asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria blushed at recounting the memories of Link. \"Oh, of course I do. I mean he lives in Castle Town. I thought I might as well stop by the house the carpenters built for him in the field path leading to Hyrule Castle.\" Saria said. \"So why don't we get going.\" Saria said, beginning to leave the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi nodded. \"Yes, we need to go.\" She agreed as she followed her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria opened the door and walked with Navi outside the forest exit, and through Hyrule Field. Saria knew of the dangers at night, but it is the dawn of morning now, any monsters that would have appeared probably would've burned back into the ground. They encounter the bridge crossing into Castle Town, and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe townsfolk are slowly beginning their day as they walked over to the path leading to the castle, but Navi noticed a kid looking like a preteen wearing black clothes with a sword on his back. \"Mom, I'm going to my sword training lesson.\" The boy said. \"Okay, just try not to get hurt to bad and stay away from those bullies from school.\" A voice said from the house. \"I'll try, but it seems they want to fight me and they lost.\" The body said before closing the door. The boy left and ran up the path to the castle like the way they were heading. Navi turned to Saria. \"Saria, did you see that kid going the same way we are?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, yeah.\" Saria said. \"I wonder what business he has with the Queen.\" \"Alright, you go see Link first if you want, I'm gonna stay here and get groceries and supplies for Deku.\" Saria smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi nodded. \"I'll meet you at his house and you can talk with him before we go see the Queen.\" She said as she walked up the path to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Navi was walking up the path up to the castle, but noticed the boy at the house Link lived in and he went inside. \"Link, I'm here for my lessons.,\" the boy said. \"Alright, Fado. We will begin with the basics like before we move on the last move you were learning.\" A voice said sounding like an older male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had been teaching a boy, named Fado, the way of the sword. The boy was a mid-teenager, and wielded a sword that had very slight resemblance to the Master Sword, which Link no longer had himself, but was still inside the stone at the Temple of Time. Link wielded a regular longsword for the practices he did with Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Fado, you began learning of my downward strike yesterday, can you show me what you've practiced?\" Link asked, pulling out a wooden dummy from a closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado nodded before unsheathing his sword taking aim at the dummy before striking down with his sword hitting the dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink clapped his hands, at the impressive deep cut, but it had only made it about halfway through the dummy before his sword got stuck. \"Watch this Fado.\" Link smiled, holding the longsword. Link stood and faced another dummy, and simply hit his sword on the ground, and it sent a jolt through the wood and sliced the dummy in half from under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that, Link?\" Fado asked amazed by his teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years of practice, Fado.\" Link said. \"If you add enough force to your hand area when you strike downwards, all that power is converted into the sword and then into the ground, creating a light seismic shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado nodded, but felt he could try something like his teacher did. Turning to his dummy again, he raised his sword, but focused some of his power into his sword with the thought 'My sword is an extension of myself' and he strike the dummy again harder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado's original slice was furthered much deeper with the new slice, and Link was impressed. \"Good work. Now, today we should try the spin attack.\" Link smiled. With his longsword, Link stood in a battle ready pose, and imbuing his own magic energy into the sword, unleashed a light sword and span like a tornado, slicing another dummy in half and the force made the dummy shatter against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado nodded before his face gained a determined look and focused more of his own energy getting a light sword. He moved into a stand between that same dummy and another one before spinning like a tornado was well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado sliced, but the way he spun was off and only made a three inch slice, whereas Link's slice had cut all the way through. \"Maybe the spin attack was a little tough at first, and I shouldn't have expected you to be perfect.\" Link said. \"How about we take a lunch, and resume afterwards?\"</span></div></div>",

He hold her in his arms as she is holding the bag and he jumped off the mountain gliding into the village<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like to fly.\" He said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Fado, I am part fairy, just so you know, so gliding and flying are just my forte.\" Navi said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for their journey to take them towards the Zora Lands to get the Sapphire of which lay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the village, he dived into the village and soon he slammed his feet into the ground. His boots negated the pain in his legs and skidded a few feet before he started to run again out of the village. He jumped over the stairs before setting her down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way to the zoras?\" He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be south of here, just about a mile near here.\" Navi said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're a mile away from completing your challenge.\" Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Navi said as they both began to run to the Zora Sanctuary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped into the river as she was running on land and he was running on the water. He took care of all Octorocks in the river before meeting her in front of the waterfall and he played the song on a flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanking for opening the way Fado, I shall go to meet Princess Ruto and King Zora.\" Navi said going to jump the gap that was the waterfall<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot slipped however, she was barely able to grab onto the edge of the stone entrance and pulled herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come back soon Fado.\" Navi said running in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi walked into the cavern Fado had opened up for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?!\" Navi yelled, when she saw the Zora Sanctuary was frozen over still, even if Link had defeated Ganonndorf in battle, saving the future time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi?! Is that you?\" A feminine voice yelled from the other side of the cavern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruto?!\" Navi yelled She ran, but tried not to slip to the other side of the cavern<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Ruto and the Zora King encased in the same red ice, this is why Navi always had a small jar of Blue Fire with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi tried pouring some on the red ice, but it wouldn't melt away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi!\" Fado yelled, running to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi then learned how the cavern froze, and a sword can only shatter the ice. Fado began working on all the frozen Zora while Navi looked for the stone. Fado tried freeing the Zoras in the lake first by slicing the ice, but it only left small scratches. He walked over to where there is a rock platform form to stand on. He stabbed his sword into the ice center of the platform and he started to chant a spell for Din's fire on his sword while his eyes started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today is the day the Zoras are free from the curse.\" Fado said as his sword reacted and fire engulfed the blade melting the around the blade<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used his Fire Blade Strikes on the ice-frozen lake before setting his sights on the king and princess of the Zoras. While Fado began using the Fire Blade on Ruto and the King, Navi continued looking for the stone, when Fado realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi! The Stone...it's in Ruto's Hand!\" Fado yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! It is?\" Navi yelled running back to Fado who was looking at the Zora Sapphire shining in Ruto's Hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how did I not notice that?\" Navi asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado used the Blade on the King and Ruto, creating clean slashes through their Ice Prisons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi? Is that you?\" Ruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I need the Sapphire.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only thing that keeps us alive in our Sub-Zero Prisons, if it weren't for this, we'd all be dead.\" Ruto explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, as soon as I complete my Challenge; I'll come back and check on you.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, take the stone and get away fast.\" Ruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having receiving the stones, Navi and Fado traveled back to the Deku Tree smiling that they've finally completed Navi's Challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi, there is more to me than you already have seen and you saw me use one of my gift given to me by the Goddesses.\" Fado said after he stopped walking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Fado?\" Navi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you saw me chant my sword to cast Din's Fire upon it, correct?\" Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Navi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I also have the chanting power of Farore's Wind and Nayru's Love.\" Fado explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farore's Wind Chant, it allows my sword to knock back enemies with a powerful wind force when struck with the sword and Nayru's Love gives my sword the power to control itself for a short time as if it were a person itself.\" Fado explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are so cool.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled gently at her before he kissed her on the forehead and he made another sword appeared on his back with his other sword forming an X on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I follow the Goddesses and they told me that I would soon meet the Fairy that guided the Hero of Time. I was also told that I would have to help her with her challenge from the deku tree.\" He explained and he picked her up and he started to run back to the kokiri forest. After arriving in Kokiri Forest, Fado set Navi down and talked to her some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go give the stones to the Deku Tree and return with the challenge's reward.\" Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi shook his hand, and ran to the Deku Tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi avoided the other Kokiris as she raced to see the Deku Tree and soon she made it before she was spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deku Tree, I have return with the Goron Ruby and Zora Sapphire.\" Navi said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, thou hast returned safely with thy Stones of Legend. Now, travel to the depths of thy Master Sword.\" Deku Tree said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean Deku Tree?\" Navi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traverse to Hyrulian Castle, and travel through the Master Sword, the final challenge await thee there.\" Deku Tree said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I will.\" Navi said as she left to meet with fado<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she doth well.\" Deku Tree said.</span></div></div>",

We need to make it to Castle Town before the Sun goes down at least.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know that. I live in Hyrule.\" Fado answered with a dry tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked her up before dashing for the bridge and he briefly chanted the spell for Farore's Wind so they can get there faster. They quickly made it into the Hyrulian Castle before being spotted. Fado pulled out his sword and chants the spell for Nayru\u2019s love on his sword to show them the way towards the master sword. Upon reaching the stone where the Master Sword was held, in the throne room of Hyrule Castle, Fado and Navi arrived to see it glowing brightly, even for the dark of night. They walked towards it, and with every step, it began to glow brighter and brighter, till it had lit the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we need to walk through the Master Sword?\" Fado asked her recalling the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Deku Tree said there was a Chasm inside the sword itself, so I guess we have to shrink ourselves to find it I guess?\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrinking? Maybe that's a power of one of the stones. Let's stand on the sword gently and shrink ourselves.\" Fado said pulling out the Kokiri Emerald knowing it was the one with the powers of shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shrunk down, and saw they were getting farther and farther away from each other, as only Navi had actually been shrinking. She found herself in the chasms themselves, and heard a deep voice, obviously not belonging to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you are Navi, showeth the stones, to take the Master Chasm Challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have come to take the challenge of the Master Sword.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it that I need to do?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all you would need to do is find your way throughout this labyrinth, then take a staircase down further, and do the next challenge. I shall re-communicate with you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Navi started to walk her way to find her way out of the maze. The Labyrinth was quite confusing; every time Navi would make a turn and would come at a dead end. The \"Chasm Master\" as she began calling it would just say stuff like \"Not that way.\" or \"Wrong Turn\". Navi truly felt like a plaything to the Chasm Master as if she was in a battle with him and she is just failing at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Don't give up, Navi!~ Was heard in her mind and it sounded like Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado?\" She asked looking around for her friend and ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I'll explain this gift to you after you win this challenge.~ He said as she grew more confident from his words and she nodded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith renew determination from his pep talk, she started to run to find her way out of the maze and beat the Chasm Master. Upon Fado's encouragement, Navi flashed by the rest of the chasm and made it to a staircase leading downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the final challenge, welcome your friend and ally, Fado.\" Chasm Master boomed. Fado materialized next to Navi and he handed Navi one of his Blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need it.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you make it to the end of what I call \"The Hall of all creatures\", then you'll see me, whom you call, the Chasm Master.\" The voice called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado smiled at navi before use both Din's Fire and Farore's Wind chants on their swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's finish this.\" He said before he lead the charge down the hall</span></div></div>",

He hold her in his arms as she is holding the bag and he jumped off the mountain gliding into the village<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like to fly.\" he said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Fado, I am part fairy, just so you know, so gliding and flying are just my forte.\" Navi said, smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for their journey to take them towards the Zora Lands to get the Sapphire of which lay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the village, he dived into the village and soon he slammed his feet into the ground. His boots negated the pain in his legs and skidded afew feet before he started to run again out of the village. He jumped over the stairs before setting her down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way to the zoras?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be south of here, just about a mile near here.\" Navi said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're a mile away from completing your challenge.\" Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Navi said as they both began to run to the Zora Sanctuary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jump into the river as she was running on land and he was running on the water. He took care of all Octorocks in the river before meeting her in front of the waterfall and he played the song on a flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanking for opening the way Fado, I shall go to meet Princess Ruto and King Zora.\" Navi said going to jump the gap that was the waterfall<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot slipped however, she was barely able to grab onto the edge of the stone entrance and pulled herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come back soon Fado.\" Navi said running in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi walked into the cavern Fado had opened up for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?!\" Navi yelled, when she saw the Zora Sanctuary was frozen over still, even if Link had defeated Ganonndorf in battle, saving the future time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi?! Is that you?\" a feminine voice yelled from the other side of the cavern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruto?!\" Navi yelled She ran, but tried not to slip to the other side of the cavern<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Ruto and the Zora King encased in the same red ice, this is why Navi always had a small jar of Blue Fire with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi tried pouring some on the red ice, but it wouldn't melt away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi!\" Fado yelled, running to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi then learned how the cavern froze, and the Ice can only be shattered by a sword. Fado began working on all the frozen Zora while Navi looked for the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado tried freeing the Zoras in the lake first by slicing the ice, but it only left small scratches. He walked over to where there is a rock platform form to stand on. He stabbed his sword into the ice center of the platform and he started to chant a spell for Din's fire on his sword while his eyes started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today is the day the Zoras are free from the curse.\" Fado said as his sword reacted and fire engulfed the blade melting the around the blade<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used his Fire Blade Strikes on the ice-frozen lake before setting his sights on the king and princess of the Zoras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Fado began using the Fire Blade on Ruto and the King, Navi continued looking for the stone, when Fado realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi! The Stone...it's in Ruto's Hand!\" Fado yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! It is?\" Navi yelled running back to Fado who was looking at the Zora Sapphire shining in Ruto's Hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how did I not notice that?\" Navi asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado used the Blade on the King and Ruto, creating clean slashes through their Ice Prisons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi? Is that you?\" Ruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I need the Sapphire.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only thing that keeps us alive in our Sub-Zero Prisons, if it weren't for this, we'd all be dead.\" Ruto explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, as soon as I complete my Challenge; I'll come back and check on you.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, take the stone, and get away, fast.\" Ruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having receiving the stones, Navi and Fado traveled back to the Deku Tree, smiling that they've finally completed Navi's Challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi, there is more to me than you already have seen and you saw me use one of my gift given to me by the Goddesses.\" Fado said after he stopped walking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Fado?\" Navi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you saw me chant my sword to cast Din's Fire upon it, correct?\" Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Navi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I also have the chanting power of Farore's Wind and Nayru's Love.\" Fado explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farore's Wind Chant, it allows my sword to knock back enemies with a powerful wind force when struck with the sword and Nayru's Love gives my sword the power to control itself for a short time as if it were a person itself.\" Fado explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are so cool.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled gently at her before he kissed her on the forehead and he made another sword appeared on his back with his other sword forming an X on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I follow the Goddesses and they told me that I would soon meet the Fairy that guided the Hero of Time. I was also told that I would have to help her with her challenge from the deku tree.\" He explained and he picked her up and he started to run back to the kokiri forest</span></div></div>",

We need to make it to Castle Town before the Sun goes down at least.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know that. I lived in Hyrule.\" Fado answered with a dry tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked her up before dashing for the bridge and he briefly chanted the spell for Farore's Wind so they can get there faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickly made it into the Hyrulian Castle before being spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado pulled out his sword and chants the spell for Nayru\u2019s love on his sword to show them the way towards the master sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the stone where the Master Sword was held, in the throne room of Hyrule Castle, Fado and Navi arrived to see it glowing brightly, even for the dark of night. They walked towards it, and with every step, it began to glow brighter and brighter, till it had lit the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we need to walk through the Master Sword?\" Fado asked her recalling the challenge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Deku Tree said there was a Chasm inside the sword itself, so I guess we have to shrink ourselves to find it I guess?\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrinking? Maybe that's a power of one of the stones. Let's stand on the sword gently and shrink ourselves.\" Fado said pulling out the Kokiri Emerald knowing it was the one with the powers of shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shrunk down, and saw they were getting farther and farther away from each other, as only Navi had actually been shrinking. She found herself in the chasms themselves, and heard a deep voice, obviously not belonging to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you are Navi, showeth the stones, to take the Master Chasm Challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have come to take the challenge of the Master Sword.\" Navi said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it that I need to do?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all you would need to do, is find your way throughout this labyrinth, then take a staircase down further, and do the next challenge, I shall re-communicate with you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Navi started to walk her way to find her way out of the maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Labyrinth was quite confusing; every time Navi would make a turn and would come at a dead end. The \"Chasm Master\" as she began calling it would just say stuff like \"Not that way.\" or \"Wrong Turn\". Navi truly felt like a plaything to the Chasm Master as if she was in a battle with him and she is just failing at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Don't give up, Navi!~ was heard in her mind and it sounded like Fado<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado?\" she said looking around for her friend and ally<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I'll explain this gift to you after you win this challenge.~ he said as she grew more confident from his words and she nodded with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith renew determination from his pep talk, she started to run to find her way out of the maze and beat the Chasm Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon Fado's encouragement, Navi flashed by the rest of the chasm and made it to a staircase leading downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the final challenge, welcome your friend and ally, Fado.\" Chasm Master boomed. Fado materialized next to Navi and he handed Navi one of his Blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need it.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you make it to the end of what I call \"The Hall of all creatures\", then you'll see me, whom you call, the Chasm Master.\" The voice called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado smiled at navi before use both Din's Fire and Farore's Wind chants on their swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's finish this.\" he said before he lead the charge down the hall</span></div></div>",

A fight of Pure Strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado took his 2nd sword from Navi preparing those two. \"Well, it's time for my sword, show yourself! Make me believe your strong!\" Chasm Master said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strongest blade ever appeared in his hand, the Fierce Deity Sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado chanted Nayru's Love on one of his swords before setting his sights on the Chasm Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to see my power? Well, you are going to feel all of it!\" he yelled as he and his second blade charged at him with amazing speed from the Farore's Wind chant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try enchanting your sword! It won't work!\" Chasm Master said sending a magic blast from his sword disabling the magic enchantment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Fado said, before going back and striking an X towards Chasm Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be nothing but a sweat drop!\" Chasm Master said only holding his sword in the air blocking both swords and creating a knockback to Fado, who was sent flying on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wanna get up and try again?\" Chasm Master said smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado got up with both swords in his hands and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't say that i can use my chants on myself.\" Fado said as he charged again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mess with me Fado! I'll just send a Magic Blast at you, but it'd be like a razor, it'd slice you right open. DO YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT?!\" Chasm yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado just kept charging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. If that's your wish.\" Chasm said, prepping a Magic Strike, going for the final blow, which will kill Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado smiled as run passed the Chasm Master, but he started to run around him until he become a blur without using a chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Din.\" He said as he stabbed his sword into the ground, but still continue to run around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farore.\" He said as he stabbed another sword in the ground, but across from the first sword<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nayru.\" He said as the final sword is in the ground forming a triangle, but they were glowing as the names of the goddesses were being called out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grant me the power, courage, and wisdom to beat my opponent.\" Fado said as the symbol of the triforce appeared on the floor from beams of lights connecting the swords<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sword as long as the three swords combined appeared in his hands and he chanted all three spells on himself without the smile leaving his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't run, back down, or fear you. They guide me to Navi and I sensed they have a reason why, but at this moment my job is protect her and kill you. So you better hit me with all you got!\" Fado said as he charged at the Chasm Master<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puh-lease.\" Chasm said, as a <span class=\"cindigo\">blue</span> Triforce mark appeared on his hand. Chasm began moving swifter and quicker than ever. \"You have basically doomed yourself young Fado, because when the spell is enchanted, it also gives me power. But, as I am stronger than you, I will not kill you.\" Chasm said, appearing behind Fado, and knocking him out with the butt of the Fierce Deity Sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi, great work passing the challenge; I believe this is what you came for.\" Chasm said pulling a necklace from his pocket. Tossing it to Navi, she saw it had symbols of all 4 tribes, The Kokiri, The Goron, The Zora, and the Hyrulians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I believe it's time for yours and Fado's departure, so, ai revoiure.\" Chasm said, snapping his fingers, making Navi and Fado leave his throne room, though he felt the same teleportation too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen fado left, Chasm Master felt something sliced up his back before he was pushed onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would say that.\" A voice said that sounds like fado<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you ask how I'm back here, I never left and you beaten a mirage of me. So you want to try me again?\" Fado asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, an intent one are you, just can't admit when your beat!\" Chasm said, re-activating his blade, and clashing with Fado once more, finishing the job easily, by shoving the entire sword through his chest. \"Now, I can either leave you dying, or I can help heal you.\" Chasm said, looking straight at the gushing wound, almost covered with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Fado appeared behind him and he has his blades at his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will only meet death when my job is finished, not sooner. Didn't you say that you wanted to see my real strength?.\" fado said as he stood facing the chasm master as the other mirage vanished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No magic; just a battle of wills between two warriors.\" he said as he took a defensive stance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, how about we make this a more fair fight. 2 swords each. When one of us falls, we stop, we don't kill.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me.\" Fado said taking a battle stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasm and Fado ran towards each other swords clashing until both warriors were tired enough and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it looks like the match is a draw.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good match.\" Fado admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, why don't you get out of here there really is only room for one powerful soldier in this Master Sword.\" Chasm said. \"Plus, we really shouldn't have fought like enemies I was just asking by the goddesses themselves to challenge you. If you could beat me or tie with my power, then you could continue; we did all that extra fighting out of idiocy.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could come with me?\" Fado said helping Chasm up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I don't know. Actually, I haven't seen land in 100 years (You stay immortal if you live in the Master Sword), I'm getting the hell out of this place.\" Chasm said grabbing Fado and teleporting them outside the Master Sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi was standing near the Master Sword waiting for Fado to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it wasn't.\" fado said to Chasm Master as they appeared next to navi and he put the sword back where it was <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here.\" he said to both Chasm master and navi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi.\" Chasm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Chasm?\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do now that you have that necklace I gave you?\" Chasm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I plan to continue do what I do best, helping people.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I plan to assist her in that manner.\" Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall too.\" Chasm said.</span></div></div>",

He did another quick three slashes on him before switching back to defense. Chasm's burns faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot damage a god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasm dodged at Link, and to his unexpectance, broke the Biggoron Sword. Link had only the Kokiri Dagger to use, which wouldn't last long as it's wooden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm, you-\u201c link started to say, but was interrupted by something like two swords landing in his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is fighting like gannondorf.\u201d Was heard before link got into his offensive again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you figured out my strategy.\" Chasm said. \"Good work Hero of Time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as that, a sword stabbed through his chest, and behind him, was another who looked like Chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-one mimics me!\" He said, twisting the one sword he had<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chasm who had the sword in his chest began to get taller, and a lot grosser. The other Chasm withdrew the sword, and the figure (Who later was actually revealed to be Gannondorf), bled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? What do you want?\" the real Chasm said fierce, before throwing the Master Sword back to Link<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigures it was him.\u201d Was from the swords that were in link\u2019s hands before they stabbed gannondorf and fado appeared with his swords in his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and I said that.\u201d Navi said running to link<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe part about being a god gave him away.\u201d She added before fado teleported all of them into hyrule field<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marks on fado started to glow in reaction to gannondorf, but he put one of his swords away and pulled the other one out of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGannondork should be dead after the final battle with link.\u201d Fado said before kicking him in the head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he did mimic me well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I am a god.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try stabbing me, right here, in the chest.\" He pretended to draw a circle around his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado let him get up so he could stab him while watching him if he was trying to pull a fast one. The sword stuck into Chasm and Fado pulled it out making the wound bigger. Chasm clapped his hands together and hovered them around the wound, which with an odd blue electricity closed up. Fado beheaded gannondorf since he allowed him to live long enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that.\" Chasm said clapping his hands once more trapping Gannon's head in a jar and then he used what appeared to be a cookie-cutting knife to most literally cut a rip in the fabric of time and space and he threw the jarred head in. Chasm repaired the hole, and brushed his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now while his head in dissolving in the dark matter controlled by beings from a parralel world, why don't I take you to see my family?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later, chasm.\u201d Fado said as he and navi ran back to the kokiri forest.</span></div></div>",

Go ahead and tell me.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was during my youth when Queen Zelda was still Princess Zelda. When I was young, the other kids were acting different around me so I had little to no friends growing up and only my parents loved me. One day, I stayed inside not wanting to deal with them; but there was a knock on the door and my mother opened it to see Princess Zelda at the door wearing a cloak to keep herself from being noticed. She asked if she could talk with me alone and mom gave a smile before going back to what she was doing before. Zelda looked at me and noticed that there was something special about me, but she smile and I looked at her confused. She put a hand on my forehead and she closed her eyes. I thought she was tired, but she was thinking and I felt something warm from her hand. Something on the back of her hand glowed and she opened her eyes. She showed me the mark on her hand was the triforce of wisdom and she said that the goddesses chose me for something important like how they chose the Hero of Time to kill the evil being from the desert. I smiled and I gave her a hug while maybe crying a little, but she just hold me and let me cry into her. Soon I felt better and she just smiled and rubbed my head. Just as I was getting older, I heard someone talking to me in my mind or in my dreams so I remember that it might have been one of the Goddesses talking to me. During one of my dreams, I felt someone or something keeping me warm and showing me courage while I felt someone's love towards me and it was someone other than my mother. I think later on Princess Zelda came by again to see me and she brought Link so she must have told him about me. He smiled and took me out into the backyard to show me some swordplay, but he put his hand on my heart and it glowed the same as hers. When I got old enough, I went to buy a sword and find a teacher for lessons, but I felt someone behind me and it was him again and he took me to his personal training ground where he taught me to fight with a sword.\" he explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, so that's what my companions have done in the past few years.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kept chatting in the iced cavern until 15 hours were surprisingly up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon who I was then became who I am now.\" He said as he revealed his face, which was light tan, sea green eyes with some blue, and fire red hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's, no offense but a little odd. As you know I'm actually fairy, but I took this challenge to see the world at a different angle.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado pulled out two of his swords and stabb them in the ice lake before stabbing a third sword making a triangle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Din, Farore, and Nayru.\" he said as the swords reacted by being engulfed in flames and his final sword appeared and the three swords made the triforce symbol by gold beams of light<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stabbed the final sword into the center and he meditated before chanted all of the chants at the same time creating the Goddess Spell chant which gives the sword and caster invincibility from both magical and physical attacks. The sword is Twilight Gold and glows from the power of the Goddesses, but he pulled the sword out before it vanished and he stood in the center still facing ruto and her father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Din, grant me the power to free the zoras form their prison.\" he said as he pull the other two blades out only one vanishing and he grabbed the red fire sword before stabbing it in the center gathering power<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mark of Din glows on his left shoulder and he pulled the sword before he moving his hand along the blade making it engulfed in flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire Storm Barrage.\" fado said as he teleported to both ruto and her father slicing the ice freeing them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stabbed the ice lake and melted it with one grand strike, but he let the blade stay in the rock platform for it to cool down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to rest for a minute while you talk to them, Navi.\" fado said before sitting next to his blade</span></div></div>",

The Mark of Din was glowing and his eyes were glowing red with fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go fool Leon and Chasm.\" He said to the mirages as he and Navi left for gannondorf and girahim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado handed Navi a potion and it was blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink that; it will help with your powers.\" he said as he put her on his back before dash teleporting to his next opponents<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi, focus on using one power for the moment like that psychic wall you did.\" he said</span></div></div>",

Leon eventually found Fado fighting (And losing hysterically to) Girahim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well to bad I have to kill them all at a moment's notice.\" Leon said, rolling his eyes, trapping them all in an unbreakable barrier, something not even Fado's 4th Sword could handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon could see inside the ball of unbreakable steel and noticed Girahim was shocked and had Fado and Navi by the collars of their shirts and was yelling at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi, could you possibly use the psychic power to break the shield?\" Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but that won't work. If you try attacking the ball itself, you'll activate the gunpowder within, making the ball explode.

Girahim, Gannondorf, Link, Zelda all gone; their powers were absorbed and made Leon Giant. He used his now amplified power to trap every Fado and Navi in a ball and made it not only inescapable, but also unbreakable. Shrinking back to his normal size, the ball containing the 2 shrunk with him eventually to the size of a mere keychain. Leon returned the souls of the people, but the Goddesses took them as losers, as did they with Navi and Fado. Leon found the way to their chambers and he and Chasm prepared for the battle.</span></div></div>",

We're friends, not enemies, let's not kill each other, but at least take the other out like you did Link and Zelda.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orbs of the elements moved circling around Fado and Navi. the orbs shrink down enough to look like they can fit in your hands and they lined up before in a small quick flash resulting a sword is made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sage's Sword and True Goddess Sword.\" Fado said wielding both swords with ease and used the orb of water to wake both zelda and link up to see this fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chasm, you and i are almost the same.\" the older voice said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have the power that our younger forms can't reach yet, but young fado shows promise as leon too, but both fado and navi need training.\" it said before fado charged at him again before teleporting and sliced up his back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the Goddesses will allow both Navi and Fado to be trained by them, then they just might reached their full power and maybe then we will meet in battle.\" it used fado's voice to asked the goddesses as it used the body to ready another attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing the best, could also mean acting the cockiest.\" Chasm said, repairing his back with little of his magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he charged at Fado and stabbed both swords into his stomach, truly only creating enough blood for a flesh wound, but could knock any normal human out instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi. I recommend shielding you, Link, and Zelda.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi did as told, Chasm pulled 2 swords from Fado's Back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explosion Swords huh, perfect.\" Chasm said. Chasm put a shield around himself using the remainder of the Fierce Deity Sword, and shoved the swords into the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreating an Explosion that would knock out and petrify Fado for quite a long while. The Explosion, knowing where to go, also struck the remainder of false Fados on the floor. Just as a filler, Chasm turned Fado's lower body (Waist down) into stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado melted into a puddle before turning black and moved away before reforming into his normal body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirage Chain Explosion.\" fado said as the fado mirage exploded around Chasm until both chasm and fado were caught in the blast of the last big explosion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire Shield.\" was heard from fado protecting navi who was shielding link and zelda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know i have long and hard path to get stronger, but the first to know is when i am beaten.\" fado said crossing his two swords and letting them vanish back to where the goddesses keep them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado show chasm a smile before pulling out his sword of Din and stabbed him in the heart. that was a mirage which exploded and the real fado returned to normal before with the marks's glow fainting, but he fainted and fell next too navi, link, and zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Fado is not dead, but sleeping from the drain of his energy and his will is adamant while burns like a fire never going out. What he said is truth about him and his feelings about Navi is true as well, but maybe the Goddesses can show both Fado and Navi the path they need to take. Fado knows that he relies on his powers and his chants alittle more than on his own blades, but that will change in time during this training. Chasm and Leon, do your best as warriors.~ The older voice said using fado\u2019s mind power before disappearing and fado started to sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess this battle was a draw.\" Chasm said, removing the sword from his chest then healing the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because I say it is.\" fado said in his own voice in his sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado.\" Navi said as she lay his head on her lap while he sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword reappeared in its sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chasm, fight hard my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your honor, I shall Fado.\" Chasm said, smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi is looking at fado before he kissed her on the lips and he opened his eyes halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi, would you be dishonored by staying with me?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Navi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, just say ya love eachother already, If Navi isn't gonna come along to try and become a Goddess, then I have some Goddesses to battle.\" Chasm said, beginning to walk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi, you should go with him so you can become a goddess.\" fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay here with those two.\" he added before he tried to get up, but he just made another mirage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take him with you, he will be my eyes and ears.\" he said as they left to follow chasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the real you should be coming.\" Chasm said, slashing the mirage to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch this.\" Chasm swung the Fierce Deity Sword, sending Magic Pulses to Fado's Body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There Healing Pulses, it'll heal your body faster than any treatment or medicine. Until your legs are strong enough to walk, you'll just have to deal with being shrunken with Navi. It'll be the Easiest way for you to travel.\" Chasm explained, as Fado shrunk, and was placed in Navi's Hands, still glowing from the Healing Pulses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I'll get my chance later.~ fado thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Sure you will.~ Chasm thought in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was thinking of something when he looked at his hands and he remembered something that he trained himself to use his body as a weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I'm not out of tricks yet.~ he thought as he did the stances<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Please Fado. You're shrunken in Navi's hands. If anything, you should just lay down. If you tried to kill me at that size, not even your swords could dent me or Navi.~ Chasm thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado just smiled before shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My one last surprise and its for later.\" fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure that navi doesn't get hurt, chasm.\" he added before laying down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I'll make sure that Navi stays safe, but that would mean I'd also be in charge of your protection, because if something happens to Navi, it could happen to you as well.~ Chasm thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I still have some powers left to use and size won't matter. I'm more concerned about navi if you ask me if i have a death wish, then i guess i will some day; but it won't be today.~ fado said ready to trigger one of his other powers that he kept secret<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Kay then.~</span></div></div>",

Fado pulled the fierce deity sword and put it with his swords before pulling up the Time and Space Deity Swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi, let chasm and leon help you become a goddess.\" he said with his smile and charged at his opponents without fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will use whatever power I can.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hey Fado.\" Chasm and Leon said to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You answered.~ Fado replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Of course, we're all friends. Remember how I said I was their father?~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yes Chasm.~ Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Well I being their father, they had power-hungry lifestyles and they would hate me for having more power than them. Then my wife, Gaia, decided to give them their powers of the Triforce so they would leave and leaves Us alone.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~So, you were the Ultimate Being already?~ Fado asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Duh, whoever else coulda given these girl their original powers.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Now Fado, I must thank you for summoning my piece of the Triforce, the Deity Triforce. This way I can create a soulless army of soldiers to fight with you. If you want me to help. My power is basically yours x100 at the right time.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Do you want that, or can you and Navi use Mine and Leon's Souls to defeat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado just kept smiling at them, but he pulled his sage's sword and schtick it in the middle of the symbol. Another flashed blinded them and another triforce appeared in the center of the deity triforce and the sword was upgraded to the elemental goddess, but the symbol was Gaia's piece of the triforce that is on the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I'll use whatever you can give, chasm. Can your wife help navi's growth as a goddess since I just brough her side of the triforce into yours?~ fado thought as he stabbed the goddesses in the hearts (if they had one)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Din is weak to Nayru, but she is weak against Farore and she is weak to fire.\" Fado said as he pulled out his swords after stabbing them and backing away from them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado teleported to Navi's side and was ready for another attack, but he triggered another power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one is the real Fado?\" was heard before millions and millions of fados appeared filling the chamber and they charged at the goddesses<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado smiled, but he turned to navi and pushed her out of the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi, go get link and Zelda and inform them of this little mess of the brats posing as goddesses.\" Fado said before hitting a fireball towards farore and he handed her the fierce deity sword<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give that to link and I'll keep them busy.\" he said before she ran off to get more help<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado pushed a water blast at din before reflecting a tree to stab into nayru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Hylia would have been a better goddess to follow than you three.\" fado said running into his army of mirages<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Gaia can help you, in fact, she's even here now.~ Chasm said as 3 Giant Mirage People appeared in the sky<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery Fado looked up, and recognized Chasm as the male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again Chasm.\" Gaia, the female figure said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my dear wife and it's good to see you as well Hylia.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Dad, I was wondering when you'd return to the realm of Gods and Goddesses.\" Hylia said, hugging Chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, for you three.\" Gaia said, giving a deathly glare to Din, Farore, and Nayru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. As Goddesses, I would expect more from my sisters.\" Hylia lectured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasm bent down to the real Fado, saying \"I heard what you said about my daughter Hylia, that would be a good choice. Though she may be ditzy, she's probably the best choice out of our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Chasm.\" Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, about your punishment.\" Gaia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if you could ever punish us Mom, we're so powerful. Not even a God or Goddess could beat us, that also mean you Dad and Little Sister.\" Farore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Farore, still cocky as ever. I think it's time for your punishment to arrive. Navi! Could you come in here please?\" Gaia called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi then ran in with Link and Zelda. But Link had looked completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like the true worthy wielder of the Fierce Deity Sword has arrived.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to Navi, as long as you are willing to become our child, I have the ability to make you a Goddess, do you wish for that?\" Gaia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi looked at fado, link, and zelda; but mostly at fado before she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please. I want to help people and protect those who I care about.\" Navi said</span></div></div>",

What happens is when it's I guess you could call it \"their time\" they just let it happen, and have no regrets, but as me and Gaia say, every death of a Goddess plants a new seed for another.~ Chasm said to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Who was it that I felt in my dreams when I was younger? was it them or someone else?~ fado asked feeling like a fool and betrayed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Well, that all depends on who you think it was. I'll just be able to confirm who it was if you can give the first guess.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile talking, Navi and Hylia were working on finishing up the brats Chasm and Gaia dare called their children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Also young child.~ Gaia thought to Fado<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Don't have the feeling of betrayal.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~My wife is correct, do not feel betrayed or foolish. The only thing that's foolish was that thought, we'll always be here, for friends and family.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado's body is moving on its own and it's in meditative position while he is still sleeping. He was recalling the dreams and the memory of the feeling from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Thank you both.~ fado said as his body smiled feeling better<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hmm, At first I thought it was them considering I have their marks on my body; but was it any of the three, Din, Nayru, or Farore? I'm just being sure.~ Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Who knows, it may have been our daughter Hylia's mark.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Could it have been? We did see Hylia's Mark in the sky about 5 years ago.~ Gaia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Was that when the mark appeared?~ Chasm asked Fado<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado's body had its left hand index finger point to his right upper arm near the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Power.~ he said and nothing came to mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit placed its left index and middle fingers on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Wisdom.~ he said and still nothing came to mind like before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit put whole left hand on his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Courage.~ he said lastly and a chime he heard in his mind, but nothing came to mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Let's see five years ago.~ he said thinking he feels the memories coming to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado focuses on the dreams as his body took a standing meditative stance before working through the poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I did feel something 5 years ago and i was outside after Zelda's first visit.~ Fado said and he smiled when it hit him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I remember looking at the sky and I did see something for a moment, but I didn't think about it at the time.~ fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Zelda, can you touch my back? I think I have a mark there.\" Fado asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course, Warrior Fado.\" Zelda said as her gloved hands connected with Fado's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Chasm and Gaia's eyes, a shining mark of Hylia appeared on Fado's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, Fado, you were meant to not serve any of our other Goddesses, but Hylia.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. We're done.\" Hylia said, coming over with Navi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do them; your clothes are all bloody.\" Gaia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasm looked behind Hylia and Navi, and saw the bodies of the other Goddesses maimed, strangled, and overall worn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from the note of almost murdering your sisters, Hylia, you have your first follower.\" Chasm said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it dad?\" Hylia asked, excited the like a little girl, which was her physical appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Fado.\" Gaia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats little sis, maybe I'll get one someday.\" Navi congratulated, already acting like a true goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Navi, that may not happen for at least a year.

Chasm and Fado were normal sized appearing, and Navi and Hylia still appeared in their Goddess/Giantess forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So 1 trick to being a God or Goddess, is Power Control. Sure, having ultimate power to do things you've never done before would be cool, but you can only do them in moderation, like a diet, but for Gods and Goddesses. Keep this in mind Fado, I may just make you a God one day if you like.\" Chasm explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the no. 1 rule. Never to do by the hand of a God or Goddess is...\" Chasm began to say, but Navi interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is too never eat humans?\" Navi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct Navi, trust me, you don't want to do it. My Mother made me swallow an innocent Hylian one day, I still never can forgive myself for the death of that young girl.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado nodded before looking at navi weird and chasm confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wouldn't it be weird if navi and I love each other and I become her brother in god form?\" he asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, if a God/Goddess is made from a human by another God, they actually won't be apart of that family, yet if a Goddess makes a human a God or Goddess than they are made for the family. It's all really confusing, but don't ask me, ask my dead Mother and Father, they were the creator of Gods and Goddesses. Thus the king and queen of them.\" Chasm explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so you will be training them; but maybe the first thing is shrinking to normal size?\" fado asked him looking at them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't. During their training, the Goddesses are forbidden to change to human size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Dad, I wanna be normal size for a while.\" Hylia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.

It was made to help you be as strong and powerful as the three Goddesses of the Triforce. But we all know how THAT turned out.\" Chasm said, destroying the necklace underneath his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed, but they all knew that those three goddesses were already being punished for their crimes against Hyrule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado. Why don't you go ahead and lead Hylia to the Zora River, and I'll head to say the Spirit Temple with Navi to work on her Psychic Abilities, since that is what she's chosen to work on.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, chasm.\" fado said before looking up to hylia and he smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does she need to do for her training at zora river?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will happen to leon, chasm?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I'm re-recognized as a god, Leon will become his own seperated being, just looking exactly like me with a few differences.\" Chasm explained, as he left with Navi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado still hadn't figured out what Hylia would do at the Zora River when it bonked him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuff with water.\" Fado said, sighing that he didn't think of it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Ding Ding Ding!~ He heard Chasm call in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Hylia.\" Fado said as they walked to the zora river<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my little follower. Though you should be following me.\" Hylia said, stomping ahead still undescribed on where they were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was teleporting as he was running to stay ahead of his goddess and he was running towards the Zora River.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hylia, you should be following me to the zora river.\" he said passing her up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you should be following me, as I am your chosen Goddess.\" Hylia said, crossing her arms, and make huffing noises like she was mad, but she was really just playing to see if she could get on Fado's nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado smiled as he stopped for a minute before jumping up and landing on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are trying to fool me into thinking your mad.\" he said kissing her on the nose and running off into the Zora Lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't catch me if you tried.\" he said mocking her with a playful smile before running off leaving her behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHylia smiled and began running after Fad, creating cracks and dents in the Earth with her large sandals.

He looked at it before chanting something of a spell and the sculpture will never melt or be destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be a great piece in your bedroom when you take it back home.\" he said before getting back to training her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each instrument has its high notes and low notes that includes my flute and your harp, but i'm going to try something different for this lesson.\" fado as he play a song with high and low notes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHylia listened intently to Fado's Preformance, and clapped when he had finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the applaud. So, why don't you try.\" Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHylia followed the same notes and patterns as Fado had demonstrated, and another Ice Sculpture, this time one of Din, Nayru, and Farore was made. Fado was tempted to smash it, but held back the ambition to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Hylia.\" fado said before shrinking the sculptures to fingurine size for Hylia to keep in her room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his ocarina next to his flute, but he walked on the river after a few minutes of focusing his energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from using an instrument to help you to control water, you can use poses or maybe a dance for more control and flow of the water.\" he said as he had water focused into a small orb before pulling his hands apart making the orb bigger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the orb is big enough, move his hands in an ancient style of fighting as the water moves with his hands becoming thin or small snake like whip. he concentrated for a minute and and the water turned into the fairy form of Navi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should start with something easy for you.\" he said as he next off the river<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm better off just using my Harp.\" Hylia said, turning the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe teleport to see her face and stared into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can teach you one last lesson with the harp, but then I will have to teach you another way to control water.\" he said before showing her a smile before rubbing her cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will teach you everything I know about controlling water and it can be useful if you have to defend yourself in a fight.\" he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. But you're still my follower, so if I tell you to stop when I'm tired, then you just stop.\" Hylia simply said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded before he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I will ask is that you give it your all and do your best, will you do that for me, hylia?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my little follower.\" Hylia said, petting Fado's head as if he were a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he said before pulling out both his flute and ocarina before having a mirage appear and take his ocarina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your harp and use both lessons together.\" he said before both he and his mirage started to play a song<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHylia again listened intently, then once he was done, she followed the same note pattern, and the water made swift motions like a snake, this time not making an ice sculpture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hours worth of water manipulation, Hylia was feeling very tired and wanted to go see how Navi and her father were coming along with her training of Psychic Control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado is on her shoulder as she was resting before they teleported to the spirit temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very proud of you and I'll show you a cool trick after we go check on navi and your father.\" he said hugging her cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Hylia said, petting his head once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had recovered from her training, fado put his ocarina away and started to play another on his flute, but this time he jumps off her and lands on the water in the river. he started to dance before skating on the water and the water lifted him up as if he is on the head of a snake, but the water goes ahead of him as he dance on the water while playing a song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~As a goddess, you should already be able to read my mind or something like that; but this is one of the cool things you can do with water. After our visit, we are going to lake Hylia for some special training.~ Fado said in her mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I wonder if you are done with your training though, but we should ask him~ he added before having two watery hands help hylia up and they went walking towards the Spirit Temple</span></div></div>",

She becoming quite the force to be reckoned with. For enemies that is.~ Chasm thought, then chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Well, she still have earth manipulation, water inflation; but i have a trick to show her for that one, and we both know that she has growth and shrink powers.~ he said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~can you the differents parts of the triforce? I'm alittle confused about that since i summoned your and gaia's triforce.~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Gods and Goddesses can summon the triforce, but only specific ones, such as my mother, father, Din, Nayru, and Farore.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What about you, Gaia, Navi, and Hylia?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Sadly, no.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~So each of you have your own triforce?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yes believe it or not, there is more than one Triforce, Each for every family of Gods and Goddesses~ Chasm thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hmm, very interesting.~ fado said before his body stood up, but his eyes were still closed and he pulled out his flute<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado started playing a song on his flute and soon a trail of moving water came to him, but he jumped on the water without falling through and he started to dance in his sleep as the water moves around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hylia, show your dad the ice sculptures you made.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yes, of course.~ Hylia said taking the Ice Sculpture's from her dress pocket and showing them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, these will go in your room when we get back to the realm\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~When we will get to the lake, the lessons there will be more fun based and i think maybe navi should join us; but you are welcome to come along.~ fado said as his body and the water snake was flying around until he made a wrong turn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped over Hylia's head before he landed on the water as it went straight up with him on top of the head and he was moving down like a rollercoaster, but he was above navi's head and he jumped off the water falling towards her shirt pocket.

I'll go wake up my little follower.\" Hylia said, gently wading across the lake, which was more like a deep puddle to her, and crossed to the tree Fado was sleeping on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked his tiny body as gently as possible and even that woke him up. He popped his back, and jumped onto Hylia's hand, traveling back with her, and being set down on the ground, while Chasm reverted to human size to speak with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your copy said you were jumpy, that reason, may I ask?\" Chasm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was about to speak when Chasm had recieved a telepathic message from Gaia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kids, I need to run over to Castle Town to get some ingredients for dinner, Navi, can you take Hylia back home?

In fact, we'd be not much older than you if we were human.\" Din said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what help is of your request?\" Nayru asked, with big, anime-like eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething evil has been coming for me while I was resting from training Hylia. It felt like it was from child\u2019s nightmare during my youth and I would like for you to test me.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you want us three to try to explore your brain, and try to find whatever is plaguing your mind so you can concentrate properly?\" Nayru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Nayru, Din and Farore were betting cash to see if that's what Fado had wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Concentrating isn't a problem, but I have a feeling that I need to train my body using hand to hand combat like i used to. So I think you three will have to look in my memories for that something and use it as a test for me in a dream realm, but I want you three to test me in my fighting skills as well before my test.\" he said rubbing the back of his head while looking at them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you exactly want us to do?\" Din asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how are we supposed to test you when we're not up to maiming and eating humans anymore?\" Nayru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nayru, I believe you owe me 100 Goddess Coins.\" Farore said, with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado looked the coins before taking them from farore and nayru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to you three since you tested the Hero of Time and I trust you.\" fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have look in my memories, find the nightmares that I think I have felt before and set them in a dream realm; but you three will have to test me in my fighting skills before that. As to testing me, you should be creative instead of killing and maiming humans.\" he explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe for your coins.\" he suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no! I worked hard for these coins!\" Farore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fa, you bet on a kid's mind. How is that working hard? The only thing it is, is Gambling.\" Din said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sis, just put the coins in.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also Fado, remember we still have this.\" Din said, snapping her fingers, making Fado's Fourth Sword appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this could be an extra prize.\" Nayru said, taking the sword, and putting it with the coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, we except your challenge, as long as you play on our terms.\" Farore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are your terms?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You face us in an arena that suits to our powers.

If you can't find her, just call me, and I'll swallow some lava, that is mine and her's favorite drink, she always drinks it when I swallow it.\" Din said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, din\" fado said just before a chill ran up his spine again and something is in his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr.\" fado said shaking his head and trying to block out the feeling in his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry din, but i have to put a pause on the challenge for now.\" he said before teleporting out of her body and use his power to make a mirage appear and his body fell to the ground around the lava pool<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you swallowed me, i had a bad feeling and that something felt real familiar when it came into my mind.\" fado said clearly shaken up by the feeling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still agree to your teams, but this is only time that i have to do this.\" he said looking at his body as it laid there still<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado stood there like a stone remembering something and it was of a black mass, but it was not made of shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember the feeling was from something made of a black mass, but it was not made of shadows and there was this feeling of evil intent coming from it. When i was younger, i would get these nightmares most likely about the same thing and my mother would be the only one who could calm me down.\" he said with a small sound of fear in his voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can still do the challenge, but i would have to do in a mirage's body since i used a power to switch bodies.\" he said sitting down and looking at din.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we stop for now, and just hang out until your original body is done resting, it/he does kinda look feverish.\" Din suggested.</span></div></div>",

He used his enchantments on both himself and his sword before slicing her arm off and saving his mother from dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Bitch!\u201d He yelled towards the naga and he set his mother down as he was ready for a fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can stand up to me, the Ruler of all Goddesses?!\" The Naga hissed at Fado, showing off her snake-like tongue and body. \"Mother! I demand you stop!\" Chasm said, appearing with everyone else. \"Drop Fado's Mother, and drop the thought of devouring anyone else.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, how is that girl I made you devour when you were seven dear?\" The Naga asked Chasm. \"I can never forgive myself or you for that. I owe her this at least.\" Chasm said, launching a sphere made of his own aura at the Naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt nailed her in the face, and she hissed angrilly. \"As soon as this is done, I'm having your whole family and you go into my stomach acids.\" She said, regenerating the arm that Fado had cut off completely. \"Sorry Mother. But that won't happen.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado.\" Chasm said, bending down to him. \"What Chasm?\" Fado asked. \"I'm going to throw you in the direction of your mother, and I want you to take her, and run. Go back to your house. I'm sorry, but I'm giving you no option.\" Chasm said, picking Fado up, and throwing him in the direction of his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped in mid flight and the marks were glowing stronger than before. He made millions of fados and some of them took his mother to their home as the others with him charged at the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Hell I will.!\" He yelled as he merged with his mirages and formed a giant fado in a mass of shadows <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my fight, Chasm and you do have a option. making me a god.\" he said before grabbing the naga by the tail and swinging her around before letting her fly out of the castle town and into Hyrule Field (think of Mario swinging bowser around then lets him go on a bomb)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe teleported after her and the aura around him was blood red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if your the ruler of Lawn Gnomes, but no one lays a hand on my mother kills her without going through me first.\" he said with a dark voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red energy surrounded him in the form of a wolf and he was growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send you back to the Hell hole you crawled out.\" he said talking like a beast<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of red swords appeared behind him and he charged at the naga with the swords following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry kiddie. Being the ruler of all Gods, I also ascertain every power of Gods and Goddesses. But how about we fight on a more suitable battlefield, I don't want to ruin the land of which I eat the people as normal meals. And don't you dare say I'm not a Goddess, because I am.\" The Naga said. Chasm then jumped in. \"Hello Mother.\" He said, blocking the punches she threw at Lightning Speed to get him out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since you made me eat that young girl, I've got more powerful. In fact, I never told anyone this, but she's still alive.\" Chasm said. \"What, but I saw with my own eyes she digesting in your stomach!\" The Naga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did, I coughed up her bones, and using them, I created her anew. She now lives within the body of one of my daughters. Menyassan. Remove yourself from Din's Body!!\" Chasm yelled, as a Succubus appeared on his should. The Giant Fado looked at her tiny body on Chasm's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tiny thing is going to help you defeat me?!\" the Naga yelled. \"Tiny? Oh no no no. With the bones of Maria, who is now Menyassan, I created the perfect being, a succubus.\" Chasm said. \"Yeah. So, Master Chasm, can I grow now?\" Menyassan asked. \"Yes, please do so. I'm sure my mother would be pleased to see how powerful I made you.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenyassan flew to the other side of Hyrule Field, and sucked all of Fado's Dark Energy off of his Giant Forme, making him shrink back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dark aura flowed off her, she began growing, and didn't stop, until even the Naga was no bigger than her big toe. Even Chasm saw as her tiny wings grew bigger and bigger, until they were the length of ten airplanes and her teeth (Now pointed like a vampire's) were miles long. All she had on clothes wise was a bandana which tore off in the growth process, and a black pair of boots, which stayed on her. Otherwise, she was completely naked, no clothes would ever fit her in this size, so she didn't bother wearing any at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was laughing in the snake\u2019s mind and she could hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~One for Chasm and an ass kicking for you, bitch.~ he said before landing a giant red wolf shadow punch to her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe teleported to Din's shoulder to stay off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Menyassan!?\" Din yelled, floating up to the Gargantuan face of Menyassan. \"Yes Mistress Din, Chasm has summoned me to help take down this bitch he calls his mom.\" Menyassan said. \"That thing is Grandma?!\" Din yelled, completely in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenyassan picked up the Naga, and it was no more than a cut up string of a spaghetti noodle to her. \"I could eat you, it would be so easy.\" Menyassan said, wrapping her saliva-coated, pink tongue around the Naga's small body, making her coated in her saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know how my victims feel, at least I'll be able to take one into death with me.\" the Naga said, wriggling out one of her arms, revealing a person between her fingers. \"Oh no.\" Fado said as he realized that was his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenyassan didn't notice as the Naga ate Fado's Mother whole, and snake tail first, slipped her into her mouth. Fado tried to yell to Menyassan to cough the Naga up, but he was too small compared to her, and didn't have the dark energy to grow to the needed size, but by the time he got Din to, it was already too late, both Fado's Mother and the Naga were swallowed whole by Menyassan, and were digesting in her organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the battle, Fado told Menyassan what she accidentally did, and then Menyassan noticed a humanly presence in her stomach, and told every to stand back so she could regurgitate it, but what everyone didn't know, Succubi don't regurgitate through their mouths, they regurgitate through their vaginas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado's Mother popped out in a pile of Menyassan's Stomach Acid, even though it came out of her vagina, and ran over to Fado, still scared for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado took her home and cleaned her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chasm, I\u2019m going to be busy with my mother and maybe you can clean up the mess.~ he said to him before closing his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasm heard, and smiled yes at him, and told Menyassan to shrink to her normal size, and return to the insides of Din.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore swallowing, Din asked \"Can you stop munching on my insides please Menya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but then regularly you have to eat something appetizing like Lava Rats. Not that disgusting Burger stuff you make me feed on.\" Menyassan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDin smiled, and said \"Sure.\" before tossing Menya in her mouth, and swallowing her like a Giantess, even though she was normal sized.</span></div></div>",

I have some other things to do.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there won't be a next time.

Only to protect unlucky humans who wander in and end up getting devoured.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded before teleporting near chasm and his swords appeared on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess this can be a training trip for me and maybe I can help your friend break the urge.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't happen. Like I said, it can only take a lot of bonding with the Naga/Neko/or Mermaid.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? There are mermaids too?\" Fado asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, except more evil than regular ones. They'll near you towards their bridge with their Siren Song, then they'll hide in the water, and you'll only see their blue face for a moment before swallowing. Also to note: There is no way to get out of Mermaid's Stomach, they're skin is like the unbreakable metal Leon trapped you in, they don't go to the bathroom, and to make it even worse to taunt you there; every mermaid stays completely naked.\" Chasm explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, unless you\u2019re the victim of one Mermaid Giantess named Envy. She always bathes in the lake, and is totally concealed, even above water, so when you walk by, she'll pick you up, and unlike any other Mermaid, she'll slurp you down feet first so you can get one last look at the world.\" Chasm added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it takes a single step or push in the right direction.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you till you get to your friend\u2019s home.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'd best stay in my pocket. Any Naga, even my friend when she's really hungry will starts salivating uncontrollably at the sight of a human.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan they cancel my powers?\u201d fado asked him as he hopped chasm\u2019s open shirt pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Felarya Forest blocks all magic usage. Your sword enchantments are utterly useless there.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But most don't know of this block because no creatures in Felarya are magic users.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know about this block how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm a magic user.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one who enchants swords and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe I have a way to get by it.~ was heard in their heads and fado froze<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What are you doing in my head?~ fado asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Living. Remember, you and I are like leon and chasm.~ he said and fado growled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I don\u2019t kill.~ he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You do if someone like your mother or navi is in danger.~ he said and fado can feel him smirking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado sighed before passing himself out and he took his dark side into a realm of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m going to be busy with him so my body will be sleeping while you are traveling, chasm.~ fado said</span></div></div>",

It was much bigger than when he was young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chasm!\" A Feminine voice called out to him, before he received a hug from behind, only revealing to be his best friend Crisis, who had adapted much more since they were kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crisis! How are you?\" Chasm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good.\" Crisis said, as Chasm noticed she was carrying a woven basket full of fruits and vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that for?\" Chasm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was going to cook a stew for us to enjoy before you got here, but I guess that'll have to wait, because you're here now!\" Crisis said excitedly brushing up against Chasm's chest making Chasm accidentally look at her now uncovered and much developed breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is only one problem.\" Crisis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasm felt fado's inner mind battle getting more serious as it rages on in his mind. Fado is using his hand to hand fighting skills as his dark side is using his swords. The sky is getting dark in his mind, but fado is smiling as lightning generated from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Come on, if you really are me then you should give it all you got. Dark loser.~ was heard from fado's mind to his dark side, but chasm shook his head and looked at his old friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, anyway, what is the problem?\" Chasm asked his big breasted friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, remember that Frost Succubus Arale?\" Crisis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She became the queen of Felarya. All she's done is evil things, that's her Frost Castle to the north. She's making it a rule to eat any human scum who enter. So veggie eaters, like you, me, and Vivian, have to either begin eating humans, or duck out in a safe house.\" Crisis explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight in fado\u2019s mind stopped since they both heard this and agreed to a truce for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about fighting this queen, chasm.\u201d Fado said as he popped his head of the pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sounds like she needs to be taught a lesson.\u201d His dark side said as he appeared next to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a truce while we are here.\u201d They said to chasm and sink back into the pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans. When did you befriend some of those Chasm?\" Crisis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I became the King of the Gods and Goddesses all since my mother was well digested by a succubus named Menya.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ironic, since your mom was such a vital human eater.\" Crisis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to you human, it's fatal to cause an uprising against Arale, because she freezes anything she touches, even the hottest of swords will freeze in her presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado and his dark side teleported to chasm\u2019s shoulder with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good think that I know something about blocking out a block.\u201d Dark fado said to chasm and fado nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy will burns hotter than any flame and I will fight anyone who is like his mother.\u201d Fado said referring to chasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides he is not human.\u201d He said to crisis while pointing to his dark side<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado pulled out his flute and was getting ready to play before he stopped and looked chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay we get inside before I start playing and attract some unwanted attention?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad my little tasties.\" Envy said, walking up to the group, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chasm, it's good to see you again, I hope you've been eating humans as vitally as your mother?\" Envy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm no human eater.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then since you have no use for them, I'll just swipe your little friends.\" She said, swiping Fado and Dark Fado, swallowing them, feet-first down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips. \"Thanks for the snacks. Now they'll never get out, that is, until they're digested and I have to take a piss!\" Envy taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado reappeared on chasm's shoulders with his dark side who is smiling at this mer-bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, but you can't kill us.\" dark fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you called envy?\" fado asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because she never gets what she wants.\" his dark side taunted her with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm called Envy because I should've been the queen. Truth is, I'm not even really a human eater, I was gonna become queen so I could either banish humans from coming into Felarya, or prohibit Felaryians from eating them. I was just following the queens' rule.\" Envy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she had to beat me by one measly vote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like the second idea better.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because there might be some humans that care for those human eaters.\u201d His dark side said appearing on envy\u2019s left shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado\u2019s shot wide before smiling and his dark side smiled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis rule is going to get broken.\u201d Fado said appearing on crisis\u2019s right shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss crisis, can you take us to your home? I have an idea that might work and it involves him.\u201d Fado said while pointing to his dark side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you cute human!\" Crisis said, taking Fado in her free hand, and tickling him non-stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is trying not to laugh from her tickling, but he is starting to lose the mental war on his control and started to chuckle before teleporting to the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is fado, not human.\u201d He said before readying to his flute and throw his ocarina to his dark side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm, I think now would be the time to change the world.\u201d Both fado and his dark side said to their friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I have to get stronger before going to fight my father in the spirit temple.~ fado thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~that is one thing I have to do alone.~ he said in his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, though it may be extremely tough, we need to take down Arale.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go home first and enjoy these veggies and fruits in a stew first.\" Crisis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth fados nodded before they were testing their musical playing, but they were playing a song just to play it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to play something without it controlling something.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm, how did you met your wife?\u201d fado asked him wondering that question for awhile now that he thought about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I actually don't know. I remember being knocked out when I was a teen, then I woke up in a bed with Gaia hunched over me with a concerned face, and I was in my Naga forme, being half snake.\" Chasm explained, grabbing a ripe apple from Crisis' basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you still make me a soulless army?\u201d fado asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid down to crisis\u2019s right shoulder and started to concentrate on his marks. They started to move around on his body and hylia\u2019s mark is on his chest while chasm\u2019s mark appeared from his other daughter\u2019s marks on his forehead, but the other three moved to his right hand, arm and shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd still be able to create a soulless army, except I'd be their maestro.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe and I will be the distractions while chasm makes an army, but there has to be some others that want to fight back.\u201d Fado said while pointing to his dark side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.\" Dark Fado said.</span></div></div>",

Chasm went straight up her pussy, and he felt Arale moan the further he went. He made it to her womb, where her final weak spot would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, y-you do-don't!\" Arale said, shoving her arm right up her vagina to pull Chasm out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasm was sucked into her womb and did the only thing he really could to Arale; take over her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Just keep her busy till I can get out of the card and then the real fun will begin.~ fado said before leaving his mind as he just got an idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm, can you make her get us out of the card?\u201d he asked thinking of something smart<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I can't control her magic power, I can just control her body. So guess what I'm going do.\" Chasm said, grabbing Arale's walls, and controlling her movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made Arale fly to the lava pools, then straight down. While she was diving, Chasm flew out of her womb (Fairies have the magic power to get out of anywhere) and grew to normal size so he could watch Arale, an Ice Goddess, burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN YOU CHASM!\" Arale screeched before Lava embedded in her mouth, setting her insides on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fuck you Queen Bitch.\" Chasm said, giving the Arale 2 middle fingers and continuing to watch her sink into the lava.</span></div></div>",

Fairy Gods or Goddesses born from human souls, as humans were always much larger to fairies, they do.~ Chasm explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I remember seeing navi as a fairy/human hybrid. A human with her wings and maybe she can go into that form again.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I guess, but it'd require more training and we should probably get back to the realm when you wake up. I'm beginning to miss everyone.~ Chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You still have to make dark fado into a dark god before putting him into the realm prison; If I can\u2019t control him.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Besides I don\u2019t know if I should speak with navi and hylia about becoming a fairy god I think I can convince navi since it will be a role reversal between us, but hylia could be more difficult.~ he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I still have to finish the challenge between din and her sisters while planning on taking on my father\u2019s challenge. I\u2019m not doubting myself, but maybe this will be a good challenge for me.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I guess~ Chasm said, during this, Chasm nor Fado noticed that Crisis had fallen asleep laying on Chasm's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Fado, I plan on heading back to the realm soon, and also about Navi and Hylia, Navi will be easy as it's a fairy god you're talking about, but as your \"queen\" Hylia may punish you if you don't become like a water god. Even I don't know what she would do.~ Chasm warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is why I\u2019m going to talk with them first before finishing din and her sister\u2019s challenge.\u201d Fado said waking up from his nap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have made my choice on becoming a fairy god, but it won\u2019t hurt if I talk with them about it.\u201d He said as he getting out of her hair and he teleported to chasm\u2019s other shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly wonder what Hylia would do if she would be to punish you. Because as a Goddess, she can do anything to you, whatever it is, it probably won't be good.\" Chasm said, before falling asleep himself, since he wouldn't be able to go back until Crisis wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe I can test her in her skill of water control and make a deal with her, but either way this won\u2019t be easy.~ he thought as he went to meditate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You said that right, Hylia is stubborn though. You should seen the rage she threw when we tried to feed her veggies for the first time.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Can we meet the king and queen fairies before we leave? I think I have an idea that might work.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I'll have Crisis drop you off there, and I'll wait for you by the door back to the realm.~ Chasm thought, before closing his mind, so Fado was unable to speak with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado continue to meditate as the two slept and he was trying to think of a plan. The night quickly passed by and Fado was still unable to think of anything. </span></div></div>",

Hylia may punish you for not becoming a water god, you should see when she's violent, you don't even wanna know what her dark forme did to me.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be something I have to deal with.\u201d He said determined<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a sound of deadly serious in fado\u2019s voice and chasm caught that, but he felt his emotions is like a bomb ready to go off if something sets the fuse and lights it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she has to learn that she can\u2019t get everything she wants.\u201d Fado said before popping his neck, shoulders, and back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She may be spoiled, she may need a lesson or two, but she's my daughter, remember, I come down to being a protective dad sometimes, so if you try to hurt her, I won't hesitate to kill you Fado.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if she is going to punish you with me? What then?\u201c he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t hurt her with my swords, but you will have to trust me on something.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t hurt her directly, but if she strikes at both of us I\u2019m willing to take all of the punishment for you.\u201d He said while touching the mark of chasm on his forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that you and I will do anything to protect our families, but there is some things that she has to learn the hard way and you have to let it pass.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but remember, just go lightly. Like I said, I won't hesitate to harm you Fado.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I\u2019m going to use is my arms, legs, and maybe my dark side\u2019s powers if I have to.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess we'll head back to the realm?\" Chasm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, don\u2019t you have to get dark fado\u2019s bones from crisis to make him a dark god?\u201d fado asked reminding him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to see the fairies before we leave, though.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods, I completely forgot! Crap, his bones and soul are probably disintegrated inside Crisis now.\" Chasm said, panicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Well thanks a lot douchebags. Well, at least I can still communicate using Fado's mind.~ Dark Fado said pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado started to laugh at something funny before closing his eyes and started to concentrate, but he teleported in front of crisis\u2019s stomach before he started to hit at various points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm, can you lay her down somewhere soft like on the leaves she was on earlier?\u201d he asked as continued hitting her stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Chasm said laying Crisis on a small bed of leaves, then popping his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado slammed into the beginning of her snake half and there was a strange sound from her stomach before there are a phrrrrrrrrrrrrrrft sound and she crapped the body out. The soul floated out and he was not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Don\u2019t do that again.~ dark fado said and fado smiled before he was laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasm burst out laughing at that, then simply said \"I could've just teleported you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You could have done that in the first place.~ dark fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you can make him a dark god.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Chasm said, pulling D. Fado's soul towards his hands and casting a few mists of magic around him and he began to regain his physical form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Will you be able to hand the power?~ fado asked his dark side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I feel dark energy rising to maximum levels.\" D. Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should be in the realm prison so you can learn to control it.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso be near my wife.\u201d Dark fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. So I say to you...vanish.\" Chasm said making D. Fado disappear into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019ll use your own powers if I have to and maybe you can get out less than three years. I\u2019ll try to help you control your powers.~ fado said to his dark side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm, should we wake her up?\u201d he asked about crisis<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'll just tell her we have to leave early throughout thought, and then we can head out. You don't want to see Crisis when she's agrivated. Especially if you're a human.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she can show me the fairy kingdom when I come back for training.\" fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have her wait for you, however I won't come with you at that time, so whatever happens to you here, Crisis is responsible.\" Chasm said, before walking to the door which had opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado teleported to his normal spot which is inside chasm\u2019s open shirt pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I hope hylia can be reasonable.~ fado thought before getting serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chasm, I think I might have to go hard on her if she gets too violent. Would you agree?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just see what she does first. Then I'll stop her if I need to, I am the most powerful of all Gods you know.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you sounded like you and maybe gaia were scared of her when she gets violent.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if. It's called acting Fado.\" Chasm said. \"She's my daughter, why would I be scared of her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause she might have more power than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, all I'd have to do is a little soul sucking from Menyassan, and I could easily become the most powerful being of galaxies. Though I'd rather not do it, I'm afraid of becoming power-hungry, and I wouldn't anyone on Earth to be caught up in it.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red wolf walked over to chasm and looked at crisis before sit while watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where does that thing come from? Is that like Dark or someone else?\" Chasm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was created when I was my dark side take over the first time, but I think it becoming linked to me since I\u2019m the other side of dark fado. It comes from my rage, but only when I\u2019m pissed off like when your mother attack castle town.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was just depressed at that. But now Menyassan has all her power, and if I need it, I have good access to it.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you will need it that power.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have all the power you need inside of you.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, also I should mention I can suck powers from enemies and allies, keeping them or giving them back would amplify them by 10-100 times. Your welcome for that helpful tip.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could have forced that ice bitch to release me from that card, but do I really have to be in your stomach to leave?\u201d fado said thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I was just kidding on that, though I do have to put you somewhere so you don't get ripped apart and killed in the travel between dimensions.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~In your head?~ fado thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly, though you did somehow make it when in my shirt pocket so I guess that could be much easier.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Well, that was before I was stuck in a card.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Were you born a naga or were you a human and your mother turned you into a naga god?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it. My Mom was a Naga, My Dad was human, in a sense, I was made a Naga God, even though I was one from birth.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Did she eat him?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting thing, I do know that Nagas, in order to actually give birth, they have to devour 7 humans souls. But knowing my mother, she probably over-packed on the humans, and gave birth to me like that, and that's also most likely how I'm able to transform into any type of creature.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Don\u2019t you have mind control?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever say I did, I don't think I did.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Well, you said that you can transform into any god so I was thinking that you can become a dark god.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, in that case, I've actually never tried this before, maybe it'll come in handy sometime soon, but let's just head on back to the realm, I'm sure the family misses us.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado nodded before teleported into chasm\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yeah I would hate it if mom and navi were worrying about me.~ he thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark did get eaten twice, but they don't know him, so let's head on back.\" Chasm said, continuing through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I know you would have to tell gaia about this trip and I would tell navi and hylia, but what about my mom and your other daughters?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just say you came along with me for a training trip.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Alright.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's head out.\" Chasm said pushing the door open and going through.</span></div></div>",

Welcome home! Welcome home to you too little follower o' mine!\" Hylia said, hugging Chasm at his waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHylia, where is my mom?\u201d fado asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom is speaking with my mom, she's more calm towards gods now. I can take you to the chamber their talking in.\" Hylia said, grabbing Fado off Chasm's shoulder and walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl.\" Chasm said, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHylia, before we go to them I need you to take me to see navi first.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you wanna see your mom, you've been gone for a whole week.\" Hylia said, still heading towards the chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I do; but there is something you, me, and navi have to talk about.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it can wait awhile.\u201d He added before thinking about his mother<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHylia soon arrived at the chambers where Fado's mother was chatting with Gaia peacefully. Chasm however went back to Navi's Room to tell her about Fado's wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, we\u2019re back.\u201d Fado said getting his and hylia\u2019s mother\u2019s attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah son, I heard from Ms. Gaia here that you went on a trip with Mr. Chasm to some kind of Forest.\" Fado's Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I have something to tell you all.\" Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado wishes to become a god of your species.\" Chasm revealed to Navi as they were sitting in Navi's Bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to become a fairy god.\" Fado basically repeated in the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW COULD YOU! I HATE YOU FOLLOWER!\" even Chasm and Navi could hear that from the Chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious Hylia had screamed this, but she quickly calmed down unusually and forcefully took Fado and His mother towards her room. He teleported his mother back to gaia\u2019s hands before using the shadows to grow to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you listen to my reason why hylia?\u201d fado asked staring her down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You betrayed me Fado, and followers who betray their goddess are punished.\" Hylia said, using water compression to shrink him back down then trap him in negate barrier, which negates all powers and abilities Fado could possibly had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t betray you Hylia!\u201d fado yelled before shattering the barrier with his real strength from his will<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew back to her size and hold her in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust listen to me.\u201d He said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Let go of me! I have the right to punish you!\" Hylia said, struggling her way out of the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou spoiled child.\u201d Was heard as fado\u2019s father appeared again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have his will, but navi has his heart and if you hurt him you will hurt your sister.\u201d He said as fado\u2019s grip gets tighter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chasm, Gaia, and navi, I think I need some help with her.~ fado said to them not caring if she heard it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHylia, you have to learn that you can\u2019t and/or won\u2019t get everything you want in life.\u201d Fado said as his father is watching them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! I don't care for someone who a big, fat, liar, traitor!\" Hylia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you! Why don't you suffer! I hate you Fado! You were supposed to become a water god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, but only after I live life as a fairy god and had the training.\u201d fado said holding her down tight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Even as a human, you should know when being made a god, you get no free switches! I hate you!\" Hylia said, pounding on him until they teleported to a large lake and Hylia was gone entirely from Fado's Point of View.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you hate me that bad, then you better seriously hurt me.\u201d Fado said with deadly seriousness before the red wolf appeared and covered his body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado took a stance and ready for a fight, but the wolf looks human standing over fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cALRIGHT THEN HYLIA! PUNISH ME WITH ALL YOU GOT!\u201d fado yelled with a roar and a howl from the wolf<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is deathly calm before waiting for her to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw he was standing on an open lily-pad, and thought this to be dangerous since Hylia had been trained to be a water goddess. Fado saw the creeping of something very red and slimy, just beneath the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Fado.\" an echoed voice of Hylia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight Fishing is dangerous, especially for humans, but it's delicous for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Fado was trapped in a closing mouth, as the lily-pad he was standing on was easily swallowed, and he was barely hanging onto the tooth of whatever was attacking him. He wasn't sure this was exactly Hylia, mainly because whatever this was, it had a large snake tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your attacks won't work on my creation, none of them will, his body also nullifies teleportation. So good luck trying to get out without being digested.\" Hylia boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat my little pet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado then knew what attacking him wasn't Hylia or a snake, but yet a Felaryan Amoeba Giantess and he could look out her throat. He saw that even if he had evaded this one, Hylia, who was over 100x her normal size was tapping her sandaled foot on the water like it was a solid surface. The Amoeba Giantess continued to tilt her head back until she felt Fado plop into her watery stomach acids. Fado was very much stuck within this prison only having the ability to look outside and see Hylia cooing the Amoeba Giantess like a baby girl. Fado tried stabbing his sword anywhere possible, but sure enough Hylia was telling the truth unless he could get peed or pooped out there was no way of escape not even his teleportation worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado appeared outside of the creature as the fado that was eaten made millions of fados in the stomach pilling up and he made them block up the throat of the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will always have ways to beat someone.\u201d Fado said before the creature started to choke on the fados<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it choking on the mirages, the eaten fado jumped out of the mouth and the other fados vanished except the fado that is in the air. The wolf is growling before a massive water cannon was formed and it fired high pressurized water bombs at her and her creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad Idea Traitor.\" Hylia said as the water blasts continually hit her and the Amoeba Giantess making them grow and grow and grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done, Fado and the wolf were no bigger than the Amoeba Giantess' Pinky Toe and no bigger than a speck to Hylia's Sandals, which was over Millions' of Miles tall to them. The Amoeba GTS was also able to finally swallow every Fado and digest them Fado and the Wolf watching every copies' skin burn in the stomach acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just get rid of you myself.\" Hylia said. She picked Fado up, and placed him in one of her gigantic molars inside her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was slowly closing her mouth to have her molars grind him into bloody chunks, she set up a more powerful negate barrier, one that couldn't be broken as easily as the last. Fado and the Wolf watched in fear as the top molar began to drill off the top of the Negate Barrier. Fado saw her salivating tongue, and began to realize all his fighting, for his mother, for his life, for Navi's life, all of it was useless, because he would die today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado, if you're really scared like that. then just let me do this.\" Chasm said, appearing the same size as him, but outside the negate barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should hold her off.\" Chasm said, sticking a metal bar between the lodges of her molars, and the disintegrating negate barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Menyassan, I'm very sorry, but I have to do this.\" Chasm said, pulling the succubus from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to grow inside my daughter.\" Chasm said, tears streaming down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Menyassan said.</span></div></div>",

This takes litteral seconds normal time, but you could mentally be there for more than an hour if needed.\" Chasm explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado nodded before having a giant red hand over his own and he slapped hylia across the face, but not hard enough to leave a mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I wanted to betray you, I would have done it without telling you and navi; but I have been considerate of you and navi.\u201d He said with a hurt tone and his fist clenched<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to see this from my point of view, goddess.

I want to see what is like to be a fairy god since I have a chance.\u201d He said as tears started to fall down his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you have to be a spoiled brat and try to kill me for not wanting to be a water god!\u201d he yelled before making her bonds vanished and letting her go<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thing you have to learn is that you have to think of others beside yourself and that includes your follower, family, and their family.\u201d he said with a dark tone before sending her out of his mind realm and back to the realm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you can leave if you want, I want to be left alone.\u201d He said as his body left the realm and teleported to the chamber of Sages while he was still in his mind</span></div></div>",

He was here learning about the sages from Zelda and the sage of light during one of her visits and she wanted to take him on a trip. He pulled out his flute and played a song with all of the temple songs in it; it was his own idea to thank them for helping the Hero of time stopping gannondorf. He even helped Zelda make a song for the temple of time and he made it apart of his song. He learned everything from Zelda, the sages, link and there has been a few times where Zelda came to him as sheik; but he didn\u2019t link them together until they played the same instrument or she gave him a hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chasm, before I forget, you might need to guide leon\u2019s soul to gaia so they can have a brother to care for.~ fado thought to him as he was playing his song called \u201cSong of the Sage\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yes of course, I did see some Leon when my mother burped that time.~ Chasm said scanning the heavens for Leon's soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then dragged the soul to Gaia, and she gave birth to the new baby god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado nodded and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe he can do light magic.~ he suggested to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he finished the song before he started to think about hylia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~\u2026\u2026.How is hylia feeling after my outburst at her?~ he asked still feeling concerned for her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I talked to her a few moments ago, her cheek still hurts a bit, but she's mainly okay, and that giantess you beat reverted back to the water formation I gave her years ago. It's something I made that can morph into any animal.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado sighed before putting his flute back where he put it and he went into a meditative position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~How do you feel about it?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Eh, it's okay now. I would've crushed you if Hylia didn't try to kill you.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~When I get back, I would like to see her in her room, before anything else.~ he said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado made his sage sword appeared and stabbed it into the center as the pedestals started to glow; reacting from the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I request a word with the sages that sealed the evil king away.\u201d Fado said as his words were traveling to the sages of the temples<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just me here. Everyone else is off in their kingdoms doing something else. Ah, the life of a little girl.\" a childish voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Figure came from the ground on the Forest Pedestal. It was a young Kokiri Girl; everyone in Hyrule knew as Saria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh miss Saria, Sage of the forest and childhood friend of the hero of time.\u201d Fado said as he opened his eyes to see her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a good friend to navi. Before you ask how I know, let me tell you what happened.\u201d he said before explaining his story so far<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, you've had quite a lot of things happen Fado. But it's always good to know that someone is safe.\" Saria gasped once he was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is that really true, the water goddess Hylia tried to murder you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe tried, but I stopped her father from killing her after he freed me and I bound her down using some of the shadow power.\u201d He said, but he looked at the shadow pedestal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried my best to reason with her, but my emotions burst out from their bottle and I exploded at her so I slapped her with a dark giant hand.\u201d He said not happy about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That takes guts, and a pretty ballsy mind.\" Saria said, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the only thing I could do without causing any serious harm to her.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Fado, I think there is someone in your life you wanna protect, which is why you keep doing this crazy things no human would ever do.\" Saria said, stepping in circles around Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it possibly a female whom recently became a goddess?\" Saria asked, randomly flashing into what looked like a Sherlock Holmes outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d He said keeping a straight face, but he is smiling in his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it maybe the Navi I'm good friends with?\" Saria asked with a smirk on her face, already knewing it would be the correct answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is Navi, but she is not the only one in my life that I will protect.\u201d He said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see, you one day wish to become a god, and do your best to protect all of Hyrule, is it not?\" Saria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to protect my mother alongside with navi.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is the other person in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for becoming a god, for me there are two ways and I\u2019m going to do both of them.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask the knowledge of these two ways?\" Saria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can, but sadly I won\u2019t tell you.\u201d He said</span></div></div>",

Would you like to tell her?\u201d he asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only reveal that info to humans and gods, maybe she wants to be one.\" Chasm said, turning into his Naga form, and wrapping her up with his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaria, do you want to be a god?\u201d he asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no one's ever asked me, but I do want to be a Cypress Goddess. Protecting and playfully torturing humans with giant vines, that's what I would call fun.\" Saria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess I can do that. First, it'll require me to do this.\" Chasm said, shrinking Saria down to about 3 inches, to where Fado and Chasm were gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado, could you carry Lady Saria?\" Chasm asked, handing the shrunken girl to Fado, who simply placed her in his pants pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to go back to the realm.\u201d Fado said honestly feeling better<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if Lady Saria is too become a Cypress, than I need to warp home, and grab a few things. I will warp you to where we have to be.\" Chasm said, making Fado and Saria disappear than the same with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado and Saria appeared in a grassy plain. Then Chasm appeared with Gaia and they had...gardening tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d fado asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait.\" Gaia said, digging a small hole with the shovel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now place Saria in this pill.\" Chasm said, holding a glass pill up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado placed Saria in then Chasm after closing the capsule dropped it into the small shoveled hole.Gaia then covered it up with dirt, and Chasm sprinkled growth water over the spot. Before their eyes, Saria burst out of the capsule, feet already merging as a tree, and clothes becoming tighter and tighter as her and her bodily features grew and grew. Her skin turned a light green, and she was completely naked from her large vagina (Half covered by her tree stump legs) up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado is surprised to see this and moved back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big is she going to get?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if she was just a normal Kokiri or Human, she'd stop at about 1000ft. But since she's a Kokiri and a Forest Sage, then she could possibly get up to 5000ft, or even higher if she's lucky.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked looking at the still growing saria before looking around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Forest Sanctuary of the Realm.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaia, do you know any gods that my father served?\u201d he asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well little Fado, I do know he served me, and another Dark God or Goddess, I don't know which.\" Gaia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado nodded, but he started to think of dark navi has the other since he knows it wasn\u2019t his dark side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm, I want to take the mind test.\u201d He said feeling ready<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then I want to be a fairy god like I planned it.\u201d He said setting his plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it may not come out to that. The Questioner may choose you as something different.\" Chasm said, when Saria had stopped growing around 7000ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado nodded before teleporting to see saria\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe I would be linked to the triforce if I become a god.~ he thought to himself\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It honestly feels different.\" Saria said, jiggling her now naked and giant boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also can't move around, and I can't see many people like this. It also feels weird being transferred from a forever kid to a forever adult tree with gigantic breasts, I mean, have you seen these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used one of her now green fingers to knock Fado off her shoulder and in between her giant breasts. He blushed before teleporting back to her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you wanted to be a cypress goddess.\u201d He said with a nervous smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you liked being in there. How about you spend a little more time in there, I'm not going anywhere.\" Saria laughed knocking Fado back down this time smashing her boobs together jostling Fado around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~This is not my idea.~ fado said as he was blushing red this time teleporting out and appearing next to chasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Man, that was close.~ he said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince when she was like that?\u201d he asked shaking the blood away from his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she's just excited she's finally taller than people she thinks of herself now sexy and wants to share this with you go ahead back up there.\" Chasm said tossing Fado back up to Saria's hand even though he was human sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Saria shoved Fado in her mouth, and played with him by jabbing him with her tongue. He batting the tounge away with his hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Why are you encouraging this?~ he asked chasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You know that I love navi.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Dude, just let her play with you, it's her first time with someone who's smaller than her, other than a child who she's ordered to bless every once and a while.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Gaia, how did you meet him?~ he asked her as he started to wrestle with the tongue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I was picking fruit in the Felaryan Forest, when I saw Chasm in his Naga form being chased by other types of creatures. Then I saw in his hands why. Chasm had been slithering away with a mass horde of humans, obviously protecting him. He was beaten down by the creatures, but he had successfully protected those humans by hiding them in his mouth. He actually swallowed 2 of them, but he didn't realize it, and still doesn't, the others didn't see though.~ Gaia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ I took him back to my resort lounge in the mountains, and healed him back to health.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Are they the same souls that din has within her body?~ he asked to both mostly to chasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Wait what? No I just dragged those from a graveyard and gave them life inside Din.~ Chasm said to Fado only<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Don't tell him about that you partially dimwitted human!~ Gaia said only to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~So even gods and goddess have secrets hidden from each other.~ he thought feeling slightly depressed before batting away at the tongue again playing with saria<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yes, he'd only be saddened if he found out that he killed more humans than just Maria, Menya's past form.~ Gaia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You feel like you need something to hit.~ dark fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yeah, I\u2019m tired of all the secrets.~ fado said mentally hitting a wall within his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What\u2019s more important, gaia? Telling the truth so you both can feel better or keeping it a secret so you can protect him. Isn\u2019t it your job to tell your daughters to tell the truth, but you do the opposite towards him?~ he asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I don't know. I haven't told him because, because i was worried he wouldn't love me anymore for keeping a secret as huge as him killing little humans.~ Gaia said, holding her hand towards her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado teleported out and made his body get engulfed in flames so he can dry off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA trip for three coming up.\u201d Fado said before teleporting him, gaia, and chasm to his realm and he sealed off their escape and all of chasms powers for when he gets mad<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey appeared at a field, but it has a table and chairs with tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. I only brought us here so we can have some questions answered and let out any skeletons in the closets.\u201d Fado said like a doctor as he sit them at the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour powers won\u2019t work here since I sealed them away.\u201d He added looking at chasm for a moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm, how much do love and trust gaia?\u201d he asked gauging him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's my wife, I'd trust her no matter what is said.\" Chasm said heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, what if she has a secret about you accidently eating two humans from your past?\u201d he asked him still gauging him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it be better if she told you that secret then not at all?\u201d he asked with a straight face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess, but I've never eaten a human purposely in my life.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado got up with a nod before walking over to gaia and leaned to her right ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell him now while we are still on the subject.\u201d He whispered in her ear before pulling out his flute and sit on the stump ready to play a song<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Love, I've been keeping a secret from you.\" Gaia said. \"What is it Gaia?\" Chasm asked. \"You actually have eaten more than one human. 2 others back then.\" Gaia said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh those two, yeah I chatted with their souls when you weren't looking years ago, they said they actually jumped down my throat, saying they'd rather be killed by a protector than a harmer.\" Chasm explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I offered to turn them into creatures like Menya but they refused, so they made me let their bones digest in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You were worried that he wouldn\u2019t love you anymore.~ fado said to gaia, but it was heard from all around<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unsealed their escape and chasms powers.</span></div></div>",

Because I've been appointed by Daddy to build your new mansion, just your size.\" Hylia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might better if we take my mother with us so I won\u2019t have to make a second trip.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might do her some good than staying up here.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure said it.\" Hylia said, using some of her growing psychic ability to locate and transport Fado's mother to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Fado's Mom, are you ready to take a field trip?\" Hylia asked, as if she were a teacher and Fado and his mother were mere students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m ready.\u201d She said before hugging her son<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's go!\" Hylia said, setting them on the top of her head, so they'd have a fantastic view of the new Crystal Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHylia ran out into Hyrule Fields, her bare feet making indents in the sandy path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two ready to watch me build your mansion?\" Hylia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does she mean, mansion?\" Fado's mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just out of kindness.\" Hylia lied, when it really was a part of punishment from Chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, I\u2019ll tell you about it later.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, hylia we\u2019re ready.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHylia ran into the Crystal Kingdom, and saw a tall, perfect building to build their new mansion on. While using her psychic abilities to grab the tools she required, she accidentally crushed a car under her bare foot, and which she gasped, and checked under her foot, luckilly for everyone, there was no-one in the car at that time. Hylia first made the building their mansion would stand on, much more durable, than began to use everything she grabbed to carefully build their mansion. Fado and his mother talked and caught up for almost 3 hours before Hylia was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-da!\" Hylia presented, the new 7 story mansion Fado and his mom would live in, also crushing another car in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woops.\" Hylia sighed, checking her foot again, relieved for no humane blood being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, your new house. Congrats.\" Hylia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Hylia.\u201d Fado said before he teleported both his mom and himself to the mansion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, I think that maybe this could be better for us and it would give us more room.\u201d He said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chasm wanted to you build it as part of your punishment, right?~ he said hylia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yep, you got it.~ Hylia huffed, putting her foot down crushing another empty car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~We should have you work in a demolition office.~ Fado joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado made mirages appear at their old house to get their things to move into this house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chasm, can hylia come inside human sized?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my choice, not dads. May I show you two around?\" Hylia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Fado said as his copies were moving their things in to the house<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHylia shrunk down to size, and warped into a sexy tour guide outfit. She showed Fado and his mother every floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lobby is, well, it's the Lobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floor 1 is the bedrooms, with 2 occupied rooms, and 7 extra.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floor 2 is training rooms, specialized for Fado with every type of weapon: Swords, Bow and Arrows, all that good stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floor 3 is the sun room, with glass panes and hot tubs, what could be better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floor 4 is restaurants, interchangeable may I add, with this lever, here are 100% discount cards by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floor 5, I decided to add a game floor, in case Fado has any girls over who may be tomboyish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floor 6, being the last, in building floor, is probably the most relaxing, as it has closets with Swimsuits of all kinds, and pools of extreme relaxation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floor 7, landing area. Here, a private Jet or Heli can come take you to wherever you need all at the notify of a tablet right over there, or you can use your custom built X-Flyers, made from the rubble of cars I stepped on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the tour.\u201d His mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you can help the copies move our stuff.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I'm a Goddess not a mover jockey.\" Hylia joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I call Navi down here, maybe you and here can get some hang time, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winked at Fado as she returned to her normal size and back in the swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, do you want to stay here to see the mirages move our things into the house?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather check out the sun room that looked amazing.\" Fado's Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the copies finished moving the stuff into the house and they moved it into the bedrooms. Fado left one of them in charge of protecting his mother and he teleported to hylia\u2019s left shoulder.</span></div></div>",

He pushed the checker in the frontwards direction, and Hylia easily moved a piece near with just a touch of her finger. He jumped that checker. He couldn't exactly see right, because the checker Hylia moved, happened to be right in front of Fado's checker, and not diagonal. He moved the one behind him. Hylia moved one, and jumped the one that was in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Score was now at:<br>\r\nHylia: 1<br>\r\nFado: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado made his move and was able to jump one of hers. She was then able to jump one of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHylia, how is this a fair game?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you chose it, you also can change it. But it'll still be my sized. Unless of course you choose catch and stomp.\" Hylia answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is catch and stomp?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's basically tag, except the human is invincible, and a Giant or Giantess such as myself would chase you. If I were to trap you in a negate barrier say like this.\" Hylia said, trapping Fado in a negate barrier, and then recalling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It stands up to anything and negates anything and everything, except the invincibility. If I were to catch you, I could stomp and jump on you as many times as I like when I'm done the invincibility wears off and the game ends.\" Hylia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was thinking as he was making his move and he jumped onto the checker and looked at the board. He smiled knowing what to do. He picked up the checker and did a triple jump. Hylia then made an amazing quadruple jump, claiming herself quite a few of Fado's pieces, then putting the score at around Hylia (6) Fado (3). He made his move by jumping over five of her pieces. Hylia then jumped the remaining 6 of his pieces in one go, and won the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm an ace.\" Hylia said, as soon as she won.</span></div></div>",

Hylia went back to the realm realized it was actually night-time there and everyone was asleep so she headed to bed as well. He was sleeping soundly in his bed as thoughts were flying around in his head soon he fell into a deep sleep. Hylia soon did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I wonder if I could teach navi how to use water to inflate body parts.~ he said in his sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Please Fado, you can have such a mind of a p.e.r.v.~ Navi said, communicating through sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m not a pervert, navi, but I wanted to show you something cool.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Sure, you just wanted me to inflate my boobs, I know how all teenage men are, Fado. Don't try me.~ Navi said, chuckling in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~No, there is more to it than that and it\u2019s one thing I won\u2019t teach your sister.~ he said as he appeared at the lake in his sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~But you have to be to normal size so I can see the difference.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yawwwn. Let's do this in the morning, I'm really heading to sleep now.~ Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Ok, but I want to spend some time with you, my beautiful fairy goddess.~ he said before making some water form ice sculptures of navi in all forms<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi saw this as she was sleeping, and blushed wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Here, for my soon to be Fairy God.~ She said, using the sand near the lake to make a 50ft tall sculpture of her and Fado arm-in-arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Navi, I\u2019m going to talk a test so I can see which god I\u2019m best suited, but I\u2019m going to delay my fairy god plan alittle so I can get training as a god of the realm first.~ he said before making an ice sculpture of them kissing and another one of them only him carrying her like a bride<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Aww, we'd make a great husband and wife duo. Maybe we should marry one day. Possibly if you luckily do become fairy god.~ Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I will, but it going has to wait and I would like to see you in your human/fairy hybrid form. Chasm said that it will more training or so.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe teleported near her and stole a kiss from her before he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I only have eyes for you.~ he said with a toothy grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~It doesn't matter what form I'm in for you to see me and I have those same eyes for you.~ Navi said, giving him a more passionate kiss on the lips then leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the dream and went back into a deep sleep, but he was smiling on the inside and singing a song in his sleep. Navi appeared in his dreams at her full size, but she seemed much darker mannered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you possibly Dark Navi?\" Fado asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says I am. What if I'm regular Navi?\" She said, a wave of black rushing over her clothes and skin, leaving her eyes a glittery red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out my beloved wife.\" Dark Fado said appearing at his full size for a Dark God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop messing with my light-sides' dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark Fado?\" Fado asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as Dark Gods, our special ability is Dream Invader meaning we can either appear to you inside or communicate with you using the power of Dreams.\" Dark Fado explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but why are you in my dreams?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to tell you that.\" Dark Fado said, as he and Dark Navi vanished from Fado's Dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Wow, he was right about dark navi being hot; but my navi is smoking hot.~ he said before going back to his singing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Thanks for the complements.~ Fado heard both Navis say simultaneously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I thought you went to sleep.~ he said to his navi<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went deep into his mind before playing the song he made for the sages. His head was silent as he played the song. Soon he finished the song and he started to make sculptures of the sages. Once made, he sent the seven sculptures to their respective locations and sages. He made another set, but he sent them to his room with the navi sculptures and a smaller version of the sand sculpture with the bride sculpture. He smiled gently at his work and quietly drifted off to sleep. He dreams of spending days with navi and hylia, but shows link a way to fuse the fierce deity sword and the master sword. Talks with his mother as sparring with his dad in the spirit temple, but the last thing he sees is the wedding of him and navi with him having become a fairy god and a god of the realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe I can get a family picture of everyone and we can do it around saria in the realm.~ he said thinking in his sleep around the dreams</span></div></div>",

Aren't you both quite young for that?~ Chasm thought to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What is the age for marriage?~ fado asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I allow no less than 23 for marriage.~ Chasm thought/said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~How long were you there?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Long enough to hear you and Navi chatting as lovers.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You heard me say your name.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yep~ was all Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m serious on marrying her and she is the only one for me.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~As if you wish. I shall allow, I sense that Navi loves you too. So when the time comes. My blessing shall indefinitely fall onto you in the correct sense.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe I shouldn\u2019t rush things, but I know she is the one for me.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Haha. As you wish, young warrior.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I still have to beat din and nayru\u2019s challenges. Hmm, how am I going to plan this?~ he said thinking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Just a piece of advice, maybe in an alternate reality, you've already beaten them. If you can get advice from that Fado, you should be able to do just about anything.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~At least that's what the legendary book says.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Riddle me this: how do I do that?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Well in theory, there lies a temple somewhere in either Earth or Felarya and it says there is a magical time/space rift one that can actually abridge the gates of time and space so you can see yourself in another world. If you were to meet and defeat yourself then absorb them, you'd become immortal.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I have the Fairy Queen Subeta working on finding that for me.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hmm, why would I become immortal?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I can\u2019t see myself living forever and see everyone else die.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~That wouldn't be fun.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~why are you looking for it?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Meh, I'd need something to do.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I wonder why my father didn\u2019t see me during my childhood.~ he said thinking about him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~He was always away on adventures, needing that exploration feeling.~ Chasm said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~But if he needed the exploration feeling, he could have just stayed here with the child you. Children are especially hard to take care of.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What were you doing at the time? Besides being stuck in the master sword.~ he asked feeling sarcastic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Actually, at that time I wasn't stuck in the Master Sword. I was a young god in fact the one who'd just been chosen to grant the Master Sword to the Hero Link. Yeah, I defeated that bitch Ganon, not Link.~ Chasm laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~So how did you get stuck in there?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Like I said, chosen, not forced into.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Was my mother chosen to be a follower for someone?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yes, believe it or not, she was follower of my father, who was made godly before marriage with my mother.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Will she be chosen again?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I don't know.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Ok.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m trying to think of you as a father figure during my childhood or was that link.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I can't tell you that.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Why?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Simple Answer. I just can't, it's something God's have to keep confidential. You know, like C.I.A stuff, but for Gods~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~If I become a god will you then tell me?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~When you become a god.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Alright.~ he said before closing his mind and going back to sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You're a good kid Fado, you're father and mother must be proud.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You can say that again.~ fado\u2019s father said to chasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Haha. Good to see ya. How's your training coming along?~ Chasm asked Fado's Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Good, but does he know I\u2019m still alive?~ he said referring to his son<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~No, he thinks you\u2019re dead and your spirit is in the Spirit Temple waiting to fight. Which that's probably true aside from the Spirit part.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Heh, your mother ate a copy of my real body.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Like father like son.~ he said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You and navi were in the spirit temple, but not in far enough to see me.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m in the room where the hero of time fought twinrova.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Ah, I guess that saying is true, well I'm off. See ya later, if possible, I'd like to get a fight with you sometime as well.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Either before or after he becomes a god, you and him with navi, the other three, and hylia come see me and you will have your chance.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~If he wins, he may find out that he has sisters that are waiting to see him in felarya.~ he said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Well, I'll tell him that.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Don\u2019t. or not yet. He doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m a rare kind of person with the same ability as you are in your naga form.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I would like to be the one to tell him in person instead of my spirit form.~ he said with a bit of regret<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Okay. If you're still alive, I'd still ask you of course to continue following Gaia as you always have and were chosen too.~ Chasm said, before leaving completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I never stopped, but I asked her to keep me being alive a secret till I feel ready for him to find out.~ he said before leaving and return to his body</span></div></div>",

Thank god your alive!\" Navi said stopping her running and kissing Fado everywhere on his tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same thing would have happened when one of them ate me.\u201d He said after navi finished kissing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was placed in between Navi's now giant, jiggly breasts, which was covered by a red bra and blue shirt. She used her hands to jump them up, and Fado jiggled in her boobs for minutes on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that necessary?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, but wasn't it fun?\" Navi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get me to blush.\u201d He said before rubbing them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to try that meeting again?\u201d he asked\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, my father saw me eat, you know Chasm frowns upon that.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was an accident we know that and he knows that.\u201d He said rubbing her breasts trying to cheer her up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s try that again.\u201d He said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chasm, can you convince her?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~She's seems pretty intent on impressing me for some reason.

He used enough power to make them feel it before the hands vanished and stayed on navi\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you try to eat me again, I will make you feel that you are helpless as a human.\u201d He said to both as he ready to make the move<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep, lunch is fierce.\" Kana and Subeta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So human, what would you think about becoming a neko warrior for my kingdom?\" Kana said, wrapping her cattail around Fado bringing him to her lips and giving him a large kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, if he becomes a creature, he becomes a Fairy Warlord for my domain.\" Subeta said stealing him with fairy magic and giving him a large kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little annoyed with them, fado made the move to his realm and chasm with navi came with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only domain I\u2019m staying with is her!\u201d fado yelled as he pointed to navi<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling pissed off he slammed his fists in the ground making a huge crater and the wolf appeared next to him looking calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, I have stronger restraint on my anger than I thought.\u201d He said fairly surprised at himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a fairy god and nothing will change my mind.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, maybe he can become a neko god.\u201d Fado\u2019s father said appearing in the realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut only after he finished his training as a god of the realm and a fairy god.\u201d He quickly added before walking to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you\u2019re becoming a Fairy Warlord, how delightful.\" Subeta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado\u2019s father smiled before changing his appearance to a fairy god then a neko god before returning to his human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon, before your test meet me at the spirit temple; but I will have a surprise for you where the hero of time defeated twinrova.\u201d He said before leaving<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I\u2019ll have to see this surprise.\u201d Fado said before making kana and subeta shrink to human size<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be what I want to be; not some puppet for two human eating bitches.\u201d He said started to get mad again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, we were just playing. Fairies, Nekos, and most of those regionals are against human eating, such as me and Subeta.\" Kana said returning both to their normal sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScaring her out of her mind was just playing?\u201d he asked mocking them as he referred to navi<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just smiled before shrinking them down again and sealed their powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy realm, my powers over rules yours.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright you had your fun.\u201d Was heard behind the queens as another fado appeared and walked towards the other fado that just smiled and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat he said is true about this being my realm and I can seal your powers, but I already did.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the stage Dark Lord.\" Chasm said entering the realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m still helping my wife with controlling her powers, chasm.~ dark fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just the real calm fado.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe look towards kana and subeta before he snapped his fingers and his realm changed to look like a fairy forest surrounding a neko styled house, but they are outside drinking tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you want to meet me?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard about your amazing abilities from Chasm.\" Subeta continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thought you'd be an amazing warlord to each of our teams.\" They both said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about this and he still have to see about his father\u2019s surprise in the spirit temple. He unsealed their powers and he nodded to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see what you can do and I\u2019ll decide if you can handle it.\u201d Fado said finished drinking his tea before taking them back to the realm and chasm appeared with navi behind fado<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm, let your other daughters know that I\u2019m planning on going to the spirit temple after this and they can come if they want, but they have to be human sized.\u201d Fado said without taking his eyes off of kana and subeta<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let us go. 2 on 1, does that seem such a fair fight?\" Kana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubeta agreed as Chasm walked away with Navi to see his other daughters.</span></div></div>",

This will be good for a warm up.\u201d Fado said with a dark tone as his swords appeared on his back, but left them alone and got into a stance made for more than one opponent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kana darling, how about we make this battle a little tougher for the dear warrior here.\" Subeta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.\" Kana said, they grew to their full size then casted spells on Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrink Warrior.\" Subeta said, as a mystical light enveloped Fado, shrinking him to a centimeter tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic and Sword Block.\" Kana said. Another mystical light this time enveloped the outline of Fado and his swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made him almost as weak as a normal human weaker than because regular humans would be gigantic to him. But the queens appeared as if they were the size of 15 Hyrule Castles each. Kana and Subeta bent down to Fado, their leering eyes looming over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barrier of Magic Prevention.\" Subeta casted, making a square barrier appear around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're not in your realm, you can't really break our powers or anything.\" Kana boomed, which even in the barrier, he had to cover his ears. Subeta picked up the capsule, and looked at him intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this tough enough for you yet? Millions of feet tall goddess, double magic prevention you couldn't even break with brute strength, shrunken to less than a cenimeter tall, and having us just tower over you like that?\" Subeta boomed, even though she was whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at them before smiling as he sits in a meditative position concentrating his power and he started to laugh at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDistraction.\u201d He said before something pushed them to the ground and his body started to flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarrier breaker.\u201d He said as he broke through the first magic block with his fists<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPower Magic Breaker.\u201d He said as he broke through the second barrier with a single punch with his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to breathe hard from this, but he is still smiling feeling good and he returned to his normal size. He had a copy hidden with his invisible power ready to get them and it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that about not being able to break it?\u201d he said mocking them as the marks on his arm started to glow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barrier Reverse.\" Kana and Subeta said. All the barriers reappeared on Fado, this time 100% stronger and 1000% less breakable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only reason I have is that we are having the fight here is because I didn\u2019t think it was fair having power over you.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe broke the barriers again and he still smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarrier protection.\u201d He said as a twilight color outline around him appeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m protected from your spells.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barrier Break.\" Kana said, as a white line flew from her finger slicing Fado's barrier in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human Elimination Barrier.\" Subeta said, putting a barrier this time absolutely unbreakable, that latched Fado's arms and legs to walls of the barrier, and it began filling with lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado began to feel the lava eat away at his body. By the time the lava was halfway up his body eaten through everything except his leg bones, Subeta ceased the lava and restored his legs. She let him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defeated. Welcome to brigade warlord.\" Subeta said, cuddling him against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down. I\u2019m not done yet\u201d he said before they were pushed again and he got away and the red wolf appeared next to him their sized<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew to their size and did some martial arts moves making them feel pain before the wolf walked over to them and sit on subeta while he sit on kana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me enough time and I would have used my triforce power, but that is why I didn\u2019t use my swords.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t consider my sense of being fair for overconfidence.\u201d He said before getting up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou both are defeated.\u201d He said before shrinking back down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. It just means you\u2019re in my army now.\" Subeta rejoiced jumping on him smothering him in her naked Fairy breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe backed away from here by a few feet and the swords disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFairies have to use magic, but I sense that you, kana, are able to use swords as well.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, pure diamond blades. See?\" Kana said, withdrawing 2 swords, gleaming off the light. She set them down near Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, definitely something I want to test my steel against later.\u201d He said looking at the blades<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho made them?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Father, the Neko Blacksmith. He carefully crafted it in his Lava Room.\" Kana said stabbing the blades into the ground 5 feet away from Fado each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods as he was studying the blades and the hilt of the blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis work looks familiar.\u201d He said before making his original blade appeared in his hand before focusing on his blade<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Kana said taking the small blades from Fado<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the design carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes this is my father's work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his blade reappear in his hand before putting it back into its sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy blades were a gift from my father, but my mother was the one who have given them to me.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to think before remembering something and he pulled out his flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you are welcome to join me at the Spirit temple, but you both will have to be human sized.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'd would also like a chance to fight that father of yours.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather sit this one out; I have to get back to the kingdom, see you soon Fadi-poo.\" Subeta said, blowing Fado a kiss and a sexy wink before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m going ahead to the spirit temple, chasm.

The wolf charged at the fake fado and bite into the arm with the fire sword as fado used his fire sword strike on the arm with the ice blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShark bait.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" Guardian said behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only who can make copies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d fado said behind him mocking him as he was slicing up his back again before backing away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Guardian said appearing behind him and setting his shirt on fire with the fire sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire absorption.\u201d He said before the fire went into his body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, there maybe nothing I can do to you now. I concede.\" Guardian said, his two swords disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado smiled darkly before slamming him into wall and let out a deep growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not getting out of this that easily.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I'll give you your father if you release me. I am the only one who can break his cage.\" Guardian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to think about it before running up to the cage and slamming his right fist into the crystal before the triforce started to glow on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTriforce power breaker.\u201d He said before seeing it crack<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the crack just filled itself in and it encased itself in a light that blew Fado away. He ran up to it and punched it, but he heard his father say something to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Nitiro speaks the truth, only he can break it.~ Fado's Father said mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Nitiro. Break it, but we are not finished here.\u201d He said sheathing his swords and the copies vanished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I believe we are. My kind are only for guarding. once the one we're guarding is released, we die. I was delighted to have had this job.\" Nitiro said using a regular sword to slash the crystal to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fado's Father fell to the ground and awoke, everyone saw Nitiro begin to disentigrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am grateful for our unfinished match, Fado.\" Nitiro said, as the last of his body vanished into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out his flute and started to play his song. The effect of the song varies, but this time its bringing nitiro\u2019s back with his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNitiro, there is another term for guarding someone and it doesn\u2019t have to be mean encasing them in crystal.\u201d Fado said before walking to his father and helping him up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, for your father had said himself that when his son comes, and I break him free, my time as his guardian would be up, and I can leave peacefully. Goodbye.\" Nitiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I want you to guard me?\u201d he asked before hitting nitiro upside his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late. I'm gone.\" Nitiro said before disappearing completely so not even Fado's songs could bring him back</span></div></div>",

Is that the best you can say?\u201d he asked mocking him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll my life I thought if I even had a father. Not once during my childhood did I see you and I just heard about you from my mother that you died by that snake bitch after chasm\u2019s good friend menyassan ate her and saved mom from being killed by her.\u201d He said before striking another punch at him, but he missed and hit the wall not caring about what damage is done to his hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry son. I had to conceal my face as everyone in Hyrule Town saw my copy get eaten. So I retreated here.\" Fado's Father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom almost died trying to save your copy. A real fighter would have come back to the town after their copy would have been eaten.\u201d He said before landing another punch to his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sorry for anything.\u201d He said with pure hate, sorrow and a little regret before leaving the temple heading off somewhere<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son!\" Fado's Father said chasing after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Buuuuureakdown.\" Chasm and everyone else said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chasm, you and kana can fight him.

Fado's Father just slashed through the barrier with his swords and kept doing this. Eventually, he caught up to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst apologize to mom and then maybe I\u2019ll listen to you, dad.\u201d He said that last part is sarcasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado teleported to his realm and sealed it tight so he cut through it. Fado's Father did as his son said and walked to Hyrule City before climbing up the building their mansion was placed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever happened to our old brick house?\" Fado's Father yelled almost falling off the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hylia made this as a gift for us and I had copies moved everything from the old house to in here.~ fado explained before cutting off from his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark fado appeared at the temple to speak with the others about his light side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand what he is feeling, but I think only hylia, navi, and one of the three can talk to him at this point.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course, Navi, Hylia, can you both go calm Fado down? I'm gonna go find his father.\" Chasm said, leaving with Kana, Din, Nayru, and Farore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is at his house with fado\u2019s mother apologizing to her.\u201d Dark fado said before leaving through a portal to be with his wife<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Can I feel her fur?~ fado asked about kana in a hurt tone, but opened his realm to hylia, navi, and kana; but still not his father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have much fur, just my hair and tail.\" Kana said once she was in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi and Hylia just comforted Fado at their human sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realm has red sky, the water is angry, and the land was barren like a desert as fado was still crying even though he was slowly calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ~What I did to hylia was only a tenth of what I did my father, but he asked for it.~ he said in his mind, but they can hear it and he doesn\u2019t feel like talking with his mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed a cattail was around him with navi and hylia, but he started to pet it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I remember chasm talking to my father, but I didn\u2019t know he was still alive. It hurt to hear him was dead, but it hurt even worse that he went into hiding after being eating.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad told us of this and how he predicted you would react, but he didn't predict it like this though. He thought you would just punch your dad once, then move on; but we didn't expect it to happen that way. Not at all.\" Navi said, hugging Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Try living the life I had growing up and then you might understand why.~ he said crying into navi and hylia as they hugged him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Cats were my favorite kind of pet and I wanted one, but mom said that they were hard to care for.~ he said with a small smile at the memory still petting the tail<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here, as long as you keep it well fed and taken care of. Here\u2019s this baby one that was given birth to just a month ago.\" Kana said handing him a baby white fur cat that was sleeping gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Thanks, but I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if I can take it out of the realm yet and I need to be calm.~ he said handing it back to kana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe after we get out of here and back to the house.\u201d He said before looking at them with tears in his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water is calming down and the land is returning back to normal, but the sky is still red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still mad, I can sense it.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just calm down Fado. It\u2019s not cool to act like this.\" Hylia said splashing his face with cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this will help.\" Navi said giving Fado a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun blasted the red sky and clouds away as steam was coming out of his ears from the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Wow.~ he said before standing on the water<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. I\u2019m better.\u201d He said with a devious smile and a giant water cannon was formed behind him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, Young goddess, Navi.\" Kana said patting Navi on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get him!\" Hylia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi paired on Fado's side and it was just an all-out water fight for at least 2 hours. Fado is still standing, but he kissed navi on the lips, kissed hylia on the forehead, and kissed kana on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for helping me, but I will still feel hurt by my father and nothing will change that.\u201d He said before sitting down next to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what else he hid from me.\u201d He said referring about his father</span></div></div>",

He burned his hair dry making it short again and he put his shirt on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is something you can do with water inflation.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.

It also made her look much taller and older. She stood up to her full height, and Fado was only taller by her pinkie toe by an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, hylia.\u201d Fado said with a nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, shrink back to human size, but keep that form.\u201d Fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can.\" Hylia answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried shrinking down, but her power wouldn't work.

I'm sorry you and Fado never got to battle. \" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, oh, Fado, this is a sorry for never getting to battle.\" Menya said, kissing Fado on the cheek then flying to Hylia's throat and flying into her heart making it pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy???\" Hylia muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hylia, I'm here.\" Chasm said, hugging the giantess' cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado...I'm so..sorry.\" Hylia said, grabbing Fado, and kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled before nodding and patted her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts ok.\u201d He said before growing to her size and giving her a hug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted you to understand my reason.\u201d He said before shrinking back down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough din will have to do something else for our challenge.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cchasm, can she access menya\u2019s soul?\u201d he asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually Din has seven differing souls inside her, though I set them in awkward places. You can either choose to fight them all at once, or one at a time.\" Chasm said.</span></div></div>",

They changed the world to din\u2019s birthplace. He started to chant a spell with the song and the fire with lava started to form the body of menya as he triggered the power that dark fado stored in him. When the body was formed, he put the power and a small part of his soul into the body bringing her back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado? Did you save me?\" Menya asked, yawning like she had just woken up from a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He said with a smile before kissing her on the cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was for the kiss and now we can have our battle.\u201d He said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little peoples.\" Din said appearing in Giantess Form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I will see you all later. Good luck with your remaining challenges Fado.\" Chasm said disappearing into a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this fight will be inside me so don't be rough; just the first one to bleed in my stomach loses. Then, whenever the match is decided I'll either make myself throw up or poop.\" Din said gobbling the two up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I can just teleport myself out din.~ fado said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado turned to see menya with a devilish smile and started to crack his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u201d He said with a slight dark tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fell down Din's large throat and plopped in her stomach. It was a small, compressed area, and it had little bits of stomach acids popping in and out at some moments. They heard Din sigh in enjoyment and were a little wielded out by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she still eat humans?\" Fado asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I miss devouring unlucky humans who fall down her throat to get torn apart by me.\" Menya said with a groan from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let us begin.\" Fado said, reaching for his one sword, but he couldn't feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Fado yelled as he dived for his one sword, which was being absorbed through a small hole not even his hand could fit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't grab it before it slid down completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado, why did your sword just slowly slide out of my ass?\" Din asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It slipped from my back.\" Fado yelled up her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not legalized to give you another, nor can you summon one. So you'll have fight fist to fist with Menya.\" Din explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado agreed to this with an \"OK\" and then saw Menyassan had doubled in size, from her normal 6ft5, to 12ft10<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I wonder if she can read my mind.~ fado thought about menya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady when you are.\u201d He said taking a stance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try tiny.\" Menya said laying her foot over Fado trapping him on a stomach wall of Din.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenya then began to scrap off pieces of Fado's Clothing so she could begin devouring his body and soul. He smiled at her before knocking her hands away hitting the pressure points in her foot and leg, but he jumped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gave you a part of my soul so we can have this fight, menya.\u201d Fado said as the sword that got away from him was nayru\u2019s sword appeared on his back, but he is still using his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenya still began to grind her foot into Fado and decided to double in size once more, Din did have an especially big stomach even in Lava. She double to then 24ft10 with her foot now completely covering Fado making him gag on her foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe once again.\" Menya said deviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doubled in size again, this time to 48ft10. Fado was barely near the size of her toe, and still stuck under her demonish toe-claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fun Fado, well fun for me, because you're either under my toes drinking my foot sweat, or between my toes having your head knocked side to side by my toes.\" Menya said deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I fado?\u201d fado asked her with a smile before she felt something big shoved her off him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked to see what pushed her, it was the red wolf and it was covering the real fado since she was torturing a mirage fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, I am.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung her foot around, not only giving Fado a view of her naked forme, but also roundhouse kicking him. She gripped him with her toes claws, and threatened to grow to her full size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At that size I could crush a million fake Fado's.\" Menya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Bleed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a deep cut in an open section of his chest, but stuck her demon toe in so it wouldn't bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, wherever your teleport, I do too. With puny skills like these tiny, there's no way the Fairy Queen Subeta will ever accept you as one of her own.\" Menya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was on the merge of explosion. With Menya's gigantic cut through his chest, the only thing that was keeping it closed was her gargantuan toe. Fado tried to push it out, but he was nowhere near strong enough to lift a toe his own size out of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never teleport when I make a mirage.\u201d Fado said as another fado appeared, but he was her size and he did a star slash on her chest before ramming a giant fist into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped her heart and gave it a subtle squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust guess which one is the real fado.\u201d He said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenya took no surprise to this, and began reforming her chest, closing the space in between her breasts around this Fado's Hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, since you have your hand inside my chest, I guess I can do this to you.\" Menya said placing her foot on this one's crotch and using her drill toe ability to drill his privates off making that area explode with blood<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bluish blood, so this tip revealed this wasn't the real Fado but another mere puppet. Fado faded into din\u2019s stomach as his was healing itself before the fake fado kissed menya as he went up her baby maker. Something he got from chasm and he made millions of mirages to start rubbing her walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it you little brat.\" Menya said, panting heavily, she grabbed a grasswhistle from her back, and began playing what she likes to call the \"Melody of Doom.\", with it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe targeted every Fado, and it began compressing her pussy, crushing them all. Their blue blood streamed from her pussy, and she felt like she needed to orgasm, but had to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I shall play a little tune for whom would like to be a sex toy for me.\" Menya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now playing, the Melody of Reveal and Trapping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was forced away from where he was and was trapped in a Despair Barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, here's what you wanted Fado.\" Menya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck trying to escape, but I really shouldn't say that, cause you can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck the capsule of her now normal pussy, and was sucking it up and up using her body. Fado saw every inch of pink inside the clear capsule. Fado's Capsule was then sucked into her womb, and he saw as the wall closed, now rendering him unable to escape unless he were to be unbirthed, then rebirthed, or make Menya orgasm or cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just smiled before as another fado started to rub her walls again he made millions of more mirages, they keep making more mirages while rubbing her walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trap what is free.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his sword appeared outside of the barrier and it started to glow black as it started to multiply itself before stabbing her womb from the inside-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado tried this, but it didn't do anything, it only tickled Menya, as she had doubled her size three more times, to where she was over 300ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this will put you in your place.\" Menya said, as lava fell down Din's Throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenya picked some up and shoved it up her pussy burning every Fado alive and every sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know your place bug. It's to be defeated by me.\" Menya said, controlling her umbilical cord to grab Fado's Capsule which was still intact from the lava and dragged him near where he would suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if I'd ever do that.\" Menya said, making herself cum, washing out Fado's Capsule, and he saw how big she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenya picked the capsule up, and licked the cum off it, and then opened the capsule, letting Fado out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you letting me out?\" Fado asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm defeated. If the next question is why, I may be an adult succubus; but I still have my periods every once and a while.\" Menya said as she pointed down to her pussy, which was dripping her greenish blood.</span></div></div>",

Oh no no no. My challenge is much more cival than fighting. But before I tell you, may I be granted a foot rub, my sore feet have been pacing around this coliseum for ages waiting for you deary.\" Nayru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado looked her with a raised eyebrow and walked towards her feet not letting his guard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNayru did nothing but a smile, and moved her feet nearer to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I'm asking is a little rubbing around my heels.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado stopped when she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I know it\u2019s not a trap?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please dear, when I changed into the new me, I also changed my ways of scheming and trickery. I'm now pure as the purest waters of the sea.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado still didn\u2019t move not trusting her so he made some mirages to rub her heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that feels delightful, thank you Fado clones. Maybe when we're done here, before you move on, a back rub would be in order.\" Nayru sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado still doesn\u2019t trust her, but he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you give me a massage in return.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her foot rub was finished, she snapped her fingers and instantly made those Fados close and compress into a small box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I keep these Fado as tiny massagers? They did a wonderful job.\" Nayru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the challenge?\u201d he asked before snapping his fingers and her throne changed into a bed as those fados appeared on her back and started rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was just going to have you do a barrage of fights against random attributed creatures I can conjure up, but I'm thinking for all this delightful service I'll just let you off free.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled before making the fados stop the rub for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it and if I win, you give me a full body massage before I leave.\u201d He said as the fados got back to rubbing her back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I can conjer up 3 differing sets creatures, because I'm nice, I'll let you choose what your first opponnet is.\" Nayru said, bringing a screen down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can summon a Lv. 1 Water Snakette; a Lv. 1 Cypress Mini and Giantess, or a Lv. 1 Lava Demoness.\" Nayru suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or do you want me to raise to Lv. 2? Because I can go to up to a Lv. 6 Monster if I so please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado started to crack and pop his joints with a smile as he took a stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you summon first because I\u2019m going to get that massage from you.\u201d He said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just choose or level up deary, because you will have to fight a terrible creature at Lv. 6. But as I allow, you can only grow 1 Lv. per time, then you must absolutely choose a creature to fight.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, water snake.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lv. 1 Water Snakette.\" Nayru said. \"Alright, here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Colosseum moved around, and was now mainly water, leaving stone platforms for Fado to jump across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, because I'm nice, I'll give you this one tip, NEVER leave your back unguarded.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado shook his head yes, and then he saw 2 Water Snake Women morph into view on the other side of the battle field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's our morsel Lady Nayru?\" The Water Women asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just a human, so go light on him.\" Nayru whispered to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Human, even tastier than a beginner god.\" the 1st Water Women said, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado, even from a 300ft distance, could see the Water Women begin to morph into their Water Snakette form. He took out his flute and he smiled before started to play something to grind on their ears as he started to dance across the platforms, but he is watching his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does this sound to you?\u201d he asked before jumping on the water and it started to make it move like a snake as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado then realized they didn't have any ears!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I thought I could win by just that.\" Fado said, letting the guard on his back down for just a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad choice morsel.\" said one of the snakettes, when she formed behind him, and latched onto his arm, with an iron grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began injecting her venom into Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this, she freely let go, and was quickly stabbed into oblivion by Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My part is finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado decoded as her last words. He knew where the other had to be, thanks to a quick mind journey, Fado found out that snakettes can regain or power themselves up when circling under water. He looked around under water, but found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splash Splash Little Morsel.\" the remaining Snakette yelled, appearing behind Fado, and chomping his upper half to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. A Fake.\" She screeched when blue instead of red blood poured from Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was actually on the snakette's back, and was planning to find a way inside to strike this one's Amoeba Heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should sink back and continue looking.\" She said. She sunk back into the water, and Fado had no choice but to let go, and search by swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made fifty mirages and sent them after the snake before teleporting back onto the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here you pair of snake skin boots.\u201d He said taunted her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then as Fado turned around, he was swallowed whole by the snakette. He slipped down her clear throat with a squish and landed in her belly with a plop. He realized his swords were gone again so he took out the last resort he thought he'd never have to use a bow and arrow, though he only had one arrow. He had to make it count wherever he decided to shoot it. He closed his eyes and he focused on the sound of the snake heart beating and let the arrow fly in that direction, but he wasn't too sound with it, so he missed the Snake Heart by 1 measly inch, then he realized his feet were continuing to sink down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just not my battle.\" Fado said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his upper body began to be concealed, something dropped down, it was one of his swords, he reached for it, and tossed it straight at the snake heart. It blew up, and all around Fado began to vanish. The snake disintegrated leaving Fado in warm, watery blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice Job Fado, now you either have a choice of raising to Lv. 2, or taking the bonus package, and seeing a preview fight of the Lv. 6 Creatures.\" Nayru said.</span></div></div>",

Finally there is Konoko; whom may look like a little girl, but is a sweaty death trap, she may capture her prey and try to have sex with it, but is deadly, her area is said to masturbate upon seeing a human, her mouth drools a lot, and her ass is heavy.\" Nayru explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I see them for a moment before I choose?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly no, I cannot allow you advantages like that.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsahi.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now are you sure, since you've never face Neko kind before, wouldn't you want to go a bit easier with Konoko, or Keni? Because Isahi also mesmerizes her enemies with her voluptuous boobs, which are fully developed, meaning she's an adult, which they are skilled.\" Nayru warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to think, but he looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of them with crush me while the other one will try to have sex with me and you\u2019re saying their easier than her.\u201d He said not believing her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Point, but Isahi will also kill you, after defeat, she straps her victims down, either preparing to eat them and grind them to pieces with her molars, or crush them slowly underneath her sandal.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither way two out of three I\u2019m going to get eaten or crushed.\u201d He said sighing before regaining his smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m staying with her.\u201d He said ready for the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let me call and summon her. But I won't do that until you put the Fado clones back up my ass.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his fingers and she felt the clones appear in her ass, but even more clones appeared in her ass filling it up to the brim. Nayru screamed and her pussy exploded, filling all the water in the lower stadium with a layer of masturbation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI put them back and then some.\u201d He said with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son of a bitch! I LOVE THIS!\" Nayru screamed, echoing in the stadium, before she exploded with even more sticky cum, this time covering Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe teleported before he was covered and made them vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fight, Nayru.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this!\" Nayru screamed, grabbing the real Fado, and forcefully shoving him up her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I'm sorry Fado, I can't control myself after cumming.~ Nayru thought to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled before making more fados appear filling her up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I wonder how would this feel.~ he said to still smirking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNayru screamed louder and louder with each Fado filling her up. She ended off panting, her pussy and ass filled with Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. STOP!!!!!\" Nayru screamed, fountains of cum streaming from her pussy and nipples. These rounds of cum washed every Fado out, and only left the ones in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET BACK TO FUCKING ME! I NEED PLEASURE!\" Nayru said, shoving every last Fado back in and panting even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I need to stop this.\" Nayru heavily panted. Nayru fell out of her seat, and began drinking all the water of the stadium, not caring if it was layered with her own cum or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his fingers again, but she is on her bed on her back mouth open as the water started to flow to her mouth and down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually sat up and grabbed Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is revenge asshole. You know why I want to drink so much water?\" Nayru asked. She tossed Fado in a jar angrily, covered the top with her vagina, and began Fado's warm golden shower, made of her piss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado tried escaping, but the piss was dampening his powers, making him unable to escape. The jar was soon full with Nayru's golden piss. Fado was barely swimming in the jar and it was still warm, which disgusted him; but Nayru just set a holed top of the jar, than set it in her personal toilet, and continued to piss straightly throughout one of the holes, dampening Fado's powers until he just couldn't use them, and his swords and somehow disintegrated in the piss. He could no longer make copies, teleport, or try to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to escape, drink all of it.\" Nayru said, when she finished pissing, changing the holed top with a non-holed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled concentrating his strength before breaking the jar with sheer power of his body and he vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you under control now, nayru?\u201d fado asked as he appeared on her shoulder wet from the water in the coliseum</span></div></div>",

I was in the water after my fight with the snakes meditating and trying to get you off your sex drive.\u201d He said before making his body heat up enough to dry his clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Fado, I must thank you for that.\" Nayru said, kissing him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Nayru, where is this pipsqueak you want me to crush in battle.\" Isahi said, stomping into view. Fado was amazed by her height, as he was no bigger than an inch to her sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was even bigger than Nayru, whom even at her full height, only reached to Isahi's ankles. Isahi had to get down on her knees, destroying half of the colosseum seats with just her feet. She looked at Fado, whom was no more a speck to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This fool is my rival for battle? How miserable Nayru.\" Isahi said, focusing her eye on Fado, whom was intimidated by her size a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsahi stood back to her full height, and broke the entire colosseum ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could crush this miserable human with just a flick of my cat tail.\" Isahi said, brushing her long grey hair out of her face with her long grey-colored cat tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he is no more than a speck to me, I demand he is allowed 2 swords, and an aerial assist partner.\" Isahi said to Nayru, who instantly gave Fado another of his three swords, and a Loftwing who would fly him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I might as well use one of these.\" Isahi said, pulling a sword from a sheathe on her back. She stabbed it into the ground near Fado, who shivered from the coldness of the diamond blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe my cat treat would like to see a demo of my swords' power?\" Isahi purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado smiled before snapping his fingers and he grew to her size with some help of her shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not your cat treat, cat.\u201d He said before flicking her on the nose and returning to his normal size with his swords ready for a fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you couldn\u2019t get me to massage your feet even if I were lose to you.\u201d He said to her smile and summoned multiple mirages to hide himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if you little rat. I will crush and smush your copies under my foot, not have a mere bug rub my godly feet.\" Isahi hissed, using her cat senses, to pick out the real Fado with her cat tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought him to her face, and used her long cat tongue to cover Fado in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, you seem to have a precious taste to you maybe once I'm finished with you, I'll keep you as my suck toy. Feel blessed I won't just grind you under my sole.\" Isahi purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set Fado down, and removed her sandals using just her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should take a smell of the beauty that will crush and mangle your body.\" Isahi said, shoving her sweaty feet right in his face not could she even feel the poke that Fado's face did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did took a smell of her foot and almost gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call that beauty?\u201d he said mocking her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have seen girls with more beauty than you ever will.\u201d He said as he made a tsunami at her size and hit her with it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for you to get a bath.\u201d He said before jumping on the loft wing and take flight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please bug.\" Isahi said, gripping the Loft wings' feet, and ripping it's feet and legs clean off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn her.\" Fado mumbled, trying to calm down the loft-wing from the tragic event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you suffer.\" Isahi hissed, slashing a sword at Fado, cutting one of the loft-wing's wings off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, sorry bud.\" Fado said, jumping onto Isahi's opened hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish choice bug.\" Isahi said, as she rapidly closed her hand, and either way, Fado would be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled before her hand closed and he appeared on her head near the ears and he pulled out his flute. He played a single loud note right into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope that will make you learn to not underestimate me.\u201d Fado said before jumping off and started to play a song to make the water catch him for he slides into the water<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dived into the water before swimming to the bottom and started to meditate his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado, you just wasted your energy.\" Nayru called out to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isahi's half deaf! She only had her deaf ear open for attacking, the other is blocked by an unbreakable barrier, but she can still he-\" she tried to finish, but was knocked straight into the wall by Isahi's big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defy me Nayru, and I won't hesitate to call in my sisters to crush you.\" Isahi hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Your fight is with me.~ fado said in her mind before a fado at her size emerged from the water<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink you can handle this?\u201d he said mocking her before punching her in the face with a hard right fist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou leave nayru out of this.\u201d He said before casting a barrier to protect her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fado in the water meditating made millions of water mirages before sending them to give her some pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNayru just blocked them away, she didn't need another sex-drive attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can enhance myself with these little guys.\" Nayru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright all you copies, I need you to help me with something.\" Nayru said, pushing them all down onto her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to eat you guys, I want to see if it can inhance my growth capabilities. Isahi is dangerous, she could kill Fado, look!\" Nayru explained pointing all the Fado to see the real one getting his ass kicked by Isahi, who was now pulling his arm beyond its limits with her foot on his back, keeping him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Nayru, the giant one is a water mirage I\u2019m still in the water normal sized.~ fado said only in her mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019ll try to give her some pleasure like I did you to buy you time.~ he added before even more mirages appeared and ram up isahi\u2019s ass and more appeared in her baby maker rubbing the walls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes the cat want some pleasure before killing me?\u201d the giant fado asked smiling before his arm turned to water making her let go and it reformed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, worms like them don't deserve to be inside me like that.\" Isahi said, and all the copies instantly vanished, as if they had been killed but there was no trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Fado! Let me out of here! I need to help! Isahi will kill you if she finds you!~ Nayru banged on the barrier. Isahi then picked Nayru's Barrier up, and held it in front of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the real form of my bug rival, worm!\" Isahi said, crushing the barrier slowly between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, or should I swallow you like the cat treat you are to me?\" Isahi boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't say, I must protect him from you!\" Nayru yelled out, getting tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if I must young Nayru. You should've just told me, you should know by now that I will go to any extreme to defeat my rival.\" Isahi said, tossing the crushing barrier in her mouth, swallowing it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNayru fell in Isahi's stomach, and even though the barrier was normally invincible, it's durability was cracked by Isahi's fingers, so stomach acids were seeping in, soon meaning she would die in this prison if Fado doesn't get her to pee or shit, which Isahi, apart from a normal Neko, never does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet her go and I will appear in your hand.\u201d The giant fado said as he become a wave of water and flowed into her baby maker<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water flowed into her stomach fixing the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019ll let you out after she lets you go.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let her out bug, and all that water is doing is tickling me.\" Isahi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado appeared and his marks are glowing as the red wolf appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will let her go.\u201d He said pissed off before growing to her size and started to hammer on her body with rage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if.\" Isahi said, drawing her sword, and slicing open Fado's right arm in the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado fell to the ground, and began to bleed heavily. Isahi kicked him down with her bare foot. She then stood over him, and began to pound his face repeatedly with her bare foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the foot you love so much worm, now smell it. Smell as I smash you're skull in and mutilate you.\" Isahi said, putting more weight on the foot each time stomping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this.\" Isahi said, putting her sandals on, and repeatedly jumping on Fado face with both legs like a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Die Worm, you may be worthy to be my slave, but your my rival in battle, so die!\" Isahi said, jumping one last time, landing on Fado's face full force, knocking him out, also making an indent on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf growls before attacking her and he smile before a black portal opened with a figure stepping through it.</span></div></div>",

I had some copies do that for her since I didn\u2019t trust her and it feel like a trap. This was to be my challenge, but she loved the foot rub so let me off and decided to have my copies massage her body. Her hormones started to act up from the internal massage they were doing and I had to make them vanish so I could have my fight with kana. Well, that almost worked and I was in the water from the first fight against the snakes as a copy was putting her hormones into over drive by summoning copies in baby maker and ass.

Please. I beg of you. I'll do whatever you say, just become my king, and we can bring peace to this naughty world.

Your future is me, Kokosuno. Please, trust me and we can rule Hyrule together. Please, you\u2019re the most handsome man I've seen just become my king. I do not wish no for an answer. I won't release my molten lip lock until a fair answer is chosen.~ Kokosuno thought, covering their locked lips in molten rock, no escape permitting until a fair answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~No is what you\u2019re going to get.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m sure you can find someone else.

If you won't marry me, at least pleasure me once. I beg of you, this time, I won't take no as an answer.\" Kokosuno said making fire appear around their mouths hypnotizing Fado in a trance not only could he not break out of, but one that forced his body to do functions against his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me hubby.\" Kokosuno said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado wanted to say no, but the mind crack forced his body to say yes. Nayru and Chasm just sat there, watching this all go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We probably should stop them soon.

If you want, I can banish her and increase you to lv. 3.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I know her weakness now.\u201d Fado said before making the waters teleport into her baby maker and they started rubbing her walls while more appear in there<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said she's love hungry, not sex hungry, actually demons don't know what sex is, they rape, and solely rape.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, damn. Well best go on offensive.\" Fado said charging at her with his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powers of Sun...activate.\" Kokosuno said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trapped Fado in a box, and he was standing on one sole piece of stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you agree to be my king, there's no possible way out of there without lighting yourself on fire.\" Kokosuno said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado, there is a way, try using this.\" Chasm said, tossing Fado a staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Fado asked, catching the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you set fire over fire, the new fire will eventually burn the other out. I've done it before. Say it's fighting fire with fire...only in this situation, literally.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRing of fire.\u201d He said as a ring of fire appeared around him burning out the other ring of fire and he stepped out of the box before making water whips attack her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWater cannon blitz.\u201d He said before a giant cannon made of water appeared behind him and it took aim at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire.\u201d He said and a big ball of water slammed into the demoness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little cherrybomb, how could you kill the women who'd be your queen?\" Kokosuno said, passing into death, as the ring of fire on her back, if extinguished, she had mere seconds to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you did quite the number on her, we'd best hand her body over to Gaia, she could make a wonderful daughter. Maybe one that's not exactly the demon she was.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado walked over to her and kissed her on the lips to return her kiss that she gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay you awaken in a new life and may we meet again.\u201d He said before handing her body to chasm</span></div></div>",

He felt Kana had began walking and began to tumble around; yet it wasn't enough to actually escape, but only tickling Kana more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe.\" Kana giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really gotta get home soon, but it's so far, it's at least 50 human miles from here. So about a 25 mile walk nothing apart from most days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Kana.~ fado said in her mind floating in her bellybutton as she is walking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKana had been to occupied on getting home to see what was causing this tickle and hadn't actually heard Fado. She began to pick up speed outside the Colosseum and eventually was jogging making Fado go out of his float stage and begin bouncing around again unable to say mental or physical words. He jumped using his feet before jamming himself deep in her bellybutton trying to stop bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chasm, I\u2019ll be back with kana after she finds me. Don\u2019t worry about me.~ he said/thought to chasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Where are you?~ Chasm tried to ask, but Kana's mind waves blocked it off as Fado began bouncing in Kana's belly button again due to her jumpy feeling in her jogging soon becoming full on dashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado used some of mind power to negate kana mind waves for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m in her bellybutton.~ he said floating again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I'm sorry, I can't connect with her mind, she's set on getting you out, so I just suggest you wait it out until she returns to her Neko Kingdom.~ Chasm thought to Fado, barely able to make it through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Well, I know what a pinball feels like.~ fado said trying to stop bouncing while floating<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what's making me laugh so much, maybe I'll take a bath, and if whatever is inside of me, I'll just crush it in between my feet or something.\" Kana said to herself, still giggling from Fado being bounced around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I have to get her to get me out of here.~ he said thinking of a plan before he started to jump around till he got a grip on her shirt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~KANA!~ fado yelled into her mind as loud as he could<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKana was still too focused and that was on getting the bug out; either crushing it or drowning it when she takes her bath. She giggled at the thought of the bug either becoming a dirty bloody spot between the balls of her feet or watching it drown and be sucked down into the drain only to be eaten by a fish or something. Kana had finally arrived at the kingdom when she was bowed to and was led back to her room in the Neko Kingdom. She undressed still not knowing Fado was in her bellybutton stuck to the back of her navel by her sweat and hunched over the bathtub and began filling it with warm water. She dipped her toe in and it was the perfect temperature to keep the Neko Queen's skin silky smooth. She dipped her whole body in and began cleaning herself. Little did she know Fado had swam out of her bellybutton, but by bad luck he had gotten stuck to the soapy suds on the brush she was using and was being used to clean everywhere on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Damn. I know I won\u2019t be mad at her.~ fado said to himself before concentrating his power</span></div></div>",

Let's just finish our bath and then I'll help you find a place in my room to sleep.\" Kana explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made the orb nod for him before he was done cleaning and he was steam cleaning his clothes after appearing in his boxers on the edge of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAright, but if you have to eat me I rather have it be a mirage than me.\u201d He said watching the orb clean his clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's where the fun is if it's a mirage of you then you have to switch your mind with its mind and watch for the entire thing then end off with the body being digested in my stomach.\" Kana explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if it's really you when it's the stomach you'll just have to stay in there for a while I wouldn't let my acids digest you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwitching bodies is easy, but the hard thing is that I have to watch my real body.\u201d Fado said before using one of his powers and made his real body faint on the edge of the tub before a copy appeared next to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I got that covered.\" Kana said, using her cattail to envelop the actual body of Fado hiding it into her long flowing gray hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his clothes are done being steam cleaned and he put them on his real body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I have to get punished if I got here by a mistake and I was trying to get your attention so you could have gotten me out?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to punish people sometimes.

She picked out some day clothes, and slipped them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we go for a walk, my little boob stowaway?\" Kana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe teleported so he was deep in between them and he can hear her heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m going to try and stay hidden here and maybe get a nap.~ he said in her mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Do what you want, but wake me up so we can deal with my punishment before going back to chasm and nayru.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~If you need me, poke my mind and I\u2019ll wake up.~ he added before getting settled in and slowly going to sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay my booby stowaway.\" Kana said bouncing her boobs once more, and opening her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Kana.\" a Neko Soldier said, running up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Soldier?\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little sister, Princess Krokiko, she's escaped the kingdom to find distant Human Refugees and crush them.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I don't want to do this, but this the 5th time this month she tried to do that.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the Black Soldier, and assign her the mission of crushing my sisters' skull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you're highness.\" He answered, running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado woke up to this and he was growling in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Kana, go to your sister now.~ he said and he was feeling a little mad right now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I want to see her.~ he said trying to calm down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't do that in less than an hour my sisters' skull will be crushed by the Black Night.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~It\u2019s a good thing that I know something.~ he said before three red wolves appeared and two of them made her get on the one that her size<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had enough power to teleport them to kana\u2019s sister and he grew to her size before landing an uppercut on her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop the black soldier, kana. I have a plan for this one.\u201d Fado said making more wolves appear behind him sounding deadly serious and a red aura appeared around him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take this as my punishment.\u201d He said before walking up to krokiko who was recovering from the cheap shot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to crush something, then crush me.\u201d He said to her as his fists clenched and the sound muscles rippling was heard from his body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, she's arrived.\" Kana said welcoming the Black Soldier who knocked Koriko down and layed on her where the black soldier's butt was right on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now deary, I'll make this easy.\" The Black armored soldier said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her legs around the Princess' head, and began squeezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Damn little girl, you have a resistant skull. NOW CRUSH!\" The Soldier said, breaking her skull into pieces, using merely her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood spread over the Soldiers' Legs and she grabbed the body to use for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the victim Kana, I'll put her to good use.\" She said, before leaving with the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier was shoved onto the ground by fado and the wolves as he caught the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike hell you will.\u201d He said sounding sort of beastly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used some of his power and fixed the skull of the princess before sending a very small part of his soul into the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKana, I\u2019ll give you one guess on why I\u2019m doing this.\u201d He said before a pack of wolves appeared around him protecting him and the princess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I guess I left my mind closed to you.\u201d He said before setting the princess down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have sisters since I was an only child and I never saw my father except now I saw his spirit from time to time, but you still have a chance to change her or let me do it instead sending the black death bitch over there to kill her.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s like to have siblings and I don\u2019t care about that, but you really care for your sister you won\u2019t give up on her and still keep trying to change her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to the princess and she is sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up!\u201d fado yelled he hit the princess on the forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow. What just hit me?\" the Princess said, waking up, to find the bump on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did.\u201d Fado said eyeing the black soldier<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the wolves licked the bump and it went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, you have two choices; one is to stop crushing humans and stay with the queen or two keep doing that and me or the black soldier will stop you.\u201d Fado explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m nicer than her.\u201d He added before teleporting to kana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKana, you are the queen, but you are also a sister and you have to be a sister before a queen sometimes.\u201d He said before kissing her on the cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the black soldier and picked her up before shoving her up against a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t kill you, but how would you feel I used your body?\u201d he asked as he was strangely calm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're an incompetent human, and for whatever use, my body will not be permitted as a soul slave.\" The Black Soldier said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado smiled before all of the red aura flowed in the arm with the marks and he smashed his fist into her black helmet making a dent in it, but he knows he didn\u2019t touch her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me what you will, but you know nothing about being a part of a family or even having one.\u201d He said before the wolf pack faded till one was left and it walked over to kana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy strength is fading, kana. I\u2019ll accept whatever punishment you give me, but it will have to wait till I can endure it.\u201d He said before walking away from the black soldier and teleported back to his sleeping spot after shrinking back down to normal size<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Save killing for a last resort or if you don\u2019t have a choice, but I do wish you keep trying, kana.~ he said to her, but his mind is still open<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So as punishable manner, this is your punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used secret powers no one knew she had, to shrink the soldier down to human size, making her bare nude half the way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My queen, please don-IEEEEEEEE!\" the Soldier screamed as Kana slowly lowered her sandal on the soldier's body, but then taking it off acting like she was playing but she wasn't<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her sandal, and crushed the arms and legs of the soldier into the grass. She then picked up the remaining bleeding, torso and head, and slurped them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The life of a Neko Queen, having to punish lives of those who've done wrong.\" Kana said with a light burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was thinking of something and he rubbed the walls that were surrounding him in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Kana, we both know that she was following your orders and it was a mistake; but maybe you could have lighten her punishment a little instead of killing her?\u201d he asked before rubbing his back against her chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Grrr, why is my back so itchy?~ he asked trying to scratch it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could have gone lighter, but I'm a violent person sometimes, if I only kill partially, like leaving her shrunken and limbless, I only would've been depressed that I didn't finish the job.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're back is itchy because your laying on my cat tail, which this is how I always sleep, it's weird I know, tail between the breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~If you move your tail, I can use it as a blanket.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe I should bring her back and you can scold her.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Kana said moving her tail in front of Fado who was now very warm and cozy, but rejecting the offer to bring her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed her breasts and her tail before hugging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Can you tell me about your family?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Actually, I don't have much family except my sisters. My parents are dead, which is why I'm the queen and not my mother.~ Kana thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I think I\u2019ll go take a cat nap before I put any more strain on my body.~ he said before slowly going back to sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minute he closed his eyes, he passed out and feel into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Catnap. Funny Fado.~ Kana said tickling his body with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Please, let me sleep. I\u2019m nearly exhausted from bringing your sister back to life and I don\u2019t think I could do it again if I tried.~ he said as he was batting at it trying to make it stop<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hmm, what do you think of me?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKana hadn't heard that as she was obeying Fado's wish of leaving him along leaving her cat tail on his body. Kana smiled at Fado one last time, and drifted off to sleep. Somehow, he was in his realm; but it looked like kana\u2019s bedroom and she got in the realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, how did this happen?\u201d he asked looking around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I thought your realm was modeled off your world, not my bedroom.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, it was to be a green field like the last time I was here and I can change it to something else.\u201d He said before changing it to the original green field clearing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is deep within my mind so maybe it was related to me sleeping in your bedroom.\u201d He added before making kana his size<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I have power over everything and everyone in here.\u201d He said before making kana grow back to her original height<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's quite interesting, so in a sense, whoever comes here is your mind-slave?\" Kana joked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was here a few times for different reasons and there must be one here.\u201d He said sitting on the stump before the field changed back to the bedroom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, is there anything special in your mental presentation of my room?\" Kana asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it has to deal with my punishment or something else.\u201d He said thinking about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it'd have to be in my littlest sisters' room. I've decided that's where it'll take place and it's with her; not me.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'm gonna let her decide, but just so you know; she loves tiny things exploring her \"massive body lands\" as she calls them.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will stop her if she takes it too far, right?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, she's barely 7 years old, how much harm could she cause.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus I may be out, ordering food and supplies for my kingdom to live and continue to flourish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry calming down hylia down when she is mad.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's 15.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but if she takes it too far I\u2019m going fight back.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if her room is all magic block. It's the point of punishment, endure it. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Because of that I'll be taking every possible weapon you have away.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiddle me this: how are you going to explain it to chasm when you see my body lying on the floor as a blood stain.\u201d He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. If my sister can't even hurt a butterfly, then she couldn't hurt something denser than a butterfly.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time I get stuck in your bellybutton, I\u2019m going to trip you first then yelled your mind so this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Fado said with stomping his foot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked to her before shrinking her down to his size and he kissed her on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is for the massage and letting me sleep close to you.\u201d He said before flicking her forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that was for the punishment and getting me stuck in your bellybutton.\u201d He said giving her a kind smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you can be a cat in here since we are both dreaming.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really want to be a full cat, but your welcome for the things I let you do.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned her to her normal size before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt just sucks being an only child.\u201d He said before leaning against the stump<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you need to, rely on me as a sister-figure for you.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but queen Zelda fits that spot.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed again before turning to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it won\u2019t hurt to have another big sister.\u201d He said with a joking smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shut it.\" Kana said, wrapping her cattail around him, bringing him to her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know where to start for you to be my sister.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should keep trying to make you laugh.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always do Fado, and most technically if you act like my little brother, that would mean you'd become a prince.\" Kana said</span></div></div>",

He silently climbed up to the ceiling and hide in the corner. Kana finished counting to ten, and looked everywhere, under her bed (Didn't see the fake), then the dresser (found the fake, crushed), then in the bathroom (didn't see the fake, accidental crush), and finally looked in her dirty clothes pile, as that's where most of her tiny friends hide when she's playing cat and mouse with them. Fado scoffed at that, but kept his balance, but have great hearing, Kana heard that, and trapped him in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caught you.\" Kana said, as she ran a scan test to see if it was really Fado, which it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't put up any of a chase.

Besides you are not going to find those places.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Kana said smiling, and grabbing more fruits, including tomatoes and apricots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I wonder if you are a good cook.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to make dinner for my sisters' every night. We maybe royalty, but we lack a good chef. So I'm the queen and chef in one. Haha.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Have you found the places?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My copies are still searching.\" Kana said, taking the final bite of the apple she was nomming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You\u2019re not going to find them.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it doesn't really matter. If this doesn't turn out to be the real you, I'll just have the really real Fado come out and maybe I'll have you as a side-snack or something.\" Kana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You have forgotten that I\u2019m in a fake body as my real body is still hidden.~ he said reminding her of what happened last night<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Sometimes I think my real body has a mind of its own when I\u2019m not in it.~ he said with a bit of intrigue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe that was how your bedroom was modeled in my realm.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly.\" Kana said paying for the items she bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~When you get back to the room, check where you put my body and see if it\u2019s still there. I have a feeling that you won half of the game.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado,\" Kana said coughing him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you even remember?\" as she undid a braid in her hair, revealing Fado's real body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t forget that, but.\u201d He paused before putting a hand on his body\u2019s forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice fake real body.\u201d He said referring to his real body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was right about that theory.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKana, the two places you haven\u2019t checked yet are not in the castle or in the room.\u201d He said before fading out and return to his real body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~But it will have to wait till you get home and make that fruit salad for me.~ he said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado, that fruit salad will be a leaving present, so that is what will wait. But here.\" Kana said, dropping Fado into the fruit basket she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~No, it\u2019s the unfinished game that will have to wait~ he said before eating the fruit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fruit Salad.\" Kana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Check between in your chest and your feet. Those are the two places you haven\u2019t checked yet.~ he said not caring about his body at the moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't care anymore. Now, let us go forth to my sisters' room for your punishment. Swords and Magic Power are restricted of course.\" Kana said taking all away from Fado making him no more than a normal human<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Alright.

You have him for 3 hours go on ahead. I'm gonna go make dinner for everyone.\" Kana said leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m stronger than she thinks.~ he said to himself about kana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, what is my punishment?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take a bath first, I'd need to be all washed up and chipper so I can dish out as much punishment as possible.\" Kimika laughed cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Fado to the bathroom, she sat him on the bathtub edge and stripped him nude, then herself nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, jump in!\" Kimika said, gesturing Fado to jump in once fully concealed with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we play a little game? I like to call it Sharks and Minnows. I can be the Shark and you'd be my little treat. Then up until we get out and back to the regular punishment you can be my suck toy.\" Kimika said cutely laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can get me, sharky.\u201d He said daring her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dived into the water, but he is still able to breathe underwater started to swim around her. She dived underwater making a huge splash up above and began searching around her flat chest swiveling making bubbles float up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sharky's gonna get her snacky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuck her chest as if it was the one talking and not her. He is swimming above her before touching her fur and swimming away. Kimika then swivled up and caught Fado in her mouth. He wriggled and struggled to get free, but couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I got my suck toy.\" Kimika said smiling gently lowering her teeth onto Fado's body then sucking him in till only his head was sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then used her teeth to massage Fado's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis feels weird.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's supposed to.\" Kimika said as she continued sucking also beginning to wash her body with a sponge and shampoo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I wash up after you\u2019re done?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the punishment, I decided you're gonna do the whole thing nude.\" Kimika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be a kid, but I know many of adult things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Next time I get stuck in her bellybutton, I\u2019m going to trip her.~ he said about his plan for kana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the punishment?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't tell you yet.\" Kimika said laying back in the water until the back of Fado's head was touching the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I just need a proper snap so I use my invisible power and I can use it on my boxers.~ he thought to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked before he started to whistle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should do this until I finish my bath.\" Kimika said using her finger to pop Fado's head in between her pink lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you do me a favor, and just squirm a little underneath my tongue?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it. Do you really need a reason to pleasure pretty girls like me?\" Kimika said, giggling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Kana is pretty, you, I don\u2019t know.~ he thought to himself before he started to squirm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe. I just may ask Kana if I can keep you. You\u2019re a good squirm toy, but now's for your punishment.\" Kimika said slipping him out of her mouth and drying him off using her now dried kiddie vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on her bed, but they were both still nude as Kimika grabbed some tape and taped Fado to her wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Great I\u2019m going to be step on.~ he thought, but he knows he can still use his body\u2019s power<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says?\" Kimika said sitting on Fado landing him right between her butt-cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored her before trying to think of a way to get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d he asked mocking her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Kimika said letting a small fart out on Fado's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can\u2019t smell the gas and he tries getting a snap going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the best you can do.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this will teach you.\" Kimika said stood up and placed her foot on Fado's body knocking his head between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to smile before chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared or afraid.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Kimika said pressing down on her foot and moving one of her toes onto Fado's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the chance and bite the toe that was on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe may have bitten it, but it didn't even mark the toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Kimika said pressing down even further making Fado believe he was gonna be squished under her sweaty foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy tapping his feet together, he got his flute in his hand because of the tapping his feet and he tried moving his hands to get the flute to his mouth to play a song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot working, sweetheart.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began stomping, and stomping, until Fado's entire body smelled like her foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I have another two hours.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked Fado up, and washed and dryed his body. She kissed him, then licked him violently. She then sucked Fado in her mouth, and swallowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun going through my digestive system try to make it out alive.\" She said patting her nude stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimika then snuck out of her room to head to Kana's real quick and grab something she grabbed what she wanted to grab: Kana's least favorite motor dildo. She turned it on and began massaging her child pussy with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn the acid to something I can stand on.\u201d Fado said before he started to play a song with his flute<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to dance in her stomach, but he started to running up her stomach as he was playing. Not even his flute music would work, it wouldn't turn the acid into anything he could stand on. He then tripped when he heard the dildo get to work and dropped all of his musical items so they digested instantly. Not one thing was left with Fado. He was nude in acid and very upset that this was all for a punishment. He jumped to a wall of the stomach and jumped to the next wall till he gets to the top. Then pieces of fruit fall down knocking him all the way back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop tickling inside me. Oh crap, 2 hours are almost up. Alright little guy, the only way to get out is through my butt so I want you to sit still and just get sucked into a digestive pipe I won't digest you I just need to poop you out. Trust me.\" Kimika said sucking Fado down one of her digestive pipes it was a tight squeeze, but she got him to finally drop out of her butt and into the toilet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimika grabbed pairs of gloves, and picked him out of her shit, and cleaned him up, and re-clothed him. He snapped his fingers and his flute appeared in his hands before putting it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter put that sex toy back in your sister\u2019s room or I\u2019m going to tell her about it.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes.\" Kimika said quickly putting the dildo back in Kana's Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp mental push, he broke the magic block around the round before falling to a knee.</span></div></div>",

He fixed his blade again as he sent thoughts of her and him into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that look good, navi?\u201d he asked before having wind form a sword in his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic Wave.\u201d He said slicing the barrier in half<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sent another water cannon blast, but a shield just appeared again and Navi looked shocked as none of these hits even touched her. She didn't even know what was going on. He charged at her with his wind sword and broke through the shield before landing the cuts on her face and arms. The cuts easily healed off and the shield was restored. Fado did this again, but his wind sword snapped, literally, Navi's skin was made like her sword, diamond. Fado also saw that Dark Fado was losing to Dark Navi and he has retreated out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. We're losing badly, it's like both of their skin has turned to diamond.\" Dark Fado said, showing Fado his seven snapped swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado tried to fix the swords, but he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened?\" Fado yelled to Navi and Dark Navi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know. Our skin feels colder and our swords feel lighter.\" Navi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike ice?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's like the swords are almost like feathers.\" Navi answered, striking it into a part of empty Coliseum<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still does its damage correctly though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm, can you explain what is going on here?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe it's Navi's potential, finally being unlocked.\" Chasm simply said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Continue the match for three more minutes. If Fado and his Dark are unable to land a critical hit on Navi or Dark Navi within that time, they will lose the match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado turned to his dark side as the red wolf appeared between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to go full power.\u201d He said to him and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado marks started to glow as he made the space and time deity swords appeared in his hands before his body emits a gold glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpace distortion slash.\u201d He said breaking the shield<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime Stopper.\u201d He said as he stabbed navi in the stomach freezing her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis water cannon turned into a red wolf cannon and it fired at her chest leaving a mark. Just as Fado and Dark Fado thought they had won, their skin reformed, covered over the marks, and reformed the barriers.</span></div></div>",

I honestly don't care for what you have to say and/or do.~ Snowflake said hissing at Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Sorry, cats are my favorite kind of pet; but I been able to buy one.~ he said before getting close to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~May I pet you?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Whatever human. I don't care much for any humane life, so I will crush you if you get to rough.~ Snowflake said, glaring at Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to rub her fur gently and scratch behind her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hmm. You do good work, maybe I'll have Kana take you back and I can have you as a massage mouse.~ Snowflake purred gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Sorry, but I\u2019m not going back there again unless I get trapped again in her bellybutton~ he said before teleporting to chasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm. You and me.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, though I will be using much of an assorment of weaponry while you can only use 2 swords total.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will begin with the Magic Staff.\" Chasm said, making a purple staff with a dark blue orb appear by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado just pulled one of his sword without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic Enchantment Block. Time Set: 2 hours!\" Chasm shouted sending a blast towards Fado, leaving him with a shock in his body preventing him from enchantment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now. Magic Movement Block. Time Set: 4 hours!\" Chasm then said trapping Fado in a light that prevented him from moving at all making all his body parts feel like someone dropped 300 lbs. dumbbells on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled before trying to shake his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDistraction.\u201d He said before another fado appeared behind chasm and sliced up his before stabbing him in the legs and arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Mental Magic block breaker.~ he said before breaking the blocks and the other fado faded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. It's best to snap out of your dream Fado.\" Chasm said, bringing Fado out of the fantasy that was the last moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Magic Blocks also prevent all copies from being summoned or created. That being said you cannot use any mind tricks to try and break the barrier.\" Chasm explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado was utterly shocked, as he was completely restrained on the Magic block. He also couldn't move any of his body parts to reach for a sword. He forced a smile and a short laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were already made; they are just hiding.\u201d He said as thousands of mirages appeared and attacked chasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they neared Chasm, he simply blew them to bits with his mind. The field became scattered with Fado's Fakes body parts, and the ground drenched in blue blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that feel? Would you say I'm a formiddible foe?\" Chasm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe calm his mind and started to pop his neck despite the block, but he smiled at chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but someone that I wanted to fight.\u201d He said before breaking the movement block for good<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't do that.\" Chasm said, popping Fado back to reality. \"You could only do that when the time is up. But is 2 hours out yet, I believe not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gale Staff.\" Chasm said, as the Magic staff switched with a bright green staff, with an orb that had small clouds circling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said that I can\u2019t use mind tricks, but I believe that maybe I did put you in an illusion you haven\u2019t noticed yet.\u201d He said as he keeps trying to breaks the blocks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasm just snapped him back to reality and kept reminding that he couldn't break out till designated time. Fado kept trying and sent more copies to attack him. Chasm exploded every copy with just his mind again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Struggle all you may. But it will get you nowhere.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot unless I know the trick to breaking them in reality.\u201d Fado said as his hands made half symbols in synch with his mind and he made the blocks explode and made them form around chasm stopping him in his tracks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, come to reality.\" Chasm snapped, making Fado realize he was still trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sword Staff.\" Chasm said, as a regular brow staff, with no orb appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe twisted the bottom part of it, and it slipped off, revealing a sharp sword, raring to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am in reality.\u201d He said snapping chasm to reality<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not. As you can see you're still binded.\" Chasm said, holding the blade right above Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could lower this sword right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasm lowered the sword enought to poke Fado's stomach, and the pressed down to make him bleed, but just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe this match is done, rule regulation was the first to bleed loses and that's real blood, and with the magic block, you can't heal yourself, so go ahead and sit there. Think about how you lost; a second time.\" Chasm said, walking off leaving Fado no room to object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado looked at him confused as another fado appeared stabbing him a second time and its blue blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChasm.\u201d Real fado said reappearing in front of him smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fight is not over and you never said what type of fight we were having, but the fado you were fighting was a fake.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Chasm said making the barriers move from the fake to Fado then crushed the Fado that was fake and left the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this will be a suitable goodbye present.\" Chasm said, stabbing the sword staff into Fado's stomach, and twisting it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the fight is over.\" Chasm said leaving the stage as Fado fell the floor passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What the hell is your problem, chasm?~ fado asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is I always win my battles and I always do it like that. Don't worry the wound will heal, of course after the block is removed.\" Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Or you do it yourself.~ fado said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I don\u2019t feel like dying from blood loss.~ he said being semi-sarcastic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Chasm snapped his fingers and the barriers and the blade was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado's wound then began to heal very quickly. He sighed before getting up and look at nayru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Nayru, you with din and farore in the final fight in the final arena.\u201d He said before teleporting to the final arena for the challenge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fado. Didn't you realize? It's dark out. Fights fought at night aren't fair. I may be the God of Gods, but I cannot change that rule.\" Chasm said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are welcome to sleep over if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and teleported out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m staying with my mom tonight.~ he said to chasm as he teleported to his house and walked into his room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Okay.~ Chasm said.</span></div></div>",

Fado began to have a nightmare about that evil-sounding cat, Snowflake, violently playing with him like a mouse toy and then eventually swallowing him up. He sat straight up sweating in his bed breathing hard before sitting on the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Damn cat.~ he said trying to calm down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What's wrong Fado?~ Kana asked from her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Your cat gave me a nightmare.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Little Snowflake?

During the night, he had another nightmare about Snowflake; this time in much more detail. During the dream, Snowflake had trapped him under her paw and was tearing his legs and arms off with her claws. She then used her teeth to grab Fado and slurped him up whole again. He flashed into his realm and sealed it before going into sleep again. Even there, these nightmares plagued Fado's mind. His body moved into a meditative position as he was still sleeping and he began to get rid of these fears in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Snowflake, can you hear me?~ he asked reaching out to her with his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What do you want human.~ Snowflake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Are you happy that I\u2019m getting nightmares of you eating me?~ he said bluntly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What? I only eat mice, and crush humans. I don't know how you could have nightmares of me eating you. Silly Human.~ Snowflake said, before cutting the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went back to sleep in this position ready to draw out his mental sword at the nightmares. Upon that news by Snowflake, Fado had no more nightmares and slept peacefully throughout the rest of the night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he could never match our goddesses in a fight without his powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Tru answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can\u2019t let him reach our dear Goddesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot let this fool fight the Goddess Nayru I worship so dearly.\" Zakon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all charged up the swords using the power of the sun and cross the swords making a bright flash of light continually making Fado blind for flashing seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This light will not wear off.\" Kazim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For as long as we stay standing, it is there.\" Tru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot let you defeat me or my brothers.\" Zakon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey can see a smile before fado blindfolding himself and he pulled out his sword as he got into a stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will win this fight.\u201d Fado said before teleporting behind them and slashed a deep Z into their backs making them bleed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado thought he did this, but he actually had made three Z's in the ground, missing the trio completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fall now!\" the Trio said, slashing their swords across Fado's body, making it ravaged with cuts and scars that bled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This match is over, the winners: Kazim, Tru, and Zakon.\" Navi announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even close, Navi.\u201d A voice said before scars suddenly appeared on their bodies and they are bleeding as the real fado appeared smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Fado, but now you're disqualified, magic was not allowed in this battle. Magic includes making copies.\" Navi then said, consulting a scroll, which read that rule in tiny print.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio healed themselves now that the match is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good match Fado, see ya when you want a rematch.\" Kazim said, shaking his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did your best.\" Tru admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you couldn't match us.\" Zakon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Fado, but now you're disqualified, magic was not allowed in this battle. Magic includes making copies.\" Navi then said, consulting a scroll, which read that rule in tiny print.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio healed themselves now that the match is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good match Fado, see ya when you want a rematch.\" Kazim said, shaking his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did your best.\" Tru admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you couldn't match us.\" Zakon said.</span></div></div>",

Fado sealed his realm before going back to training and he sent navi an image of them at the lake with a picnic type of date. Navi sent it back angrily. Whenever Fado tried to send it back, she'd had blocked him from her mind completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Thought I would get a blush out of it.~ he said to himself before shrugging his shoulders<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed before letting it go and went to fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile fishing, Chasm appeared next to Fado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Navi is angry, why?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFado showed him what happened before this in his memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething I must have did like pushing her brother, kazim out of here.\u201d He said before making a fishing rod appear in chasm\u2019s hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can join me if you want.\u201d He said before sitting down on the ground in front of a lake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi has a brother.

He smiled before kissing her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Dad is making my brother a god, so you'll have an even tougher time beating him and his friends.\" Navi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chasm, can you hold off on making navi\u2019s brother a god?~ fado asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Why? Don't you like a challenge?~ Chasm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I like a challenge, but I want to fight him after I finished my training and beat him.~ he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Fine.~ Chasm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~But you still have to face the three in battle.

He tried to peel himself off, but he was stuck against the tan-white foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe I can talk with whose foot this is.~ he thought to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pounded between foot and sandal, blocking mind waves. He tried rubbing the foot, but he was still pounded until he could taste the foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where are the seats?\" the voice asked from above<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey check your foot.\" he yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever it was couldn't hear as Fado was very tiny compared to this girl.

Fado began to feel the Chant and it snapped before snapping his swords once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fixed his swords again. He felt the walking stop, and the feet began to tap, smashing his swords to bits, and he heard yelling and swords clashing.
