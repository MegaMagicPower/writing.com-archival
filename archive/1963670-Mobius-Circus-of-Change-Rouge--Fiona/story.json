Turkey and cheeseburgers and chicken and all sorts of delicious meals. Any food you could think of was there. Fiona's stomach began to growl at the feast before her. Not wasting any time, she picked up a drumstick taking a giant chunk out of it. The flavor melted over her tongue and left a wonderful taste. \"It's so good...\" Without thinking she picked the meat off the bone licking her fingers clean. She threw the bone aside looking at the rest of the greasy turkey temptedly. Usually a drumstick that big would fill her up, but the delicious turkey leg she just had didn't even leave a dent Iin her hunger. Hesitantly she ripped the other leg off the turkey nearing it towards her. The smell was intoxicating. \"Maybe... Just one more bite...\" She slowly took a bite smiling to herself. She took another bite and then another one until there was nothing left on the bone. Glaring down at it, she threw it aside digging into the rest of the turkey. Hastily, she shoved giant chunks of turkey into her mouth barely taking the time to swallow. In no time the turkey was merely a pile of bones, and Fiona's stomach had become a bit plump. The extra weight caused her stomach to push out a bit past her waist line. But she barely seemed to notice it moving on to a big chocolate wedding sized cake. She began eating the first layer, shoving her mouth full of the chocolatey goodness. Her stomached gurgled and groaned as she ate more and more cake. At this point she began to look a bit overweight, her stomach pushing out a good 5 inches from the Hem of her shorts. She ignored the tightening if her clothes and finished off the first layer, going on to the second. Faster now, she began to scarf down the cake, not letting a single crumb fall onto her swelling belly. She ate more and more her belly beginning to rest in her lap growing bigger. finally she finished off that layer, starting to shovel the third layer into her mouth. the third layer was the biggest, about the size of a backboard on a basketball goal. But she tore into it like it was nothing. In a matter of minutes the entire cake was gone. Her belly had grown significantly, making it to her knees. Her shirt had slided up revealing the giant tub of fat, but Fiona's eyes were fixed on a keg with a hose attached to it along the tent walls. The cake had made her throat extremely dry and she needed a drink to wash it down. Grunting, she stood up swaying slightly and made her way over to the keg, her big belly jiggling and growling with every step. Picking up the hose and placing it in her mouth, she turned on the hose letting the sweet cold substance flow down her throat. Closing her eyes she began to chugging the delicious drink sitting down. Her stomach began to swell bigger and bigger widening significantly. It sloshed and churned, showing no sign of stopping. The drink began to affect other parts of her body as her thighs and rump began to widen as well ripping through her shorts. The last drop dropped onto her tongue as she her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to....</span></div></div>",

Fiona could feel the pressure building up inside her as one massive was desperately trying to get out. She did everything she could to keep it down, even holding her breath to try and stop it. However, given how large it was, and how short her time was in terms of holding her breath, it wasn't very long. Her cheeks went blue, as she struggled and struggled until finally the urge was too much. She opened her mouth, gasping for air and then, as she was about to hold it again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"HICCUP!!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Fiona could feel her already round body tremble and shake, her eyes darted around in shock as she watched everything unfold. Each part of her body; from her glove shaped hands, to her round, spherical torso, and her overly swollen cheeks, was swelling up even bigger than before. She could hear everything; every little \"fwoomph\", every \"Pop!\", and in terms of her boots, she could hear them tear and explode off her feet, finally losing their struggle. Her face wasn't fairing any better either, with her cheeks growing even bigger, her small fox ears puffing up along with her. Fiona tried to look up but found her vision was getting distorted due to the fact that even her eyes were growing as well; swelling and bulging out in an almost cartoony fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the end of it though. With each surge of growth, and air from the unknown pill, Fiona grew bigger and more puffier. Her entire body becoming much too big for the tent to hold her. She even noticed the sudden difference in size too; she had to have been around 15 feet at this point, and she was still getting bigger! Her overblown head, soon touched the roof of the tent, before another surge of growth caused her head and her body to shoot through, tearing the tent and allowing her overinflated form to poke out into the outdoors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph...B-Big....Big...Balloon.....sho...big...\" Those were just some of the few words that could escape the vixen's mouth. By the time her growth ended, Fiona, the now overinflated balloon of a Fox, was now sitting here; cartoonishly over-filled and towering over the tent at an alarming 30 feet in size and height. Her thoughts, if any, were pretty much clouded up. She struggled, finding it hard to even come up with a cohesive thought due to how pressurized her head was at this point. All she could really do was sit there, wiggling her hands, and feet a bit until something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were silent for a good while...however things weren't silent for long...</span></div></div>",

Her clothing pooled around her, now entirely too large for her to ever wear. Her eyes swirled, spirals boring into her mind, unpicking every little bit of knowledge she had learned, and melting it away. It all went, from her extensive studies in first aid and fighting, her experiences as a robber, a Freedom FIghter, a queen and a mercenary, to her personal bonds and memories, washing them all into empty nothingness. Finally, even the most basic of life skills began to leave her. Speech, walking, feeding herself, it all went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, something in her rapidly-emptying brain told her that losing memories was bad, but another mandatory suck on the rubber bulb in her mouth doubled the intensity of the spirals, 'reminding' her that her old memories were a pain. She came for a new start, and she has it. She had her whole life ahead of her again, never to make the same mistakes she did the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thought in her mind, before all of her internal thoughts dissolved into baby talk. Fiona rocked backwards, lying down as she cried out. She wailed, wept and sobbed for the embrace of a mother. The worker who had changed her was only to happy to provide, scooping up the little red ball of fluff and palcing ehr on a changing table. Dusting the kit's backside with powder, Fiona was placed into the poofiest, softest diaper available. A pink top with the word \"Princess\" on it in flowing cursive was quickly added, followed by a new, less draining pacifier. With that, Fiona was placed in her crib, and rocked gently until sleep overcame her.</span></div></div>",

Thinking to himself he knew that due to Nicole technically being a machine she couldn't be forced to ingest the transformation liquid while on the other hand Muttski wouldn't be much of a threat to him and once separated from Nicole would be easy to convert. If he wanted to put Nicole under his control he would need not only her handheld console but someone who would know how to use it as well. What felt like forever for Eclipse but in reality was only a few minutes, the duo finished their conversation and went down the hallway until they reached a forked point in which they separated from there, if Eclipse followed Muttski he could easily convert him now but if he followed Nicole she could lead him to the console which would be one part of two to acquire her into his growing army. </span></div></div>",

The section that covered her stomach turned white, while the section around her chest turned red-orange. Her gloves turned the same colour, and stretched up to merge at the shoulders.

Plus - didn't she mean 'one size fits all'? \"Yeah... Why don't I?\" she resolves, scratching her head and pulling the uniform out. \"Do you have a changing room, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simian woman tilts her head and scratches it; mimicking Fiona. \"What for?\" She waves dismissively, continuing \"Just throw it on over your other stuff, we'll get you out of it later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring what <i>it</i> could mean, she unzips the jumpsuit and steps into it. There's something strange about watching the rather plain, unflattering garment swallow up her form-fitting outfit - and she wasn't sure whether that was a good thing or bad thing. Once it was on, she zips it up - feeling it sag slightly around her body. Looking down at the chest, she could see a small patch reading <b>Greasemonkeys</b> in lieu of a nametag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! You look <i>great</i>, new gal!\" the simian woman chimes, hopping up onto the counter, then jumping down on Fiona's side. Fiona can feel herself smile - confused as she was, she appreciated the compliment. \"So, you said you know a thing or two - how confident are ya? You wanna get right to work; or maybe brush up a little?\" She jabs a thumb at a stack of manuals and magazines sitting behind the counter. </span></div></div>",

Her legs were now covered in white stockings. She could feel frilly bloomers around her hips and crotch, but the garment was hidden from view by the wide, soft skirt of her new dress, which was an indeterminable grey to her now. It had a frilly hemline, exposed a tasteful amount of cleavage, and had round, puffy short sleeves, which were also frilled. Around her waist was a white sash, tied into a bow at the small of her back. She felt a corset constricting her midsection, and a bra supporting and pushing up her breasts. She wore no gloves, her exposed hands showing her finely manicured nails, as opposed to the sharpened claws she had before. A pearl bracelet clutched her wrist, and she felt a matching necklace around her throat. A glance in a mirror showed her that her hair was now shoulder length, curling up at the ends, with her fringe following suit. A hairband held the rest back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is this!?\" She gasped, her body holding itself in a girlish posture involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite simple, my dear...\" Mezarro smiled. \"You are now one of the Sweetly family, the stars of this show.

I'll get right to work, making those noses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezaro made around 2500 clown noses in one night, and just in time for the show, too.

Fiona was handing out noses at the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona: And here's one for you, too, mam. *hands a woman a nose*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman #1: Why thank you, ya little cutie. *puts on the clown nose* Ooh! I feel funnier already. *smiles and walks inside*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona: She'll make a great clown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona handed out about 1800 noses that night. Then, the show began. Everyone in the audience was wearing a clown nose that had already permanently attached itself to the wearer's face. No one seemed to notice, though. Fiona was doing usual clown things, such as juggling, pie throwing, and even got shot out of a cannon. By this time, the show was about half over. Everyone in the audience had pale white skin and bright lips that could only smile. No one had a flat chest either. Just about everyone's pants and shirt had been \"clownified\" at this point as well. No one seemed to notice. The show continued and the changes continued as well. Fiona was having so much fun being a clown and the audience was having so much fun watching her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show was now over, and everyone in the audience was a clown girl now. Everyone had a large set of breasts and no one had any male parts remaining. Almost everyone wore a cute clowny dress with big, four-fingered gloves. All of their lips were locked with a permanent smile. Some were wearing heels and some were wearing goofy shoes that seemed to fit Bigfoot rather than a human. Every clown had long hair of varying colors and each had rosy red cheeks. But it wasn't just the physical appearance that had changed, but their minds had changed as well. As far as they knew, they had always been clown girls and lived to bring joy to others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona: Well, I'd say this was a fabulous success. Everyone's a happy clown girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezaro: Yes, I'd certainly say this was a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona: ... There's just one problem, Mezaro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezaro: And what would that be ?</span></div></div>",

After finishing half of the liquid she smacked her big lips in delight, savoring the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tootsie\": So what's this drink going to-*She gasped at what she just heard, her once sweet and sexy voice had become higher pitched and helium toned* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezaro: Why it's turing you back to \"normal dearie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTootsie looked in joy as her body started to morph and distort in more ways than she thought. It was there that the changes started to take hold. Her arms suddenly became little and baby-like in both weight and size. Though her feet remained big and floppy, her legs started to dwindle down to a smaller more midget-like state. As she shrank and squashed down in height her magic clown outift distorted along with her to match her soon to be new size and weight. Tootsie couldn't believe what was happenning  to her. She had never been more delighted to return to a size that in reality she never was in the first place. Finally the changes stopped and Tootsie looked around in amazement. Everything she once knew now seemed like it was being run by giants now. She quickly ran to a measurement sign and was delighted to see that she had gone from a 5 ft tall clown to a tiny, 3 ft tall circus midget. The chubby, little vixen cracked a big smile and laughed in her squeaky little voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTootsie: Hee hee hee hee! Look at me! I'm a little person again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezaro: A regular Circus Midget and a cute one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTootsie beamed brightly as she laughed and ran around in circles, singing a few little tunes in her chipmunk tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTootsie: *singing* <i>\"I wore an Ittsy Bitsy, Teeny Weeny, Yellow Polka Dot Bikini!\"</i> This is so fun! Now I'm sure to make people laugh and smile! People LOVE little girls like me! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezaro looked and chuckled as the cute midget vixen ran around his legs honking her own red nose in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezaro:I can tell little one. So here. Take this with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed \"Tootsie\" the bottle of \"Midget Juice\" as she slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezaro: Your tool of trade is ready, after all we wouldn't want you to be the only midget here would we? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tootsie\" shook her head with a big smile across her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTootsie: Yeah! I want people to know what it's like to be part of our circus world but I also want them to be little and happy and giggly like little ol me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezaro: Well no time for dilly dallying then sweetie, take the juice with you and do what you do best!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that knowledge and goal in mind, Tootsie ran as fast as her little legs could so she could</span></div></div>",

Of course, with her new memories, she knew the path through like the back of her hand. As she traversed the maze, she caught sight of her new form, staring back at her with glazed, pink eyes. She'd noticed her changes as they came, but now was the first time she could look upon the completed product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stark white fur contrasted her rainbow-coloured hair, fluffed up into an afro, her favourite style, and her scarlet lips and big, squeaky rubber nose- which she honked for good measure upon seeing it again, giggling in her helium-toned voice. Her feet were disproportionately large, and her shoes doubled the effect. These too made squeaking noises when she took a step, yet, despite their length, she moved with surprising grace, as if she had done it all her life. She wore a bright yellow dress, almost eye-searing, covered with polka dots, while, upon closer inspection, appeared to be red noses. Her hair ribbon had more than doubled in size, become the same scarlet, and now rested on her chest in a bow. But the thing she loved most was her new stature. Three feet tall, barely above the children that loved her act so much, with a chubby little form and a small pot belly. She was the perfect clown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, something in \"Tootsie\" flickered. Her glazed eyes cleared, though remaining pink, as something that she would call \"perfect\" happened deep within her mind. Seeing herself this way, robbed of her height, her figure, her colour, her style, her freedom, and even her name, everything that was left of Fiona cracked and melted away, descending into the giggly, submissive madness of \"Tootsie Flopperdoodle\". That was who she was now. Fiona Fox was gone, done for. Even if her friends did find this place, nobody would ever suspect that it was her. Who could possibly look at \"Tootsie\" and see Fiona? No-one. Because she wasn't Fiona. She was \"Tootsie.\" She wasn't \"Fiona\". There was no \"Fiona\". No \"Fiona Fox\" had entered the Big Top today. Tootsie Flopperdoodle had woken up here in her bed, because she lived with the circus, she always had done, and she always would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTootsie looked at her reflection again. She giggled happily, that strange headache being gone now, honked her nose twice, and skipped onwards, her shoes squeaking musically as she hopped. Speaking of hopping, she really did need to get her pogo-stick back... But for now, Tootsie had the perfect plan to make everyone a clown midget like her.</span></div></div>",

She looked down as her tube top and pants stretched against her swelling chest and hips. She could feel her belly pushing outwards, slowly starting to hang out a bit, poking it with one hand, while the other was placed on her face, which was plumping up with fat cheeks and even a double chin. She stood there for a solid 10 minutes before the mirror finally completed her change. Before Fiona looked and weighed about a healthy 100 pounds, complete with a trim fame and decent curves. However now, she looked more like a supersized, and cartoonishly overweight parody of her former self. Her clothes stretched to their limit, her face now all pudgy, and her figure now reduced to a round, blubberfied weight of 400 pounds.

Is that MY voice?!</b> Fiona giggled and laughed hysterically as she continued uttering out ridiculous words and phrases to test out her new voice, all of which amused herself and Mezzaro especially. <b>\"Ha ha ha ha ha!

But Smaller is definitely cuter!\" She giggled as she soon felt the mirror's magic take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona could feel an invisible force push down on her body. It tickled a bit, making her giggle as her body began to painlessly squash and shrink in certain areas. Her arms and legs pushed up, getting smaller and stubbier, while all the mass converged in the center, giving her body a slightly chubby look. Her clothes, with the exception of her bow, remained unchanged though. Seeing as how this was happening in reality, rather than the mirror, her clothes became increasingly bigger and looser the more shorter and squat the vixen became. Once the weight left her body, Fiona grinned as she looked at her new self. What was once a slender vixen of 5 feet in height, was now a short, chubby parody of her former self, standing at a dwarfish 3 feet in height and stature. And yet she couldn't help but smile and laugh at her new transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my gosh, I look so puny! Huh?\"</i> Fiona placed a little hand on her mouth, shocked as she heard a much more squeakier sounding voice escape her mouth. <i>\"Hello~? Oh! Say....Is that my voice? Heh heh. Is that...MY voice?!\"</i> She giggled and laughed even harder as she kept talking. <i>\"Ha ha! How cute! I sound more like a chipmunk than a fox if I do say so myself~! I wonder what else has changed. Oh! Oh! I gotta get a look at-Whoa~!!!\"</i> She soon took a step closer to the mirror, however she stumbled a bit as she almost tripped over something. She looked down, only to chuckle at what she saw. Her pants and top were WAY too big on her little body, hanging off her shoulder, and slightly dropping down her legs as she moved. And her boots? She wasn't even wearing them! Her feet were now so small, that she easily stepped out of the oversized footwear without even noticing. <i>\"Hee hee! Such a silly fox am I.

The steel toes of her boots pinged off, as they slid down her legs and morphed into regular high-heel shoes, before turning reddish-pink. A yellow puffball appeared on one toe, and a light pink one on the other. Her pants separated into a pair of frilly panties, white with pink spots all over it, and a pair of stockings, covered in horizontal rainbow stripes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, pretty!\" Fiona giggled. Her crop-top then shifted, the lower seam flowing down over her stomach, around her hips, and began to spread out into a wide skirt. The black leather turned into yellow cotton, and it formed puffball sleeves around her shoulders. The hem, neckline, and sleeves were tipped with magenta ruffles, and the dress itself was covered in rainbow spots. It also lacked a tail-hole, so any movement of Fiona's brush lifted the skirt and showed off her panties. WHich of course, she found funny. A second set of sleeves, rainbow-striped like her stockings, slid out from her gloves and up inside the puffballs. Finally, her hair bow increased in size, and was covered in the same spots as her dress. \"I'm such a silly billy cutie-pie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed.\" Mezarro smirked at his new clown. \"Now for your finishing touches!\"</span></div></div>",

They pulled the vixen's magenta hair into two thick, wild pigtails, hanging down either side of her head. Then, her puffy lips were coated with red lipstick, her cheeks were painted into magenta hearts, and yellow eyeliner surrounded her glazed pink eyes. Mascara coated her lashes, and her eyelids turned blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've noticed that you like bows, Fiona. Would you like some more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, yes please!\" Fiona giggled. One appeared around her neck, one at the top of each stocking, three of them appeared going up the middle of her dress, and a huge one appeared on her rear. Finally, Mezarro put a tiny top hat on her head. \"Thanks Master!\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing, actually.\" He snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" She managed to say, before realising that her sultry, smooth voice had been replaced by a high-pitched, helium-esque squeak. She squealed with delight, bouncing on her squeaking shoes.  \"Oooh, I sound super-funny, Master! This is so great! Thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it, dear.\" He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it? I love it! I feel so happy and fluffy inside, and, like, I can't stop smiling!

I'm Fifi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezarro took a step back, and looked Fifi up and down, taking in her garish costume, her chalk-white fur, her girly hair, and her exaggerated figure. He had taken his captive, a strong, confident woman, and broken her down, stolen her will, and hypnotized her into allowing him to turn her into a clown. A ditzy, airheaded clown, who would happily do whatever he asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fiona quickly found a comically long trolley, practically a whole new table with wheels on it, just outside the tent that served as a kitchen. It was piledhigh with every kind of edible treat imaginable, though all of it was sugary, greasy, fatty, and otherwise generally unhealthy. It was the single most appetising sight anyone could ever see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Fiona's thought upon seeing it wasn't that she should eat some for herself. Her stomach didn't make the slightest gurgle. No, the only thought in her mind was that she had to bring the table to Rouge. A girl of her size clearly needed a meal like this! She quickly positioned herself at the end of the trolley, and began to slowly push it toward the bat's location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, despite its massive length, the sheer weight of the contents, and the general instability of caster wheels, along with Fiona being just one, ordinary Mobian vixen, the trolley was easy to control. She steered it past tents and stages and props, easily guiding it toward Rouge's corpulent form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, a peculiar change came over her outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the entire ensemble's material changed from tight leather to soft, silky cotton. Her belts shifted, thickening up as they fused together and formed into a skirt, which lengthened and spread into puffy, wide bell-shape. Chiffon appeared underneath it, keeping it outstretched as white frills appeared along the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boots changed next, steel toes pinging off as they slid down her legs, melting into a pair of cute high-heels. She stumbled slightly as said heels formed underfoot, but stayed upright, as her pants turned white. The legs separated, sliding down to the middle of her thighs, while the remainder tightened around her crotch and backside, becoming a frilly pair of white panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gloves went next, but their change was relatively simple, turning white as black, lacy cuffs appeared around her wrists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer top, meanwhile, was shifting the most. The neckline dropped, exposing more of her cleavage as the straps widened, reaching over her shoulders and down to where her gloves stopped, before poofing out into a pair of puffy, round sleeves. But as the neckline continued to drop, they all but separated, the top now just reaching up to her chest, more a fancy corset than a shirt, as it flowed down over her midsection and fused with the skirt, forming a dress, as the whole ensemble gained increasingly elaborate frills and lace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white apron formed on the front of her dress, tied in place with a large ribbon around her waist, which made a huge bow just above her backside. At the same time, her actual bow was reshaping into a maid's bonnet, white in colour, just as a lacy choker appeared around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona arrived back in the room where the mostly-immobile Rouge awaited her, swelling with pride when she saw the bat's eyes light up at the sight of her cargo.</span></div></div>",

Now it was once again covered in the most mouth-watering dishes ever seen.In fact, not only were there exquisite high-class foods waiting for her to try them, but some wonderful guilty pleasures, and, curiously, some of her particular favourite meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach gurgled at her. It had been a long time since she'd had a good meal. In fact, not since she'd left Knothole with Scourge had she eaten properly.

All these conflicting feelings bumping against each other, soon sparked something that Fiona hadn't considered before. Maybe she couldn't take her sights off the food....because deep down... she also wanted to be like Rouge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No. That's stupid! Why would I give up my figure...my own intelligence just to be big, waddling whale of a fox?!\" She paused to think trying to favor the cons to turn herself away from it...yet something crept up to enlighten her current situation. Rouge, despite her size and current lack of intelligence looked....happy. Relaxed. Blissfully enjoying herself without a care in the world. Whereas Fiona had constantly been living a rough and stressful life of abandonment, and pain. Maybe...she wanted this just so she could have a way to finally have some kind of joy and happiness in her life. Even if it meant tossing away her old self to whatever weird shlock was in this meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Maybe it's temporary.\" She thought, as she reached down, grabbing a juicy drumstick from a nearby smoked turkey. \"...Oh I still don't know...but...I...I just want one moment of bliss....I just want one moment of happiness and enjoyment....I just... want...\" She said as she stared at the drumstick \".....one little taste.\"</span></div></div>",

Already her stomach was gurgling, not with hunger but with happy acceptance of its looming bloat. Body and mind, she wanted it. It wasn't just mindless gorging like Rouge had done, Fiona had a goal. A goal to be as big and bloated and brainless as the bat that had once been her enemy, her rival, and was now her idol.

So what do you say~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge looked at the machine with a smirk before looking back at the exit. \"Well. Okay I guess since I'm here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" exclaimed the machine. \"Now then...Ms.Rouge. Speak clearly into the Mic. \"What is your deepest desire?\"</span></div></div>",

That's not what I-\" suddenly everything soon kicked in. \"Wait a second, what did you mean by \"his dim-witted brain?!\" Before she could get an answer, Rouge held her head as the light's energy soon invaded her mind and began to wipe away all intelligence she had stored away. All while the sounds of blubbery fat continued to pile on, causing her once slender arms and legs to plump up like large sausages. Her clothing continued to strain and stretch as her gain continued; but some clothing was not so lucky to make it so far. She looked down and watched as her fat feet soon won the fight against her boots; bursting out and reducing them to shreds. Strangely, Rouge instantly frowned and almost started to cry. \"Oh no~ Not my precious boots.\" She sniffed as she waved a plump hand farewell to her fallen footwear. \"Bye Bye Boots. I knew you well.\" It took a second but she soon began to question what she had just said as she felt her face following in the gain; plumping up to chipmunk sizes while more began entering her gradually fattening chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not my face! I'm too pwetty too-OH!\" The bat was shocked at what she just heard. Her once smooth and lustrous voice was now replaced with a low pitched mockery of its former self; making her sound just as dumb and dim-witted as what the machine was turning her into.As the last of her weight soon poured on, the energy made one last but very fatal blow to her mind. After eliminating enough IQ, they began erasing and wiping memories of her life. Her friends, her real desires, even simple things like who she was or what she loved to do for a living. By the time she could do anything, it was already too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Body Morph Complete\" The machine shut off the laser as its automated message played out. It then turned its attention to Rouge. \"Well my dear the process was a success. Now say hello to \"the new you\"! Upon pulling out the mirror from its side, the reflection was almost something out of a fun house. When in actuality it was in fact crude reality. Gone was the slender and clever treasure hunter that walked into the tent, but standing before the reflective glass was a gigantic distortion of her former self. Towering the mirror at 6 feet, high and weighing in an amazing 616 pounds stood the big and enormous Rouge the bat; who was still recovering from the strange experience. Upon looking at herself in the mirror, she could only form a big, dumb grin on her face as she waved at the mirror's reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh. Hewwo Me!\" she greeted with giggle. When the reflection didn't respond she just stood there and smiled. \"Daw don't be shy! I won't hurt you. I'mma fwiend!\" </span></div></div>",

Perhaps the mind alteration was not as total as it had originally thought.

She didn't know what else to do until her stomach began to growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, Hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching for food the bloated bad searched for food her oversized exposed stomach jiggling as she did so.

She rolled her eyes at the clear low-brow joke. What was next, toilet humour? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was something off about the image. Normally, a mirror like this would make her reflection look comically mismatched. A wide, heaving lower body, with her unaltered head on top, with her legs and feet looking almost as distorted as her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was different. The rotund Fiona in the mirror wasn't simply a stretched-sideways reflection of her normal self. Rather than simply looking out-of-scale with the rest of her, her belly was spilling out over the waistband of her leggings, which looked like they were struggling to hold together. Her belts had snapped, and now rested uselessly near her boots, which themselves had been stretched and warped by the massive increase in the thickness of her legs, which wobbled like jelly with every step the vixen took closer to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms were similarly chunky, her gloves long-since having been split apart, while her fingers were fat little sausages, and looked to be covered in greasy food. Her breasts were huge, former C-cups now a generous G-cup, sagging down free of any semblance of a bra, her top not quite able to hold them in, as they rested on her heaving stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the biggest giveaway was her face. Rather than a normal head atop this warped body, her face had changed to match. She had plump, rosy cheeks, thick lips, and a second chin. But despite that, and the immediate revulsion Fiona felt upon seeing this corpulent copy of herself... she was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, she was smiling a contented, carefree smile. She was the size of a blimp, and yet she didn't seem upset about it at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought wormed into Fiona's mind: This version of her was fat and lazy because she was happy. She didn't have a care in the world. No wars to fight, no enemies to flee, no food shortages or traumas or anything. She had the total freedom to just... sit around and eat all day... Fiona almost envied her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear from the vacant look in Fat Fiona's eyes that there wasn't much going on upstairs either. She probably didn't think about much beyond her next meal... but given the life Fiona herself remembered... maybe ignorance really <i>was</i> bliss... After all... Fat Fiona was happy and well-fed, and Regular Fiona was neither... Her stomach gurgled to remind her of her own lack of good food. Or any food, really. And as she stared more and more... she realised that she... wanted to share Fat Fiona's lifestyle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she watched her gormless, guzzling counterpart, the less repulsed she felt by her appearance. The more she wanted to to emulate it. The more she relaxed into a blissful daze. The more hungry she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fiona stared into the mirror, the pink glow returned, flooding out and into her eyes as they began to swirl. A content, lazy smile formed on her face, and she began to reach out for the mirror, her hand rising without any input of her own. Her fingertip touched the mirror, and...</span></div></div>",

As such extremities like her hands sunk into her sides, despite their puffy, glove-like look. Her feet ballooned and exploded out of their boots as they stuck out from under her rear, and her head also swelled to cartoonishly large proportions. Her cheeks the size of yoga balls, her nose was now more round and bulbous, and because of the intense pressure and her head being stretched a bit wide, her eyes bulged out a bit, forcing her into a split and wall-eyed view.

It had been stretched and blown up that there was now way too much space inside of her cranium, rendering the poor girl's mind much tinier in comparison. <i>\"Mmm...Nod...Funnee...
