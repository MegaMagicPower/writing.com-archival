Burnham groaned as she leaned back holding her overblown belly. It was as big as an overblown yoga ball that half of it's fatty black mass squished down on top of the table in front of her. She panted heavily as she tried to take in her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo...urp...much...food...\u201d, Burnham replied holding her stomach. It was so packed that it didn't even jiggle. It just bobbed back and forth from the pressure that her hands were putting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It bulged outward from the new food, making it swell even more. \u201cSo...fat!\u201d, she groaned out through food stained lips as she swelled even bigger. Burnham moaned as she slowly wobbled from all the food contained within her. She held her swollen form in the middle of all the debris of table and food items from her meal. With a belch, she let out another groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Oh come on,</b> I know you. You can eat forever can't you?\u201d, Tyler stated.<br>\r\n Michel Burnham looked down to see her belly plopped out underneath her pink shirt and resting on her lap. She had wished that those 27 pounds she had gained was still the same amount, but she had inspected her body the day before and found that after her bad eating habits that continued after her pizza gorge she had added 3 more pounds to her figure. <br>\r\nThus bringing her to an even 30 pounds. She even measured her waistline which was 33 inches, and not to mention her belly which was <b>35 around</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurnham immediately tensed up. She glanced down and saw that after her lunch she had forgotten to try to suck her stomach in. Some of her  belly fat was protruding outward through her Pants. She quickly sucked it in and tugged her pullover across it, but the words \"gained weight\" felt like a brick inside her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Burnham couldn't even say anything in response. She knew that she had gained weight and there was no denying that, but to admit it is something else. <b>She couldn't believe that she was actually getting fat</b>. Luckily, Tyler noticed the embarrassment in Burnham's face and tried to amend his last statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't mean it like that! I mean you were already really skinny! Now you look really great! And I think someone's boobies have gotten bigger too.\" Tyler said, putting emphasis on the too while nudging Burnham's left breast. Even after Tyler pointing out her weight gain that last sentence seemed to cheer her up quite a bit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Burnham was surprised how fast she was eating it. She then peaked under the table and saw her inflating stomach pushing her shirt up so that a sliver of her fat black round belly poked out underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Ash Tyler watched Burnham's growing gut he was starting to feel horny for a touch.<br>\r\nBurnham slid her hands around her belly and felt how it resembled a giant soccer ball was inside her. She used both hands and squeezed the sides of her swollen belly.<br>\r\n Her belly oozed upward as she squeezed her hands together. It was so squishy that it puffed out wherever she wasn't putting pressure on it from her hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulging flesh that was being pushed out from Burnham's abdomen. It got pushed farther and farther up until her belly button was in plain sight. Her skin was stretched tautly across her engorged stomach like a overfilled balloon. Red  deep Stretch marks spread across her belly. That didn't stop her from trying to finish the burger though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The excitement she felt was reaching a critical level as the euphoric sensation of her bloated belly mixed with the pain of her stomach being stretched so tightly. She moaned and groaned as she forced more of the burger into her gaping mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though her uniforms were stretchy, she could hear a faint creaking from her underwear that she was wearing underneath all her clothes. They were still the same size that a 120 pound Burnham had worn, so they weren't used to all the extra girth ( about 50 pounds ) being forced upon them. She absentmindedly tugged at them downwards so they wouldn't interfere with her expanding waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurnham stood up. Her hands went to the zip of her dark blue suit, and She couldn\u2019t help grin as she started to lower it, as I\u2019d had many thoughts of the same thing happening. She met my eyes and smiled upon noticing Tylers reaction, the zip finally ending and she opened the jacket to show a <b>rather nice pair of ebony tits, her bra had snapped and it showed a delightful body.</b> \u201cWow,\u201d Tyler murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching behind, she unclasped the snapped bra to drop down, letting her breasts free. She was around a C-cup if Ash was a good judge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater she Stood naked with her pussy wet, Right there a Dark brown Goddes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This wasn\u2019t the only thing trying to escape the confines of the tortured outfit. The advanced fabric was stretched to its limits, taut across soft arms and a well-padded rear.

Her belly was bulging at least seven inched into her lap, but was being held back by her uniform pants button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She took another intake of air and felt how tight they were. \"Oh crap. Now what?\" Detmer said to herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, I'll just unbutton them and then pull my jacket over it!\" keyla Detmer then attempted the task of removing the button that felt like it was welded against her skin without trying to alert everyone else in the mess hall to what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally with a faint *pop* her pants were undone and her belly oozed out even farther into her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeyla still had some more enchiladas left and tore into them as well. Maybe she could eat them before Tilly and Ariam got back, so she wouldn't look like a pig in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She gulped down the cheesy concoction along with her water. Her belly oozed farther and farther towards the edge of the table as more of the Mexican food entered her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally with one last swallow she pounded the last of the enchiladas down her throat into her awaiting stomach. God she was full. Not only did she eat the whole triple combo platter, but the Mexican food felt really heavy inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She felt as though she had swallowed a bunch of bricks since her belly was so tight. But the stuffed sensation she felt from engorging herself as she did was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stiffed out a small cute burp as she shifted her new weight in the chair. While one hand was pushing the hair out of her eyes, the other one was furiously rubbing at her bloated gut. She was stuffed to the gills from all that food, and the Uniform she had on wasn't exactly meant to be comfortable when a around 10 pounds of food was shoved into them as well.<br>\r\nHer stomach protested, but she didn't care. Her stomach was getting full and that's what she was focusing on. Finally, her fingers brushed against the empty crumbs of the plate and she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky it was late, only to see two girls starring in awe at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever on the way to her quaters she side stepped through the door opening and lost her balance completely. She fell right into her bed from her lack of footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her enormously stuffed gut that stuck out and was reaching at least seven inches in front of her by itself. Groans could be heard from the Mexican food and the water that was within it. She poked it and even though it was stuffed, it gave way a little, and a small grin appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShort quick breaths escaped as her belly was pressing into her body with great force. She moaned as she felt her round fat stomach and rubbed her stomach in circular motions feeling her meals slosh around inside her. Her shirt was now being pushed up by her expanding dome like gut, and her belly button became visible to the world.  Detmer groaned and moaned as she turned on her side and felt how utterly fat and stuffed she was on the bed. Each breath pulled at her tight skin that was stretched over her stomach. And her stomach sat contently at her side bulging and groaning as it wobbled from her massive meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeyla was in ecstasy though. She rubbed her giant stomach as her stuffed sensations washed over her. She couldn't believe how much she had eaten.<br>\r\n If Tilly had thought she had looked pregnant last day she should have seen her now. She looked as if she was 8 months pregnant, but even bigger since she had a good layer of fat over it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her belly pushed out in front of her as she peered over to her roommate. Keylas breasts paled in comparison to how giant her midsection was.<br>\r\n She had wished that her boobs would grow a little as well, but she wasn't complaining because of how giant she felt. She was so full and packed, that she was afraid to even move too much in fear of setting off a chain reaction.<br>\r\nSo instead she laid on her bed rubbing and groaning over giant orb of a belly.<br>\r\n It was so large that it barely felt as if it was part of her body. But she could feel the pressure from her hand feeling and pinching her belly all over.<br>\r\n She huffed shallow breaths from the sheer mass of food that she contained at this point. She let out a loud moan as she moved a little and her whole belly sloshed and groaned in response.<br>\r\n Her stomach was an immense giant globe that creaked with every breath. She was really stuffed at this point, maybe a little too much. Because the pain was even overlapping the pleasure a little which caused her to squint as she tried to soothe how stuffed she felt. She undress While her roommate peaking under from her blanket and observed the view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeyla awoke at 7:20 Earth time. Outside the window discover was at warp on their way to earth spacedock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLt. Keyla Detmers giant stuffed state had sent her into a 6 hour food induced coma. When she finally gained her wits she tried to sit up and to her surprise she was still pretty big from the food items which she had consumed through out the day. Although she was full, her stuffed to the max feeling had left her leaving her giant stomach to digest the rest of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She managed to sit up just fine however and felt how her belly pressed against her chubby thighs. The contact was so warm and smooth that she slipped her hand underneath her belly and felt the warmth overtake it. She then grabbed her belly and squished it while lifting it up as well, and once again she felt the tingly sensation that usually did when thinking about her \"growth\". <br>\r\n<b>Her nipples were hard and she felt arousal around her pussy.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to dr. culbers weekly medical exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u00b4s been one year since Starfleet converted from United Earth to the Federation when Humanity allied the Vulcans, Andorians and the Tellarites for peace and exploration. With the help of my crew and the Enterprise. However, Commander Charles Tucker was technically declared dead a year ago but was later brought back to life by Doctor Phlox\u00b4s regulan egg\u00b4s that takes the DNA from it\u00b4s the host and later the egg rapidly grows up with the knowledge and memories of it\u00b4s host to when Mr. Tucker died. The host\u00b4s age fast, but Phlox has succeeded in what he failed the first time in 2155. but... I'm glad my old friend is with us even if he\u00b4s not the original Tucker. End Log.\" Said Admiral Jonathan Archer of not the NX, but now the refitted U.S.S. Enterprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe NX class ship enterprise, with an extra hull section below the saucer and connected with some new pylons and is refitted to travel at warp 5,5 at standard. Archer has laid a course to the new starbase nearby Risa was a new ship awaits to the Promoted commander Tucker, now a captain will command a new ship. A new exploration class escort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the crew have gotten their promotions included T\u00b4pol. She is now a Federation Captain of the enterprise and Admiral Archer has only a temporary command of the ship on its 1 month trip to starbase 7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo give you all a more personal description between the crew I will be delighted to elaborate it to you, like relations.<br>\r\nEven though Trip and T\u00b4pol haven't been dating for seven years they have been warmer to each other lately and it\u00b4s 2 weeks left until T\u00b4pol\u00b4s mating season begins. It\u00b4s only once seven years it happens, get the reference? However, Hoshi is now a lieutenant and is still single as ever.<br>\r\nAnd the commander Malcolm Reed official first officer to captain T\u00b4pol on the Enterprise. He does well actually. He has a kind of a relationship with an Andorian girl who was a weapons officer in the imperial guard.<br>\r\nWith the Federation formed the ties between its members have grown closer. But Reed has known this Andorian for years, and she is one of the first none humans serving on a federation ship. And Phlox and Portos... I don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the officer's mess hall:<br>\r\n\"So trip, have you recorded more clips of this season of Waterpolo games with you? All I know in the season final New Zeeland won the world cup.\" Said Archer while sawing the steak and pasta into smaller parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah sir, but you should watch the first games too when Australia made some interesting throws while keeping themself above the water.\" Said Trip while glancing over T\u00b4pol on her mega-sized portion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry T\u00b4pol? and I tell you now just like 10 years ago, you cant eat those breadsticks with a fork. Use the hands, it\u00b4s easier.\" Said Mr. Tucker in his Florida accent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Tucker, Vulcans don't eat with their hands. Said T\u00b4pol while shoving a load of Vulcan pasta in her jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I know, I know. But... doesn't it appears to be a bit much on your plate? Are you feeling alright? Asked Trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel fine Tucker.\" Said T\u00b4pol flatly. But could not help it when a light green blush colored her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Perhaps it\u00b4s the Porn\u00b4far that occurs every seven years when...\" Said Archer but were interrupted by T\u00b4pol that looked scared, or what little could be told from what a Vulcan shows with their facial muscles. Logic and whatever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vulcans don't talk about this with outsiders Admiral, apologies.\" Said T\u00b4pol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outsiders? what?\"Trip spatted out smiling to his maybe Vulcan girlfriend. \"T\u00b4pol, we have known you since 2151, what\u00b4s the deal?<br>\r\n\" Said Trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation Continued while their dinner proceeded quite nicely, T\u00b4pol has for some reason ordered thirds and impressed her human colleges. They all rose up and went to their quarters and T'pol... Well, she was helped by Trip. She may have overdone her normal level of food intake for the day. Besides Trip and T\u00b4pol found this arousing. Her belly was a bloated ball that was pointing straight out from her middle. She walked with one hand on her overstuffed belly that showed off. </span></div></div>",

Starfleet has asked the Vulcans about the spec about an energy converter that converts dilithium crystals to fuel the warp engine, as we have stated that the antimatter on board is not enough.

She went to sleep and gazed out the window at the stars to pass by at warp speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt breakfast, she sat down beside Tucker at the opposite side sat the first officer Reed with he\u00b4s Andorian mate who is the weapons officer of the enterprise. Next to her sat Hoshi with sushi in front of her. <br>\r\nAdmiral Archer Was busy in a conversation with Tucker about improving the matter and antimatter flow into the warp reactor with a new force field device on every ship in the fleet. And Hoshi and the weapons officer Lt. Shen spoke in an Andorian dialect which impressed Shen into her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut T\u00b4pol was busy eating her fattening Sompek soup and were pretty much ignorant of the conversations around her but caught up some few engineering words from Mr. Tucker from time to time and commented with him here and there while she ate portion after portion.<br>\r\nShe wasn't the only one that was overeating, Hoshi seemed to eat tuna fish whole and Shan ate some similar food as well. Every girl was stuffed beyond imagining. <br>\r\nT\u00b4pol had a soft pudge at her belly, her flat hard surface was gone but had a deep navel now. So she pointed a finger into it and it sank into her. Wish used to be impossible 2 days ago! She worriedly looked up to see if Trip disliked her or were disgusted by her new appearance but he wasn't looking her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoshi, on the other hand, had several fishes in her belly and were not fully digested yet, she just looked stuffed and good looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReeds Girlfriend and weapon officer had some slight blue love handles with some more wobbling to it when she moved a bit. Her ass and boobs were slightly more jelly-like now. Andorian evolution made them that way when they ate it quickly being digested and adipose cells quickly go to work. Add several hours of standing and sitting on a human ship made her muscles weak. The same goes for all of the females on board and this time around 90% of the crew are females. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the breakfast was over they all returned to their stations, but T\u00b4pol was uneasy. She wanted everyone to go first so she was the last to leave the room, but Trip hung around the doorway and said: \" T\u00b4pol, was the matter? Are you coming? Travis found some interesting asteroids on the port side ane one of those emitting graviton emissions.\" Said Tucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will come shortly, Mr. Tucker, I have some thought I need to contemplate things first if it\u00b4s alright.\" Said T\u00b4pol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing T, I\u00b4ll go check on the engineering to see the new warp core that can make us travel at a steady warp 5,5.\" He said and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT\u00b4pol bites her tongue at seeing him leave. \u00b4\u00b4Do Trip like me no matter what?\u00b4\u00b4 she thought and stood up and examine her body. She took a step and saw her ass bounce bit much. \u00b4\u00b4It never bounces this much\u00b4\u00b4 she thought. But duty calls, it would be illogical not to attend to her duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she strode out from the officers' mess she noticed that her upper part of her blue siden shirt didn't cover her lower belly. It has ridden up a bit, revealing half the navel and the bronze-colored fat hang out 3 cm outside the waistline of her pants. </span></div></div>",

It may be the cause of it. You need sex.\" Said Phlox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon doctor?

It\u00b4s logical to assume that so long time of emotional hindering can cause serious weight gain. Try it, with who is not my concern.\" Said Phlox smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT\u00b4pol blushed heavily green on top of her bronze-toned face withe her eyebrows raised high in an awkward look. \" Thank you Phlox, I will keep this in mind,\" T\u00b4pol Said with her enlarged hips swinging and fatter ass bouncing as she walked out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Glancing at her body, she saw the extra weight was distributed evenly, but of course, her ass, having her ass on a captain's chair her fat pumped straight into it most of it. The ass was jiggly, rising out from her bottom and flaring out at the side so her tights looked thicker.  Straining against the muscle inactivity of her daily sitting, she laid her hands on her mounded belly and rubbed against the second skin of her catsuit, now tightly stretched over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her new mass and the shift in her center of gravity from the jam-packed load, she had considerable difficulty rising from the chair.  Her ass was stuck. Eventually, she had to rock back and forth until the momentum of her considerable mass sent her body out of the chair.<br>\r\nShe staggered to her feet, cradling her bloated, overfilled stomach.  The sheer weight and the struggle of standing up gave her glances from the crew which was awkward for T\u00b4pol.<br>\r\n Before long, she was panting and sweating with a real effort at moving her generous ass along the passageways. By the way, several seams have gone up during her walk to Trips quarters. She did have some stressful days behind her and still contemplate the solution to stop her weight gain with sex. She thought she could have an excuse like.. massage to make her sleep better, Vulcan neuro pressure like she thought him years ago. But still, she doesn't know how he thinks of her.</span></div></div>",

He had begun stripping her down almost immediately as they entered the door, both of their shirts still lying in the entryway. That's where the making out began as they fumbled with one another's shorts and sweats. Having T\u00b4pol come straight from the mess it was no easy to slide them off and leave their bottoms abandoned in the hall as they made their way to the room. Trip got hard he ripped T\u00b4pols panties off, ignoring the green marks on her skin from where they dug into her soft fleshy hips and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there he turned her around and pushed her over the bed, skipping all foreplay as he took control. His hands went to her inner thighs as he felt the heat she was giving off, his fingers teasing her; he could almost feel her dripping when he slammed himself into her. He thrust into her from behind, trying not ignoring the sounds of her belly and tits slapping together as they bounced and jiggled with each thrust. His hands dug into her newly developed love handles and he squeezed them, shocking himself with how soft they actually were. T\u00b4pol then decided she wanted control so she turned around, pushing him on the bed, she straddled him and slid him inside her yet again, this time riding him slowly at first and then faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, yes, yes!\" T\u00b4pol shouted as she rode trip in their bedroom. While the bouncing did the trick of getting him hard it was easy to keep his eyes open once T\u00b4pol got on top. Her belly rolled slightly over her waist and her breasts were beginning to sag as they grew larger. Each gyration of her hips sent her whole body into a jiggling fit in which he could feel it all as their naked bodies were pressed together. He finally blew his load after having closed his eyes long enough to picture a much fatter T\u00b4pol on top of him. The orgasm from him was followed by orgasm from her as she collapsed next to him naked in bed, her belly rising and falling as she panted. </span></div></div>",
