You bounced around and the fact that your crush, Hayley, agreed to go with you made it the perfect night. After two hours of non-stop moshing, the band finally finished their set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmongst the crowd of people, you finally managed to squeeze out of the doors into the cold winters night outside. You had agreed not to drink anything so you could take Hayley home, but you didn't let that spoil the night as you walked down to your car. You got into your car and began heading over to Hayley's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a great night Hayley! I didn't know you were into the same music as me, we should do this again\", you exclaimed to Hayley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely! I didn't know you were so much fun\", Hayley giggled to herself as you chuckled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had that feeling in the pit of your stomach that something could come out of this as you pulled up outside Hayley's apartment. She looked at you with a wild look in her eyes and you looked back, you couldn't control yourself as your head lurched into Hayley's face and began to make out for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do you want to come inside?\" Hayley asked...</span></div></div>",

You managed to just lock your car before being pulled inside the entrance of the apartment block and into the elevator. You went up to the tenth floor before being led to room 1018, as Hayley fumbled around with her keys to unlock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, it was a bog-standard apartment for someone in their twenties as she led you to the living room. You took a seat on the couch, feeling a little nervous as this was the girl of your dreams. You had been acquaintances for a few years but lacked the confidence to make your move, however, it was all about change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a drink of something? Vodka? Beer? Water?\" Hayley asked you. </span></div></div>",

A few minutes later she returned with two shots before handing you one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On three...one...two...three\" Hayley counted down as you swung back the vodka in one, immediately cringing at the sour taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is in that? That's the strongest stuff I've ever tasted!\" You exclaimed as you tried to get the taste out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just an old family recipe\" Hayley replied as she sat down next to you, before stroking your crotch with her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that shot, you just couldn't focus. All you could do was focus on Hayley's cat as he slept on the armchair opposite you. Your vision started to grow fuzzier by the second before going black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like the longest sleep of your life, you opened your eyes. You stretched and rubbed your face as your vision started to clear, but where were you?</span></div></div>",

Confused you stood up to see it was a glass floor beneath your feet. You turned around to see another glass wall. You looked up to see a cap screwed on tight above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly clicked, you were inside a jar! You immediately started panicking as you started pounding your fists on the glass wall. Your tiny arms didn't do much in the way of making noise as suddenly the lights around you flicked on. You saw you were in someone's bedroom, the jar was sat on the bookshelf opposite the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Hayley in her giant form appeared in front of you with a wide grin on her face, she kneeled down in front of the jar and tapped it with her fingernail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling little guy? You just passed out on me!\" Hayley giggled as she began unscrewing the cap above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley! What have you do...Woah!\" Before you could finish your sentence, Hayley had slid her giant fingers in and grabbed you by your arm, pulling you out of the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed in terror and dangled helplessly by your arm, as she brought you to her face. You saw your terrified face in her glasses as you looked down at the huge drop to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what shall we do first? Shall we...\"</span></div></div>",

However, your escape attempt was short-lived. Hayley simply leaned forward and plucked you up in between her fingertips, before dangling you in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that didn't work out too well did it?\" Hayley said, looking pretty angry as she grabbed some wipes, before standing up and heading to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe switched on the lights to the bathroom and headed inside, her bare feet slapping against the tiled floor. You desperately squirmed around, not knowing what she had planned for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley simply dropped you on the tiled floor, causing both your legs and lower back to break. You screamed in pain as you heard your bones snapping after the huge drop. You desperately tried to drag yourself away using your arms as Hayley wriggled her toes against the floor in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a dark shadow loomed over you. Looking up, you saw Hayley's giant sole and the pads of five toes directly above you. You had no time to react and her foot suddenly came down on you, everything suddenly went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed in relief as she felt your tiny body pop and crack beneath her sole. She then lifted up her foot to see a bloody mess on her sole and on the tiled floor. She simply pulled out a wipe and began wiping away your blood and guts, before disposing of the wipe in the toilet and flushing it away.</span></div></div>",
