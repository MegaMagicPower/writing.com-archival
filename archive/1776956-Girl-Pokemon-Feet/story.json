Celebi, alarmed at her plaything moving, fell into your lap. Before fully sitting upright, Celebi stood up and tried to push you back down.

Celebi looks up at you with a very sad expression and tears begin welling in her eyes. You start to lay back down slowly and her face instantly brightens up.

Hoping to get some of her weight of your chest so you can at least keep breathing throughout her game of footsie. You might as well try to lift a continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms slide painfully to your sides.Your ribs groan in protest as your chest is compressed again under her mass, and the bit of air you managed to take in is forced from your lungs as the foot settles on top of you once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biii...</span>\" you hear again from far up high, muffled through the tons of foot-flesh currently covering you. Still, you get the gist of what she's saying: \"I'm waiting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you've heard of the legendary pokemon, she's not the type to kill you on purpose. But you're pretty sure you'll end up an accidental smear if she doesn't ease up on her \"encouragement\" soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lungs are burning for air, and darkness is seeping in from the edges of your vision when the foot lifts slightly again, granting you another breath. You greedily fill your lungs with the stale air underneath the pokemons foot, not even caring about the smell anymore. The paw starts lowering again, and you do the only thing you can think of to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the taste isn't too bad. Sure, your saliva, the crushed grass and gritty sand form a foul mixture in your mouth, but it's simply unpleased, not the disgusting mess you expected it to be. And though it feels weird to lick something warm and moving, the foot itself is pretty much tasteless. Maybe abit salty and earth-like, but nothing that would roil your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now it looks like your lapping has stopped the descent of the great fleshy ceiling suspended above you, though you're still smushed uncomfortably between it and the ground. It's not long before you managed to clean the sole within the limits of what your mouth can reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems Celebi picked up on this problem as she fully removes her foot from your body, destroying most of the progress you made as she sets her foot back on the ground. The green mountain looks much happier after having received your tongue bath, positively beaming down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she turns around, and starts walking away from you. At your small size, you can hear the dirt shift with every step she takes. Getting compressed and pushed aside underneath that unbearable weight, much like you had been earlier. You want to get away from this feet-obsessed fairy as far and fast as you can, but you don't envy your chances of making it out of this forest at your current size. Your best solution for that problem is currently moving away from you with giant strides. Since your green tormentress managed to shrink you, she can probably also reverse it. But you might even prefer facing the forest as you are now, over having to participate in any more of her games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is interrupted as Celebi makes a small pirouette before plopping her butt down in front of a tree, and props her feet up in your direction. It looks like they are about as tall as you. She probably even used them to determine how far she should shrink you, considering you've not seen her do anything yet that doesn't involve her feet. This new view on the green monoliths also confirms your earlier fears - any progress you made in getting one of them clean has been completely undone by that short stroll of hers. The spin at the end was probably to make completely sure you had to start over, as dirt and grass once again clings to every inch of her feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi</span>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings her hand to her lips and points to her feet again, before leaning back against the trunk and looking at you expectantly. It looks like she's eager to have you continue your service, and she intends to enjoy it as much as she can this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding quickly, you...</span></div></div>",

So, even though very reluctantly, you decide to do as the pokemon wants in order to regain your original stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you approach her foot, Celebi gives a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" the green fairy exclaims happily as you stop in front of her foot. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" she repeats impatiently.

Sure, the whole thing is humiliating as it is weird - being reduced to the size of a bug and forced to lick the sole of a pokemon clean - but, at least, you aren't being pinned in between the foot and the ground like you had been earlier. Nonetheless, the smell of grass is still present, and it is most certainly not getting any better.

You hesitate for a moment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biiii!</span>\" Celebi cries immediately, catching your hesitation.

Your very being won't bear this situation for much longer. It's simply becoming too much for you to go on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost half and an hour, you finally take one last lick, before stopping, having cleaned Celebi's foot completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to not throw up, you get away from the pokemon's feet.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" Celebi says in a cheerful tone.

I've done what you wanted... return me to normal...\" you mutter in a pleading tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she just giggles, before you feel yourself being dragged closer to her feet once again. You understand two things: one, she's using her psychic powers to incapacitate you; two... she isn't done with you just yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drops you at her feet again, she looks down at you with the same smirk she had earlier. You quickly understand what she's up to...</span></div></div>",

I'll play with your feet some more.\" You nervously assure her, before wishfully adding: \"But you'll grow me back afterwards... Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately regret saying the last bit, as you see that otherworldly glow return to her eyes. Fearing the no doubt unspeakable foot-related torture she has in mind for you, you quickly brace yourself and await the psychic assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething should have definitely happened by now. The lack of any psychic action starts to disturb you more and more as your mind wages a battle between protecting yourself from the inevitable onslaught, and curiosity to find out what's taking so long. When you finally manage to gather enough courage to look at her face again, you just see her close her eyes as she offers you a half-hearted shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief at the discovery that no new abuse of your body at her feet seems to be coming, and accept that this dismissive commitment of hers is the best you're going to get. You quickly and  dutifully make your way to her foot again, before she reconsiders pulling any more supernatural shenanigans on you.  When you arrive, you realize the sole looms above you slightly, obviously bigger than before. Not a whole lot, but still easily noticeable. Did that time-traveling fiend shrink you again!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince there's little you can do about it now, you decide to set to the task at hand. You're unsure on how to even start rubbing a foot taller than you. To begin, you try placing your hands at the sides of it and gently start kneading, slowly moving them up and down along its edges as you do. You even find yourself getting slightly into it. This is much more pleasant for you as well after all, compared to the experience of having to lick it or getting stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, your spell is soon broken when you hear her sigh in disappointment. You chance a look upwards and see her staring back at you with a bored expression. Her head rests in one paw as she lazily observes your pitiful attempt to make good on your promise. The message is clear. If you don't come up with something better soon, there's no chance she's ever restoring your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frantically move your hands around the edge of her foot, squeezing as you go, but her expression doesn't change. You bring your hands to the wider surface of her sole and slide them around like that, but all you accomplish is coaxing an exaggerated yawn from her. It's like she can barely even feel you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning out of ideas, you punch her foot in frustration. And then immediately regret doing so. You slowly peek upwards, to see if she noticed. She obviously did. But, astonishingly, she doesn't seem angry. Nor does she look like she's about to fall asleep. She just looks down at you surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to try again, and jam your knee into her arch. This gets her to sit upright again. Looks like you've not wasted your chance! You start outright pummeling the great foot. You shoulder bash the ball of her foot and hammer against it with your fist. You kick and punch the arch. You try out bear hugs and full body tackles against her towering sole. With every blow, you try your utmost to push as deep into the scented flesh as you can. It's absolutely exhausting, but the pleased mutterings pouring from her lips tell you you're doing something right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep going as long as you can before softly leaning against her skin, trying to catch your breath. Every inhale fills your lungs with the scent of her foot. Your muscles ache and your body is damp with sweat. Yours or hers, you honestly can't tell at this point. Nor can you bring yourself to really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hope it was enough.</span></div></div>",

But Celebi stays silent during the whole process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biiii....</span>\" you stop to gaze up to the giantess, realising that she just yawned out of boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, she looks dejected, her gaze fixed on the ground, telling you that she's paying little to no attention to your actions. Clearly, she once again wants you to come up with something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish...\" you mutter, starting to back away from her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shifts her gaze to you, curious about your next action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you feel you've gotten far enough, you stop and look at Celebi, spotting the amused amused expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally counting to three, you start sprinting towards her at your full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, at short distance from her foot, you leap up and extend your leg, thrusting your own foot deep into hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon landing, you look at Celebi, eager to see her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that a wide-open-mouth smile had brightened up her face, while her paws collide together repeatedly. She's <i>clapping</i> her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, she appreciated that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like that?\" the legendary nods with excitement.<br>\r\n\"You want me to do it again?\" again,  the up-down movements of her head answer your question.<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you start doing it over and over, hitting her foot with flying kicks until your breath is cut short, to the point you have to stop in order to catch it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again, you lean against Celebi's foot, and your lungs experience being filled with grass-scented air as you keep inhaling and exhaling, trying to regain your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even care about the scent anymore, having now spent hours with the grass type's feet.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It takes a while for your request to fully sink in. Then, you can see her visibly struggle to come up with a proper response for your repeated plea. She obviously doesn't want to lose her new toy yet, but she also appreciates how you willingly went along with her games despite the rocky start, and wants to reward you for that in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conclusion to her dilemma announces itself by an exasperated sigh escaping from her lips, and she starts to focus her psychic abilities again. You feel a strange power encompassing you, coaxing your body to swell and grow. Her dainty feet start to lose their intimidating size as the first milestone - her knees - slowly inch towards eye level. It's not long before your growth leaves those behind too, as you expand further towards her waist. Then her shoulders. Then even further beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's doing it! She's really doing it! You started to doubt she ever would, but she's actually growing you back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the supernatural glow disappear from your eyes when you can look directly into them without having to crane your neck upwards, and your growth spurt fizzles to a stop. She confirms that this is the new size she's decided to give you with a happy <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Bi\"</span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there unmoving for a while, looking deep into the fairy's eyes for any sign of trickery. It doesn't take long before you're unable to hold back your emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU CELEBI!!\" You cry out loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, standing eye to eye with the fairy is still a long way from regaining your original size, but after being forced to look at the world through a bug's eye view, getting stepped on, getting toyed with, feeling like the smallest twitch from her could erase you from existence...Every inch gained is precious to you. And the increase in your size also brings back new hope. That she regards you as more than just a toy to use and abuse however she sees fit, that she might actually fully restore you. That you might just walk out of here in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly grab her into a tight and heartfelt hug to thank her. Celebi, clearly not expecting the physical assault, sends you flying back with a powerful psychic blow. Only after you've painfully landed \u2013 first slamming against a tree before falling to the ground - does she realize that you weren't trying to hurt her, and a slight blush creeps to her cheeks in embarrassment as she regards your crumpled form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying flat on your back like this, you can see the sun is starting to set, your view of the sky this time unobstructed by any giant Celebi pads. Damn. You'd have hoped to at least come within seeing distance of the next town by the end of the day. Your experience with Celebi had made you lose complete track of time. You need to set up camp soon, before you lose the sunlight completely. You can also feel your stomach start to nag at you, demanding a proper meal after being forced to process the fairy's foot funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking towards where your backpack fell by the roadside. You don't fancy your chances to get the tent set up at your current size, but hope your sleeping bag will at least offer some protection from the night's chill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looks alarmed as she sees you walk past her and quickly flutters in front of you, spreading out her arms in an effort to stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Celebi, I'm just getting some things from my bag. I'm not going anywhere\". You assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy reluctantly lets you pass, but you can feel she's keeping a close eye on you. You don't doubt that should you try anything funny, she'll put you right back under her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou halt in front of your backpack. You don't remember taking it off. You must've dropped it during your collision with Celebi. Or she removed it when you were out cold, thinking it'd get in the way during her playtime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, it's still completely normal-sized, leaving it slightly taller than you. Your sleeping bag sits on top of it, rolled up tight and tied firmly to the rest of your pack. You quickly untie the bag from your pack, having to put in much more effort due to your smaller size, and gravity quickly pulls it down to the ground. It rolls away from you slightly, coming to a stop between you and the grass pokemon watching you with curiosity. You quickly dive in your pack and return with your prize: a small pot, two packs of instant soup, a bottle of water and some matches. You manage to drag them all over towards Celebi with some difficulty, feeling quite proud of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"Bi?\"</span> she asks, unsure what to make of your collection of items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's dinner\" You confidently reply. \"Not the best admittedly, but it'll do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks unconvinced, and starts gently chewing on a corner of one of your soup packs. You can barely choke back a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still need to prepare it before we can eat.\" You try to explain as she spits out the plastic. \"But I want to get the sleeping bag unrolled first. Come on, give me a hand\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's unsure if she likes having you boss her around like this. She decides to let it slide since you brought out so many exciting new things for her to play with. Besides, she can always easily put you back in your place if you try to take it too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you begin your preparations for the evening, with the legendary pokemon following shortly after. You manage to prepare the sleeping bag, having to unroll it by pushing it around like a hay bale. You also gather some firewood and stones to perch your pot on, and filled it with water. Celebi even seems impressed  as she sees you strike a match to light your small campfire. You dump in your powdered soup and start stirring it around, Taking small breaks to check on the fire, to make sure it doesn't peter out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it doesn't take long for the fairy to get bored again. While you're busy feeding the flames some more wood, you hear a loud splash. When you look back up to investigate you find her casually lowering her left foot into your dinner, it's right counterpart already submerged in the thick liquid. She seems to enjoy her improvised foot bath, happily gliding both feet through the hot soup and gently kicking at the floating pieces of vegetable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Celebi, we're supposed to eat that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe innocently giggles at your frustration, and playfully raises one of her feet out of the soup and offers it to you. She calmly waves it in front of your face, trying to encourage you to dig in. You watch as thin rivers of soup gently flow down her arch, following the wrinkles and folds of her sole, before converging on her heel and softly dripping back into the pot. The rich scent of the liquid gets your mouth watering even though the other, less appetizing, but by now very familiar smell of the grass type's feet is also clearly present in the aroma now tickling your nose. Your stomach loudly approves the vicinity of something edible, and you start to lean slowly towards the offering without even realizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi seems to be have fun causing your visible discomfort, and decides to pile it on even more. She slowly and exaggeratedly opens her own mouth as she lets her foot approach your face, like she's trying to coax a baby into eating its porridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"Biiiii...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt connects and, feeling her foot softly prod against your lips, you hesitantly lick up the traces of soup it leaves behind. Do you even risk your new size by protesting Celebi's wishes? The empty pit in your stomach does its best to convince you to stop caring. You probably shouldn't even try to get out of lapping your first serving off her sole like she wants. But, after showing your willingness to keep playing along with her even at your larger size, maybe you'll be able to convince her to drop the foot stuff. For today at least. She must be hungry as well, and she can't really eat any of the soup while she's bathing in it. Maybe you can get her to stop relaxing her feet in the dinner you prepared by inviting her to eat it together with you?</span></div></div>",

She's clearly enjoying this - as she enjoyed every other 'game' she put you through - but you decide that you have to convince her to stop, for the night at least. Your stomach is getting noisier as it claims its daily meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you keep licking the grass type's foot for about five minutes, before stopping, having cleaned it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" she exclaims with a giggle, raising her other foot from the soup. As expected, drops of the liquid fall off her foot, splashing right back down into the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you look at Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully choose your words, in order to avoid being shrunk again. Being Celebi's playmate is far better than being her toy, and you intend keeping the situation like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Celebi, I'm getting really hungry. And tired. Why don't we just take a break? Just for tonight?\" you suggest. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?</span>\" the grass type asks, lowering her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go on.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why don't we stop for a while, so we can eat our (my) dinner? I mean, I did play with you all day, right?...Aren't you hungry too?\" you ask, noticing her dejected look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden growl of her stomach answers your question. She looks at you with a bit of a blush on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\" she says with a nod. You smile. You did it, she's willing to take a break from her 'games'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... could you stop... 'bathing', so we can eat?\" you ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Celebi is hesitant. The sensation of the warm liquid is pleasing her feet very much. But she also would like to eat something right now. And again, you willingly played with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she decides, she can take a break... for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she floats upwards, removing her feet from the soup. Its aroma tickles your nose, it makes your mouth water, it makes your stomach growl in hunger once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you hastily get to your bag, digging into it, just to emerge from it with a spoon. Even though the soup was used for a foot bath, you still intend to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, apparently, Celebi does as well. Turning around, you find the fairy dunking her whole face into the pot, hungrily sipping your well desired meal.<br>\r\n\"Come on Celebi, I want to eat that as well!\" you call out for the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, she lifts her head from the pot, soup dripping from her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" she cries happily, obviously liking it. You sigh, walking toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a bit to convince the fairy to let you eat as well, but you can finally take a spoonful of soup. Your stomach growls in hunger once again as you can finally sip the warm liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long before the pot is emptied from all the soup.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" Celebi cries again, licking her lips.<br>\r\n\"You did like it, I guess...\" you remark, taking a small sip of water from your bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass type nods at you with a beaming smile. You laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you give a yawn, meaning that you're stuffed, ready to call it a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you notice something touching you. Turning your head, you see Celebi poking you with a paw. Seeing that she has your attention, she gives a smile and points to her feet again. She's clearly eager to resume her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Celebi, can't we play tomorrow?\" you ask pleadingly, hiding an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biiiiii...</span>\" she whines.<br>\r\n\"Please... I'm very tired, I want to sleep...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you expect her eyes to glow azure once again, shrinking you down again, just to be successively put under her foot once again. The seconds of tension that precede the time traveler's answer feel like an oppressive weight on your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, contraire to what you expected, the grass type just sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\" she says, giving you a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at her.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Celebi.\" you say, leaning to grab her in a hug. At least, she doesn't send you flying with her psychic powers this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you break the hug and walk towards your sleeping bag. Yet again, Celebi keeps a close eye on you. Not that you have any intention to leave anyway. You have to regain your size first. And something tells you that it'll take some time for that to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning again, you reach your unrolled sleeping bag and slip into it. Because of your new size, it's much bigger, and you have no problems in sliding inside completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl up, getting ready to sleep. Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" you hear Celebi's alarmed cry. And, before you can process what happened, you feel something hitting the sleeping bag from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek out, finding the grass type pounding it. She must think of your sleeping bag as some monster that swallowed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi!\" you call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agitated legendary stops for a moment, turning her head to you. And, upon seeing your head sticking from the bag, she quickly floats over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice her eyes glowing blue as she tries to pull you out with psychic.<br>\r\n\"Celebi, calm down! It's just a sleeping bag, I need it to sleep!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass type seems to calm down upon hearing your words. Though she still looks reluctant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she pokes the sleeping bag with a paw, only to immediately retract it.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?</span>\" she says, poking it again, repeatedly, before deciding it's harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you crawl right back inside, curling up once again. But you're once again disturbed as you feel the sleeping bag moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you notice Celebi trying to get inside as well.<br>\r\n\"Celebi? What are you doing?\" you ask, more tired than curious about her action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to your question, she points to you.<br>\r\n\"You want to sleep in my sleeping bag?\" you ask, starting to blush. She manages to get fully inside and nods. Your size, along with hers, is enough to occupy the bag completely.<br>\r\n\"But... you know, it was made for one...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looks at you for a moment, processing what you said, before giving a smile.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You realize what's coming when you see her eyes shimmer with power again. Desperate to avoid another loss in size, you try to struggle out of the sleeping bag. Frantically attempting to get away from the psychic pokemon. Unfortunately the bag fits pretty snugly around the two of you at your current size, and you accomplish little beside some futile wiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do eventually manage to get free, and quickly stumble to your feet to start running. Three steps is all you manage before your escape is cut short by the fingers of a now gigantic paw wrapping around your torso. Your feet lift off the ground with a gentle tug, and you find yourself being slowly pulled closer back to your now giant bedroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fearfully look back at the now giant cloth cavern. You know what's hiding in the darkness beyond its opening. She must be planning to stuff you inside, to give her feet some company during the night. Give them a toy to idly play with while she's free to dream up new ways of tormenting you the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... No, Celebi. You can have the sleeping bag, I'll go find some soft patch of dirt to sleep on. Please just let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weakly squirm in her grip, trying your best to get loose. Both your pleas and your struggling are for naught and you get carried past the entrance of the padded tunnel. The light pouring in allows you to watch your dreaded nemeses fidgeting further below, eagerly awaiting your arrival. The warm air bellowing upwards from the depths of the padded sack greets you with their natural scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise however, your descent is halted before you come even close to reaching them. Your back presses firmly into a soft, warm wall and the fingers keeping you captive relax, though still cover most of your body. You experimentally push against them. You find you can lift them away, with some difficulty,  making it clear she's not trying to resist your efforts to free yourself. Your efforts do coax a confused <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Bi?\"</span> from your captor. Looking upwards, you see she's lifted the padded ceiling and regards you questioningly. Obviously trying to figure out what you were attempting. Feeling safer with the threat of nightly foot fun no longer looming over you, you hesitantly assure her: \"Oh err... Nothing. I thought umm.. You startled me is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly content with the explanation, she offers a reassuring smile and lowers her other hand back onto her chest, slowly guiding the cloth blanket back onto you. You slowly sigh to yourself. You guess you don't mind playing her teddy bear for the night, but you wish she'd at least given you some warning before shrinking you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fairy actually makes a comfortable bed, you find. The softness and warmth of her body are surprisingly cozy, and the beat of her heart might as well be a sweet lullaby that slowly carries you off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groggily wake up, before shooting wide awake with a panic. Everything is huge! You start struggling to get out of the oppressive cave your bedroll has become, before you remember the events of the day before and calm down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, you don't see the jolly green giantess anymore. She couldn't have left you like this, could she? Panic starts to return when an odd sound catches your attention. A soft, oddly familiar sounding, muffled humming, punctuated by many other sounds you don't immediately recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to carefully make your way to source of the noise, and find the titanic grass type rooting through the rest of your bag. It looks like she shrunk it too, allowing her easier access, and has buried herself inside from the waist up. Periodically, you watch something fly out, evidently having failed to catch her attention for more than a few seconds. The ground is littered with pots, pants, cups, snacks, papers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi\" You try, hoping to stop her from burrowing through your stuff any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're too late to dodge a shirt heading straight towards you. Any complaints you try to make quickly get silenced underneath the oversized cloth. It takes a while before you manage to walk out of one of the sleeves towards freedom, just in time to see your camera sail through the air and, luckily, find a safe landing on top of the sleeping bag you occupied a couple of minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CELEBI!\" You shout at the top of your lungs this time, not wanting to take any more chances with the rest of your more sensitive belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you've managed to catch her attention and she slowly emerges from the depths of your bag. Her eyes quickly find your shrunken form on the ground, and she happily makes her way over to you. You see her pull one last item from your backpack, absentmindedly carrying it along for the short trip towards you. Only when her towering form comes to a halt in front of you, do you get a good look at what she's brought over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go white as a sheet as you realize it's...</span></div></div>",

Most probably, she's eager to start playing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour theory is confirmed as you see her other paw, the one holding the socks, inching closer to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?</span>\" the legendary asks you. Somehow, you understand the meaning of her words, \u2018Ready to play?\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, noticing the giantess staring right back at you, that familiar smirk of hers present on her face. That can't mean anything good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi... please... I just woke up...\" you try to dissuade the giantess from starting playing. Your brain refuses to imagine yourself being trapped in between her scented foot and the fabric. That would be the worst situation you get in since you met Celebi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the mischievous legendary just closes her eyes, and shrugs, before moving you to the entrance of your sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting that she won't need both, she the other one, before giving you a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biiii~</span>\" she sings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her one last, pleading look.<br>\r\n\"Ce-\" before you can talk, she drops you into the white tunnel.

Even though Celebi never used one, she seems to know how to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it doesn't take long for her foot to reach the bottom - and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer paw slides right into you, pinning you in between itself and the plush surface of the sock.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" comes the muffled, happy cry of the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving fulfilled her first objective, Celebi stands back up.

Celebi's done nothing much besides just stand on you so far and, while the weight of the time traveling pokemon does force you deep into the thick fabric of your sock, your new fuzzy home provides enough padding to make this bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis changes as you suddenly find your world lurching upwards, before heavily crashing back down to the ground. When crash back onto the ground, the oppressive mass onto of you doesn't seem to stop. Instead, it presses further into you, untill you can feel the solid earth through the thick fabric behind you. The sole in front seems to mold over your trapped form. Your body groans as the air is forced out of your lungs. You try to scream at Celebi that this is too much, that she's hurting you, but your mouth is invaded by her foot flesh the second you open it. Any protest is smothered to a whisper before it even leaves you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as you thought you were going to pop, the weight leaves you again. It returns shortly after as Celebi takes another step. And then another. This repeats again and again. Every step brings you to the brink of passing out before relenting. You try to squirm to the side of the sole, somewhere you hope to find some shelter from this torment, but the sock is pulled to tight to make any progress. You're utterly at her mercy, forced to bend even your breathing to the rhythm of her casual walk. The foot rises \u2013 you breathe in as deep as you can, even though it means filling your lungs with the scent of her feet. The foot falls \u2013 you exhale, and silently brace for impact. The foot lands \u2013 you grit your teeth and bear through it, ignoring the feeling of having the sweat and dirt of her soles rub off against you. Trying to remain conscious. Rinse and repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Celebi decides to spice things up a bit. Balancing on the ball of her socked foot, she giddily twirls before walking on. You're honestly baffled you didn't get smeared right then and there. Your diminished size must have made you more sturdy than normal. Still, that spin of hers completely destroyed the last of the feeble resistance you managed to put up. Your battered and bruised body now just lies limply against the bottom of the sock, as the sole of her foot continues slamming into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must look so innocent, you sourly realize. Wearing a single sock, happily dancing and twirling through the forest. Nobody would even dare to imagine the torment she's putting you through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how long you've been trapped in there. You probably passed out a couple of times during the ordeal. Still, to your great relief, she eventually slows down her little dance.  You almost cry in happiness as you hear her sit down, followed by the welcome sound of her fidgeting with the thick cloth of your sock. She's getting you out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you also quickly discover:</span></div></div>",

You're also pretty sure that your nose is bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you really expected her foot exiting the sock, finally letting you breath. But, weirdly, you seem to be moving forward as well.

Plus, you discover, you were right. Your nose is bleeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly feels sorry. She was just having some fun, she didn't wish you any harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough, groan and look upwards, into the giantess' eyes.<br>\r\n\"Happy... now?\" you say with a hint of defiance in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the grass type slowly moving her paw downwards, carefully and gently deposing you on the grassy floor. Then, she stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay still, and close your eyes, expecting her to rise her foot, only to slam it on you one last time, leaving a red stain on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it never happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you feel something gently sliding on your chest. You open your eyes a little, discover Celebi with her paw on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biiii.</span>\" she says, focusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whitish green light suddenly surrounds your small form. It actually feels... nice. Like your pain is being relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly rise your head, and watch as the bruises disappear from your body. Your nose stops bleeding. Celebi is healing you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing goes on for a few minutes, before Celebi removes her paw from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can act, she gently picks you, and sits back down, while closing you in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden display of affection makes you blush.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\" you hear her say.

Reluctantly - very, very reluctantly - you push your tongue on the green surface of her foot, starting to lick it clean once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fairy lets out a pleased sigh a she feels your tongue making contact with the surface of her scented foot. She literally <i>loves</i> having you service her feet. It makes her feel... powerful. She could end your existence in a single movement of her foot, and she knows it. She can do whatever she wants with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she won't miss rewarding you for being an obedient toy later on.

The concept of personal space must be foreign to pokemon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inches slightly closer to you, trying to find a more comfortable position. She looks remarkably innocent like this. Slightly cute even, with her eyes gently closed and her mouth slightly hanging open, a small drop of drool collecting in the corner of her mouth as she slowly drifts off to sleep. A far cry from the towering giant able to crush you with a single step you saw her as earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly relax as well. As tempting as it is to enjoy this quiet time as long as you can, you're certain you'll need the sleep for whatever she's got planned tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsciousness slowly returns to your sleeping form, and you bury your face deeper into your pillow. Not willing to leave the comfortable embrace of sleep quite yet. The stale, warm air surrounding you has just started to tug you back into dreamland when realization starts to slowly seep into the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPillow? You swear you didn't bring any, though the softness you're nuzzling into begs to differ. Stale Air? But you're sleeping outside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly open a single eye, trying to make sense of this. You realize must've burrowed deeper into the sleeping bag during your rest, as you can feel its warmth embrace you from all sides. Only a bit of light pours in through the opening ahead, but you can still see the prone form of the Celebi you encountered yesterday laying just before you. Looking down you discover your pillow, barely being able to discern the wide soles of two very familiar feet in the darkness. Their plush surface must have lovingly supported your sleeping head throughout the night. You silently curse yourself. How do you keep ending up in these situations? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the feet rises up and slowly starts rubbing along your cheek, like it senses your distress and wishes to comfort you. Or it misses the warmth your face provided throughout the night, and is now attempting to reclaim it..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tiredly gaze up at the green fairy, expecting her to be looking back with that familiar smirk of hers, eager to start another day of playtime. Instead she still looks fast asleep, the foot having either developed a mind of its own or being urged onward by her dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wonder what she's dreaming about. Maybe it's about you, and she's happily tormenting your dream-self underneath her feet again. Maybe he's even eagerly playing along? Enthusiastically serving and worshiping them without her even having to ask. You quickly decide you don't really care. While she's preoccupied in her dreams, you're free from her games and psychic encouragement to participate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove your face from her affectionate foot and shift towards the side of the cloth cave, trying to catch some more sleep. It's not long before the playful foot returns however. This time gently rubbing against your forehead, before trailing down your nose and nestling itself against your mouth. Its tip gently flicks at your bottom lip before retreating and resting on top of your head. You faintly taste something on your lips. Salty and... Tomato? Right. She never did wash them properly before going to sleep, did she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to take another glance towards the grass type, She's either really good at faking it, or she's still soundly asleep. You see her roll over and, before you know it, her second foot joins the first in its fun. It slides over your hair and slowly pats against your cheek and chin. You realize your face is feeling slightly moist wherever the pair passes. They must've started to sweat, confined in depths of the stuffy sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dejectedly accept you're not getting any more rest, the feet frolicking over your face sure to stop any attempt. The next best thing would be to climb out of the confined space into fresh air to get a few moments of peace and quiet before Celebi wakes up. But, looking at the distant opening of your sleeping bag, you realize getting out might be harder than you had hoped. Now that you're not sleeping side by side anymore, the dreaming pokemon has eagerly abused her newfound freedom and laid claim to as much space as she could. You're not sure if you can shimmy past without bumping into her and accidentally waking her up. You're unsure how fast she sleeps and how her morning temper is, and you're not sure you want to find out either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, the only other option is staying put, effectively volunteering your face as a toy for her feet until she wakes up on her own terms. An offer you're sure the playful pair currently exploring said face would be all too eager to abuse. Further, you also doubt you'll like her reaction when she wakes up and finds that you've already willingly submerged yourself beneath her feet. It's bound to make Celebi ecstatic though, so maybe it will be worth it in the long run?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

Then, you rise your head, to see if the fairy woke up in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she didn't. You see her letting out a light moan, but her black eyelids remain sealed, meaning that she's still fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Good</i>\u2019 you think to yourself as you mentally prepare to accomplish your second goal: getting out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs slowly and carefully as you can, you start crawling forward, in direction of the opening, but also towards the green, living barrier that lays in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing lowly, you start crawling through the right space between her and one of the walls of the sleeping bag, your body making contact with hers.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biii...</span>\" you hear the fairy moaning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou halt, holding your breath, fearing that even the slightest noise would call the fairy back to reality. You definitely prefer her asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start crawling again but, just as you're side by side with Celebi again, the fairy rolls on her side, her long arms wrapping around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat as you wait for either her to wake up and finds herself like this or she lets go of you so you can resume your task and get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds pass, minutes even, but the fairy gives no sign of wanting to wake up or get off you. You feel her warm breath being blown in your face as she snores softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel something poking your lower body and, looking down, you discover that it's her feet again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the two gently rubs itself on your midsection, while the other insistently (and less gently) pokes your belly. It's almost like they missed your face, and they're pleading you to get back inside to 'play'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch them rub themselves around your lower body, when the fairy suddenly moves hers upwards, both legs rising themselves and almost kicking you in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, showing an incredible flexibility, the fairy lays both her feet on your chest, while her arms are still wrapped around your neck. And, from this shorter distance, the grassy smell of her scented feet starts to travel up to your nose, making its way inside your nostrils. Even when you got pretty used to it, it still is annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again...\" you mutter to yourself as you opt for a hasty decision. You carefully grab Celebi by her sides, and gently try to push her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fairy has a solid grasp around your neck, and plus, she has no intention of letting go.<br>\r\n\"Come on Celebi, get off!\" you cry as you finally manage to wrest the fairy off you and laying her as far from you as you can - which is a really short distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of this newfound freedom, you once again starting crawling and, with no living barrier getting in the way anymore, you soon reach the opening of the padded sack and crawl out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since you're awake, you manage to breath in fresh air. Pure, fresh, wonderful fresh air, that isn't the stuffy one present in the sleeping bag, nor the scented one emanated from the feet of your 'captress'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you fully get out, you get away from the sleeping bag. Not that you want to run away though. You need your original size back first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, for now, you just need to put a good distance between you and the green fairy, who is still sleeping soundly inside of your sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you go sit down in front of a tree, leaning with your back against the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you remain perfectly still, doing nothing but inhaling the morning air to counter the smell of Celebi's feet that is still very present in your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you notice something moving inside your sleeping bag. And you hear a loud cry:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biiii!</span>\" you assume the the fairy just yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you get up and walk towards the bag, deciding to check if the fairy woke up. You figure out that if she finds you too far from her, she'll assume that you wanted to flee, and she'll simply shrink you down to size as a punishment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at the thought, and halt in front of the sleeping bag, looking into the opening to see...</span></div></div>",

You walk around a bit to shake the stiffness from your limbs while greedily gulping down the clean forest air. Your enjoyment of the fresh air is short lived, as the familiar odor of the grass-type's soft soles quickly floods your nose again. Confused, you try again. But despite your best efforts to replace the scent of the fairy's feet with the smell of fresh pine, you can't seem to get rid of it. You must have slept on the pok\u00e9mon's soles longer than you thought, filling your lungs with their fragrance for hours on end. Now happily nestled within you, it looks like you'll get to keep enjoying their aroma every time you exhale. At least for a while, until it clears out of your system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly look around to shift your mind to something else, away from the idea that her feet managed to ingrain themselves into you in some way. Your gaze stops on Celebi herself, still happily dreaming. Although... she seems more restless than you remember. Her closed eyes are clearly frowning, and you can see her fists clench tightly into the fabric of the sleeping bag. You briefly worry that something might be wrong with her, but then a movement from within the bedroll catches your attention. Something's frantically moving around in there. For a second, you believe some kind of insect pok\u00e9mon became trapped in there, before you realize the more likely explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's her feet looking for their newest little toy - you. You can't be certain how your face's presence against her soles influenced her dreams, but it's clear its sudden absence is now also having an effect. Seeing the sleeping pok\u00e9mon in distress like this, you actually feel a bit sorry for her. She obviously isn't trying to purposefully hurt you, you're certain you'd know pretty quickly if she was. And yes, while definitely not pleasant, the feeling of her feet pushing and prodding at you isn't the worst you've ever experienced. This is all just a great big game to her, and you just took her fun away. Maybe you should just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. You quickly shake your head, trying to physically force that train of thought out of your mind. You're not even sure where that came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back down at the grass-type it's clear that, despite her restless fidgeting, she'll be sleeping for a good while longer. You could do with some more shut-eye of yourself. Though, unwilling to venture back into the bedroll and put yourself at the mercy of her feet once again, you'll have to figure something else out. Maybe you could drag over a spare shirt from your bag to double as a mattress and blanket. Ofcourse, if she wakes up before you, you'll probably be waking up to a face-full of fairy feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you can ignore your lingering drowsiness and start preparing breakfast. The smell will probably wake her up faster, but maybe a decent meal will put her in a good enough mood to keep her games to a minimum.</span></div></div>",

Nor you want to miss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, yawning again, you make your way towards your bag, which is laying near the bedroll where a certain time traveler is sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden thought makes you stop your walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you make too much noise, the fairy will wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the noise wakes the fairy up, and she finds you - her toy - nowhere in sight, she could be annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the fairy is annoyed, she'll shrink you down and use you as a foot-toy again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood momentarily leaves your face at the perspective. As a result, you go pale as death itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite certainly, you don't wish to be used as a foot-toy again, forced to worship and lick the feet of that mischievous legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, again, your lack of sleep manifests itself in yet another, deep yawn finding its way out of your mouth. <br>\r\n\"I'll make sure that I don't make too much noise.\" you drowsily mumble to yourself as you walk up to your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag is still bigger than you, meaning that it would be impossible for you to reach inside of it without having to push it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you quickly discard the idea. That would surely make noise. So, you put your drowsy brain to work. And, soon, you get an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you get a hold of the bag and, not without difficulty, you drag it to a nearby, fallen log. You push the bag against it, before climbing on the log. This position grants you easy access to your bag, and you quickly dig yourself into it, only to emerge from it with one of your spare shirts, which is currently at least twice your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place it down on the log next to you, before digging into the bag again, this time grabbing a hold of a bag of cotton wool you had brought along with you, in case you got injured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the bag is wedged between something. You pull harder, and you luckily manage to pull it out without making the slightest noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in relief, you grab the objects to improvise a decent bed and you leap off the log, starting to walking to your previous spot, as far as possible from your sleeping bag, near some random tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as you walk, your bag happens to fall down, producing a non-indifferent noise because of the pots that are inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou abruptly halt, and bite your lower lip, fearing that the noise might have woken Celebi up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat'd be really bad for your intentions of getting a few more moments of shut-eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost mechanically, you glance back at your bedroll. And your blood almost freezes as you see the fairy yawning:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biiiiii!</span>\" for a moment, you watch as she rolls in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, much to your relief, those black eyelids of hers don't part like you expected, remaining sealed instead. Only then you dare to breath again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, once you made sure that the fairy is still fast asleep, you gently place the shirt on the ground and lay down on it. It's large enough to even wrap it around yourself like a blanket. Then, you proceed to place the cotton wool beneath your head. It's nothing near your sleeping bag, but at least you won't be sleeping on the grass. Better than nothing, you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and, relieved to have at least a short break from Celebi's feet being anywhere on your body, you relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also take notice that the persistent smell of the time traveler's feet is finally starting to find its way out from your poor lungs, fresh air emanated from the trees starting to replace the scented one that bothered you for... you don't even know how much time you spent with her feet already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, your drowsiness sweetly claims your consciousness as you fall asleep again...</span></div></div>",

It feels malleable through your improvised blanket, and slightly warm. You try to ignore the feeling and return back to sleep's welcome embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, the weight seems to be gradually increasing. Not too long after it's joined by a twin, this one covering most of your belly and chest. A muffled giggle appears from somewhere above, and the weight on your chest also starts to grow. Recognizing you won't be able to catch sleep again under the mysterious assault, you groggily open your eyes to find the cause of your interrupted nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou easily spot the culprit. Celebi is standing on top of your prone body. Her back foot is on your legs, while the other one rests on top of your chest. She seems to be trying her hardest to stop herself from bursting out laughing while stepping on you. A confused grunt from you catches her attention, and she gleefully smiles down at you. Slowly and deliberately, she raises her back foot off your legs and guides it to hover over your face. You see its bottom is once again covered in crushed grass and dirt. She flashes you one last cocky grin before planting it firmly on top of your face, smothering it in the soft warmth of her big, green sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before its weight starts to increase again, and you realize you should probably get her off. You try to do so, but you've barely lifted your arms before the foot leaves you of its own accord to join its mistress above you. You crane your neck up to see what she's doing and find that, having run out of you to walk on, the time-traveler spins around and takes a seat just above your head, planting both feet on either side of your it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm... Good morning Celebi\". You try, deciding not to question her morning walk on top of you for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bii</span>\", the pokemon happily responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi Bi Biii Bi?</span>\", she tries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your confused expression, she tries again. This time pointing to you, then herself and then your empty bedroll. Then to you again, and finally to your improvised bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you want to know why I got out of the sleeping bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" She happily nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I...-\" You trail off, feeling an odd sensation against your cheek. A sideways glance reveals that it's her foot, lovingly caressing you as Celebi listens patiently to your explanation. The feeling of her sole rubbing along your cheek reminds you of her feet's nightly excursion over your face. You look up at her alarmed. Does she know? It doesn't look like it, she's just waiting for you to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...\" you try again, stammering this time. Her foot's affectionate display towards your face keeps your mind drifting back to the gentle nudges and strokes it received from them during the night. You can't let her know what happened. \"Y-You see, us being stuck together like that, I couldn't really get comfortable. You seemed fast asleep already, so I snuck out and made a bed of my own to sleep in\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looks at you questioningly. She clearly picked up on your change in demeanor. You see her eyes closing, as she ponders your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, you realize. Celebi is a psychic type. She couldn't be trying to read your mind, could she? You try to calm yourself down a little. If Celebi could read minds, you're certain it'd be something more widely known. Then again, you haven't heard any stories of Celebi shrinking people down either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously wait for a reaction from the green pokemon.</span></div></div>",

Celebi shakes her head almost frenetically, and points at her foot with more energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. I don't know about you, but I, uh, need something in my stomach before... 'playing',\" you remark. As if wanting to help you, your stomach growls in this precise moment, asking to be filled with the first one of its daily meals.<br>\r\n\"Hear that?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's smirk drops, but nonetheless she lowers her foot down as she nods her head in an understanding manner. Soon enough, you hear her stomach growling as well, suggesting the reason of why she's letting your refusal slide so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\" you unnecessarily ask with a smirk as you make your way to your bag, which is still laying on the ground in front of the fallen log where you left it when you got asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emerge from your bag holding a bottle of moomoo milk, a few Lava Cookies and a sitrus berry. You remember Celebi using your soup as a foot bath yesterday evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you wonder if she could do the same with your milk, before deciding that it's a stupid idea. There is  difference between a pot and a bottle after all, her feet would luckily never fit in the second one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat on the log, the green fairy sitting next to you.<br>\r\n\"Here, try one of these,\" you mutter as you hand her a Lava Cookie, before biting in your own meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the fairy hesitantly bites her cookie, before deciding that it's not only edible, but delicious! You choke back a laugh and watch as she devours the whole cookie in two bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take one last sip of milk, before letting out a satisfied sigh, meaning that you're full. And, judging from the pleased look on her face, Celebi is as well. Which is a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pleased Celebi means a reduced chance of being shrunk and used as a foot toy from her today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in your own thoughts, you don't even feel a green paw belonging to a certain time traveler poking you repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" this cry effectively stops your train of thought. That and the green fairy's paw making contact with your side, hitting you with a somewhat painful blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" you cry as you look at her with annoyance, silently asking the reason of why she just hit you. In response, the fairy smirks that familiar smirk of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe annoyance fades from your face as you recognize that expectant look, the same one she uses whenever Celebi wants to play...</span></div></div>",

Seeing that you've decided to obey, the fairy's frown is quickly replaced by a wide smile as she plops her but down onto the ground and eagerly presents her green soles to you once more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHaving resigned yourself to the task at hand, you gently lift up her left foot and place it into your lap. You look over to Celebi, expecting her to show you exactly what she wants you to do. Instead, you see that the fairy has laid flat on her back, eyes closed. Her foot starts tapping against your stomach, encouraging you to get started. It seems like she's content to let you decide what to do this time.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUncertain, you reach over to your blanket/shirt. You'd already seen an up close view how her soles were once again littered with bits of plants, pebbles and sand, and decided to remedy that first. Using the shirt like an ordinary rag, you swipe away the larger bits of debris clinging to her foot before putting more effort in rubbing away the more stubborn smudges of dirt off her sole. Once you manage to get the foot clean, you give decide to give it a massage. You place one hand right next to her heel, the other underneath the ball of her foot, before pressing your thumbs deep into her malleable skin. It's evident you're doing something right, as Celebi starts softly murmuring in approval, pushing her foot deeper into your caring hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job is made much easier this time by your increased size, and soon you find yourself kneading at parts of the sole you swear you'd already tended too. You're uncertain how to continue. While Celebi clearly doesn't mind, you don't want to spend the entire day tending to her feet. However, you also don't want to risk annoying her by stopping too soon. You look over to her face again, hoping for a signal to allow you to start on lefty's twin, but the relaxed pokemon hasn't opened her eyes since you started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to think of another way to cut the massage short without raising her ire, you slowly raise her foot until it's level with your head, and gently bring it closer to your face. You feel the ball of her foot bump against your forehead and stop, hesitant to proceed. You can see the small wrinkles covering her sole, feel the  faint smell of grass fill your nose once again. The top of her foot lovingly strokes your hair, seemingly sensing what is about to happen and urging you to continue, eager to feel your lips against its fragrant skin. Closing your eyes, you push past your doubts and  press your lips into the warm sole covering your face. you feel the muscles underneath tense and shift, as if trying to return the gesture. Before you can even wonder how long you should hold the kiss, the decision is made for you. The foot slowly lowers of its own accord to reveal a pair of big, blue eyes staring right at you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTime seems to stand still as you look into each others eyes. But then, slowly but surely, an impossibly big smile starts to spread over Celebi's face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe smile, and the rest of her face, quickly get eclipsed by her right foot, still generously coated in the bits and pieces it picked up off the forest floor, which she now enthusiastically starts waving in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You curse yourself for encouraging her<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi! Bi Bi! Bi</span>!\", she happily squeels at you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Celebi, wait! Let me expl-mmmfff\", you start, before an invisible force pushes your head into the soft embrace of her foot. The rest of your protest is smothered into nothingness against the plush skin as you feel her damp sole mold to your face and flood your mouth with its taste. You desperately to get it off you, but Celebi's psychic prowess keeps her foot glued firmly to your face. Feeling your tongue brush over her sensitive sole during your frantic struggle only emboldens her further.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter you finally - with some difficulty - manage to pry the affectionate foot off your face, you collapse to the ground. You roll over onto your back to try and catch your breath. You only dare to look back at the fairy once you've recovered a bit, and see her glancing back sheepishly. A small blush appears on her cheeks as she realizes she went slightly overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's uh... let's forget that ever happened\", you hesitantly offer once you managed to get back to your feet. The fairy smugly grins at you, before quickly shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, could you at least lend a hand in packing up our camp?\", you continue dejectedly, \"I'd manage on my own at my normal size, but now that everything's more than twice as large...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi ponders for a moment, before stretching out her hands towards your things. You wonder what she's up too, but then you see you things slowly shrink down, until they're normal sized to you. You look back at the pokemon, but see she's already taken a seat at the foot of a nearby tree, motioning you to get started. You guess you can just be happy for the fact that she didn't try to continue any of her games...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning is already half past when you finally manage to pack everything back into your bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think i got everything\", you exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to go?\" you ask, as Celebi quickly flies up to you. She doesn't respond, instead taking great interest in the backpack perched on your shoulders. You're about to ask if something was wrong, when she flutters up directly above you. Soon after, you see two very familiar feet descend on either side of you as she takes a seat on top of your pack. Her heels kick lightly against your chest as you feel her paw tap against your scalp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\", she exclaims, giving you the command to march. You silently grit your teeth, more out of embarrassment at being used as a pack mule than out of difficulty to carry her, before setting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou make some good progress deeper into the forest, before...</span></div></div>",

Will you grow me back to normal?\" you ask again, not bothering to hide the hope in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought finds its way among the others in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Celebi grows you back to your original size... how will you manage to get rid of her? The best shot you've got would be running as fast as you can... you quickly discard the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wrong step, and Celebi would incapacitate you with her psychic powers, shrink you down to a microscopic size again and use you as a foot toy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething you don't want to experience again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your hopes are shattered, and a loud sigh escapes your mouth as you see Celebi turning around and shaking her head, responding to your previous question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" you mumble.<br>\r\n\"Let's get going then.\" you turn around, starting to walk again, not even letting the fairy hop on top of your bag again. Carrying her is the last thing you wish for right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you take the little amount of five steps before being forced to stop, a cyan energy surrounding you. Soon enough, Celebi enters your eyesight again as she flutters in front of you. Her half-lidded eyes tell you one thing: she's bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with a good chance, she wants to play again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you feign obliviousness, hoping that you're wrong about her intentions.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask as the psychic energy around you dies down, letting you move freely again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biii...</span>\" Celebi says, pointing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot at her feet like you expected, though. She's pointing to the ground, you notice.<br>\r\n\"Y-You... you want to stop...?\" you question. The fairy nods, before rising one of her legs, showing you the wide, green sole of her right foot. One of the fingers of her paw points at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, annoyed scream echoes from the depths of your mind.<br>\r\n\"You want to play again, don't you?\" you ask. Celebi nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Celebi, we're supposed to be getting out of the forest...\" you complain, hoping to make her give up on the idea of playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the fairy is stubborn.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" she exclaims, waving her paws back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff, knowing that she won't accept further complaining. You remove your bag from your shoulders and unceremoniously toss it aside on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's frown is replaced by a wide smile as she sits down, you doing the same. She pushes both her feet into your stomach, knocking the air out of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you inhale deeply to regain your breath, you try to figure out what should you do. You already massaged... worshipped the fairy's feet earlier, and it had disastrous results...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but you fear that if you're too monotonous with your work, she won't be too pleased...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your hesitation, and not feeling your touch on her feet, the grass type opened her eyes again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi? Bi!</span>\" she exclaims, first curious, then impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to do!\" you snap back, irritated. Only to immediately regret speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly smirk appears on the time traveler's face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi...</span>\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her bright blue eyes become even brighter as they glow azure...<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" you exclaim, startled, knowing what that glow is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall back on your rear and try to get away, but the psychic energy soon engulfs you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your horror, your surroundings start to grow bigger and bigger as you are yet again shrunk down to size by the green fairy, who watches with glee your size getting drained by her psychic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the shrinking comes to an end. And you find yourself staring up at a monolithic Celebi, whose eyes stop glowing as a smug smile takes place on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp down as you watch the now gigantic fairy getting up and hovering above you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi~ii!</span>\" the giantess laughs at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a frustrated cry.

That was no problem, she had plenty of ideas about what you could have done to her precious little feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, you could have... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi lost her grin for a second; in front of you, your nemeses touched the ground as the fairy landed, looking deep in thought. You saw the smelly twins fidgeting on the ground, probably preparing themselves for your \u2018performance\u2019, coating themselves in dirt which you latterly had to remove, either with your hands or, dreadfully, with your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celebi?\" you called out, trying to sound firm, but failing poorly. You've already been through this once, and it had been relatively harmless, but you still couldn't get used to the idea of being so tiny, helpless and, above all, powerless to stop the giant time-traveler from doing whatever she wanted with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid pokemon looked still deep in thought, probably coming up with new ways to use her feet to \u2018play\u2019 with you, which meant an endless torture until she declared herself satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Celebi, she still couldn't find anything that you hadn't already done to her grass-scented feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the giant fairy in front of you carelessly sat down, causing the ground beneath you to tremble while causing you to fall on your own butt as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat startled, but glad that you currently weren't under her butt, you looked back up at Celebi, discovering that she was staring down at you intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\" she said as her left paw rose, two of her fingers bending twice, before pointing to her foot as she beckoned you to get closer to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed resignedly, knowing that you had to obey if you wanted your size back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegrudgingly, you slowly walked up to her towering sole, which was familiarly covered in crushed grass and sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled at the thought that you were probably going to lick it clean again. Your stomach growled, protesting loudly at the disgusting meal that was being offered to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\" the owner of the foot drew your attention, causing you to look back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your delight, she was rubbing something invisible with her paw, before said paw pointed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted another simple foot-rub, you thought while silently thanking the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you placed both your hands on her sole and began rubbing off the dirt, which happily transferred from her foot to your palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned in disgust, while Celebi began moaning, pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the mind of the fairy kept working as she tried to find new ways to play with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a few involving your mouth came up,  and she smiled at the idea of you licking or maybe kissing her sole, but a new one made her discard the scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eager smirk crawled across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she had \u2018captured\u2019, she thought, you have been doing all the work. But now, it was going to be the exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't going to do anything, just stand still, while her feet had their way with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time-traveler smirked even more widely as she stared at you, who were still busily rubbing her foot, worried by the sudden lack of pleased moans escaping the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allowed herself to sigh contentedly as she watched you working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just had to finish this foot-rub. Then, you were going to \u2018relax\u2019, the fairy thought with a creepy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the dirt and grime were removed by Celebi's first foot, she obviously commanded you to get to its identical counterpart, which you reluctantly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swore that the second foot was in an even worse state than the first one was, being coated in even more dirt, but you just shook your head: it was probably your brain processing the still fresh memory of what you had to rub off from her first foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you worked to scrub off the dirt while not particularly enjoying the smell, you looked up at Celebi, at least to distract yourself from the humiliating task you were given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you slowed down your rubbing as you spotted her grinning down at you, predatory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon took notice that you were staring at her, and her from became even wider,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi? Bi.</span>\" she said, \u2018Are you done? Perfect\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't like that creepy grin of hers, but you really liked the moment when her paw rose in the air, her three fingers rose as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could only mean \u2018Stop\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in relief, you stepped back, watching the fairy as she grabbed her own foot and examined your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was acceptable, she thought, but the second one - she shot you a disappointed expression - was still covered in a thin layer of dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at that disappointed look she was giving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, you told me to stop!\" you justified yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat look lingered on the fairy's face for a couple seconds, before she allowed herself to smile and her paws to let go of her feet as she offered a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole being seemed to emit a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was shoved back down your throat as Celebi made her new idea clear to you.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, an encounter with a trainer much stronger than you left all of your Pokemon fainted, and you had no choice but to retreat out of the depths of the cave back to Dewford Town, where a Pokemon Center awaited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see rays of light ahead and knew the exit of the cave was just around the next bend. Before you could reach the turn, a wild female Mawile leapt out of the shadows! Normally, encountering a Pokemon with no usable Pokemon would be extremely bad, but considering the small size and weak natures of Mawiles, you felt confident this one was not going to harm you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you crouched down to shoo the Mawile away, you found that your confidence was misplaced. The Mawile rushed forward and delivered a shattering Sucker Punch to your face! You hit the ground instantly and found your conscious slipping away. The last thing you saw before you were knocked out was the Mawile jumping up and down on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reawakened, you found yourself in an isolated part of Granite Cave, sitting up against the cave's wall. The first thing you did was try to reach for your face to make sure nothing was broken, but you found you could not move your arms. Or your legs, for that matter. You looked down and saw your legs were bound in... Wurmple silk? You tried not to panic and assessed your surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few feet away, you noticed a Mawile, which you assumed is the same one that punched you. Now that you were able to get a better look at her, you noticed she looked very different than other Mawiles. She had a very curvy, feminine figure, complete with small lumps on her chest resembling breasts. Additionally, instead of her feet having two toes like all other Mawiles, both of her feet had a full set of five toes each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were examining her, she noticed you were awake, smirked, and began to slowly walk toward you. With every step she took, your heart rate raised and sweated more and more. After what she did to you earlier, the thought of being completely helpless against anything she may try to do to you filled you with dread and anxiety. She finally got right in front of you, and, shockingly, sat on your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she lifted up both of her feet to your face. You could see they were covered in filth, the blackish-brown dirt contrasting against her pure black feet. The next thing you noticed was the smell. Her feet positively reeked, and smelled worse than anything you could imagine at the moment. You couldn't help but gag, to her delight. The Mawile giggled and wiggled her toes. As her nasty toes wiggled, you could see mounds of dirt caked between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she did was press her filthy feet against her face. The spot on your jaw where she punched you stung as she pressed against it, but the pain wasn't unbearable, so you assume it thankfully wasn't broken. As the feet rubbed against your face, you could feel both the dirt and the stench smear into your skin, leaving your face as disgusting as the Mawile's feet. You had no idea why she was doing this, but you theorized that, by rubbing her scent onto you, she was marking you as her property to other Pokemon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of rubbing her feet on your face, she pulled her feet back, pointed her right foot toward you, wiggled her nasty toes, and began using them to prod at your mouth. After a few pokes, she began scowling and prodding more aggressively, obviously expecting you to open your mouth. You would never, ever, EVER wish to have her filthy foot anywhere near you, let alone in your mouth, but you fear that if you refuse, you'll be punished. After that Sucker Punch, you don't think you could possibly take any more pain this Mawile can dish out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You coughed and gagged on the rancid foot as the Mawile wiggled her toes inside your mouth gleefully. The foot tasted absolutely vile! The combination of dirt and sweat created a muddy mixture, and you were being forced to taste the salty results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mawile rhythmically pushed and pulled her foot, essentially throatfucking you with her toes! You gagged with each push, wishing for this nightmare to end soon. She finally pulled her toes out, hopefully for good. However, she pointed her toes upward, leaving you to look at her grimy sole. She pushed her sole forward against your lips, and you instinctively stuck out your tongue. She ran her sole up and down your exposed tongue, wiping across it as if it was a doormat. Her salty footsweat left a bitter taste in your mouth, and you felt like you were going to be sick. You could the dirt on her feet being pushed around by your tongue, the added saliva making her feet muddier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she flexed her black toes out and used your tongue to floss out the mounds of dirt and toejam between her toes. She wiggled the toes on her other foot right under your nose. leaving you no choice but to sniff up her disgusting foot funk. The assault on your senses is overwhelming, but with no sign of help in sight, you have no choice but to endure. After a few minutes, the Mawile switches feet. Despite having just been cleaned, the recently-licked toes now wiggling under your nose smell just as foul as the grimy toes now dancing across your tongue. Perhaps Mawiles have smelly pheromones they emit from their feet? You don't think anyone's been close enough to a pair to check for themselves before now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours, the Mawile put her feet back down, to your relief. She bent both of her feet toward her face and inspected her soles and toes very carefully. After a thorough examination, she giggled and winked at you. You must have accomplished whatever she wanted from you. Then, she extended both of her feet back onto your face, used the toes on her left foot to pinch your nose, and shoved right foot right back into your mouth. You began to panic, as you couldn't breathe! Was she trying to kill you? Was this how you were going to meet your end, suffocated under a pair of disgusting Mawile feet? Slowly, everything went dark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, you reawakened. Thankfully, the Mawile only caused you to pass out instead of outright killing you.

She turned her neck and waved a hand at the Mawile and Sableye, to which they responded by shrugging at each other and backing away a little bit. You were relieved at not having to take their feet all at once (whatever horrors that entailed), but that relief was soon squandered when the fighting-type scooted forward in order to get better access to your face, compressing your ribs and forcing air out of your lungs on the way. Instead of just getting down to business, however, she lowered an arm behind your neck, grabbed it, and raised your head, her face inches from yours. This unexpected move scared the shit out of you, and you instinctively tried to close your lips again. But before you finished, with a smirk on her face, the Makuhita grabbed you by the collar and forced your lips together. You didn't know what to make of this, but you felt utterly humiliated, a blush spreading across your face as the other two pokemon laughed at your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakuhita poked her tongue out against your lips, seeking entrance to your mouth. As much as you didn't want it to happen, you realized that the only thing you'd get for resisting is another smack to the face, this time by a fighting-type. Reluctantly, you allowed her tongue in, shivering at the thought of making out with a pokemon. Just as you thought she'd up the ante, with her large tongue intertwining with your smaller one, she ripped away from the kiss. Coughing and spluttering, she (painfully) turned around on top of you to yell at the Mawile, presumably for not telling her your mouth had already been 'in-service'. The steel-type only chuckled harder, falling on her ass in the process, while the Sableye only snickered to herself. Some tiny part of you felt bad for the fighting-type on top of you, but the rest of your brain (and your body, at that) strongly disagreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back around and crushing your ribs in the process, the Makuhita grumbled and slapped a thick, meaty foot on your face. The sole alone was the largest and widest you\u2019ve ever seen; so large and wide, in fact, that your face sunk into the sweaty, filthy flesh, like a base being used for a mold. Deciding to not delay the inevitable, or anger the pokemon on your chest, you open your mouth and get to business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakuhita gently\u2014if you could call anything a fighting-type does \u2018gentle\u2019\u2014rubbed her foot back and forth against your head, making sure your tongue is nice and plastered against her sole. Unlike Mawile\u2019s feet, the salty smack of hard-earned sweat was much more prevalent in the overall taste of the arch. You\u2019d honestly prefer if you just had to clean these feet, as slick as they were, if it meant getting away from the others\u2014<i>Wait, no! I don\u2019t want to clean their feet at </i>all! <i>What the hell\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, there wasn\u2019t actually too much dirt on the underside; the main problem, though, was the smell. Many kinds of sweat; fresh, old, wet, dry, and muddy, all congregated on the fighting-type\u2019s massive wall of a foot, and with your mouth fully occupied, the only choice you had was to inhale through your nose, which was wedged deeply in the space between her big and second toes. Even worse, her weight on your chest made it harder to breathe, necessitating your breaths to be deep and sharp. Each huff you took was infused with a rank cocktail of these flavors, the vinegary stench being much more potent than that of your initial tormentor. And it was growing stronger by the second! You couldn\u2019t exactly use your eyes to see, what with them being filled with the sight of sweaty, pudgy toes that you\u2019d inevitably have to suck, but you could definitely tell that Makuhita was getting a bit\u2026excited, at your submission to her. She scrubbed your face more firmly with her foot, really getting your tongue in there, and giving her sole a deep cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she lifted her foot off of your face and inspected your handiwork. Satisfied enough, she grinned down at you and hovered her toes in front of your slightly open mouth. Weirdly enough, she didn\u2019t just jam them down your throat. You look her in the eyes, and she responds by pointing a finger down at her wide digits and wiggling them in your face. <i>Oh god,</i> you realize, <i>she wants me to do it myself. Just\u2026crane my neck up and suck on her toes.</i> Just when you thought you couldn\u2019t get any more emasculated, here you were, stuck between a rock and a hard place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ponder whether or not to keep the last shard of dignity you have left, you feel a firm pressure on your crotch and an electric zap up your spine; straining to look over the form of your rotund tormentor, you see Mawile pressing her heel straight down on your cock. She meets your gaze, waves and giggles deviously, then twists her foot, grinding it against your half-chub\u2014which was growing embarrassingly fast. A hot rush spreads through your gut, and your head feels fuzzy and warm. A little groan sneaks through your lips before you realize. You gulp, panicking on the inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck, fuck fuck fuck FUCK\u2026! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am </i>not<i> a Pokephile\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it looked like these girls were trying to change your mind. Makuhita seemed almost entranced in your reaction. After getting a good look at your panting, blushing face and unfocused eyes, she actually rolls off of you, unburdening your chest. You take the precious break time you have to gulp down some nice, relatively fresh air\u2014even the stale, murky depths of Granite Cave had nothing on these pokemon\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakuhita seems to be having a conversation with the others; at least that stopped Mawile from touching your co\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Spoke too soon\u2026</i> you thought, feeling one of the fighting-type\u2019s large hands grab your member from inside your shorts, squeezing it a couple times, as if to make a point. Another slight moan escapes your throat, and you can hear her snicker a bit. Mawile seems\u2026miffed? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit, are these pokemon </i>crushing<i> on me?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mawile and Makuhita are arguing, Sableye sneaks up to you, sits down lightly on your chest, and waves one foot in front of your face, chuckling at you; then, she slaps both of them on your face. Your moment of peace is broken as you inhale the funky scent of her peds, quite small in comparison to the ones you just faced, but no less potent. She grabs your cheeks with her toes, stretching them out and making you make a face. She laughs loudly, which draws the other two\u2019s attention back to you. Smartly, she slinks off of you and back to them, knowing that angering those two would probably mean she\u2019d have less fun overall. Still, she waves at you, a smug look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, one of them approached you, looking a bit less excited than before, but nonetheless ready to have some fun at the expense of your dignity and olfactory senses. You hazard a reluctant guess that whoever's not working your head is probably going to work your 'little head'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one is going to play with your face?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mawile walks up to you, staring intensely at your defenseless form, most of her smarmy condescension being replaced with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits on your chest, which is still pretty sore from Makuhita\u2019s weight pressing down on it. A sense of dread washes over you, and it only worsens when you feel the fighting-type\u2019s hand pass against your right thigh, and gently fasten around the unfortunate bulge in your shorts. She winks, blows you a kiss, and squeezes your member tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaps out of your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mawile smacks you across the face with her foot, bringing back the dull stinging on your cheek from her Sucker Punch earlier. Obviously, she was unamused at your reaction to Makuhita\u2019s teasing. Maybe she interpreted it as you \u2018reciprocating\u2019 the fighting-type\u2019s affections; maybe she just wanted your attention back on her. Either way, she didn\u2019t take her time toying with you; instead, she went all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising the same foot she slapped you with, Mawile shoves it straight down your throat. Afraid of the kind of damage she\u2019s willing to deal now that she\u2019s\u2026eugh\u2026\u2019jealous\u2019, you waste no time before servicing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was even possible, her feet were even filthier than before; dirt caked their undersides, and the spaces between her toes were filled with grime\u2014and somehow, <i>more</i> toejam. You brush your tongue against the sole currently invading your mouth, being unable to reach her toes due to how far back they were in your throat. Meanwhile, Makuhita tugs your erection slowly and methodically, fogging up your mind. You felt the terribly familiar feeling of your saliva and Mawile\u2019s foot-filth mixing to create an orgy of mud that coated your mouth and the entirety of the foot inside it. A tangy, salty taste pervaded wherever it touched, with the slightest hint of\u2026grass? Did she really go out of her way to get her feet dirty at the entrance before telling her \u2018friends\u2019 about you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, Mawile didn\u2019t appreciate your lack of direction. She gave you the stink-eye, at the same time introducing your nose to the rancid, sweaty toes of her unoccupied foot. The horrid odor of earth and marking-pheromones completes her two-pronged invasion of your olfactory organs. The foot in your mouth is shoved further in, her toes tickling the back of your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the fabric of your shorts slide down your legs; Makuhita decided to get a bit more intimate with you, grabbing your bare shaft through the waistband of your boxers. Jerking you a few more times, slowly, powerfully, from base to tip, she slides your underwear down. You instinctively gulped, but it only resulted in you taking Mawile\u2019s foot deeper into your throat. A shiver runs down your spine, sweet tingling running through your body of its own accord. Half of you is cursing your situation right now, the other is shamefully anticipating her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, you realize what\u2019s happening: the two pokemon torturing you right now are having a \u2018contest\u2019 for you. The obvious winner was Makuhita; the steady, distracting motion of her pudgy hand made you painfully aware of her presence. It also made you more malleable to Mawile\u2019s requests, but it pissed the steel-type off, knowing that she was \u2018losing\u2019 this race of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden thrust of your tormentor\u2019s foot into your mouth rips you out of your pondering; forcefully, she footfucks you, much harsher than last time. It hurts, and you\u2019re tearing up, but something about it, combined with the gentle gliding of thick fingers against your member, only flushes more heat throughout your body. Your tongue scrapes forcefully against Mawile\u2019s foot, and her lips tug up, turning into an aroused smirk. She takes her free foot off of your face, and steps on your chest, balancing on you while continuing her oral assasult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakuhita changes her pace to match the frantic motions of her \u2018rival\u2019. She removes her hand from your dick, leaving you feeling cold, even with the hot, humid conditions of your environment. After an agonizing pause, your crank still twitching from both being left out to dry and having your mouth fucked, she relieves your wanting organ. Opening her mouth wide, she swallows it, sucking and licking your shaft in the same intensity as the foot on your tongue. You both moan in pleasure, but the sounds only registers as humming, her lips vibrating against the base of your cock, your lips buzzing around the foot of the steel-type on top of you. Unable to control herself, Mawile soon joins in with the chorus of moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief second of clarity enters your mind, like the calm before the storm.<i>Shit,</i> you realize, ashamed at your enjoyment of this, even if it\u2019s been forced on you, <i>not only am I a Pokephile, I\u2019m also a </i>goddamn pervert<i>!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, your clarity was lost. Mawile yanks her foot out of your mouth, almost taking out a few of your teeth. You gasp for breath; you\u2019re blushing so hard that your entire face is beet red. The worst thing? You don\u2019t know if that\u2019s from oxygen deprivation, or complete arousal. She shifts position, and almost as quickly as your mouth was vacated, another foot slams in to fill it. A gleeful grin is apparent on Mawile\u2019s face; it\u2019s evident that she thinks she\u2019s won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakuhita changes position again; the loss of stimulation from her diligent tongue is unbearable, and you find the strength to thrust into the air, accidentally slapping her in the face with your saliva-lubricated cock. She laughs hardily, standing up and turning around to rip the wurmple silk bindings off of your legs. Sableye tries to protest, impatient for her turn, but stops herself, realizing that you probably won\u2019t have enough energy to move after this. She wouldn\u2019t admit it to herself, but watching you get utterly dominated by her friends was more arousing than forcing you to pleasure her. In the end, she sat down and enjoyed the view. In the midst of your haze of pleasure could hear a quiet, wet, squishing sound, but you were too preoccupied to care about what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bindings were off, the first thing you felt after regaining the feeling in your legs was Makuhita\u2019s hands sliding your boxers down, making sure to caress your inner thighs as she did so. You shuddered. The hands stroking you left a hot, yet soothing sensation in your loins. Fuck, how were they this good? If this is how all pokemon are, then you guess there\u2019s a reason pokephiliacs exist\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your underwear was dealt with, she kept rubbing your thighs for some time, getting in deep and working out the kinks you had from running around on your adventure. You\u2019ve never felt this bizarre; relaxation and excitement simultaneously washed over your body. Nevertheless, you were horny, and you wanted some relief. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dislodge Mawile\u2019s foot from your mouth slightly, enough to let out an impatient groan, hoping that was enough to get Makuhita going. She chuckled, kicked your legs further apart, and stomped her semi-cleaned foot right down on your dick. You wheeze. Your spit mixed with hers as she ground her heel against your shaft, putting most of her weight into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile wasn\u2019t ready to quit just yet; she ceased her throatfucking for a moment, instead wrangling your tongue with her toes, still specking with grime and toe jam. You squeal, the dulled taste of her feet renewed in all its glory. The (relatively) new experience is strangely hypnotic; she\u2019s dominating you purely through her taste! You suck the filth off of her foot, flakes of dead skin melting on your tongue and traveling down your gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakuhita was busy stroking you to completion with her foot. She shifted position several times; from bullying your dick with her sturdy heel, to squashing it against your belly with her plush arch, to jerking it up and down with her toes, much like she did with her hands. Seeing your domination at Mawile\u2019s toes riled her up; it was time to bring out the big guns. She sat down at your waist, positioning her feet around your dick. Before working her magic, she gathered up some spit in her mouth, and drooled over your crotch. A hot, sticky liquid covered your crank, starting with the tip, and oozing down to your balls. You shiver in anticipation, almost ready to blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final stretch to your orgasm is a blaze of endorphins. Makuhita wraps her feet, one cleaned, one dirty, around the shaft of your cock, and starts pumping. The asymmetrical texture of her soles does wonders on you; the flesh had enough give to envelop you completely, and the dirt gave a rough, but not unbearable, edge to the indescribable bliss of being jacked off by her feet alone. You can\u2019t even concentrate on the toes in your mouth anymore, the sensation is too great, and you\u2019re about to\u2014!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour semen spurts onto the square of Mawile\u2019s back. This catches her off-guard, making her recoil and accidentally shove her foot the deepest it\u2019s ever been into your throat. In some horrific way, it accentuates the peak of the unwanted bliss you\u2019ve been receiving from Makuhita\u2019s ministrations; you gyrate uncontrollably, your crank being pushed further into the soft, sweaty flesh of her sole, and spurting rope after sticky rope onto the steel-type, painting her backside a particularly incriminating shade of opaque off-white. She shudders from the alien feeling, hot and gooey, dripping off of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two pokemon get off of you, finishing themselves off afterwards. Then, they sit beside your head, waiting for an answer. You think you can make out Sableye in the distance, passed out on the ground, and what looks like a clear liquid coating a small patch of ground in front of her. Still dazed, you are slapped out of your afterglow by Mawile. You groan, but before you can caress your new bruise, Makuhita puts a hand under your back and lifts you up into a sitting position. From what little you heard (much less understood) of their arguing, it looks like they want to see who the \u2018winner\u2019 of their little contest was. </span></div></div>",

But little you know that you are being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as you reach a clearing, a sound is heard. Nothing like cries of pokemon or the wind through the leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it sounds more like... a song... and a beautiful, sweet one as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to find its source. But, as you take the minimum amount of three steps, your eyelids starts to feel heavy. You let out a yawn, and you find that you can't stand on your legs anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsentmindedly, you walk towards a tree and sit down, leaning with your back against your trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, you lose consciousness and fall asleep; in the meantime, the tune changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf by any chance the first melody didn't do its job, you would have seen yourselves rapidly diminishing in height. And, soon, you lay there, unconscious, and as tall as a common bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe melody finally ends. From the branches of the trees above, a green headed, blue eyed pokemon smirks. Her powers did their job...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Melo! Melo!</b>\"  a voice cries. You adjust your position in your sleep.<br>\r\n\"<b>Mel!</b>\" the voice repeats. This time, something starts to shake you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMumbling something in your sleep, you adjust again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Mel!</b>\" with this loud cry, you suddenly feel a sharp pain taking over your body, successfully waking you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shut open, and the first thing you notice is a white, slim pillar putting pressure on your chest, pinning you down, keeping you still, knocking the air out of your lungs and, most of all, causing you pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing a bit, you slowly gaze upwards. You manage to make out the silhouette of a giant pokemon. It has green hair, blue eyes and a black 'dress'. Also, the pillar currently pinning you down, you realize, is its foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Meloetta!</b>\" it cries upon seeing you awake, telling you what pokemon it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know about Meloetta that she is admired by many because of her unique songs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... that melody you heard before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Mel!</b>\" she cries again, interrupting your thoughts by stepping on you harder, making you yelp in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop! Please!\" you cry out in pain. The giantess smirks. She likes your pleads. It makes her feel... powerful. And she's sure that this new toy of hers will just make her day better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she lifts her foot off you, and leans down, roughly grabbing you with her black paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta takes your previous place as she sits down where you were being crushed not even a second ago. You're really glad that you're not currently under her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your relief is short lived as the dual-typed legendary leans forward, moving you towards her feet and placing you down in front of the white pillars.<br>\r\n\"<b>Melo!</b>\" she exclaims, bringing her paws in front of herself, and starting to rub an invisible surface, before pointing to you by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while for you to understand that she just instructed you to <i>worship</i> her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look upwards, trying to put up some resistance, but a mere look to the legendary tells you that any attempt of protest would end poorly for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything's happening too fast for you too handle. You just woke up, and found yourself shrunk and at the mercy of a singing giantess who just ordered you to worship her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Melo!</b>\" she cries impatiently, wagging her feet in front of you, eager to receive your servicing. You shake your head, soon understanding that you have just to options: do as she asks (more like demands!), or attempt to flee. How far could you get from the giantess? And, more importantly, how will you face you if she catches you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost probably, she's going to 'punish' you with the same feet she wants you to service. That aside, could you face the forest and its dangers at this size? And would get out unharmed? Those are two good points against running away. Plus, you obviously need your previous size back, and maybe, if you do as Meloetta wants, maybe she'll restore you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you don't really want to humiliate yourself by worshipping the feet of a pokemon. And, even if running wouldn't exactly be a bold choice, it is far better than the alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cry from the giantess and a poke of her left foot brings you back to reality. And you hastily make your choice...</span></div></div>",

It felt...off, even by your standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wasn't all bad, at least no one was bothering you as you were going back from the supermarket. That's when you finally took notice of your house near the edge of town. This may not go wrong after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, as you soon got to the walkway to your house, you noticed a small \"outline\" of...a creature out of the corner of your eye. But you didn't notice it until it was right next to you, as though it was invisible. But soon after you did, that outline immediately starting to move, probably in response to your noticing. And before you knew it, you felt a strong pain getting delivered to the crotch, making you drop your groceries! Right then-you felt atrociously hurt, but you weren't knocked out, until the creature seemed to notice based on its movements unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That, was when you felt a strong pain against your crotch AGAIN, from behind as it vanished. Finally putting the nail into your coffin, your sleeping coffin. And even before you could fall unconscious, the creature had become fully visible in front of you being rather dark and small, with the top of its head being a mix of blue and green. Its small giggling was all that you could hear as you fell asleep from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After an hour, without knowing it, your body could tell that the surface you were on was different than what you know your property does.

The first thing you notice is that you're no longer where you were before being knocked unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in a small cave instead, the rock walls barely visible in all this darkness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fully adjust to your dark surroundings, and you notice two creatures standing before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them is unknown to you. But the other - the color drains from your face as you take a good look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed eyes, purple body and a sinister, wide-open-mouth grin. A Gengar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze shifts on the other creature, the one that apparently knocked you out earlier. Black, small body, funny shape of head and red eyes, which are fixed on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Shad, shadow.</span>\" the unknown creature says. Its voice is a little more than a simple whisper, yet you detect a feminine tone within it, giving you a close idea of what gender the creature is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gengar.</span>\" the Gengar speaks up. You notice that it's voice carries the same feminine tone of the other creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to recollect your thoughts. These two female pokemon knocked you out and kidnapped you. For what reason you couldn't figure out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown creature looks at the Gengar, and she points at you with a stubby, dark grey finger.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Marshadow.</span>\" she cries. Universally, pokemon only speak their names, so you assume that the creature's name is Marshadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever she said to Gengar, the ghost/poison type starts snickering in response.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gen!</span>\" she replies she nodding her head, before turning to you. For some reason, that characteristic grin seems more sinister than before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost's eyes suddenly glow azure as she stares at you. A blue aura surrounds you, but you find yourself unable to look away. You start to feel very weird, light-headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you close your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reopen them, the first thing you think is that you must have somehow fell asleep. This must be a dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before you are the Marshadow and the Gengar... but they've became giantesses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Yet, the cave surrounding you and them didn't even quake... so there's only one logical alternative... the Gengar must have shrunk you down with her powers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is drawn as Marshadow walks over you with an unnervingly slow fashion. The giantess stares down at you for a moment, before giggling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Sha.</span>\" she says. For some reason, you interpret this as \u2018cute\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadowy pokemon continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Shad shadow.</span>\" she mutters, \u2018You will make a wonderful toy\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stand up, staring up at the grey giantess. Slowly, the black pillar that is her left foot rises off the ground and it hovers over you, eclipsing your eyesight even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it starts to descend... straight on you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, bracing yourself for the impact... that never comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gar!</span>\" the Gengar shouts. Marshadow's foot stops in midair as the giantess looks at the purple ghost.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Sha?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gen, gengar!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reopen your eyes. Only to see that Marshadow's facial expression shifted from an amused one to an irritated one. Part of her head turns green as she spreads her arms in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Shadow!</span>\" she shouts, pointing first at you, then to herself.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gengar!</span>\" the purple ghost emulates her friend's movements. The only difference is that she points to herself in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization strikes you. The two giantesses are arguing to decide which one of them is going to 'play' with you first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that this is a good moment to try and slip away, you start crawling away from Marshadow's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the giantess suddenly turns to look at you. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Dow!</span>\" she shouts, making you halt while also making you physically tremble with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant, black paw suddenly gets a hold of you as you're snatched up by the shadowy pokemon, who turns to Gengar.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Marshadow!</span>\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gengar! Gen gengar!</span>\" the poison type replies, clearly demanding the first turn with you, the giantesses' new living toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe argument goes on for several minutes more, before the two pokemon finally decide how to mark the end of it...</span></div></div>",

In response, Marshadow fixes two red eyes on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Dow.</span>\" she replies, her other paw joining the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow grasps you against her chest, before walking towards Gengar. Then, the grey giantess bends, releasing you on the ground. You look as she walks back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pokemon fix their eyes down on you, expectant look painted on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence falls between the three of you, and it lasts for about three minutes, before Marshadow lets out and annoyed cry:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Mar!</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm sorry, but I don't exactly understand you!\" you cry with the same irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Marshadow points first to you, then to herself, then to Gengar.<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, there's me, you and Gengar. So?\" you ask, quite unsure that this is what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the two giantesses face palm. Then, Marshadow patiently repeats her actions, this time in a slower manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she points to you.<br>\r\n\"You want me to do something?\" you ask. The pokemon nods, before pointing to herself and Gengar.<br>\r\n\"You want me to do something with you two?\" again, the movement of her head is upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Marshadow points to her feet. You blink a few times, not having understood. Marshadow points to her feet again. Your mind tries to put the pieces together.<br>\r\n\"You want me... to play... with your and Gengar's feet?\" you say, mentally slapping yourself. Of course this isn't what she mean-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the giantesses smiling as you say the last sentence. <br>\r\n\"What? I have to play with your feet?\" you ask. Both nod their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that refusing is not an option, you meekly nod. You quickly decide that you'll run away whenever the two fall asleep. It was already dark when you were knocked out. You have no clue of how much you slept, but you judge that it must be night now. The two giantesses will have to go to sleep at some point... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are claimed back to reality as Marshadow talks again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Shadow.</span>\" she says, drawing your attention.<br>\r\n\"Uh?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Gengar points to you, then to herself and Marshadow, before both cross their arms, sitting down in front of you, their feet rising up, showing you their soles and what lays beneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow's feet are relatively clean. Sure, the grey soles collected a few small rocks and blades of grass, but nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Gengar's feet - they're covered in dirt and grime, suggesting that she does a lot of walking. Something you don't want to play with too much - if at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, want me to choose...\" you suddenly realize. Both giantesses nod their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to choose who should I play with first? Is that why you were arguing?\" you question. Again, they move their heads upside down, before shooting expectant looks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that this is the moment: you've got to choice, whether to 'play' with Marshadow's feet or with Gengar's. Since your current situation, you don't want to disappoint either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you know, Gengar can be a really nasty pokemon if not pleased. If you refuse to give her the first turn, she may just stomp you into dust when it comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you're clueless about Marshadow's powers, since she was an unknown pokemon before you met her. You don't know what she might do to you, and you discover that you really don't want to find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Dow!</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gar!</span>\" they cry at unison. Somehow, you are able to understand the meaning of their words, \u2018Make your choice already!\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you turn to both giantesses, unable to choose which one should you start with. Marshadow's feet are cleaner, but you don't know what she might do to you; Gengar's are dirtier, but you know what she could do if you pick Marshadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Who do I choose?</i>\u2019</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Against what your mind is screaming you, you decide to start with Marshadow's feet, which are cleaner than Gengar's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you walk towards the dark grey soles of the shadowy giantess, who smiles, understanding that you picked her first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Gengar doesn't look too pleased, you can tell by the venomous look she shoots you, making you shiver with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have little time to think about it though as Marshadow leans forward, scooping you in her giant, grey paw and gets up as she starts to walk, heading away from Gengar, in a dark corner of the cavern and sitting down, before setting you down by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you think about running away right there and then. You wonder if you could make it to the entrance of the cavern and run away from these two giantesses. You quickly discard the idea, though. There's no way you could make it, not in such reduced size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Shad.</span>\" Marshadow calls you back to reality, eager to have her feet serviced. You rise your gaze past her soles to shoot her a questioning look as you silently ask how should you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer doesn't take long as the giantess rises her left paw, bringing an open palm to her mouth; something red and slick comes out of it. Marshadow pretends to slide it along the length of her palm, before pointing at you by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silent, but clear acknowledgement, \u2018Lick\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lump travels down your throat as you swallow. A quick glance to the dark grey pokemon tells you that she's not kidding at all. You really have to lick her feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you walk closer to the dark sole, placing your hands on it. You reluctantly open your mouth, stick your tongue out and lean forward, closing your eyes to not witness yourself doing such humiliating thing such as licking someone's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that what you are currently doing is totally weird. Marshadow's feet aren't as warm as you expected them to be; it's like this pokemon barely has bodily warmth, and this foot is almost immaterial. It's like you're trying to lick smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the soles of the giantess have got a taste which, while not exactly pleasing, is not disgusting. Sure, when your tongue made the first contact with her sole, you were tempted to retreat it back in your mouth and throw up. However, you slowly get used to the taste as you keep licking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile performing said task, you use your hands to remove the small rocks, the grass and the dust from the pokemon's sole, allowing you an easier task. Still, you have to deal with the unpleasant taste and with the smell of her feet, which is weird as well. Like the taste, the foot of the giantess smells like smoke, mixed with the smell of the grass crushed beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadowy giantess giggles the whole time, barraging your ears with that low, ghostly giggle of hers. You're not sure if that is because you are tickling her or because you must look so pathetic to be of amusement to the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you finish licking the first foot and pull back, trying to hold what you just swallowed in your stomach. You feel dizzy and humiliated at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Marshadow pays your feelings no mind as she pokes your body with her left, still uncleaned foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ca-Can I have a minute?\" you ask. The giantess' head lits of a green color as she frowns. The answer is clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you start walking towards her left foot, starting what you already did to the other one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do-Done...\" you dizzily mutter as you stumble back, away from the Marshadow's foot. You've done the same thing twice, yet you could swear that the second foot was even worse than the first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou casually look to Marshadow, noticing her checking your work. All the rocks, the grass and the dust were removed from her feet. You look at her visage, noticing her expression shifting: her eyes close, and a smile spreads wide across her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Shad dow.</span>\" she happily says, one of the two feet reaching your face as she gently pats your right cheek in a playful manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're barely able to mutter a \u2018You're welcome\u2019 that a dark purple paw snatches you up, and one grinning Gengar gives out a cry:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gar!</span>\" she says triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving you or Marshadow any time to react, she moves to the opposite side of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, Gengar had unceremoniously dropped you on the ground. You ungracefully land, your back hitting the ground. A painful grunt escapes your mouth as the ghost type sits in front of you, her dirty feet rising up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gar!</span>\" she says, her arms crossing as she looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only assume that how to please the Gengar's feet is up to you. However, you have a feeling that if you don't do a good job, your remains won't be able to regret it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were right. Gengar didn't like the fact you picked Marshadow first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had opted to not lick the feet (your stomach had too much for one day), and chose to simply clean them with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Gengar hadn't the intention to make it easy for you; For the whole time, she has been constantly kicking you or pinning you beneath the dirty soles of her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, dirt now clings to every inch of your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nothing could be compared to the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like smelling poison (no surprise from a poison type), but mixed with dirt, crafting an intense smell that tortured your nose for the whole time. At least, Marshadow's feet didn't smell that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bless the moment you pull back, having cleaned the second foot too.<br>\r\n\"Happy now?\" you ask with well-concealed disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGengar snickers in response, before her left foot darts forward as she gently kicks you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when you see Marshadow coming out of the ground, her lower body submerged in a shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you know, hiding within shadows is a thing Gengar can do. But, apparently, Marshadow is able to do so as well. The only logical explanation you can think about is that she must be a ghost type too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought stops as both pokemon giantesses step in front of you, standing at full height above you, giving you an idea of how small you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately hope that this is it, that they're done. That they'll just go to sleep now, so you'll have a chance to escape and - possibly - get help with your second problem - your reduced size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the two giantesses staring at you intently. And from Marshadow's smile and Gengar's grin, you realize that...</span></div></div>",

When half her body is submerged in the shadow, she moves a paw, lightly patting your head with it. You assume that she's thanking you for the good - or at least decent - work you've done with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the giantess' body slides down, her head disappearing in darkness.<br>\r\n\"W-Wait-\" you mutter, dreading the chance of being alone with Gengar. But a quick glance around reveals that she's no longer around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have already slipped into the shadow, you decide. Without even bothering to thank you for your work, or for the torment she's put you through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that you don't care too much about it. The only one thing that matters now is another: escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around, examining the cave to check if the two pokemon really disappeared. It is said that if a Gengar watches someone from the shadows, they would feel naturally observed. Plus, the body temperature would fall to 5 \u00b0C.  You assume that it's the same thing for Marshadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand still for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, your body temperature certainly didn't fall. And you don't feel watched either. The only logical conclusion you can think of is that the two ghosts fell asleep, allowing you to move freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo escape this nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking twice, you start walking through the cave, to the point where you notice a small exit, moonlight slightly pouring inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards the exit and stop for a moment to enjoy fresh air, not the poisonous smell of Gengar's feet, or the weird smell of smoke of Marshadow's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, while you greedily fill your lungs with fresh air, a figure slowly emerges from your own shadow, soon towering above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling observed, you turn around to inspect your shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your heart skips a beat as you notice Marshadow standing there, looming over you, her head turned green and a frown on her face as she stares daggers down at you.<br>\r\n\"Uh... Hi Marshadow?\" you try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the giantess rises her foot above your head. It slams down on you. Not with enough force to kill you, but surely with enough force to put you in a lot of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Dow!</span>\" the giantess above cries, pressing her sole onto your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... I'm sorry...\" you manage to say, before the foot rises again, landing on your chest, knocking the air you managed to inhale out of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a weak cry of pain as you feel your body in incredible pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Marshadow gives no sign of wanting to stop soon. You tried to escape, she's punishing you. Her foot rises again, only to fall with great strength on a casual part of your body, making you cry out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it rises and slams down. As it does for several other times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise-slam, rise-slam, rise-slam, rise-slam, rise-slam, rise-slam, rise-slam, rise-slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body goes through more and more pain as the giantess keeps stomping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only hope that this won't last as long as you expect it to last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after several minutes of stomping your now fragile form, the giantess stops. Still, the pressure doesn't leave your body as she keeps her left foot on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it rises just a little bit, giving you a chance to breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaten, weak, unable to talk properly, you look up to the giantess. Her head returned to its characteristic grey color, but the frown is still present on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Dow! Sha!</span>\" she exclaims, \u2018Do that again!

Ironically, it was the one that reduced you in the pitiful state you were in right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, unable to even squirm in the grip of the giantess, you could only watch as she moved you in front of her sole, the one sole you licked clean earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no surprise when you saw it once again covered in dirt and small rocks. Did she want you to polish her feet again as a punishment for trying to escape? You sure hoped not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your fear of cleaning feet with your tongue turned to be wrong: as you neared the sole, you noticed Marshadow smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like she was deliberately taking as much time as possible to subject you to a still unknown torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if finally happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body touched the towering sole of the foot; then, the paw literally pushed you into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became agitated as your mouth was, once again, invaded by that familiar taste of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't even the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, as the paw behind you kept pushing, you suddenly found the almost immaterial wall in front of you seemed to melt around you, becoming softer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you suddenly retrieved your ability to speak, but you couldn't do anything as you were pushed deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot was literally <i>absorbing</i> you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands rushed to the sole, your feet did too as you tried to pull yourself back; but the more you struggled, the more Marshadow increased the strength of her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms were the first that were sucked into the shadow foot. You tried to pull back by pushing your feet against the hungry sole of Marshadow, but she simply smirked at you, her fiery red eyes glued on your form as she pushed you inside her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fitting punishment, you sourly thought,  since you were the size of an ant and given what Marshadow liked to do with shrunken humans such as yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs were devoured by the shadow foot too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped: you couldn't feel your limbs anymore, it seemed like they had disappeared behind the other side of the sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body followed, until just your head was stuck out of the towering sole, a finger of the giantess on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow pokemon shot you one last, mischievous look, before the finger pushed on your head, and everything disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow pulled back, satisfied, and slowly retreat into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way the human could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed after your head was absorbed by the foot was that you were in a pitch black place that smelt like Marshadow's feet (no wonder, given where you actually were).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cruel entrapment was totally weird, you thought: you were trapped in an almost immaterial but yet very solid place. Coldness surrounded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after your arrival on the other side of the foot, you tried to push yourself out the way you came in, but the foot quickly became touchable again, keeping you from escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let me out!\" you screamed, your scream causing the surface within the foot to vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird to think that you were inside of a pokemon, but you had no time to think: you had to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, you got no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to use the least amount of oxygen possible, you tried to struggle to get out of here, but you achieved nothing but a giggle (presumably coming from the giantess you were trapped in) causing the whole foot to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped for a moment to study your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour prison wasn't skin-tight, but was nonetheless still very small, like a tiny, circular cage. There was barely space for you to sit down: it was going to be a miracle if you didn't suffer from claustrophobia whenever you got out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If</i> you ever got out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, on the bright side, there seemed to be enough air for you to breathe. Aside from that, your prison was nothing but a smelly, cold and tight, little cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a few more meek attempts to get out by struggling, getting Marshadow to giggle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround you was the sound of a drum beating, but you knew that it probably was the heart of the pokemon, so loud because you were inside of her; a secondary, less loud sound that you registered as her breathing could be heard too and, judging by its slowness, Marshadow was probably asleep, but was nonetheless enjoying the massage you were providing in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of struggling uselessly, you fell onto the bottom of the smelly paw, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid down the best you could, resigned to the fact that there was no way to get out unless Marshadow willed it... and you weren't so sure that was something that was going to happen anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes, deciding to catch some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow was probably going to let you out in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you felt before you drifted off was the bad smell of the foot, before that too faded as you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came into the cavern where two certain shadow pokemon slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden within shadows, the giantess whose body you were sleeping in was sleeping soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gar!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo red eyes opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gengar!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the legendary emerged from the shadows, remembering about her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Gengar staring around the cavern with a venomous gaze, and it wasn't hard to understand the reason of it: the human they had shrunken and used like a foot toy was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Dow?</span>\" Marshadow chimed as she stood up, feeling a tingle under her left foot... or <i>in</i> her left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow pokemon suddenly smirked to herself as she remembered the events that had occurred last night: she had punished the human for trying to escape, then she had put him inside her foot to prevent him trying to flee again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Gengar didn't know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple ghost-type suddenly turned around, noticing Marshadow smirking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the smaller pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Gen?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Where is the human?</i>\u2019</span></div></div>",

She was quite the high-spirited girl, wasn\u2019t she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you plan to test out the newly-obtained Lopunnite that you have acquired, and integrated into your Mega Stone, you began to consider something, about what you said earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould it be a morally Just idea to risk altering Lopunny\u2019s personality, by invoking her Mega Form, giving her the aggressiveness she has repressed, and possibly shattering her fitting personality of pure friendliness, innocence, kindness and  generosity, just so that she could tap into the unknown potential she never knew she had? Even if it was merely a temporary change... The emotional and mental consequences that you and she would suffer are not light indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having to self-debate for so long, you decide that a trial must be done, for her and your sake. As a Trainer, you need power to maintain your relations with your held Pokemon, or they will eventually lose their trust in their Trainer as they grow more and more experienced. It\u2019s either you take advantage of her trust that evolved her, to gain her true power, in order to solidify your rise to power, or risk losing her anyway, when the inevitable comes from so many random battles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a worried mind, you raise and activate the Mega Stone, as it speed forth the rainbow energy that unlocked the Mega Forms of so many Pokemon, as it enveloped Lopunny in a cyclone of prismatic flames, before it dissipated to reveal her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long furred ears were now tied off into sections, as they themselves turned long and thin, with beige cuffs of fur between each section. The tufts of fur on her forepaws has been altered into cylinder-like  squishy pseudo-gauntlets that covered her forearms. On her legs, you could see that there were black webbing over them, as they had several holes of varying size, much like torn stocking fabric, and her feet bore fur that were shaped like boots on the top, as there were rings of fur around the middle of her lower legs. The long eye-brows she had merged into a symmetrical butterfly at the centre of her forehead. What\u2019s more, her figure changed from a endowed body to a more lithe one, to accent her change in biological focus,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer did you see a innocent angelic bunny-girl, who only fought battles with pity and kindness to her opponents, even as she held back as if she didn\u2019t want to harm them seriously, and a held a aura of purity, innocence that made her adorable and cute to most Trainers.  In her place was a more sharper and refined beauty, as her posture were more rigid and controlled, as her expression reflected little of her former pacifism and kindness, as they were replaced by feelings of loyalty, duty and respect, as well as her eyes radiating a stoic look, as if she has turned from a whimsical beauty to a refined female warrior who fought for the sake of respect and loyalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the transformation ended, you prayed that her inner heart and mind would remain unchanged in this form. And the results were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blissey!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Pokemon did as ordered, and used the move to heal herself... Only to have that effect mostly undone, as she was once again forced to tank another Jump Kick to the face from your opponent. You really didn't expect things to get so sour. Blissey was supposed to be this super annoying to deal with wall of a Pokemon, yet right now she was being toyed with by a freaking Lopunny. The wild, lop-eared Pokemon easily ran circles around her opponent, delivering one Jump Kick after another, while dodging Blissey's Hyper Beams and Focus Blasts with ease. Once she ran out of those moves, your Pokemon was forced to tank Lopunny with Softboiled, and hope she misses some of those Jump Kicks to knock herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck. Lopunny landed each and every single one of her moves. Now that she didn't have to run and dodge, she just stood still a short distance from you and Blissey, always waiting for her turn. This gave you an ample opportunity to notice a certain device she's been wearing: Wide Lens! So that's why she wasn't missing! How did she come across it? Gah, no matter. She had it, and you had to deal with it now. With that thing one, the Lopunny would always land her Jump Kicks, unless you lowered her accuracy somehow... Or if Blissey raised her evasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere it was, the moment of truth. You ordered Blissey to heal again, but she wouldn't do it. She ran out of Softboiled. This was what Lopunny's been waiting for. Seeing her opponent unable to act, she immediately went for a finishing Jump Kick, not knowing you still had one trump card up you sleeve...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blissey! Use Minimize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, Blissey shrunk herself down, effortlessly dodging the Lopunny's attack. You watched as Lopunny flew over her target, and went on a crash course... With you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to react to that, you could only watch as the Pokemon's paw went straight for your face. Closer and closer it came, its details becoming more intricate as it approached. You felt as if time itself slowed down to a crawl, just to let get a good look at her foot. It's three, plump toes, the sweaty pawpads that adorned their undersides, as well as the big one right in the middle of her sole. As it came even closer, you could also notice the dirt, and blades of grass that got stuck to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, the last thing you saw before the blow that knocked you out cold was Lopunny's own face. She was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally regained consciousness, you could instantly that tell something was not right. You tried to move, get up, anything really, but you couldn't. Something was preventing you from moving. Your whole was bound by what appeared to be... Grass? Grass Knot, of course. Who could be responsible for this, though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Lop Lopunny~\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lop-eared Pokemon dropped suddenly from above, having apparently spent the last who-knows-how-long sitting on top of a tree branch, waiting for you to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You yelled at the smug-looking Pokemon, who stood above you triumphantly \"What's the big idea!? Release me right this instant, if you know what's good for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny merely giggled in response, amused by your empty bravado. You were in no position to make demands, yet here you were arguing with her as if you two were equal. How cute~<br>\r\nStill, it was slightly bothersome to have you so rebellious and spirited, when she had plans for you that required your complete subservience. Fortunately for her, Lopunny knew exactly how to bend you to her will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon reached for something she held stuffed in one of her 'ear fluffs', and presented it to you. You stopped fidgeting almost immediately as you noticed it, for in her hand Lopunny held another Pokemon. A familiar-looking, scared, pink blob...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. Since the battle wasn't technically finished yet, the effect of Minimize must've persisted all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blissey!\" you shouted out loud, enraged by the sight of your partner in peril. With what strength you could muster, you leapt forward at Lopunny, hoping you could knock her off balance. Sadly, it didn't come to be, as Lopunny swiftly moved aside, letting you fall flat on your face instead. You quickly resumed trying to break free from your bonds, but things only got worse, as your kidnapper called forth even more Grass Knots, tying you to the ground, with your face turned to the side, giving you a good view of your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Lopunny placed your Blissey a short distance from your face, and then used Grass Knot to prevent the egg-shaped Pokemon from running away. You couldn't believe just how small she was, like at most the size of your thumb. The two of you stared at one another for a bit, before looking up as something blotted out the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny towered above the two of you, looking proud and mighty. Though both of you lied at her feet, her focus was entirely on your Pokemon. Lopunny carefully rose her dainty paw in the air, poising it above Blissey's small form, and to your utter shock and terror, began its agonizingly slow descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Blissey a bit to get over the initial disbelief, but once she did, her panicked cries filled the silence around you. You didn't understand what she was saying, but you could tell that she was begging to be spared, pleading for her life. It didn't matter to Lopunny one bit, however, and she responded with a sinister giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, stop!\" You yelled, joining Blissey's cries. The paw momentarily stopped in mid-air, the dominant Pokemon eyeing you in curiosity. Seeing how you failed to follow that up with anything, however, she resumed her deadly ploy. Now Blissey started screeching at you, seeing how your words had some effect on the cruel Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I beg you! Leave her alone! It's m-me you want, isn't it? I-I'll do anything, just please let her go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to do the trick. Just as her sole was about to press your scared Pokemon into dirt, it stopped. Lopunny left it hanging there for a bit, probably to give your terrified Blissey a good look at the pawpad that was about to become her final resting place. However, once she was done teasing your helpless Pokemon, she didn't set it aside. Instead, the cruel rabbit moved her paw towards your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched curiously, as she set her paw to hang in front of your nose, wiggling her toes around in a teasing manner. You wouldn't willingly nose breath with that thing around, but unfortunately Lopunny saw to it that you did, as once again she used Grass Knot to tie your mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other option, you took a whiff of her paws, and instantly regretted it. They smelled as bad as they looked, reeked of dirt, trampled grass, and (of course) sweaty feet. Although there was some mysterious, sweet tinge to it that you couldn't quite explain. Maybe it came from some unlucky flowers that ended up beneath her stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or some sweet-smelling Pokemon</i>, you thought morbidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while you just stared at her outstretched paw, wondering what she was planning on doing, while cringing with every single fetid sniff she forced you to take. Suddenly, you heard Lopunny clear her throat, drawing your attention to her. Once you were looking at her, the rabbit Pokemon pointed at her paw, and made one, long, cruelly drawn out licking motion in the air. Then, with a snap of her finger, the Grass Knot over your mouth came off. You were free to breath again... And to follow her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLick her foot clean. Slowly, and diligently. Debase yourself at her feet for your sake, as well as the sake of your Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you do it?</span></div></div>",

The foul scent of the Lopunny's fetid paws was still plaguing your nose, and the mere thought of putting your tongue anywhere near them was enough to make your stomach twist itself into a tight knot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, looking back down at your Blissey silently pleading with you, you realize you don't have a choice. You're not sure if the Lopunny would carry through her threat, but you're not about to risk it. Clenching your eyes shut, you hesitantly press your tongue outwards. It doesn't take long before it finds its target, quickly pushing into the warm and furry sole. You gingerly move it upwards, feeling the grime, dirt and fur caked to the underside rabbit pok\u00e9mon's paw rub off against it as you complete your first lick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the texture of the foul mess you managed to collect is absolutely revolting, with the gunk sticking all over the inside of your mouth and the grit, fur and crushed blades of grass getting stuck between your teeth, you're surprised to find the taste, while still pretty bad,  isn't quite as disgusting as you feared. It's mostly just salty, with the occasional hint of some fruit, berry or other thing unfortunate enough to be crushed beneath bipedal rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she won't let you go after just one lick, you lean in for a second go. And then a third. And a fourth. You quickly settle into a rhythm: First pressing your tongue hard against her heel, lapping upwards to collect whatever grime you can until you pass her main paw pad, then pulling the filth back into your mouth to scrape it off against your teeth and moving in for the next go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to avoid focusing on the buildup of gunk in your mouth, you peek open an eye to see that the Lopunny's sat down at some point, eyes closed in relaxation as she enjoys your efforts, clearly content to have you serve her for as long as she pleases. At least the paw currently dominating your vision looks cleaner now, much of the dirt and grime clinging to it before having cemented itself in your mouth. The main pad has even started to turn bright pink once again, shining with your saliva as her plump toes happily wiggle above you, showering you with of their jam and dirt as they eagerly wait for their turn to enjoy your service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your Blissey has gone oddly quiet, you twist your head around to check if she's still ok. To your relief, she doesn't look hurt but... there's clearly something wrong. She's acting odd, almost mesmerized as she intently stares at you slurping away at the rabbit pok\u00e9mon's paw with a soft smile on her face and a clear blush on her cheeks. It takes a while before she notices you watching her, but this luckily seems to snap her out of her stupor, the small egg-shaped pok\u00e9mon suddenly looking away from you in a panic as you see her blush grow a deeper crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's definitely acting weird It could be an effect of the prolonged minimize, or some sort of shell shock as she sees her trainer debase himself before another pok\u00e9mon.

Seeing how you didn't have much else to do at the moment, you reluctantly shifted your gaze back to the domineering Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately regretted that decision, as per her cruel shtick, Lopunny decided to ram her still filthy, unattended paw into your face, and clamp her grimy, foul-smelling toes around your nose. You tried to get around her malicious ploy by breathing with your mouth, but only ended up playing right into her paws. Without warning, Lopunny rose her other foot to your mouth, and stffed it with her plump, revolting toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was pure nightmare. With your mouth shut by one of her filthy paws, you had not choice but to breath in the reeky scent of her toes. Its intensity was beyond compare, no doubt the worst smell you've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Its pure, unfiltered foulness made you shiver in disgust, your eyes watering due to its sheer pervasiveness in your system. Breath in, cringe in revulsion, breath out. Over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tasting buds weren't faring much better. Through your watery eyes you were able to discern Lopunny doing a licking motion with her tongue, essentially ordering you to lick her toes clean. Just for clarity, she wiggled her putrid digits in tandem with the licking, leaving no room to misunderstand her body language. She wanted your tongue to get in there, and do some serious work. You had no guts nor will to refuse, not when she literally had you writhing at her feet, powerless to get out of this funky mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, you couldn't even take a deep breath before 'digging in'. With what little strength you had, you started lapping at Lopunny's toes, mentally cursing every single decision that led to you this moment. You knew not how it was possible, but for some reason the grime on her toes tasted way worse that what you had to deal it when cleaning her main pad. It was much saltier, nowhere near as tolerable as it was, and its texture made it much less pleasant to just gulp down your throat like you did with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking all over her toes took you way longer than her cleaning her paw, if only because you felt much more tired. However, even after all this damned effort, you were still not done with the task. Just as you thought it was finally over, Lopunny let out a devilish giggle as she spread her toes as wide as she could, leaving you with two, putrid toe crevices to work on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, the 'final boss' of your torment. The fetid mesh that Lopunny carelessly allowed to fester in-between her plump digits. The residue of all that she ever stepped on, crushed, and squashed could be found there, dating who knows how far back. Even things that shouldn't taste bad, like remnants of fruits and berries, were already way past their prime, and rotted into more gunk and toe jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cleverly' enough, you actually took a deep, long breath before getting on with your job, just to split your attention between those two vastly different, but equally overwhelming sources of disgust. It did the trick well enough, and you were able to get through this phase without pausing too much... Even if each passing moment made you feel as if you were standing at death's doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit, a dreadfully inflated bit in your opinion, but Lopunny eventually dragged her legs back to see how well you did, leaving you to your own devices. You were still tightly bound by her Grass Knot, but just being able to take a deep breath of clean air was enough to bright tears of joy to a broken man like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you started feeling much, much better. The aftertaste of Lopunny's foot grime left your mouth completely, as did the memories of her putrid odour. You began to look for the source of this great, refreshing feeling, and once you did finally locate it, it moved you to tears.<br>\r\nYour dear Blissey has managed to break her grassy bonds. However, instead of running away from Lopunny, she made her way towards your still immobilized form, and once close enough started throwing Heal Pulse after Heal Pulse at you, hoping that it would make you feel any better. It did, and you couldn't think of proper words to describe how thankful you were, not that you even had to. You already did so much for her sake, demeaning yourself before this rabbit just so she wouldn't suffer instead. She had to help you make it through this nightmare somehow, even if it meant risking her own well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis beautiful moment sadly had to be cut short, as Lopunny was done checking out her freshly cleaned paw, and was now ready to make you give her other paw a similar treatment. Blissey rushed back to her spot, and clumsily covered herself with some grass blades, hoping her giant tormentor wouldn't notice that she freed herself from their grasp...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blissey was trembling like a leaf, eyes clenched tightly shut in fear as she tried to avoid the giant rabbit's notice. She didn't have anything to worry about, Lopunny had been way to preoccupied inspecting your work. The pok\u00e9mon turned her foot this way and that, even jamming a finger deep in between the crevices of her fuzzy toes to check for any leftover gunk. Not able to find any, she raises the foot into the air with a deceptively innocent giggle, flexing and wiggling the plump digits to simply enjoy the feeling of having them move, unburdened for the first time in god knows how long by the impressive amount of grime and filth they had collected over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reprieve didn't last for long as she was quickly pulled out of her little game by noticing you were still bound helplessly before her. She slowly lowered her paw back down as she extended its sibling in front of your face. Once again your view was dominated by the rabbit's disgusting sole. It looked like a war zone, with the crushed remains of countless things stuck fast to the vast expanse of the Lopunny's paw, pulped beyond recognition underneath the pok\u00e9mon's powerful stride and glued in place by the foul cement-like mixture of dirt, grime and her sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot content by just having you gaze at her foot, the Lopunny tries to your attention by clenching her toes. You're snapped out of your daze as you hear the thick digits squeeze together with an audible squelch, forcing some of the long built up gunk out from between them. Looking back up at the pok\u00e9mon, you're given your next order as she casually opens her mouth with a soft \"Looo~\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what will follow, but realizing you have no choice, you obey. Slowly, hesitantly, you open up your own mouth, offering it as a home for the fetid toes alread wriggling in anticipation in front of it. You've already managed to polish off one paw, the other can't be worse, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize you made a mistake as soon as the sadistic bunny shoves her furry digits inside. The dirt you licked off from her sole had shielded you from the worst taste of her toes earlier. While your Blissey's heal bell had revitalized you enough to take on the second foot in the first place, it had also removed all the the grime left coating your mouth, leaving it once again clean and pristine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady to be befouled all over again by the Lopunny's fetid paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ice cold shiver ran over your back the second your tongue brushed against the underside of one of the rabbit's toes. Any hope for some respite was dashed as the invading digits mercilessly advanced deeper inside. Tears start to well up in your eyes again at the foulness your experiencing, soon breaking into a heavy coughing fit as you feel one of her claws poke against the back of your throat. In the midst of your suffering, you realize your tongue had somehow found its way between two of the bunny's foul little piggies, finding salty, crusty fur and simi-solid sludge wherever it turns. Your feel your stomach spasm in protest against it all, and are barely able to avoid bringing the previous load of filth back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny, meanwhile, gleefully watches you choke on her foot. The way you wriggle and writhe against your bonds like a worm, the soft sobs you make as you try to regain control of your body's violent protest against her foul feet, and the fact she can immediately render your best efforts futile with a mere flex of her tootsies has completely enraptured her, and she continues to toy with you like this for a good while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, you manage to fight off your body's instinctual reaction. The struggle has completely tired you out, and you've yet to even start actually cleaning the paw. Pathetically, but desperate to end your torment, you start to suckle on one of her toes. After matting down her fur with a fresh coating of your saliva, you use your tongue to massage the pad underneath, enticing the filth that has been caked to it to take up residence in your mouth. Then, dreading the next part, your force your tongue in between the toe and its neighbor, using it to forcefully excavate glob after glow of unnameable foul sludge. You feel your body shudder with every mouthful you force down your throat, the disgusting mess sitting heavily in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel the pokemon's paw push against your dazed face, wiping itself up and down. It seems your tormentress wants you to finish your job. Taking your cue, you start obediently lapping away at her sole. As a small mercy, it seems the foulness of her toe-gunk has robbed your tongue of the ability to taste anything for a while. When you feel like you're probably smearing more grime back onto her foot than your licking is removing you decide to stop, not resisting as you see her paw slowly fall down on top of you. You can feel her toes happily thrumming on your head as she uses your face as an impromptu footrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you feel the furry expanse lift from your face as the rabbit inspects your work.</span></div></div>",

Both Pok\u00e9mon were sent flying off from the powerful exchange with both of them landing on the ground.

If there was anytime to go and claim your prize for defeating this local menace it was now. You could easily capture her and go back to the town. But the Mienfoo\u2019s larger then normal feet did seem to be quite sexy even with all the sweat, dirt and grass stuck to them. A part of you really wanted to know how they tasted. And plus, wouldn\u2019t this be the ultimate karma for a Pok\u00e9mon who constantly dominated others with her footpaws, to have her own be used for the pleasure of someone else?</span></div></div>",

You seemed to be leaning up against a rocky wall as you quickly realized that you were in a cave of some kind. You tried to move but quickly realized that you were paralyzed from the neck down. Most likely from the result of Mienfoo using Force Palm on you. You also quickly realized that not only was your bag and other items nowhere to be found, but more worryingly that you didn\u2019t seem to have any of your Pok\u00e9mon on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cMieeeen?\u201d</span> You fully snapped back to your senses when you heard that familiar playful voice. The Mienfoo seemed to have appeared out of nowhere as stood in front of you with a smile on her face. Her hands were behind her back as she rose her left foot and tried to force her toes into your mouth. Luckily, since you at the very least had control of your mouth you refused to open it for the devilish little Pok\u00e9mon. The Mienfoo let out an annoyed growl but quickly regained her sly smile. She finally revealed what she was holding, dropping the your team\u2019s empty Pok\u00e9balls right in front of you. Your heart instantly sank as your mind quickly began to assume the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to my team!

She popped into your mouth as you gulped the spicy berry down, as you quickly regained control of your body.<span class=\"cmaroon\"> \u201cMien! Mienfoo!\u201d</span> With a bit more force in her voice the Mienfoo beckoned to you, clearly telling you to follow her. Completely worried about your Pok\u00e9mon partners you followed her without a word. After a bit of walking you made it to another room in the cavern where you saw your Monferno, Nuzleaf, Grumpig and Aromatisse all unconscious propped up against a wall like you were just a few moments ago. You tried to rush towards your Pok\u00e9mon but the Mienfoo punched you in the knees, sending you crumpling to the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cMien.\u201d</span> The Mienfoo unsheathed one of its claw and tapped your nose, clearly showing who was the one in control right now. Her devilish little smile quickly returned as she strutted towards your Pok\u00e9mon as she started to point out a very specific trend with your team. You\u2019ve always liked to catch Pok\u00e9mon with different feet from the rest of their species, whether it be that they\u2019re just larger and wider like Monferno\u2019s, being much meatier and pudgier like Nuzleaf\u2019s and Aromatisse, or even being completely and utterly different like your Grumpig\u2019s human-like three-toed feet. You tried to not look the Mienfoo in the eye, ashamed that it had found out about your foot fetish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cMieeeeeeen!\u201d</span> You once again felt the Mienfoo\u2019s dirty and sweaty toes prodding at your lips. Looking up at her the Mienfoo pointed to your team before once again unsheathing one of her claws and making a slicing motion across her neck. Your heart skipped a beat as you quickly understood that this was Mienfoo\u2019s ultimatum. Become her little footslave or your Pok\u00e9mon would be the ones to face the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You had almost immediately opened your mouth to let her foot in before you remembered something. In all the reports of this Mienfoo\u2019s attacks it has never said anything about her killing those that she attacked. At worst they may have gone missing for two or three days but nothing as severe as this. This could easily just be a ploy to try and get you to worship her feet and you could quite easily call her bluff.  But did you really want to risk it?</span></div></div>",

The one she always gave you shortly before throwing you down at her paws, to have her way with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Del. I'm tired. Let's save this for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a light chuckle in response. <span class=\"clred\"><i>Sorry, you're not getting out of this one.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached, Delphox spoke right into your mind. Just for show, she went right thought the middle of the campfire, the fire doing her no harm at all. In fact, it tickled a little, the Pokemon laughing heartily as the flames 'licked' at her paws. Soon she would have something, or rather someone else lapping at them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came out of the flames, Delphox's body gave of an intimidating, scarlet glow. She loved to instill fear in you like this, it made her feel more powerful, more imposing.<br>\r\nYou, of course, weren't going to just give in to her wants without a fight, even though your attempts at resisting were laughably ineffectual. You were basically going through the motions at this point. You would reach for her Poke Ball, and she would use Psychic to pin you to the ground. Then she would slowly walk overly, deliberately making her steps sound as crunchy as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><br>\r\nMmmmm~ </i></span>She cooed into your mind. <i><span class=\"clred\">What a wonderful spot you chose to rest, my loyal servant. The ground here is so crunchy. As I walk, I can feel so many, many things ceasing to exist right underneath my pretty pawpads. A dried leaf here, a fallen twig there, some feeble stones in between, and to top them all...</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRUNCH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nice, big, juicy buuug~, she finished,grinding her paw left and right into dirt, all the while keeping your head turned to its, so you could see this whole 'spectacle' unfold.<br>\r\nDelphox loved getting her feet all messy. After all, it was your job to keep them clean. She would go on long walks, getting her paws all sweaty, just to have you lick them clean afterward. She would also ruin your meals by squashing them underpaw, and then make you eat them straight from her soles and toes, 'enriched' by whatever else she had clinging to those feet. Well, you couldn't really hold that one against her. Del was , after all, the one making said meals in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome nights, however, she had enough of this 'child's play', as she called it. No, those nights she wasn't simply your mistress, but your goddess. A radiant being not of this world, who chose to grace your pathetic self with her presence, and make you her chosen servant. Of course, she had to first get herself in the role of an all-powerful being, and what better way to do it than snuffing literal lives underfoot?<br>\r\nWell, bugs made for a poor 'groveling' public, but that's also what she had you for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphox pointed at something on the ground with a glowing finger. You worryingly followed it with your eyes, and eventually found what she was looking at: a slug. A big, juicy mollusk, slowly making its way through the ground. You looked back at Del, and this time her finger was pointed at you. The yellow spark at the tip of her finger shined brightly, and before you knew it, everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened your eyes, you weren't a human anymore. You were a slug, the same one that's been slithered its way so close to you just a couple moments ago. In fact, as you looked around, you found your body, motionless. Still. Dead?<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nTHOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant paw fell down close to you, to the slug. Too close for comfort. You tried to move, to get away, but you couldn't. Your mind was stuck, tied to that slimy thing's body. Del did this on purpose, to torture you even more. Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was enormous, a true image of a powerful goddess. She smiled brightly at you, but there was nothing pleasant in that smile. Del was like a kaiju now, ready to smush you out of existence with a single step if she wanted to. And boy, did she want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had a jaw, it would break through the floor, and fall into the basement. For someone so impossibly gigantic, she moved so swiftly, so elegantly. With little effort she rose her paw above you, giving you a clear view of her dirty foot. Dirt and some bug guts rained all around you, as the giant Pokemon waved her paw around, enjoying the anticipation of the squish she was about to deliver. Her toes wiggled in delight, ready to smash your slug body into mush in-between them.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><br>\r\nFE! FI! FO! FUM! </i></span>Her voice boomed all around you, instilling dread and hopelessness. <i><span class=\"clred\">What is this little creature that dares ruin my day with its disgusting presence? The world ill needs such a worthless thing. To get rid of you would be doing the rest of us all a great service. Now, die under my foot, little felon. Die as you lived, writhing beneath the feet of your betters.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did as she said. Her foot fell down slowly, agonizingly so, with the main pawpad aimed right at 'your' slug's pathetic body. You screamed internally as it approached, unable to take your eyes away from the apocalyptic sight. You would die here like some nameless bug, thoroughly rubbed into the filth staining the bottoms of Del's feet, and forgotten by all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when it finally came, your torture was far from over. The giantess was methodical in her extermination, at first only rubbing your squishy, soft body underneath her paw, before gradually applying more and more pressure. The pawpad was naturally pretty soft, but to something so small and insignificant as you, it was harsh and unyielding. It pressed on more and more, the pain getting worse with each passing second. You screamed into her foot, pleading for mercy and release from this torment, but Del wouldn't hear you. After all, this was exactly what she wanted.<br>\r\nOne final press of her paw, and everything went black again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened your eyes, you were back in your body, staring unwilingy as Del twisted her foot left and right ontop of the spot that slug (you) was just a second ago. Of course, now that the deed was done, memories came flooding back. It wasn't the first time she did something like this, trapping your mind in a body of some insect she was about to crush. She would always block some of your memories while doing so, to make sure the experience was always as fresh and terrifying as possible. She was goddess, but also a demoness incarnate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, tears began streaming down your face, as some of the slug's remains began to seep out from underneath Del's unrelenting paw. Once she was well and truly finished with it she dragged her foot back with a 'satisfying' squelch, and then revealed its disgusting sole for your 'viewing pleasure'. She crushed that slug real good, its 'essence' spread evenly across the enite bottom of her paw, making it even more repulsive to look at... And the prospect of what was to come even less enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"clred\">Now,</span></i> she 'said', putting her foot down with one last squish, <i><span class=\"clred\">With the foreplay done, we can finally move onto some truly titillating stuff. Hmm, I think I want...</span></i></span></div></div>",

Generally these weak Pokemon wouldn't be an issue, but Totodile had no energy left to battle so you had to try your best to fight them off, which failed. The Caterpie and Bulbasaur worked together using String Shot and Vine Whip to bind you and Smeargle and the Oddish carried you off into the forest... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this dark part of the forest, there was a clearing where a throne-shaped tree root stood. Sitting on this was a Gloom, wearing what appeared to be a crown made of vines and a large brown leaf in the center. The Oddish threw you on the ground and carried Totodile away. The queen Gloom slowly approached you, in your helpless cocoon state. She smiled and raised her left foot, indicating towards it. It was obvious what she wanted.</span></div></div>",

This pungent aroma nearly made you throw up, and the Gloom was particularly proud of this fact. But you had much more torture in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gloom made you smell her left foot for the next ten minutes, and then she switched it with her right. Her right foot smelled even worse and at this point you were close to fainting. You couldn't take much more of this and the thought of how you were ever going to escape from this. You were wondering what had happened to Totodile and was wondering whether he was going through the same sort of smelly hell somewhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another ten minutes the Gloom removed her right foot and you had about twenty seconds of fresh air.

As you kissed from the arch to the ball your nose was thrusted up into her footflesh as you did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she deemed you to have done a satisfactory job the Queen switched her right leg over and you started on her left foot, kissing it as thoroughly as you could.

If it would please you to squash me like a disgusting bug that I am, then do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i>Ooooo~</i></span> Gardevoir cooed, clearly satisfied with your response. <span class=\"cbgreen\"><i>How noble of a you, my pathetic, little speck. I think I'll keep you for a bit longer, just to see how far you can go to impress me.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole world rumbled around you, as Gardevoir rose the foot you were clinging to, and sent you falling down with a wiggle of her toes. Now, as you sat it the shadow it cast, you were given a good of view of the absolute enormity that was the bottom of goddess' foot. A wide expanse of mostly pristine, white flesh, marred here and there with streaks of sweat, and dirt stains of unknown origins. To you, however, it only added to the appeal of her feet, as did the many ridges, and wrinkles, that were much more distinguishable at your current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Gardevoir abruptly kicked her foot towards you. Like a deer caught in the headlights, you watched as her giant heel made its grinding towards you, and it was only due to the mercy of your goddess (and the length of her leg) that she didn't run you over with it. Instead, the giantess settled her foot on the back of its heel, with its sole rising above you like a giant wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i>Here's the task I have for you, my little worm.

You would have no trouble licking her foot clean, if she just lowered her sole so you could reach it. However, having to get around her foot like a climbing wall in order to clean it posed a much greater challenge. You weren't sure if you were up for it, but you'd be damned if you didn't try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath of the rich, pungent scent of her lovely feet, you approached the giantess' heel, ready to get on with your job.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a Mega Lopunny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've heard of those before, but you've never actually got to see a real one. Lopunnies are rarely used by Pokemon trainers, since it's pretty hard to actually evolve one, and they're not that great at fighting. In contrary, Mega Lopunny is a nearly perfect fighter, able to hit its opponents really hard, and really fast, but its Mega Stone is really hard to come across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet here you were, staring at one of the rarest Pokemon in the world, and a mighty fine specimen at that. Lopunnies, even when Mega evolved, are pretty short by Pokemon standard, yet this one could give even your pretty tall Gardevoir a run for her money. You got a better proof of that, when Gardevoir sternly approached your unexpected visitor, and had to crank her neck up a little to be able to look Lopunny in her scarlet eyes.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i><br>\r\n\"What do you want?\"</i></span> Gardevoir 'spat' out at the Mega. Even though she was talking telephatically to Lopunny, she still allowed you to 'hear' her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny didn't seem too bothered by your Pokemon's apparent enmity. In fact, she found her quite cute.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><i>\"Aww, why so angry? I'm not here to fight you.\"</i></span> The Mega responded, cracking a grin at Gardevoir. <span class=\"ctan\"><i>\"I just saw you two having 'fun', and thought that maybe I could join in. That's all, really~\"<br>\r\n</i></span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i>\"Hah!\"</i></span> Gardevoir let out a haughty laugh, mighty amused by Lopunny's proposition. <span class=\"cbgreen\"><i>\"Sorry, but I'm not one to share my slaves. I'm afraid you'll have to find your own.\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was the rabbit's turn to flaunt, the Mega snickering at Gardevoir's 'advice'.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><i>\"Oooo~, but I do have a slave of my own. In fact, he's right here. Say hi to my loyal foot tattoo~\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lopunny kicked her right leg upwards, almost crashing her paw in your Gardevoir's face, though she stopped herself just in time to leave her padded sole hanging right in front of your Pokemon. At first, Gardevoir took it as a missed attack, and was ready to blow the rabbit away with a Moonblast or some other super effective move. However, as Lopunny continued to stand still in the face of the oncoming attack, only lightly swaying her leg to the left and right, Gardevoir understood that she was in no real danger. Taking a deep breath, she calmed herself down, and focused on the (admittedly pretty nice-looking) paw that the Mega presented to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, she spotted what Lopunny wanted her to see. Spread across the entirety of her main pawpad, was a human. A young man, by the looks of him, dressed in some stylish clothes. However, as she took a better look at him, Gardevoir shockingly noted that the boy wasn't just stuck to his Pokemon's foot. Flat like a sticker, he was firmly ironed to Lopunny's pawpad, effectively becoming her 'foot tattoo', as she herself called him. Though she hated to admit it, Gardevoir was enamored by this sight. A human life whole consumed by his Pokemon's foot, the poor girl couldn't help it but find it incredibly arousing. Against her better judgment, Gardevoir inched her face even closer towards Lopunny's paw, just to get a better look at the 'sticker boy'. As a result, the Mega's pungent foot odour became less tolerable, but nothing she couldn't handle. In fact, it only served to strengthen her arousal, as she imagined how the boy must've felt, his sense of smell literally dominated by the giant Pokemon's foot musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs abruptly as she brought her foot up, Lopunny lowered it back to the ground, twisting it left and right a few times for good measure. Looking back at Gardevoir she couldn't help but giggle a little at the sight of her disappointment, the Psychic longingly gazing at the top of her paw, blushing a little at the sight of her four wriggling toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><i>\"I take it that you liked what you saw, hmm~?\"</i></span> Lopunny asked smugly, confident that she could get Gardevoir to do what she wanted now. The Psychic type shyly nodded in response.<br>\r\n<i>\"Would you like to learn, how I did it?\"</i></span> Now the rabbit sounded a bit nicer, taking on a more mentor-y role towards your smaller Pokemon to ease her into agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gardevoir responded, she looked back at you, seeking your approval. To her utter surprise, you were madly blushing,  clearly aroused by Lopunny's earlier showcase as well. While Gardevoir imagined how great it would feel to dominate you like this, you thought how it great it would be to become a part of her foot, and have your world be consumed by the scent, and taste, and feel of her dainty, beautiful sole. As a matter of fact, you couldn't think of anything better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to have you on board, Gardevoir turned around to address Lopunny face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\"><i>\"Yes, I want to know. Please, teach me your ways!\"</i></span> the Psychic exclaimed loudly, so eager to turn you into her little foot sticker. For some wicked reason, you found that incredibly cute... and kinda hot too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mega answered with a big, hearty fit of laughter, very happy to get a positive response from the Psychic type.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><i>\"Haha, that's the spirit! How about we get to it right away then?\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any objections, the two Pokemon made their way towards the middle of the room, where they would have a lot of space to work with. Once there, Lopunny pointed her finger at you, and said: <span class=\"ctan\"><i>\"Bring him over here, and lay him down by our feet. Where he rightfully belongs~\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir did as asked, using her psychic powers to levitate you off the bed, and carefully move you towards the ground at their feet. You watched with mouth agape, as their tall forms towered over your meager self. You already thought of Gardevoir as gigantic back when she was laying down on your bed, but this... Now that she stood above you at her full height, she seemed so impossibly massive. A true goddess, if there ever was one... Even though there were two of them now, with Mega Lopunny looking pretty freaking divine herself from down here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at their feet, you noted how Gardevoir's been scrunching her toes in anticipation. Lopunny was more in control of her emotions, slowly drumming her plump, furry tootsies on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><i>\"Now then, let us begin~\"</i></span></div></div>",

It's immediately clear who the culprit is, you'd recognize that sour aroma anywhere. For some reason, your Gardevoir had pinned you beneath her arch, denying the Lopunny's furry foot its prize.

Until, eventually...</span>\" Both giantesses have shifted their full focus back to you, making you squirm pitifully underneath their gaze. The Lopunny grins down at you mischievously while Gardevoir's eyes are wide with anticipation, softly nibbling on her lip at the thought of having you stuck fast against her sole as her toes twitch eagerly against the carpet on either side of you. Her pale, little puppies seemingly can't wait to get a hold of you. Sadly, you'll only be able to grant one of the two beauties its wish. You look longingly at them, wondering which one will end up claiming you as their little prize. \"<span class=\"ctan\">He'll have fully become part of it.</span>\", The Mega-Lopunny finishes, causing a small shudder to run along the spine of your aroused partner. \"<span class=\"ctan\">He'll be as impossible to separate from your foot as your actual toes.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">There's no going back?</span>\", She hopefully asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">There's no going back.</span>\", The giant bunny calmly assures her \"<span class=\"ctan\">Once he's progressed far enough, he'll be stuck as your little insole forever~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Do it.

The brown paw hangs precariously over you, close enough for you to count the individual strands of its fur. You can't help but breathe deeply of  oppressive stench washing over you. It's certainly very different from what you're used too. While Gardevoir's foot stink smelled more sharply like vinegar, this Loppuny's musk seems much more potent. Earthy, stale and heavy as if it made the air itself weigh more, you were already being dominated by the foot before it even touched you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rabbits sole completely filling your view, you immediately see a downside of the Pok\u00e9mon turning that other person into a tattoo instead of a servant. Her foot is disgustingly filthy. Clumps of dried sweat and grime cover most of the sole, it's clearly not been cleaned any time recent. Gardevoir's conditioning makes you feel pained by the sorry state of the neglected sole. Almost instinctively, you hold out your arms and prepare your tongue to give the poor thing its sorely needed pampering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last it came down, slowly, gently settling down on top of your body. Your stretched arms prove no match as it effortlessly pushes them back down, leaving you with a twinge of regret as you were unable to serve the great furry paw as it deserved. You feel its filth slither up against your body, finding its way into your clothes as the grimy pad molds itself approvingly against your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">The hardest bit is not squishing them by accident</span>\", the rabbit educates your pok\u00e9mon, uncaring of your plight beneath her. \"<span class=\"ctan\">It's a pain to clean their remains off of your foot, and you'll need to go out and find another toy if you do</span>\". You quietly scoff at the implication this Lopunny has ever cleaned her paw of anything as you lap at her pad, adamant to polish the small area you can reach at least. \"<span class=\"ctan\">In order to avoid that, I tend to use some combination of moves to raise their defense like so</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, you can feel your skin and muscles contract and tighten. It's making you itch all over, your skin slowly losing its flexibility as it turns hard as steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Now he should be able to withstand pretty much anything I throw at him, which means I don't have to be as gentle anymore, see?</span>\" You knew it was coming, but nothing could have prepared you for the massive weight suddenly forced down on you. You even heard Gardevoir gasp as the oppressive sole relentlessly crushed you beneath it. You feel it bend around you, the filthy thing seeming to swallow you up within it. You are submerged in complete darkness as you feel her foot settle on the ground around you, leaving you in complete darkness as the only defiant little pebble to deny her sole its passage to the floor. For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Now we just wait. The defense enhancements from earlier will slowly start to wear off, gradually letting my paw squish him flat.</span>\" The Lopunny simply continues her lesson, talking about you as if you weren't even there! After giving it some thought, you suppose it would be odd if she did care about the feelings of someone she's turning into a little foot sticker. \"<span class=\"ctan\">We just need to make sure to heal him from time to time. His crushed body will then mend itself within the ever shrinking space available to it until he ends up flat as a pancake!</span>\" The giant rabid excitedly exclaims. \"<span class=\"ctan\">All you need then is patience for your foot to accept its little treat while you grind him into your sole with every step you take.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the Lopunny's prediction to come true. Slowly, your body relaxes again,  buckling under her oppressive weight. Your breathing becomes more labored as her foot mercilessly crushes your chest. You can feel her sole sinking into you, as if you were an inflatable mattress leaking out its air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay there, helplessly suckling on the rabbit's foot flesh, you start to become acutely aware of every single one of her foot's motions. Every clench and flex of her toes, every slight shift in posture to keep her balance. Eventually, you even experience its tactile sensations, her big fuzzy toes gleefully rubbing together feeling as if they were lovingly cradling your face between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Hmm... I think he's ready</span>\" With a flex of her powerful muscles, you feel yourself rise, stuck firmly to the Lopunny's sole like a wad of gum. With your face plastered against her sole, you're pretty much flying blind, forced to rely on the little input you get from your now exposed back, as well as the rest of the dominant paw. With a jerk, you feel yourself stop. \"<span class=\"ctan\">How does he look~?</span>\" You assume the giant rabbit is showing you off to Gardevoir. You're proven correct as you soon feel your pok\u00e9mon's breath on your back, ruffling the fur between the Mega-evolution's toes as it blows through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">A-Amazing... He's really stuck there like a lost, little bug</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your Gardevoir's breath getting heavier, no doubt she's getting flustered by imagining you stuck fast to her own sole. You slowly feel her psychic power building near one of your arms, looking to peel you off the bunny's foot so she can try you out herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No matter how hard she tried, Gardevoir simply couldn't free you from the tight hold Lopunny's paw had over your body. She pulled at you with the most powerful Psychic she could muster, but you wouldn't budge an inch. You were firmly stuck in it, consumed by the furry Pokemon's sweltering pawpad like the many clumps of first and grime that coated its vast surface. You yourself made an effort to assist your Pokemon in her endeavor, but seemingly to no avail. You tried to push, pry, wriggle yourself free, but you were too far gone into it to at this point made any significant difference. Worse still, being stuck face first into her dirty paw, with your body semi-squished flat like it was, it made you feel very weak, hopeless, and completely at the mercy of the overbearing foot's unsettling owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired of her fer fruitless attempts at getting you back, Gardevoir finally snapped in anger at the Mega, who stood above her all tall'n'mighty-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Hey! I can't get him off your smelly paw! Help me right this instant, or else!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny merely smirked smugly at the Psychic Fairy sitting at her feet, enjoying how cute Gardevoir looked when she was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Haaa~ Fine, fine. I'll get to it. Just try to take a hold of his body, and I'll take care of the rest.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an annoyed groan, your Pokemon did what was asked of her, and pinched your body as tightly as she could, while her other hand grabbed Lopunny's ankle. From your current position you could hear your Gardevoir dissatisfied mumbling. She clearly didn't like the idea of getting her hands anywhere near Lopunny's putrid paws, something even a foot enthusiast like yourself couldn't really blame her for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">You ready?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Yes. Let's get this over with.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Alright then. Here. I...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lopunny's leg lurched backward, taking the unprepared Gardevoir with is, and slamming her face into the Mega's stinky sole, and your body that was stuck to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">GO!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit giantess then kicked her foot forward, crashing it into the defenseless, disoriented Psychic type's face, before carrying it all the way to the ground, and ending with a powerful, brutal stomp. Your Pokemon was left knocked out on the floor, at the mercy of the cruel Lopunny's wicked whims. The Mega didn't waste any time literally rubbing her victory into the Fairy's face, as she gleefully grinded the dirt and sweat off her foot into Gardevoir's once pristine face. Of course, she used the paw that you were stuck to, finding it delightfully ironic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know exactly what happened, but from the sounds alone you were able to tell that it meant nothing good for you, or your Pokemon. Once again you tried fighting back against the Mega's oppressive sole, but your struggles were for naught. All the kicking, and stomping, and grinding underfoot that the sadistic rabbit subjected your Gardevoir to, also served to iron you even further into her sweaty pawpad. With every second you were getting flatter, stickier, more and more inseparable from Lopunny's grimy, sweaty foot, something she couldn't get enough of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Ahhh~ How I love the feeling of little, worthless humans getting gradually more stuck to my perfect feet. It's been sooooo long since I did that to my trainer, I almost forgot what a joy it was to experience. Oh, I need more of it, more of you pathetic things squirming at my feet. Where could I find another victim, though?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lopunny thought of her next course of action, she inadvertently began tapping one of her feet. Surprise surprise, it was the one you were stuck to. Predictably, it only served to further drive you into her putrid pawpad, and squish your body into the foot tattoo that she wanted you to become. You didn't know how much time you had left before you became a permanent smear on her sole, but it couldn't be much at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to think what to do next, Lopunny's eyes once again fell on Gardevoir's unconscious form. Then, as she began to absentmindedly rub one of her toes on the Psychic Fairy's lips, the Mega suddenly came up with an idea, and a delightfully malevolent one at that. While she preferred her slaves to be human, a humanoid Pokemon like Gardevoir could almost pass for one of those pathetic things. In fact, this one already got on her nerves, to the point where she wouldn't really mind seeing her be put in her place, right underneath Lopunny's superior, smelly paws. Besides, if she were to leave that Psychic alone, she would definitely come looking for her little slave, and the big, bad bunny that kidnapped him. Getting rid of her right now would definitely save the Mega some trouble in the future<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock was ticking, and Mega Lopunny had to make her choice. What does she end up doing?</span></div></div>",

Though, it wasn't hard to figure out judging by Lopunny's scream,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh!</span>\" she exclaimed, looking up at the seething Gardevoir who stood up, removing the dirt from her face and glaring down at the Mega Lopunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Hehe~ whoops!</span>\" she said innocently, before her paws connected with the ground; her legs rose high in the air before Lopunny pushed herself up, both her legs aiming at Gardevoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, both her feet connected with your poor pokemon's chest as she was hit while you were shoved deeper into your cruel, smelly entrapment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny finally landed, your dazed pokemon stumbled back, all the air knocked out of her lungs by the sheer force of the dual kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally regained the ability to speak, Gardevoir snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... You tricked me!</span>\" she stated the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Why of course~! Couldn't resist the idea of a second foot-tattoo~</span>\" she sang mischievously, before lifting her leg, whose foot you were stuck to, and trying to kick Gardevoir again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the foot never landed on your pokemon; instead, it stopped at several inches from her face, held by psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lopunny could process what was going on, she was thrown backwards by the psychic/fairy-type's mind power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny was slammed into a tree, then levitated up in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached a decent height, Gardevoir let go of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, her mind saw the brown/cream bunny crashing to the ground, but then her mouth hung open as the Mega Lopunny suddenly readjusted in mid-air and performed Jump Kick, hitting Gardevoir in the face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pokemon felt sick, some of the dirt of the cream paw ended up in her mouth, your flat form helplessly slid against her white face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clgreen\">Disgusting!</span></i>\u2019 she thought, feeling her consciousness fading once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she managed to hang on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, when Lopunny was about to dish out another kick with her powerful legs, Gardevoir hit the normal/fighting-type with a super-effective Moonblast, which had the effect of making the overgrown rabbit fall to the ground once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were suffering hell. Each time Lopunny hit Gardevoir or vice versa, you were forced deeper into the smelly pad by the vibrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, you had managed to open your mouth to scream, but it was invaded by the Lopunny's foot-flesh and was violated by the disgusting filth that was stuck to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you were subjected to an immense pressure as Lopunny stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fighting pokemon, they walked in circles for a few moments, before Gardevoir's opponent tried to attack again, but again the psychic-type used her mind power to grip Lopunny's whole leg and lifted her in the air, spun her around before she threw her like a javelin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just like a javelin, Lopunny landed head-first on the ground, her head hitting the roots of a large tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny didn't get up after that. As a matter of fact, she didn't move at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding that her opponent had finally fainted, Gardevoir rushed to her feet, which were laying limp on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Lopunny's first foot-tattoo, Gardevoir moved to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surrounded by a cyan light as the giantess performed Pyschic on you and started pulling, trying to peel you off Lopunny's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was her chance to leave the bunny and avoid further conflict, Gardevoir figured out, but she needed her former trainer first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few pulls had no effect aside from making you scream in pain, your skin stuck to Lopunny's like glue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to move your arms and legs to ease Gardevoir's task (whatever she had planned for you, it was going to be better than this for sure).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as time drew on without any noticeable results, you quickly understood that you were stuck into the paw-pad even more than you or Gardevoir had thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on, come on...</span>\" Gardevoir whispered nervously as she pulled with Psychic once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be quick: Lopunny wasn't going to stay unconscious for long.</span></div></div>",

The psychic goth pokemon had taken complete control over your body, and you were now utterly helpless. Just as you were realizing that you were totally at her mercy, the Gothorita that had you trapped began using her psychic powers to speak into your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Well, well, well... What do we have here? A little human has decided that they have the right to trespass on <i>MY</i> turf? I must say, human, you're the first in a long time to be foolish enough to invade my territory. What do you have to say for yourself?\"<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nYou gulp in fear as you begin to respond. She seemed really irritated with you, and a powerful psychic pokemon like her could easily make your life into a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please Miss Gothorita, I never intended to trespass anywhere! I just dropped something of mine around here earlier, so I had to come back and get it. I was already leaving, so please don't hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic goth simply smirked mischievously at you.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\"><br>\r\n\"Well little human, I can't just let your little crime go unpunished, can I? I think that you need to learn your lesson now, otherwise you'll think that it's perfectly okay to invade my turf in the future!\"<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n\"What?! But I didn't even mean to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words were cut off as the Gothorita used her psychic powers to force your mouth shut. You could only whimper in fear as she walked right up next to you and gave you a light shove. Normally you could have easily caught yourself, but Gothorita's psychic powers had your entire body paralyzed. She simply giggled at you as she watched your body collapse backward and fall to the ground. She then stepped forward until her petite figure was standing right on top of your chest. You could only watch in horror as the psychic goth sat down on top of you and ran one of her hands down the side of your cheek. Giggling deviously, Gothorita spoke into your mind once again.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\"><br>\r\n\"Now then, I think that I have just the thing in mind to punish a foolish <i>little</i> human like you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the blue glow in her eyes vanished. You immediately attempted to move, but you found that you were still frozen in place. Just then, Gothorita's eyes began glowing bright red. Suddenly, you started feeling the weight of Gothorita's body becoming slightly heavier. As you stared up at her in fear, you saw that she was slowly beginning to grow bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you looked around, you saw that this wasn't exactly the case. Everything around you was growing as well, which could only mean one thing: You were shrinking! Soon, Gothorita's light weight was becoming far too much for you to endure. Just as you thought that you were going to be crushed beneath the psychic goth's rear end, she stood up and stepped off of you. You were now able to breath freely once again, but the sight of the towering goth pokemon was becoming terrifying. Within mere moments, you had been reduced to only 1 inch tall! At that point, your shrinking stopped, and Gothorita reached down to pick you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another mischievous smile, she spoke into your mind again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Alright little human, I think that this size is<i> much</i> more fitting for you!

She squeezed you lightly it seemed to her, but for your size it felt like a boa constrictor. In a panic you bit down hard between her hand and her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"YEE! Ow, vile <i>HUMAN</i>!\"</span> Gothorita hissed in a rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw you violently in a rage straight at the ground at her feet. You hardly had time to think before she lifted her foot high above you, and brought it crashing down. The sole completely enveloped your body, and the only action possibly was to smell her giant foot, which was difficult in itself because of the pressure. It wasn't long before she started grinding you into the dirt and grass. Unbeknownst to you, Gothorita was using her psychic abilities to also keep you alive to endure more torture, at least until she was done with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loli pokemon was far from done. After rubbing you with the bottom of her foot, she rolled you up under her toes and proceded to grind and crush even harder. Being between her toes created immense pressure from every angle. After she was done with her revenge, she slowly lifted her dark grey foot up, with you limply mashed on the bottom of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"ahHAhaha, that is just repulsive! Im must say though, a human has never looked so good.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gothorita's smile curled devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"Now, little slave, time to get to the cleaning...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gothorita placed the foot with you on it down, pressing you back into the grass.

As soon as you were in her grasp, pain shocked your body. Despite her keeping you alive, the gargantuan sized pokemon's trampling has definitely taken it's toll. She isn't even squeezing roughly and you are still just barely conscious. You can no longer think straight as the Gothorita takes you deeper into the woods. The trees whip by you in a daze. You finally reach another clearing in the woods with short grass, beautiful flowers, and a stump dead in the center. Moonlight bathed the entire area, which you could see now that your head was starting to clear. The Gothorita walked briskly to the stump in the clearing, and sat on top of it. She held her palm flat, and brought you to her face, glaring at you with a sour expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much effort, you tried to talk to her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-pleease...COUGH... I-I-I just...Not all humans are bad, I mean you must have met SOME kind ones COUGH...Please find it in yourself...HACK...to let...COUGH...me go free\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrowed. She frowned and pursed her lips before speaking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"You must think humans did something cruel to me in my life. What a silly gesture, I've never been inside a pokeball. While I do particularly hate humans I enjoy torturing smaller pokemon as well. Something about watching them suffer, and not having the ability to escape, makes me aroused...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started tipping her outstretched palm towards the ground, allowing you to slip off. You hit the rough grass hard and yell out in pain. This made the Gothorita smile. Then, all you could see were her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour faced was pressed up against her footflesh. It squished around your entire body and covered you in sweat. It wasn't long till you realized you couldn't breath. She was smothering you underneath her feet, and she didn't care if you lived or died. As your oxygen ran short you tried squirming more and more. There was no way out unless the Gothorita willed it. She cupped you under both feet, making the smell unbearable. You could see the dark grey soles of her feet wrinkle above you. Then she set them back down on your body, cutting off you air supply again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis game continued for way too long. You are smothered by Gothorita's sweat covered and stinky feet until she lets you breath for a couple seconds. Then it gets worse when she starts to rub you slowly up and down with both feet, completely covering you in grime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat nasty grin grows back on her face as she says to you, <span class=\"cplum\">\"If you don't want to die I suggest... \"</span></span></div></div>",

But then you noticed your Gothitelle smirking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Gothitelle?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,nothing much, 'master'. and I use the term loosely.\" Gothitelle said, folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Gothitelle?\" you asked, getting a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go somewhere a bit more private...\" Gothitelle said, with her eyes glowing. She then used her psychic powers to teleport you and her to a well-kept room somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do anything, you were psychically lifted up in the air and stripped of all your clothing except for your boxers. Then you were placed on the bed and roped then appeared to tied you to the bedposts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gothitelle! You're starting to scare me!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologise, But I must take special precautions that you will belong to me and only me...\" Gothitelle said, with hearts in her eyes. \"Now then, to help you calm down, I shall...\"</span></div></div>",

W-When did you start feeling like this towards me?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you had caught me and befriended me.\" Gothitelle said,slowly raising her skirt. \"My feeling increased when you took me out on all those dates!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dates? those were outings with a friend!\" you said, trying to break free of the ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were dates. I made you take me out on dates, but also made you think they were only outings.\" Gothitelle said as she finished lifting up her skirt, showing you her thong underwear as she slowly spun around while still heading towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered in fear as as her words hit you. For a long time, she had you under her control. Only now, was she letting you know of your real place in the relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Did you hurt anyone in your pursuit of me?\" you asked, fearing the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That would be admitting I had lost a bit of my place in your heart.\" Gothitelle said, now floating above you and shaking her derriere in a sexy way. \"So I allowed all those hussies to get near you, to learn what pleases my man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then placed her bottom on...</span></div></div>",
