Moon is far too steep to climb so the only way is through the mountain itself.  Inside is a maze of caverns and tunnels filled with pokemon--mostly Zubat and Geodude or any number of rock-type pokemon.  The mountain is also home to wild clefairy that would evolve into clefable when exposed to a Moon Stone.  The mountain is known for its Moon Stones hence the name Mt. Moon.  The mountain has been hit by countless meteorites over the years--those meteorites becoming Moon Stones.   It is also home to pokemon fossils.   <br>\r\n                                        It's very easy to get lost in the tunnels of Mt. Moon.   For someone like Misty--who grew up in Cerulean City--Mt. Moon is easy to navigate through.  She had been visiting Mt. Moon ever since she was little.  She felt some strange connection to Mt. Moon as if the mountain had been her home long ago.  But that was sheer none sense; Misty had always lived in Cerulean and yet she couldn't shake this feeling that Mt. Moon had been her home once upon a time.  <br>\r\n                          Misty was going through the tunnels of Mt. Moon now to meet up with Ash and Brock in Pewter City.  Ash had come home to the Kanto region from one of the far-off regions he went off to every year or so.  This time he was coming back from some place called Unova...which was <i>far</i> from Kanto.  Each time that Ash came back home he would visit his friends Brock and Misty.   Misty had wanted Ash to stay in Kanto but Ash was always looking for a new region to explore.  The last time she had talked to Ash he had been going on about some region called Kalos or something like that.  Before Ash went to Kalos, he decided to go back to Kanto for the spring and summer--perhaps for the rest of the year.  That suited Misty just fine.  Misty had missed Ash and she was eager to meet up with him again.  <br>\r\n                           \"Geodude!\"  came a sudden cry from the ground.    Misty had tripped on a rock that turned out to be a Geodude.  Misty tried to save herself from falling over to the hard rock floor of the cave but in vain.  Misty hit the ground hard. Geodude huffed off to parts unknown.  Misty grumbled as she got herself up from the ground.  When she did so she noticed something shiny on the floor just ahead of where she had fallen.   Misty took a closer look.  The object was clearly a gem that was slightly smaller than a Moon Stone...which she knew because there was a Moon Stone right beside the gem.  The gem was green in color...did that mean it was an emerald?  Misty picked up the gem.  <br>\r\n                         \"This is pretty...\" said Misty examining the gem more closely.  <br>\r\n                           <i>Mistress...</i>  <br>\r\n                           The voice was faint and came from <i>inside</i> her head!<br>\r\n                         \"Hello?\" asked Misty aloud.<br>\r\n                            There was no reply.  <br>\r\n                               \"Did you just talk?\" asked Misty nervously looking at the gem.  <br>\r\n                               No reply.<br>\r\n                              \"Must have been my imagination\" muttered Misty, pocketing the gem in her jean shorts and continued on her way to meet up with her two friends. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After finding a strange green toned gem in Mt. Moon's many cavernous mazes. Misty had thought she heard a voice come from it. But after question the stone and getting no response, she pocketed into her left jean short's pocket and continued on her way to Pewter City to meet up with Ash and Brock. However, while on her way there. A faint child-like voice whispered in her head, \"Grrrrrooooooow.\" the word was softly said. Misty didn't hear this since her mind was on something else, but the voice continued to whisper softly in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Misty was nearing Pewter City limits, she had tripped over yet another object, though this time it wasn't a Pokemon, but a exposed tree root. But before Misty could react to her fall, she suddenly heard the child-like voice whisper, \"Grrrrrooooooow.\" Then Misty with out thinking, repeated out loud what she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrroooooooow?\" Misty had asked in a confused tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the stone sitting comfortably in her left jean short's pocket started to glow faintly and started to pour energy into her left thigh. Misty didn't feel anything, since the pain from the fall was the only thing she was feeling, though she did start to feel this odd feeling starting to occur now. It was faint, but she could feel something. Like her skin was slowly stretching or something like that. It wasn't really painful, but it did feel very weird. Misty had finally stood up and dusted off her jean shorts and overall. But as she did this, she could help but feel like something was slightly off, but what though, she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up herself, she continued on her way to Pewter City. Unknowing to her, she had grown almost a whole inch! But this was only the start of something really troubling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Arriving in Pewter City... </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty met up with Ash and Brock in Pewter city finally, though they quickly noticed the faint dirt stains all over her clothes. Ash snickered, while Brock asked what had happen. Misty shrugged at first and then remembered the cave. She explained about the Geodude she tripped over and was going to explain the tree root she tripped over too, but decided not to, since Ash was already snickering and she didn't want to give him an excuse in calling her a klutz... But the three went together into Pewter City and decided to do a few things together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock asked if they wanted to try out the new mall that had just opened and both Ash and Misty agreed, though for different reasons. When they entered the mall, Misty thought of maybe buying a new set of clothes, since she did want something else to wear everyday besides her overall strap suspender, yellow t-shirt, jean short combo. It's not like she didn't like how she looked, it's just she like to have a little more option while she is still travailing with her friends and all. She had found some cute clothes and decided to try them all. Ash and Brock had comeback around in the mall and saw Misty buying some clothes. Brock sighed, \"Oh no, she's buying clothes again... this will take a while Ash.\" Ash saw this and sighed, along with Pikachu. So the three decided to go eat at the food court maybe or something else till Misty's surfaces again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Misty was trying on some clothes, a clerk offered to help her. Misty accepted and thanked her. While Misty was in the middle of changing shirts, the stone started to flare up again. Misty started to exchange her clothes for the new ones with the clerk, when that odd whisper happen again. Only this time, Misty suddenly said the word out loud subconsciously, but then reacted unconsciously unaware as to what just happen. The store clerk stared at Misty with a puzzled look repeating what she had just said out loud too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty quickly blushed and asked what did she just say to her? The store clerk then blushed and replied, \"I-I just repeated what you just said, you said, grow. I didn't mean to miss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming red a crossed her face, she quickly jerked back into the changing room. The store clerk felt stupid and pleaded, \"Please forgive me miss. I'm not trying to mock you. I really wasn't.\" Misty stepped back and tried to figure out what happen, she had said something with out truly realizing it. First she found a odd stone, and then sworn she heard a voice, and now she is speaking random words with out realizing it?! Was she going crazy she thought. But while this was all racing through her head, that odd skin stretching feeling was occurring once again. Though again, Misty hadn't realized it, she just felt it. Which only fueled her mini breakdown. Slowly her jean shorts began to slowly cup tighter around her upper thighs and waist line. It was slow and really unnoticeable, but it was happening. But not only to her shorts, but the rest of her clothes too. Her yellow t-shirt slowly rose up, but it was barely even half an inch higher though, with her suspenders growing just slightly tighter against her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty had once again, grew another inch! But after calming down, she regained her composure and took in a deep breath, \"It's okay, I'm okay, I'm just being a little too excited right now, that's it.\" After calming down, Misty pulled her head back through the curtain and faced the clothing store clerk face to face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sorry, I don't know what happen. I guess I must be having one of those days.\" Misty laughed awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothing store clerk felt better and smiled, since she now felt like she didn't insult her or something. Misty continued her attempt to try on some clothes, but for how long till her next whisper?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>=Addition Notice=</b><br>\r\nWhen ever she hears the whisper Grow from the young child-like voice in the gem, she subconsciously says it out loud as well. Like in a trance almost. She doesn't know she is growing yet and she isn't going to like it either. So for now, keep her spurts very small. The growth is also not very painful, but not pleasant either for the most part. Last, clothes do not grow with her, period. </span></div></div>",

The rest of her time clothes shopping went by in peace, trying out this and seeing how it matched up with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, mostly in peace. A vague but pervading sense of \"offness\" bothered her. Everything she tried felt smaller than it should have. But how could that be? She'd been wearing the same size for years! What was going on here? Incorrect measurements? No, not likely. Maybe it had to do with that weird, stretched-out feeling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I have a growth spurt?\" she asked her reflection as she evaluated a navy blue tank top. \"I don't look any fatter, and I haven't put on any muscle, so maybe I just...grew. I know I finished puberty a long time ago, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down to her shorts on the bench, specifically at a bump in one of its pockets. Was the gem causing all this? Was it sentient? She did start hearing that voice after picking it up, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Misty forced herself to focus on shopping. Fretting over things in a changing room wouldn't accomplish anything. Better to focus on her shopping trip now and...search Mt. Moon for clues later or something. And as she thought that last part, she couldn't help but smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Misty. You sure are hungry today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika Pika.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked up from her lunch--a large combo meal of some fast food chain's signature burger--to find Ash, Pikachu, and Brock staring at her with mildly dumbfounded expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she replied, her words muffled from her current mouthful, \"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you ever dug into my cooking like this.\" There was a hint of dejection in Brock's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Misty swallowed. \"It's not that like this stuff that much! Really, it's got nothing on you, Brock! I'm just really, really hungry all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay then.\" Brock's mode seemed to lift a bit at that. \"Did you have a light breakfast this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's not healthy to under-eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty huffed. \"I know that. My breakfast was the same amount it's always been. My trip through Mt. Moon must have taken more out of me than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smirked. \"You mean your trip over that Geodude?\" He snickered, earning a disapproving look from Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring at him, Misty crammed the rest of the burger in her mouth, grumbling under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock sighed. \"Ash, is this really how you plan on acting? It's been so long since we all got together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay, you're right. Sorry, Misty.\" At least Ash dropped his smirk when he said that. \"I guess Iris was right about me being a kid after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty, currently grabbing a handful of fries, stopped and looked back up from her meal. \"Who's Iris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's face lit up. \"She's a friend I made in Unova! See, just after I got there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty tried to listen to Ash's recounting of his adventures. Tried to. But between quelling her appetite and that \"offness\" she couldn't ignore, she could only offer his stories a fraction of her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group's trip through the mall wasn't much help either. Every other step she took only served to remind her of the weight in her pocket. She gripped the gem through her shorts every so often. Said shorts covered less of her thighs than usual. Or did they? It looked that way. Felt that way, too. But considering she could say something out of nowhere and not even realize it, her mental state didn't seem particularly trustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was very worrying, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ended up not buying anything else. \"The clothes and lunch are all I can afford,\" she told them. Ash decided to buy a travel guide for Kalos, insisting he would study it thoroughly and not forget about it (Yeah right, Misty thought). Also some of Pikachu's favorite Poke-Food. Brock went with a new cookbook, hoping to treat all his siblings to something new. They spent the rest of the time either window shopping or just checking out what the mall had to offer. After a good few hours, they deemed the mall to be perfectly decent. Not quite on par with the Celadon Department Store (this new mall lacked an evolutionary stone shop, for example) but useful enough to be a worthwhile addition to Pewter City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that late already?\" Ash asked as they exited. The sun was setting, the sky awash with red, orange, and purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it,\" Misty muttered in response. She looked in the direction of Mt. Moon. Her fingers once again wrapped around the gem-shaped bulge in her pocket. Home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Er, in the direction of home. She <i>felt</i> at home in Mt. Moon, yes, but that didn't make it her actual home, right? Right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Brock asked. \"Cos I was thinking we could all have dinner at my place. My family would love to have you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh, Brock's cooking! She hadn't had that in forever! What a perfect to relive the old days. And they wouldn't even have to get lost in some woods like they used to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Misty still found herself staring longingly at Mt. Moon. It almost called to her, begged her to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great! Count me in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika-Pikachu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Ash and Pikachu. Their faces exuded eagerness. That Cilan person he'd talked about sounded like a great chef in his own right, but there was no way he could serve up the same dose of nostalgia that only Brock's culinary delights could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet Mt. Moon...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Misty paid no mind to the strange voice from earlier as she made her way down the cave path, eventually reaching the Cerulean City exit. Walking out of the cave, she could see the lights of her hometown shining off in the distance, lighting up the night. As she looked over the skyline, that strange feeling from earlier came back, but stronger-- she felt less like the city ahead was her home and more like she belonged back in the deep mountain passages. Before she could ponder much on this, though, a different feeling caught her attention; she could feel the stone in her pocket resonating, and a rising sensation of power leaked from it into her body. She started to tingle all over, the sensation feeling almost pleasant to her, though strange and unfamiliar at the same time. Joining the tingling was a tightening of her clothes, and Misty looked down to see her jean shorts and tank top starting to ride up as her body slowly grew taller. \"What... what's happening to me?\" she asked, her voice sounding distant and dreamy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer questions gave way to a loud moan as her growth sped up, sending waves of pleasure through her body. Her breasts suddenly inflated to several times their size, tearing her top and bra off in a single, swift movement, and she heard a loud rip from behind her as her butt did the same to her shorts and panties. The rest of her body caught up, and now that it was all in sync, Misty continued to swell taller and taller, the cold night air blowing across her naked body and making her thick nipples grow erect in the breeze. She kept moaning, the pleasure now feeling overwhelming as she grew taller than the buildings of the city below, and a stream of warm juices flowed from her moist pussy. Misty eventually stopped growing at about 300 feet, with a river of girl cum at her feet and most of Cerulean City's buildings looking quite a bit smaller than her. The strange crystal that had been at her pocket now sat on the ground at her feet, and she easily spotted its glow even from her new height, instinctively stooping down to pick it up and dropping it between her heaving breasts for safe keeping.</span></div></div>",

The feeling of pleasure tripled....so much so that she started fingering her moist pussy and started to fondle her own heaving breasts.  She moaned softly as her fingers went deeper into her dripping sex seeking out more pleasure.  She was overcome by her horniness so much that she didn't notice things around her anymore.  All that mattered was the waves of pleasure.  She was looking idly at Cerulean City and imagining herself using the building as dildos.  She moaned even louder at that thought and went faster with her fingering.  She fondled her breasts, feeling her erect nipples.    \"Yes....yes...\" she muttered.   \"...Oh....Ash....\"     <br>\r\n                               Misty had spent long lonely nights at her home in Cerulean waiting for Ash to come home.  She wanted to tell him how she felt about him...that she loved him and she knew that he loved her.   She wanted Ash; it was that simple.  She imagined that it was Ash and not herself that was pleasuring her and that pleasure increased ten fold then.   <br>\r\n                            Finally she felt her climax coming and went faster with her hands.   Finally the moment came and Misty let out a shrill scream as a thick stream of her love juices poured to the ground.   The remaining thoughts in her head turned to ash as if the feeling of pleasure was a fire that burned away her remaining thoughts.  It certainly wasn't her first orgasm.  She felt weak-kneed and after a moment fell to her hands and knees and just stayed there for several minutes...or hours...or years.    Her sense of time was no longer there.  <br>\r\n                      When her senses came back to her, Misty stood at her full height of 300 feet. It was still night but it felt much later.  'How long did I stay?' wondered Misty.  Misty looked down at herself and sighed.  There was nothing for it but  continue to Cerulean City.  At a last glance at Mt. Moon Misty stomped her way to her hometown of Cerulean.  The feeling from earlier, that Mt. Moon was her home, returned and Misty thought why she was feeling that.  She wasn't born on Mt. Moon after all.<br>\r\n                          <i>Did you forget so quickly....?</i><br>\r\n                          The voice from earlier.  <br>\r\n                          \"Who are you?\" asked Misty.  \"you talked earlier\"<br>\r\n                            No reply.<br>\r\n                              \"Whatever...\" muttered Misty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         The two young trainers exited Mt. Moon a scant ten minutes after Misty had.   One of the trainers had light brown hair while the other wore a black baseball cap.  There was nothing special about these two trainers save for the fact that they stood near seven feet tall.  The two trainers looked at each other.<br>\r\n                          \"It looked like the crystal has finally found her\" said the trainer with the cap.<br>\r\n                           \"It certainly looks that way, Jeremy\" said the other trainer.  <br>\r\n                           \"Jeremy?\" asked Jeremy.  \"where did you come up with that name?\" <br>\r\n                         \"We can't let on that we're not human\" said the other trainer.   \"the world has changed much since we last walked in it, boyo\"<br>\r\n                           Jeremy looked at himself and his companion.   \"Oh yeah...we're certainly passing for humans, being seven feet tall\"<br>\r\n                            \"A minor detail\" said the brown-haired trainer waving a hand impatiently.   \"shall we be off then?  We are supposed to look after the Mistress after all.  Until she regains her memories\"<br>\r\n                             \"That can talk a long time\" said Jeremy.  <br>\r\n                               \"Even if it takes a million years, boyo\" said the trainer.   \"that is our task after tall\"<br>\r\n                              \"Well what do I call you?\" asked Jeremy.<br>\r\n                              \"I have always been fond of the name 'Noah' \"<br>\r\n                             \"Well, \"Noah\", we can't pass off as young humans like this\" said Jeremy and he then shrank until he was a little over five feet tall.  Noah sighed and shrank until he was five feet tall.   <br>\r\n                                     \"Are we happy now?\" asked Noah.  \"can we go now, boyo?\"<br>\r\n                                      \"After you\" said Jeremy. <br>\r\n                                        Noah started to walk to Cerulean with his companion following close behind.  <br>\r\n                     </span></div></div>",

Ash, Brock and Misty were walking down a well-worn path in a dense forest.  This time the trio wasn't lost, oh no.  The trio had a habit of getting lost on their journey but not this time.  This time the three friends were heading to what was called the \"Legendary Mansion\" that was deep in the heart of the Jotho region.  A recent discovery, the mansion was said to be the home of a legendary pokemon.  The mansion had been long abandoned.   The mansion was estimated to be more than a hundred years old and nobody knew who had owned it originally.  What legendary pokemon had made the mansion its home?  That's what Ash wanted to find out.  There were stories that an incredibly old Ninetales lived in the mansion but a Ninetales wasn't considered a \"legendary pokemon\" even though Ninetales can live up to 1,000 years and said to have mystical powers that came from each of its nine tails.  <br>\r\n                      \"I think that's it\" said Brock.<br>\r\n                         The path that the three were on had led them in a wide-open area and a rambling mansion loomed ahead.  The mansion had five stories to it and was quite a large building.  It also looked old; there was ivy covering most of it and a section of wall had fallen apart.   <br>\r\n                        \"It could take hours to look through that mansion\" said Misty.  <br>\r\n                         \"Oh it doesn't look <i>that</i> big\" said Ash.  <br>\r\n                         \"Are you kidding?\" asked Misty.  \"that mansion looks like it can take up an entire city block!\"<br>\r\n                        \"Why not build the mansion in a city?\" asked Brock.  <br>\r\n                         \"Who knows?\" asked Ash.  \"maybe the owner was a rich recluse\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                              As the three approached the mansion they saw they weren't alone.  Perhaps a dozen people were milling about the entrance.  Right in front of the mansion was a grand garden and behind the mansion there was what looked like a giant hedge maze.  <br>\r\n                              \"What are all these people doing here?\" asked Ash. <br>\r\n                              \"They all came here to look for the legendary pokemon that's said to live here\" said one of the people, a rather short and pudgy kid that looked to be 12 at the most.   \"but they're all to scared to go in\"<br>\r\n                                    \"What's to be scared about?\" asked Ash.<br>\r\n                                  \"Dude, Ninetales could put a curse on you\" said the pudgy kid.   \"there's a Ninetales that lives here too\"  <br>\r\n                                    \"Ninetales isn't a legendary pokemon though\" said Misty.<br>\r\n                                   \"I didn't say it was\" said the pudgy kid.   <br>\r\n                                     \"Well I'm not scared\" said Ash.   \"I want to go in and catch any pokemon that are in there\"<br>\r\n                                     \"Good luck with that\" said the pudgy kid.   \"you can't catch a legendary pokemon\" <br>\r\n                                        \"We'll see about that\" said Ash boldly stepping forward and entering the mansion itself followed by Misty and Brock.   Misty glanced back and the pudgy kid had suddenly disappeared.    <br>\r\n                                       \"Well if that kid isn't scared, I'm not\" said the only adult there, a woman in her mid-20s.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                           \"What's your name?\" asked Ash to the woman that had walked in with them.<br>\r\n                                           \"Carol\" said the woman.  She had long blond hair and average looks and features.  <br>\r\n                                          </span></div></div>",

First the four entered a small foyer before entering a grand room that was four stories tall with a staircase.  A big chandelier hung on the ceiling far above.   The room had three corridors that went to other parts of the mansion.  <br>\r\n               A rather striking Ninetales was sitting at the bottom of the staircase.  Before Ash, Brock and Misty could make ten steps towards the Ninetales they were all hit with a wave of sleepiness.  <br>\r\n          \"That......hypnosis......?\" was all that Brock could manage before entering a trance.  His eyes went unfocused.....which was very hard to tell when it came to Brock.  Ash and Misty fell into a trance too.  Carol smirked at the Ninetales and turned into a Zoroark.   <br>\r\n           \"Our first test subjects\" said the zoroark. <br>\r\n         \"Indeed\" said the Ninetales.  \"Now let's split them up shall we?\" <br>\r\n          The Ninetales walked right in front of Ash.  \"You go the basement\"    Ash nodded vaguely and walked off.  Pikachu was on Ash's shoulder.<br>\r\n          The Ninetales walked over to Brock and spent over a minute mulling over options.   \"You go to the attic\"  Brock obediently started to climb the staircase. Then the Ninetales walked in front of Misty.  <br>\r\n              \"I have something special planned for you\" said the Ninetales.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ************** <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ash found himself in what was clearly a basement.  He was in what looked like a wine cellar judging by the barrels surrounding him.   The room was lit by bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling.<br>\r\n       \"Uhm...What?\" asked Ash.  \"How did I get here?\"  <br>\r\n      \"You  just walked in here\" said a feminine voice.  Ash turned around to see an unfamiliar Pokemon.  Ash pointed his pokedex at it and a robotic voice said, \"Delphox the Fox Pokemon.  It can see into the future by looking at the flame at the end of its stick\" <br>\r\n            \"What is a pokemon like you doing here?\" asked Ash. \"You're not native to Jotho...hey!  You just talked!\"<br>\r\n             The Delphox smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first she didn't recognize the room she was in.  It was filled with tables and beakers...it was some sort of lab by the looks of it.  Looked to be abandoned for a long time as spider webs were everywhere and at least a quarter of the roof was missing.  It had been a drop of rain that landed on her face that woke her up.  She looked up and saw the clouds in the sky.    Ivy was everywhere and a young tree was starting to grow right in the middle of the lab below a hole in the ceiling.   Misty was all alone here.<br>\r\n              What happened?  Where was she?  Where was this place?  What was this place?!   Why was she alone?  Where was Ash and Brock?  The last memory she had was being at a pokemon center.  Pokemon center of which city though?  Or was it a pokemon center in the middle of nowhere?   The pokemon center didn't have a Nurse Joy running it....it was a man with long red hair and sharp features.  His names was......Derek?  Donald?  Some name that started with the letter \"D\"  she was sure of it.   The man had said that...<br>\r\n                  Why couldn't she remember?!<br>\r\n                 \"Are you sure you dropped it in there?\" came a booming voice from outside.  The voice came from a male.  \"isn't that where we chased those three intruders down?\"<br>\r\n                  \"No I'm not sure\" came a second voice, a female voice.   \"All I know is that I don't have that potion anymore....and yes, that's where we chased those three little ones down....only caught two of 'em.  The third must've ran off\"<br>\r\n                          'What's wrong with their voices?' wondered Misty.  The voices were booming as if...<br>\r\n                          Just then a giant hand came from the opening in the ceiling and started to grab the ground as if searching for something.  Misty gave a tiny little yelp and moved out of the way as the giant hand came closer to her.  <br>\r\n                                 <br>\r\n                        \"Let's just knock the building down\" said the male voice.   \"nobody is using it and nobody can fit in there anymore\"<br>\r\n                        \"There's the professor\" replied the female voice.   \"he's still tiny for some reason. This is where he made that potion.  He needs this place to make more\"<br>\r\n                          <br>\r\n                         Potion?  Professor?  What was going on here?!   The giant hand went all around the room for a good five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"It isn't here\" said the female and the giant hand vanished through the hole in the ceiling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"What were you doing with another potion anyway?\" asked the male.  \"are you planning to grow even taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Of course\" said the female.   \"all the others keep calling me Shorty and I hate it.  With another potion I won't be so short anymore\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                      \"You aren't short\" scoffed the male.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       The two giant voices faded off in the distance and Misty was left wondering what on earth was happening here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        Misty had been under a table near the door to the lab.  She scrambled from under the table and exited the lab and into a long hallway.  She looked to her left and right.  After a moment she headed for the right.   The building looked to have been abandoned.  The power was off so the only light was daylight and since it was rainy there wasn't much of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        Misty came to an open door.  She peeked inside the room and found a smaller lab.  Unlike the lab she had left, this lab was filled with beakers of liquid.  She entered the small lab to get a better look.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               The liquid that was in the beakers was a yellowish green. Was this the potion that those voices were talking about?   Those......giants?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 There were three beakers that caught Misty's interest.   Each of the three beakers had labels on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Queen's Drink\"<br>\r\n                   \"Small Fry\"<br>\r\n                   \"Goddess of the forest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Wha...?\" asked Misty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  The Labels also had instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Queen's Drink  -- drink this to become the biggest in the village\"<br>\r\n                       \"Small Fry  -- Drink this to become a \"little\" giant\"<br>\r\n                         \"Goddess of the forest --  A new potion that I've whipped up just yesterday.  I'm still perfecting it.  I'm not quite sure how tall a person would get if someone were to drink this potion.  Ignore the name....I just like to give these  potions of mine whimsical names\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Why would anyone leave these potions here?\" asked Misty.     \"so...these potions will make me grow?  Why would I want to grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        Misty thought it over.  She seemed to be in an area populated with giants and it seemed that these potions were the source of these giants...and that someone was supposedly making more.  She hadn't found Ash or Brock yet and those two sounded like they were captured by  these giants...but Misty seemed to have escaped somehow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"If I'm to save Ash and Brock from these giants, it sounds like I need to become a giant myself\" said Misty.   \"Alright then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  Which potion does Misty drink?  <br>\r\n                            </span></div></div>",

Misty had a <i>big</i> secret that she told nobody about partially because she was afraid it might drive her friends away...and that she couldn't explain why she grew when she was angry.  Proper angry.  Not merely annoyed or miffed but seething anger.  The more angrier she got the more she grew.  She would eventually shrink back down to normal size when she calmed down but that took time; hours or even days at a time.  There was no way to know how long it took her to shrink back down  to normal.  She suspected it had to do with how tall she grew.   When she grew her clothes would be torn apart and left in tatters and she would be naked.   Luckily Misty learned to carry an extra set of clothes in her bag.    <br>\r\n                                   Misty didn't knew where this ability came from either; her three sisters didn't have it...a fact that made her smile every time she thought about it.  Misty discovered this ability when she turned ten.  She didn't know if she had been born with this odd ability or not but she recalled no instance where she grew in her younger days.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                               She had discovered this ability of hers shortly before she met Ash.   When he had \"borrowed\" her bike.   After discovering the remains of her bike Misty grew until she was near thirty feet tall; luckily she had shrank back down--to a mere seven feet--by the time that she ran into Ash in Viridian City.   That was the quickest time that she had shrank back down.   She had been seething mad when she discovered her ruined bike on the dirt road but she had calmed down a bit.  She was still mad at Ash but not mad enough to make her grow back to who knows how tall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                              Right now Misty was lying down in her sleeping bag.  Ash, Brock and Misty were camping out once again.  Misty was looking up at the stars thinking about the passing years.  For it had been several years now and Ash was continuing his grand pokemon adventure and Misty and Brock decided to stay with him.  The snores of Ash and Brock was beginning to make her angry.  Can't those two keep quiet?!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(a/v Note:  I leave it to you if Misty told Ash or Brock about her ability) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, her attempts at visualizing gentle waves at a beach and calmly swimming Water Pok\u00e9mon did little to temper her growing rage. The waves in her mind became tsunamis, and the school of swimming Magikarps became raging Gyarados. 'Ugh... how much is it to ask to let me have my beauty sleep?!' she thought to herself. By this point, it seemed it was too late to stop it-- she could already feel her shorts and top getting tight as her legs grew longer and thicker and her chest inflated. Within a few moments, her suspenders had snapped, and Misty could feel an unstoppable power welling up within, a simultaneously fearful and arousing feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No...not now...\" she muttered, trying desperately to hold it in. She couldn't fight her anger, though, and all rational thoughts were blocked out by her inner voice screaming about Ash and Brock's perceived inconsiderateness. How dare they make so much noise, as if no one and nothing else in the world mattered but them?! That was enough to push her over the edge, and Misty's growth went into overdrive-- she began to rapidly rise up in height, her shorts and tiny tank top bursting off of her growing body, with her ballooning breasts and ass demolishing her underwear immediately after. 10 feet soon became 20, then 30, 40, 50, and beyond... she kept right on growing as she took a powerful step toward her sleeping companions, shaking them awake with the shockwaves. They awoke to a terrifying surprise-- Misty has so far managed to somehow keep her ability a secret from them over the years, either through careful management of her anger or conveniently disappearing when things got out of hand. There was simply no hiding it now, though, and she roared like a giant monster as the boys sprung from their sleeping bags and ran into the woods.</span></div></div>",

Her first instinct to seeing Ash and Brock flee before her was to chase them down and punish them for making such a racket. She gave chase mere moments after the two had vanished into the woods.  She stomped trees flat, scared bunches of sleeping pokemon and flattened smaller trees in her rage-filled chase.  She didn't grew any more and her sight had a red covering over it.  She saw no signs of the tiny Ash and Brock but she could hear them somewhere up ahead.  It was clear the two boys were too frightened to talk to each other let alone discuss what the hell happened to their friend. <br>\r\n                               Misty kept on chasing them until she could no longer hear the two boys in front of her.   When she could no longer hear Ash and Brock running from her, her red-tinted sight started to lower. That was when Misty's head started to clear.  Before her mind was filled with mindless rage and pure predator's instinct to chase her quarry and possibly feed on them for daring to anger her.  But now, her mind started to clear and she no longer wished to eat Ash or Brock--in fact the thought sickened her!  Why would she ever do that?  Why would she even think of it?!  Of course it was all a part of growing.  Whenever she grew, Misty's mind became that of a raging animal.  Now Misty realized what she had done; she had chased Ash and Brock, most likely scaring the two nearly to death.<br>\r\n               \"Ash!\" called Misty.   \"Brock!  I'm not mad anymore!\"<br>\r\n               She started to search for her two friends.   Now that she was calm, Misty expected that she would shrink back down.....only she didn't.   She still stayed the same size at...how tall was she now?  Judging by the trees she towered over, Misty estimated her height to be a little over eighty feet.    Why wasn't she shrinking?    Misty wasn't panicked.  After all she was used to not shrinking right away.  But it still bothered her that she was now looking for her friends as a giant.  Would they even approach her now?  <br>\r\n                      \"Ash!\"  called Misty.  \"Brock!  I'm sorry I scared you.  I'm better now!\"<br>\r\n                      No answer. <br>\r\n                         \"Why am I not shrinking?!\" asked Misty aloud.  Then she calmed down, not wanting to trigger another growth spurt.  <br>\r\n                        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(this chapter was originally written by Drez) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty awoke with a bad headache and a bad memory. The last memory that Misty had was the three of them--Ash, herself and Brock--heading for the lifeboats because the ocean liner they were on was sinking for some reason. What exactly caused the ship to sink she couldn't remember. She had a vague memory of running into Team Rocket at one point....were they in the lifeboat too? Had those three caused the ship to sink? <br>\r\nIt was the sound of hammering that had awoken Misty. The next thing that Misty noticed was the breeze that came across her body. She opened her eyes which felt slightly gummy and saw a blue sky with a few clouds. From what she could tell she was lying on a beach. She tried to sit up but was restrained. Puzzled, Misty lowered her head so she could see the rest of her body where she noticed two things; she was completely naked and she was covered up in tiny little ropes! She tried to break free from the ropes but it was no use. There must've been thousands of ropes tied around her body....and they were such tiny little things! How could something that small be so strong?! And why was she naked?! Did some pervert remove her clothes? For several minutes, Misty struggled in the tiny little ropes that held her down. She managed to break few of the ropes but she was still held down. <br>\r\n\"She's awake!\" yelled a tiny voice. Misty looked around and saw a tiny little person standing on her exposed chest somewhat close to her nipple. The little person was dressed in blue jeans and a plain shirt. Misty squinted at the person who looked familiar. <br>\r\n\"Of course I'm awake\" said Misty. The sheer volume of her voice made the little person cover his ears. Misty winced and lowered her voice to ask a question. \"where am I anyway?\" <br>\r\n\"You're on the island of Lillia\" replied the little person. \"my name is Roger. I'm the one that found you\"<br>\r\n\"What happened to my clothes?\" asked Misty in her lowered voice. \"why can't I break free of these ropes? Why are you so small?\" <br>\r\n\"So many questions...\" said Roger. \"I simply found you that way; I saw no clothing that could fit someone as big as you. The ropes are made from this strong material found on this island and.....I'm this size because I was born this way\" <br>\r\n\"That's enough, Roger\" snapped another voice and another tiny person appeared on Misty's chest! The tiny person must've climbed up on her body clearly but why couldn't she felt these little people walking on her? The little people were perhaps twenty inches tall. The second tiny person was dressed in some kind of paramilitary uniform. \"Don't tell the giantess our secrets\"<br>\r\n\"And who are you?\" asked Misty to the second person.<br>\r\n\"I'm Captain Hawk of the Lillia army\" said the second person. <br>\r\n\"Did you happen to see anyone else my size?\" asked Misty. <br>\r\n\"No\" said Hawk. <br>\r\n\"Should there be?\" asked Roger.<br>\r\n\"At least two\" said Misty.<br>\r\n\"Oh great\" said Captain Hawk \"just what we needed. An invasion of giants\"<br>\r\n\"We're not invading!\" snapped Misty. \"we were in a ship that sunk!\"<br>\r\nCaptain Hawk and Roger exchanged glances. \"Must've been the reef\" said Roger. <br>\r\n\"This island is surrounded by a razor-sharp reef\" said Captain Hawk. \"if ships aren't careful they can run into it and sink\" <br>\r\n\"That's how we came to be here\" said Roger. <br>\r\n\"Don't tell her about us!\" barked Captain Hawk.<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" said Misty. \"why did you tie me up?!\"<br>\r\n\"To prevent you from going berserk and killing all on this island\" said Captain Hawk.<br>\r\n\"But I wouldn't do that\" said Misty.<br>\r\n\"That's what they all say\" said Captain Hawk. \"my superiors are trying to figure out what to do with you now\"<br>\r\n\"I won't hurt anyone\" said Misty. \"I'm just trying to figure out what is going on here\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we free her?\" asked Roger.<br>\r\n\"Why are you still here?\" asked Captain Hawk. \"this is a military matter now. Get out of here\"<br>\r\n\"I was the one who found her!\" protested Roger. <br>\r\n\"And?\" asked Hawk. \"either get out of here or I'll make you leave\"<br>\r\n\"Hey be nice to him!\" said Misty. <br>\r\n\"Quiet, giant!\"<br>\r\n\"My name is Misty\" said Misty. <br>\r\nAt the mention of Misty's name, both Roger and Captain Hawk looked at each other with slightly shocked expressions. Captain Hawk looked at Misty then back at Roger and then back to Misty again. Roger just looked dumbfounded. <br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Misty.<br>\r\n\"It means nothing\" said Captain Hawk firmly to Roger. \"she doesn't match the description in the legend. She has red hair, not blond\"<br>\r\n\"What legend?\" asked Misty. \"what are you talking about?\" Roger tried to say something but Captain Hawk stopped him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright, bear with me here-- in the spirit of this interactive, namely the resurrection of the old style of interactives that you don't see often anymore, I wanted to use this storyline to try and bring back a whole story that was taken down a long time ago. So here's what happened-- a good 10 or so years ago, there were two \"Nintendo Girls Gain Weight\" stories, the second of which began a storyline with Misty that outlived NGGW2 itself and continued in a separate interactive simply called \"Misty's gain: the continuation\". By the time I joined, only Misty's gain was still online, and it had a single cohesive storyline that revolved around a fat giantess Misty (see? it's relevant to the GTS theme after all!), starting at 30 feet and growing steadily through all the subsequent chapters. From what I remember, she was on a vacation in some island chain that was famous for ice cream and desserts, and spent most chapters either indulging on her own or getting caught in contrived Team Rocket schemes that always ended in her getting fed for some reason. It was a simplistic story, but fun as all hell, and I was sad to see it go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, I'm in charge now with this story, so it's time for a reboot! We can start the same way the original story did, with 30-foot, super fat Misty stomping her way into a town in search of fattening sweets, with the backstory all in broad strokes so we have wiggle room to write the way we want while still preserving the fun, silly spirit of the original. Those who remember it are free to add in anything they recall from the original, but I encourage folks to just do what they want with the setup as well, and as usual I'll see if I can add a lot more continuity nods and links to the anime and game canons as well. </span></div></div>",

She had no memory of how she came to be swimming in the ocean but that didn't seem to bother her.  What bothered her was that she could hear voices coming from the dark depths below her.  She stopped swimming and listened more closely.  She didn't hear anything else but she did felt something grab her foot and she was dragged underwater.  She couldn't see who or what was dragging her deeper and deeper.  Misty was able to breathe which came as a shock.  That's when she noticed her body was beginning to change.  She felt gill slits forming on her throat, and her legs had fused together to form a giant fin.  She was also gaining in size.  By the time she reached the ocean floor, Misty must've been at least 300 feet long.  <br>\r\n                                                Misty came to rest  besides a huge golden trident that was clearly meant for her.  The trident emitted a golden light that was almost blinding.   There were runes or mystical symbols on the trident itself that Misty could barely see.  The trident was sticking out of a huge boulder.  The boulder was nearly as big as Misty was.  Misty squinted at the boulder to see an inscription written on the boulder near where the trident was sticking out.  The inscription read: <b>I shall return to claim this trident of mine and become the goddess of the sea once more </b>.  Reading the inscription made something inside Misty twinge as if she was trying to recall a long-forgotten memory.....  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Misty awoke to the smell of breakfast cooking.   She awoke gradually and found that her arms were reaching for something that wasn't there.  She blinked several times.

Brock was cooking breakfast and had set up a small table with  chairs for three.  Ash was sitting at the table sipping at a cup filled with what looked like orange juice.  Pikachu was on the table itself, looking just barely awake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Breakfast should be ready in five minutes\" said Brock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Are you alright, Misty?\" asked Ash.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Yeah\" said Misty getting up from her sleeping bag.  \"just had a weird dream\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 ----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Two Choices lie ahead <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Option 1:  Ash, Misty and Brock are on vacation.  They go to beach for some fun in the  sun when Misty discovers a mysterious trident under the water of the ocean.  When she touches the trident, Misty gets transformed into a gigantic mermaid and ends up being the goddess of the sea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Option 2:   The trio are on vacation and go to the beach.   Misty gains memories of when she used to be a mermaid long ago.  Not only a mermaid but an avatar of the sea goddess, meaning that Misty <u>isn't</u> the sea goddess but wields the power of the sea goddess as long as she holds a trident which lies under the water somewhere.  Of course Misty would be a gigantic mermaid in both choices since this is a GTS story.   Just how gigantic can be sorted out later.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I got the idea based on all those fan theories on why Ash never ages and I decided to create my own idea that was just as ridiculous as some of the other theories.  Demigods age slower than normal people, therefore Ash appears not to age at all even though he is.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the story, Ash is returning home for his eighteenth birthday. On the way home, Ash experiences mysterious dreams about his mother telling him that his life is going to change dramatically.  Just before he gets home, his godly powers awaken turning him into a giant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know we've been having lots of stories involving people turning into gods or godlike figures, but the whole \"giant\" thing is supposed to be a metaphor of a person gaining incredible powers like a God......at least, in part. So if any of you have any problems with that, I do apologize but when a person turns into a giant in other media, they're usually invincible to pretty much everything......Like a God.  Hell, GOD is in the name Godzilla. I can't see why a person that turns into a giant turns out to be an actual God......Or demigod in this case.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Jake, this is a total reboot of that whole story.....minus the other stuff that went on in that storyline</span></div></div>",

In the kitchen were two people: his mother and what looked like a copy of himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe copy of himself had weird eyes.  Red pupils and pure black eyes gazed up at Ash from the simple kitchen table.  The expression on the copy's face was unreadable.

The pair really didn't have a plan besides going straight to Pallet in time for Ash's eighteenth birthday....but that was two days away so they had some time to kill.  The two decided to head for the pokemon center to heal up their pokemon since the pair had been in several battles just yesterday.  <br>\r\n    It was a block away from the center when a poster caught Ash's attention.  It was for the opening of a brand new arcade called \"Hard Eight Arcade\" the opening of which was in three days.  <br>\r\n    \"A new arcade that features the latest in VR technology...\".said Misty reading off the poster. \"Sounds like fun\"<br>\r\n    \"Yeah\" said Ash.  <br>\r\n   As they neared the pokemon center they saw a sandy-browned trainer around twenty at the most standing beside an usual pokemon to be seen in the Kanto region: a Delphox.  As Ash and Misty approached the other pair, they noticed that the pair was clearly talking to each other.  Delphox, being psychic, could talk through telepathy <br>\r\n    \"Are you worried about that vision you had this morning, Circe?\" asked the trainer.  <br>\r\n    Circe nodded and glanced over at Ash.  The pokemon pointed at Ash.  <br>\r\n  \"It involves him?\"asked the trainer.  The Fox pokemon nodded. <br>\r\n   \"Umm....your pokemon had a vision about me?\" asked Ash coming up on the trainer. <br>\r\n    \"Apparently\" said the trainer.  \"Circe can glimpse into the future by looking at the flame at the end of its stick\" <br>\r\n        \"What was it about?\" asked Misty. <br>\r\n       \"(Something about two days from now)\" came a feminine voice in Ash and Misty's head. \"(And about you learning a deep secret......and a binge....I couldn't see anymore than that)\"<br>\r\n    Ash and Misty exchanged glances. <br>\r\n    \"Circe's predictions are usually pretty good\" said the trainer.  \"By the way, my name is Felix\" <br>\r\n    \"Nice to meet you\" said Ash.  <br>\r\n     \"According to Circe here\" said Felix \"I'm also involved\"<br>\r\n     Circe faced Felix and clearly talked to him privately via telepathy.  Felix eyed Circe with an odd expression that was unreadable to Ash and Misty.  \"She's not coming back.  She hasn't been seen in twenty years\" <br>\r\n     \"Who hasn't been seen in twenty years?\" asked Misty. <br>\r\n    \"Nobody important\" said Felix. <br>\r\n    \"Well\" said Ash. \"Is that your way of inviting yourself to join us?  I don't mind the company\"<br>\r\n    \"The more the merrier\" said Misty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Delia Ketchum sat in an arcane circle in Ash's room.  She was chanting under her breath and the arcane circle glowed with a soft blue color. Delia's forehead was adorned with sigils and mystical symbols. <br>\r\n      \"You're wasting time\" came the voice of her son.  \"The seal you've set up is breaking.  You can't reinforce it.  I've grown strong\" <br>\r\n        Delia kept on chanting.  <br>\r\n    \"I'll break the seal before he comes home\" <br>\r\n      More chanting was the only reply <br>\r\n     \"I'll break the seal and devour him all up.  And then the fun begins\"<br>\r\n     \"Limited fun\" said Delia, opening her eyes and saw the embodiment of Ash's locked-up powers which wasn't visible to the mortal eye.  <br>\r\n     \"Fun nevertheless\" said the Ash copy. \"I wonder what his reaction will be when he finds out the truth\" <br>\r\n    \"It won't matter\" said Delia.  \"When you devour him, Ash will know why I sealed you away up until now\"<br>\r\n      \"I'm talking about the other truth\" said the Ash copy grinning like a naughty puppy allowed back in the house.  <br>\r\n      Delia grimaced.  \"......he'll still love me.  I'm his mother\" <br>\r\n    \"We'll see\" said Copy Ash, shrugging.  </span></div></div>",

Felix had invited Ash and Misty to the arcade for a sneak peek.  Circe followed and explained that she was one of those Pokemon who disliked being inside a pokeball.  <br>\r\n            \"Actually, he's my great uncle\" said Felix.  \" Great Uncle Ernie is the only family I have left.  I never knew my parents and my grandparents died before I was even born\" <br>\r\n          \"That's so sad\" said Misty.<br>\r\n           \"Yeah\" said Felix.  \" I'm from the Kalos region.   My family was originally from here in Kanto\" <br>\r\n       The arcade was in a building slightly bigger than the Pokemon center and it did have a lot of new Virtual reality headsets that had games of almost every description.  There was a shooter, an virtual experience in the body of a Pokemon (for research purposes supposedly), and all sorts that spanned every genre.   Ernie was way too busy in his office going over the final details before the grand opening.    Ernie was a balding old man in his 60s and he was rather muscular for his age. <br>\r\n         Ash and Misty naturally wanted to try out the games, both VR and the more mundane arcade machines.  It was when that Felix was showing Ash and Misty a flight simulator when Ash heard something off in the distance.   It sounded like crackling glass. Ash looked around for the source of the sound much to the confusion of Misty and Felix.  Apparently Circle had heard the sound too but she couldn't identify what it was or what precise direction the sound had come from.  <br>\r\n         Ash shrugged it off.  If nothing was happening that caused the noise he needn't have worried about it.   <br>\r\n           \"Next up is a shooter I'm particularly fond of\" said Felix.   Circe talked privately to Felix but Felix waved an impatient hand.  <br>\r\n          \"Glad to hear it\" said Misty exchanging a glance with Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        The seal that had contained the copy of Ash had shattered into a million tiny pieces.   Delia stood up from the arcane circle.<br>\r\n          \"It's time\" said Copy Ash licking his lips. <br>\r\n           Delia sighed.  \"Go then.   Reunite with Ashley\" <br>\r\n          \" Stop calling me THAT! \" yelled Copy Ash before rushing out of his bedroom.   <br>\r\n             Delia strolled from the room and entered her own bedroom.  <br>\r\n              A tied-up man was lying on the bed.  The man was in his mid to late 50s.  As Delia entered the room the man turned a fearful gaze in her direction but Delia simply ignored him.   She went over to the closet and opened it up.    <br>\r\n           \"Please!\" yelled the man in a frenzy.  \"Let me go!\" <br>\r\n          Delia hummed a pleasant tune as she selected something from the closet . It was a whip.  <br>\r\n          \"Please goddess!!\" <br>\r\n         Delia hesitated looking at the man with cold fury on her face .   The man whimpered and pleaded getting to his hands and knees, an impressive feat being tied.  <br>\r\n         Delia took a step towards the man, making the man whimper even more and back up on the bed.  With a lazy wave of her hand, Delia tied the man up with additional ropes that shot up from the bed itself. A gag was also placed on the man's mouth that only allowed muffled shouts and pleads.<br>\r\n              Delia was just about to start the fun when the doorbell unexpectedly rang.  Delia shot a glance at the still open door to the bedroom before strolling out of the room closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n             Delia managed to control her facial expression by the time she had opened the door. <br>\r\n           Gary Oak was standing there at the door blushing red.   He was wearing a dress suit complete with a carnation.  His hair hand been let down and he looked noticeably uncomfortable on the stoop.  Delia blinked at him blankly and that's when she suddenly remembered.  There was a fund raiser gala at the museum in Viridian City that featured a new exhibit that featured her as the goddess of fertility.  A week earlier she had invited Gary because he had been snooping around the house lately .  <br>\r\n                \"You ready?\" asked Gary holding out his arm to Delia. <br>\r\n                \"Uhh...yeah\" said Delia stepping out of the house and locking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              By the time that the copy of Ash reached Viridian City it was well past midnight .    He paused as he entered the city limits as he closed his eyes and focused.  Copy Ash smiled when he sensed the other half of his being.   <br>\r\n            The Copy made his way to the Pokemon center.   The doors were shut but the copy just went through the door like a ghost.<br>\r\n            The Copy entered the room where his other half was sleeping.   The Copy glanced in the direction of the bathroom to the room revealing the fact that Misty was in there.  The Copy made a lewd expression and then hurried on to the task at hand.   <br>\r\n               Copy Ash grabbed his other half roughly off the bed.  Ash opened his eyes, startled at what he saw.<br>\r\n               \"You?!\" asked Ash.   \" You're from that dream\" <br>\r\n             \"That was no dream\" said the copy opening his mouth wide and engulfed Ash's head into his mouth.   Ash struggled as his copy swallowed him up slowly.  As the copy ate him, Ash had this feeling of calm washed over him.....and then he felt a surge of power enter his body.  <br>\r\n          \"What....?\" asked Ash dreamily as the power entering his body made him light headed.   The Copy grinned as another swallow brought Ash's chest into the  mouth.  The Copy wasted little time in swallowing his other half, growing impatient.    When the copy slurped up Ash's legs he wanted it to happen.....he didn't knew what was going to happen but it was going to be glorious.<br>\r\n               The Copy swallowed one more time, sending Ash down to his stomach....except Ash didn't end up in the stomach.   When the copy swallowed Ash a golden light emitted from the body and radiated with blinding light for a full minute, totally obscuring what was happening from view.    When the light faded away Ash simply laid  on the bed breathing heavily.  <br>\r\n          Ash's body had undergone a metamorphosis.  His new body was ripling with muscle, his biceps gaining in size until they were twice the size they were.   His muscles had a sculpted look.  The shirt he had been wearing had been torn to pieces with budging muscle.  <br>\r\n              \"Mom....is a goddess?\" asked Ash quietly to himself .  Yes.  She had sealed away his power to protect himself and others....but that only lasted for eighteen years.   The seal had broken.....that was what made the sound he had heard earlier!    But that happened all the way in Pallet..so how.....<br>\r\n         \"Ash?\" <br>\r\n         Ash turned to face Misty dressed only in a silky kimono.   The sight of Misty might as well been the dinner bell ringing.   The thought that Misty now looked like food didn't matter to Ash.   Ash rushed over to Misty and gave her a long lingering kiss that brought the young adultl to her knees.  She broke off the kiss and stared at Ash in bewilderment. <br>\r\n         \"Ash?\" asked Misty \" what happened to you? \". Misty traced her fingers on Ash's chest.   <br>\r\n          \"Enough talk\" said Ash kissing her again.  \"Call me god\" <br>\r\n         \"Call....you...?\" asked Misty as her expression turned lustful .   Ash kissed her again.   <br>\r\n           \"It feels good to call me God\" whispered Ash.   When Ash had said the word God Misty experienced an orgasm without Ash touching her.    <br>\r\n       \" Ash?! \" asked Misty.  \"How did you....?\" <br>\r\n         \" Call me God, Misty \" <br>\r\n          Another orgasm hit Misty, an even bigger one...one that might be described as an atomic orgasm.  <br>\r\n           \"More!\" panted Misty.   <br>\r\n           \" You're a stubborn one \" said Ash kissing her once again and started to grope her breasts.   <br>\r\n             \"Ash.....\" <br>\r\n             \" Yes? \" purred Ash running his fingers through her hair.  <br>\r\n               \"You're God\" said Misty .  \"I don't know how or why.....\" <br>\r\n              \" I'll explain later\" <br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

It had only three floors but the building was nearly the size of two city blocks.  The fundraiser gala event was a special event that started at ten o'clock and ended until one in the morning.   The museum normally was only opened from dawn until dusk. <br>\r\n               The gala event was invitation only.   It was only opened to millionaires and other such people that were community leaders or prominent people throughout the Kanto Region.   <br>\r\n              Delia wasn't mailed an invitation to the gala which must've been an oversight.   The gala was to celebrate a brand-new exhibit dedicated to the ancient goddess of fertility...and to raise money for the museum itself since the museum was in danger of closing due to poor attentece.  The museum hadn't had a new exhibit for twenty years so it was kinda a big deal.   <br>\r\n                  When Gary and Delia arrived at the museum they were in danger of being turned away because they had no invitation to the event.  <br>\r\n          \"We're special guests of the curator\" said Delia.  \"You can call him and tell him that Delia Ketchum is here\" <br>\r\n           The guard raised an eyebrow at this but picked up a phone at the reception desk. <br>\r\n         \"You know the curator?\" whispered Gary. <br>\r\n        Delia nodded.  \"Donald is an old friend of mine.  Believe me he'll let us in\" <br>\r\n        The guard at the reception desk talked on the phone for a long time  before nodding and hung up the phone.  <br>\r\n          \"The Delia Exhibition is located in the \"Ancient Civilizations\" section on the first floor\" said the guard.  \"Just follow the signs.  You can't miss it. Oh, and the curator will meet you there personally\" <br>\r\n          \"Thank you\" said Delia.  \" Come on, Gary\" <br>\r\n            Gary and Delia walked down a series of corridors.  Signs led the pair to the event.  Every other exhibit in the museum was closed.  The gala was only for a specific exhibit after all.   As such the museum was pretty much deserted save for the people at the gala.  <br>\r\n             \"So there's an ancient goddess out there that shares your name?\" asked Gary as the two continued their way. <br>\r\n           \"Apparently so\" said Delia who had a thin smile on her face.  <br>\r\n           Just before Delia and Gary could enter the \"Ancient Civilizations\" section of the museum they were met by an elderly man probably in his 60s or even 70s.  The man wore a dark blue suit over a dress shirt.  A bowtie was just visible under the man's chin.   The man was heavyset, probably weighing three hundred pounds soaking wet.   <br>\r\n              \"Ah, Delia, my special guest\" said the man when Gary and Delia came within hailing distance.   \"I'm the curator of this museum.   Who is this young man with you?\" <br>\r\n            \" He's my plus one\" said Delia gesturing at Gary.   <br>\r\n              It was then that Gary noticed that Delia was now wearing an elegant light blue dress she certainly wasn't wearing earlier.   When the two entered the museum Delia had been wearing her standard clothing but now she now was wearing a dress.    Gary blinked as he looked at Delia in her sudden new outfit in awe.  <br>\r\n             \"I see\" said Donald the curator.  \"The gala starts in ten minutes.  Please enjoy the show\"<br>\r\n           \" Mind if I had a little chat with you in your office? \" asked Delia.   \"Gary, you can go mingle with the guests at the gala\" <br>\r\n              \"Sure\" said Donald.<br>\r\n              Gary looked uncertain. <br>\r\n             \"Go on\" said Delia to Gary.  <br>\r\n             Gary shrugged and walked off in one direction while Delia and Donald went in another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         When Delia and Donald entered the office of the curator, Donald made it a point to lock the door before prostrating before Delia. <br>\r\n            \"You honor me with this visit, goddess\" said Donald .<br>\r\n            Delia hesitated before speaking.   \"What happened to my invitation to this event?  You open a exhibit to me and you couldn't be bothered with sending me an invitation?\" <br>\r\n             \"A terrible oversight on my part\" said Donald.  \"I didn't know where you lived in Kanto\" <br>\r\n               \"I did pick a remote place to live in\" said Delia, more to herself.<br>\r\n               \"Is this a sign of your return?\" asked Donald.  \"You were gone so long that your worshippers are beginning to thin out\" <br>\r\n            \"Don't I know it\" said Delia.  \"Yes, I'm here to inform you that I am returning to all my worshippers within the month\" <br>\r\n             \" I'm overjoyed by this news, goddess \" said Donald.  \"Most of your cult in Viridian are here at the gala.  Are you going to reveal yourself at the gala?\" <br>\r\n            \" I shall reveal myself at my temples throughout the world \" said Delia.   \"A temple is much more an appropriate venue to reveal myself as a goddess than at some gala\" <br>\r\n             \" I couldn't agree more\" said Donald.<br>\r\n              <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Gary mingled among the sixty or so people that were at the gala.  It wasn't long before Gary saw an ancient mural that depicted the goddess called Delia.   It was unmistakably Delia Ketchum depicted in the mural.   <br>\r\n            \"Surely not....\" muttered Gary rubbing his chin.  <br>\r\n             \"Surely not what?\" asked a voice in his ear.   Gary looked to see Delia was standing beside him.  <br>\r\n             \" Err...surely that isn't you \" said Gary nodding at the mural.  <br>\r\n              Delia looked at the mural.  \"Hmm...not a bad likeness\" <br>\r\n              Gary blinked.  \"You don't mean you're a god?!\" <br>\r\n             \" And what if I am? \" asked Delia.  <br>\r\n             Before Gary could even think of what to say next the ground shook several times.  <br>\r\n                \"An earthquake?!\" asked one of the guests . <br>\r\n                Delia looked sharply in a northerly direction.   Gary looked in the direction that Delia was looking at but only saw a blank wall.<br>\r\n               \"What is it?\" asked Gary .<br>\r\n              \"Ash....\" said Delia in a whisper .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       ************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Ash rushed out of the Pokemon center followed quickly by Misty.  Ash was a little over seven feet tall and was still growing in height.   Minutes earlier Ash's body had undergone a transformation of some kind....a transformation that clearly wasn't over.   After Ash's body had changed he told Misty that moving out of the Pokemon center would be a good idea.  After making this announcement Ash had started to grow at a rapid pace.   <br>\r\n                     Now that the pair was out of the Pokemon center, Ash's growth was even more rapid.  Seven feet soon became ten feet, then 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 feet and still growing!     Ash's clothes were ripped apart by the growth leaving him quite naked.    Ash was sure to avoid damaging any building while he was growing.  <br>\r\n               Ash grew and grew, passing 100 feet.   By this time Ash had made it out of the city.   He had picked up Misty when he surpassed 50 feet.  <br>\r\n         Ash stopped growing at 500 feet tall. <br>\r\n          \"Why did you suddenly grow?\" asked Misty who was on Ash's hand, holding onto his pinky finger .<br>\r\n            \"That's what I want to konw\" said Ash.  <br>\r\n            \"And what is this business about you being a god?\" asked Misty. <br>\r\n           \" I believe I can answer that question \" said a voice.   Ash looked around until he spotted his mother nearby.   Delia had matched Ash's size....and she was also naked. <br>\r\n             \"Mom?\" asked Ash.  \" Exactly what is going on? \" <br>\r\n            Delia sighed deeply.   \"This isn't the way I wanted to reveal this to you.  I was hoping that your powers would return on your birthday and not two days before.   Very well.<br>\r\n                  You're not a god,, but a demigod.   Your father was mortal.  The woman he fell in love with is an ancient goddess of fertility...me.   Yes.  I am a goddess.  When you were born I sealed away your godly powers to protect the people around you.   The seal holding back your powers broke earlier tonight.   You grew because you're not used to the power that you now have\" <br>\r\n                Ash just stared blankly at his mother.<br>\r\n                \"I was going to tell you this at your birthday party but your powers came earlier than expected\" said Delia.   <br>\r\n                \" So.... \" said Ash slowly.  \"I'm a demigod now....is there anything else that you would like to reveal to me? \" <br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

The trees there hardly came up to their knees which meant the two giants were quite visible.  Viridian City looked like a city of dollhouses to Ash.  He was sorely tempted to go into the city and start stomping the city flat. He was able to ignore the temptation.<br>\r\n                 \"Look\" said Delia.  \"I know all this comes to a shock all of a sudden\" <br>\r\n               \" Oh no mother dear\" said Ash, sarcasm dripping from his voice.  \"What's so shocking for me to learn that I'm a demigod and you're a goddess and that you've been keeping this secret from me my whole life?\" <br>\r\n              \" Ash, I know\" said Delia.  \"You're upset and --\" <br>\r\n              \"You said my father was a mortal?\" asked Ash, interrupting his mother.  \"Where is he then?

Was he not worthy of your love?\" <br>\r\n              \" Ash--\" started Delia.<br>\r\n            \"Did you even love him or did you dump him for being a mere mortal?!\" asked Ash.   \"No....I bet you didn't even love him and---\" <br>\r\n              The very next thing that Ash knew he was down on his hands and knees with blood pouring out of his ears, nose and mouth.  His heart was doing its best impression of a dial tone and he was absolutely terrified.   He had absolutely no memory of what caused him to be in this state.....and, perhaps, that was a good thing.     Misty was in the same state it seemed as she was pleading for forgiveness from Delia even though Misty did nothing wrong. <br>\r\n                \"What...?\" asked Ash his voice coming out as a little squeak.  <br>\r\n                \"I'm sorry I lost my temper\" said Delia.  <br>\r\n                 Ash climbed unsteadily to his feet.  <br>\r\n               \"Your father......\" said Delia.  \" Your father is dead, Ash.  He was killed before you were born.....and I did love him.  He was a good man\" <br>\r\n              \"If he was killed couldn't you have resurrected him?\" asked Ash.  \" I mean you're a goddess aren't you? \" <br>\r\n                  Delia sighed deeply.   \"No, Ash.  I can't resurrect the dead.  What's dead is dead.  True resurrection is reserved only for the most powerful gods and, even then, resurrection is a dicey thing\" <br>\r\n               Silence hung in the air for long minutes.   <br>\r\n               \"How did he die?\" Ash finally asked.  <br>\r\n              \"To answer that, let me tell you how we met\" said Delia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~<i>Flashback</i>~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         <i>It was twenty-five years ago when I met two mortals.  One of them was your father, Ash, while the other was the son of a wealthy family. <br>\r\n            I met the two in Pewter City.  I make a habit of hanging out with mortals.  <br>\r\n                 The three of us grew close over the course of two years.  During that time, the mother of the other mortal grew helplessly sick. <br>\r\nI believe it was cancer if I recall correctly.   Anyway, your father and this other gentleman were friends since childhood.  In time I started to date the other gentleman but he wasn't interested in having offspring. <br>\r\n               As the mother got sicker and sicker, this gentleman started to neglect me and steadily became more aggressive.   It got to the point where i couldn't stand to be with him.....and so I started to have an affair with the man that became your father, Ash.   At first it was a way to cure my loneliness but our relationship got more and more serious.  Eventually we told my ex about our affair and he seemed to be alright with it.  <br>\r\n           Then the mother of this gentleman died, leaving behind a legacy for her son.  That legacy being a crime syndicate by the name of Team Rocket.   It horrified me that I dated someone belonging to a criminal family.  <br>\r\n             Your father and I moved to Pallet shortly after Giovanni took over Team Rocket.  Your father soon severed all ties with his childhood friend.  We were ready to start a family.   I revealed my true nature to your father and he was alright with it. <br>\r\n                  And then.....one night when I was off doing a ceremony in one of my temples I felt that something awful happened to your father back in Pallet.  I had to leave the ceremony but i was already too late.  Your father was in the street, shot dead by thugs from Team Rocket.   Four of my priests tried to apprehend the man who had killed your father but were killed in the attempt.    I had to apprehend the man that killed your father myself. <br>\r\n                Your father died in my arms, Ash.  I told him that I couldn't save him nor could I resurrect him.   He said he had no regrets falling in love with a goddess.  His last thoughts were about you, my son.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <b>Delia.....take good care of our child.......</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~<i>end of flashback</i>~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Ash stood there as Delia finished her story.   <br>\r\n          \"What a story....\" muttered Misty. <br>\r\n         It was then that Ash noticed a clawing sensation up his leg.  He looked down to see that pikachu had finally caught up with him.  Pikachu climbed up to his hand where Misty was standing and climbed up to her shoulder. <br>\r\n              \"Your father would be proud\" said Delia. <br>\r\n              \" I bet he would... \" said Ash in a hollow voice.   Ash then looked around.  \"Umm...when will I shrink back down?\" <br>\r\n                 \" My guess? \" asked Delia.  \"Probably in the morning.  Your body needs to adapt to the power coursing through it\" <br>\r\n                \" Morning?! \" asked Misty.  \"But it's not even midnight yet\" <br>\r\n                Delia shrugged .  \"Look at it this way;  you have all night to have fun being five hundred feet tall.  Now, if you don't mind, I have an engagement to get back too\" <br>\r\n                  Without further ado, Delia just vanished from sight.  There was no poof of smoke or anything like that.  She was just gone. <br>\r\n                    \"Fun?\" asked Misty faintly. <br>\r\n                    Ash looked over at the city of doll houses that was Viridian City and smiled.<br>\r\n                   \"Ash\" said Misty.  \"Don't go smashing up the city!\" <br>\r\n                  \" Alright \" said Ash.  \"I wasn't going to anyway.  I'm a bit peckish\" <br>\r\n                  Here, Ash uprooted a nearby apple tree and tossed it into his mouth.   He picked up another tree, this one filled with berries.  He tossed the entire tree into his mouth.  Ash didn't even chewed: he swallowed it  down whole .<br>\r\n                  \"I feel like having a feast\" said Ash stomping his way back into the city itself .  Ash soon came upon a burger restaurant and simply ripped the building off of its foundation and opened the tiny doors and tipped the restaurant to his open mouth.  Uncooked food came pouring from the open doors and into his mouth.   There was even a poor janitor  that got swallowed down.  Ash set the restaurant back on the ground and moved on.  <br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Ash grew so did his appetite which was gargantuan anyway.  Now that he towered over nearly everything his appetite had increased a hundred fold.  Misty was on his shoulder grabbing a strand of his hair for balance.    It took Ash little time to polish off the grocery store and then moved on.  <br>\r\n                 Ash spotted a large building that he mistook as a restaurant.  Misty gasped when Ash strolled closer to the building because it was the Viridian City brewery.   <br>\r\n            \"Ash\" said Misty.  \"That's not...\". <br>\r\n           It was too late.  Ash had forced open the doors to the brewery with his finger and simply inhaled the contents into his mouth.  Drinking so much alcohol all at once would've been fatal.  Either it was because Ash was five hundred feet tall or a demigod....or a combination of both that he didn't die...but he did develop quite a buzz.   Ash climbed back to his feet unsteadily and stumbled his way to his next meal.   He walked like a drunken sailor, crushing cars and smaller buildings under his foot.<br>\r\n            \"Shouldn't you people be gaveling to me?\" asked Ash, his words slurring.  His then hiccuped and then corrected himself , \"I mean groveling?  I am a god you know.  I just found out tonight.  My mother didn't told me until tonight....and, oh....she's a goddess.  All hail dear old mom\" <br>\r\n            \"Ash, maybe you should lie down?\" asked Misty.<br>\r\n            \"I'm still hungry\" said Ash.   He looked down in time to stop himself from tripping over what looked to be the police station.  As Ash paused he noticed Officer Jenny coming down the road on her motorcycle.   People that were on the street scattered in all directions to avoid from being stomped on.<br>\r\n                Officer Jenny stopped her motorcycle just short of Ash's leg.  She then looked up and up.  <br>\r\n               \"How old are you young man?\" asked Jenny rather boldly Misty thought.  \"You can't be a day over eighteen\" <br>\r\n             \"I'll be eighteen in a few days\" said Ash.   Then he giggled.<br>\r\n               \"Ah, underage drinking then\" said Jenny.   \"You're under arrest\" <br>\r\n             Ash burst out laughing .   \"What cell can hold me, a god?   Plus I'm 500 feet tall you know.   You can't do anything to me, so piss on you\" <br>\r\n           As if on cue, Ash started to urinate.  Jenny was knocked off her motorcycle and was pushed several yards down the street by the stream of urine.<br>\r\n             \"Heysh\" said Ash looking downwards.  \"I'm the one in charge, not you\" he then looked at Jenny who was soaked with his pee and laughed .  <br>\r\n        \"Sorry there, officer lady\" said Ash plucking her up from the ground.  \"Let me see if I can wash you off\"  Ash continued on his way down the street.  Ash set Jenny next to Misty.<br>\r\n             \"Is this your doing?\" asked Jenny.<br>\r\n            \" No\" said Misty.  \"Ash just drank up the brewery, thinking it was a restaurant\" <br>\r\n           \" A common mistake \" said Jenny sarcastically.<br>\r\n           \"I didn't see it was a brewery until it was too late\" said Misty.  \" I would've stopped him but it's hard to stop a drunken giant\" <br>\r\n            \"Good point\" said Jenny sighing and spitting out what was unmistakably urine from her mouth.  Jenny used Ash's hair in an attempt to dry herself off.  <br>\r\n            Ash ate several more restaurants and a grocery store until his hunger was satisfied.   He was sporting a considerable gut at this point.  Misty wondered if Ash would be able to move if Ash shrank back down.  Ash seemed to have forgotten that Jenny was there.  <br>\r\n              \"I thought you were going to wash me off\" said Jenny as Ash was walking past a winery.  <br>\r\n              Ash ignored her and fixed his eyes on a skyscraper.   \"What a looker\". <br>\r\n             Ash stumbled his way towards the skyscraper.   Both Misty and Jenny noticed that Ash was now sporting an erection.  <br>\r\n              \"Hey, baby\" said Ash feeling the skyscraper up and down. He then started to hump the building which was almost as tall as he was.   The skyscraper took the humping well enough; it didn't crack or buckle since part of it was made of concrete.  Making love with the building couldn't have been comfortable but it was to Ash.   It didn't take long until Ash shot his load all over the skyscraper.    His  seed driipped from the walls of the skyscraper in great globs.   After he was finished, Ash patted the building gently on the roof and then moved on.<br>\r\n               \"He's really out of it\" said Jenny ruefully as Ash nearly tripped over a library.  <br>\r\n                \"Out of what?\" asked Ash turning to face Jenny . <br>\r\n                \"You gotta stop this before the city is destroyed\" said Jenny.  <br>\r\n                Ash picked up Jenny and swallowed her on the spot.  \" I don't appreciate being told what to do\" <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n         <br>\r\n           Jenny nearly got buzzed just by Ash's breath alone.  She spent nearly a minute being rolled back and forth by his tongue before being pushed back and swallowed down. <br>\r\n             Jenny landed with a soft plopping sound.   She hadn't landed in acid to meet her end.  She had landed on a soft and slick place.  It was dark in the stomach and the whole place smelled like a brewery.   Here and there were stills and other equipment that made alcohol.  There was some light in the stomach which came from still functioning lights and streetlights.<br>\r\n                  \"He's going to pay\" said Jenny.  \"I don't know how but Ash will spend time in the pokey\" <br>\r\n                   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n * *************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Delia walked back into the gala which was winding down since it was nearly over.   She spotted Gary chatting with a red-headed man that she recognized.<br>\r\n             \"Is that you, Silver?\" <br>\r\n              Silver and Gary turned to face Delia.  Silver had a natural expression as he nodded in greeting.  \" Hello mother \" <br>\r\n             \"Mother?\" asked Gary.<br>\r\n              \"Yes\" said Delia.  \"Silver is Ash's half-brother\" <br>\r\n             \"I don't recall ever seeing you\" said Gary. <br>\r\n              \" Silver ran away from home shortly after Ash was born \" said Delia.  Silver smiled but it didn't quite reach his eyes.  <br>\r\n               \"Well\" said Silver, clearing his throat.  \"It's been a genuine pleasure to see you again\"  <br>\r\n                Silver made to leave but was stopped by Delia.  \" You're going to talk to me young man.  I haven't seen or heard from you in such a long time \" <br>\r\n             Silver appeared to count to ten before he spoke.  \"I'm in town to get the Earth badge from the gym.   It's under new management apparently\" <br>\r\n         \" Oh? \" asked Gary.  \"You're going to take on the league?\" <br>\r\n          \" Last I heard, you were living in Goldenrod City \" said Delia. <br>\r\n          \"I have several homes\" said Silver .  \"Since I wasn't exactly welcome at home\" <br>\r\n          \"That isn't true at all\" chided Delia.  \"You meant a lot to me\" <br>\r\n          \"Not compared to your precious Ash because he developed powers and I didn't\" said Silver.<br>\r\n            \" Is that why you ran off? \" asked Delia.  \"Because you were jealous of Ash?\" <br>\r\n           \"Call it what you will\" said Silver.  \"Now, if you'll excuse me\" <br>\r\n             Silver walked off.  Delia sighed and made to walk after him when she saw somebody else she knew.<br>\r\n             \"Felix!\" cried Delia walking over to the sandy-brown hair man.   \"Hello my many times grandson\" <br>\r\n               \" Grandson?! \" asked Gary. <br>\r\n                \"I'm 3,500 years old\" said Delia.  \"I have many lovers\" <br>\r\n               \" Hello, Grandmother Delia\" said Felix who smiled but it didn't reach his eyes....but it was several degrees warmer than Silver's smile had been.   Next to Delia was his delphox, Circe. <br>\r\n             \"I'm surprised you showed up here\" said Delia hugging Felix.  \"Wouldn't you just about to leave my church?\" <br>\r\n               \"Not at all\" said Felix.  \"I mean.....yes, I did have a somewhat crisis of faith a few years back but Uncle Ernie set me straight\" <br>\r\n              </span></div></div>",

About ten minutes later, Ash doubled over and vomited up half-digested debris and food.  He also vomitted up several skeletons and a total of three people.   Ash didn't look to see who he had vomited up;  he simply walked on.   <br>\r\n                   \"Where are we going?\" asked Misty.  She then turned her gaze downwards to see that Ash was still sporting an absolutely enormous erection despite making love with a skyscraper earlier in the evening.   She didn't want to look at the erection and yet Misty found that she just couldn't help herself looking at Ash's member.   As she looked, Misty had a mad desire to actually worship the hardened member.  <br>\r\n              \"Someplace to sleep\" said Ash.  His eyes were half-closed and he was heading out of the city itself.  Misty glanced down to see the Ash was walking passed the arcade they had been in earlier that day.   The arcade was near the outskirts of Viridian City.    \"I'm sleepy after eating so much you know\".   Ash then belched rather loudly, which caused him to break out in giggles.  <br>\r\n             Ash entered the dark of Viridian Forest knocking over the occasional tree.  Ash must've walked for nearly a hour before he collapsed to the ground.    Misty held onto Ash's hair to prevent herself  from falling from his shoulder.   <br>\r\n          Ash had fallen down backwards and ended up on his back.   He flattened down a number of trees as well as an abandoned wooden cabin.    It took Misty a couple of minutes for her to realize that Ash had passed out cold.   Nothing she did could wake him up.  Misty shrugged and gave up trying to wake up her 500 foot tall friend.   Instead her gaze turned towards the erection.   The forest was dark but there was a full moon.  The kind of full moon that was brighter than usual and even casted shadows.  <br>\r\n           \"Pika pi chi chu\" said Pikachu on Misty's shoulder.<br>\r\n             \"I'm sure he's fine\" said Misty waving a dissmive hand.  She then paused a thoughtful moment and said, \"I'm sure he's gonna have one hell of a hangover in the morning though\" <br>\r\n               Misty then found herself walking down Ash's naked body towards his crotch .  Misty blinked.  She hadn't noticed that she was walking down his body before. <br>\r\n            \"Pi pika pi pi pikachu\" <br>\r\n           \"I just can't help myself\" said Misty.  \"It's as if I'm drawn to his crotch\" <br>\r\n          Misty was on Ash's stomach by this point.  It might as well been a high hill given how large it was.   Or a small mountain .   Misty avoided going anywhere near Ash's bellybutton which looked to be a giant chasm.   Misty idly wondered just how deep the bellybutton would be.   <br>\r\n            \"Chu chu pika!\"<br>\r\n             Misty sled down Ash's belly in order to reach his erection which seemed to have softened slightly now that Ash was soundly asleep .  <br>\r\n             The erection towered at least thirty feet over Misty.   Misty had to cross a forest of pubic hair which reached to her knees.  When Misty was right next to the member she examined it in awe.   <br>\r\n              \"Pika pi\" <br>\r\n               Misty then started to stroke it slowly and sensually.  She kissed it, fondled it and then licked it.   It was as if Misty was in a trance just by being this close to the towering member.   Misty then started to climb it with little difficulty.    When she reached the wide head of the erection she gave it a long lingering kiss with tongue.  Misty could taste the salty cum that was leftover.<br>\r\n         \"Pikachu?!\" <br>\r\n         Before Misty could tell pikachu to shut up she felt a sudden tug on her tongue from inside the shaft of the penis.  Before Misty could even register that little fact the tug on her tongue became much stronger, pulling Misty's face right into the opening.   In a matter of minutes, the powerful muscles of the penis had pulled Misty inwards until she disappeared from view.   Pikachu had managed to leap from Misty's shoulder and had landed on Ash's scrotum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Misty felt like she was in a very tight tunnel being pulled further in.  She was now receiving <i>the </i> best massage she ever had.  Misty was being massaged absolutely everywhere and it felt simply amazing.  She was dimly aware that she was being pulled further and further in but Misty wasn't worried, not one bit.  <br>\r\n                It wasn't long before Misty felt an orgasm coming on due to the massage her crotch was getting.  She could do nothing to prevent herself from having an orgasm.   She screamed as she reached climax and she could've sworn she felt something enter her....Ash's seed?   The tight tunnel did have residue of what must've been cum all over.  <br>\r\n              Eventually Misty was deposited into some kind of round chamber that had pulsating walls and was filled with Ash's seed.  There wasn't a doubt that Misty had just been deposited into Ash's scrotum.  Misty didn't panic despite learning where she was perhaps due to the massage she was receiving from the pulsating walls.   Misty had to drink the liquid to prevent herself from drowning in cum.   <br>\r\n              \"Well, this is different\" said Misty.  </span></div></div>",

The two could've stayed at the Pokemon center for free but the beds in Pokemon centers were notoriously bad, at least in Felix's experience.    The beds in Pokemon centers tended to be just a simple cot and were rock hard even with sheets and comforters.    <br>\r\n               \"Yeah, yeah\" muttered Felix with half-lidded eyes.  He looked sleepily over at the single bed in the room.   This caused him to widen his eyes.   \"I thought you said you paid for two beds\" <br>\r\n                 Circe smiled devilishly.   \"(You shouldn't have left me with the money)\" she said in a singsong voice.  <br>\r\n              \"I had to go to the bathroom\" said Felix.   He made to reach for the belt of pokeballs around his waist but the belt undid itself and floated away and landed on the cabinet on the far side of the room.   All the while the belt was surrounded by a blue light meaning that Circe had used her psychic powers to move the belt.<br>\r\n              \"It's too late to play these games, Circe\" said Felix.<br>\r\n              \"(You're not wrong)\" said Circe.  \" (What games are you talking about I wonder) \" <br>\r\n             \"None that involve sleeping with you\" said Felix dryly.   <br>\r\n             Circe looked scandalized.  \"(Who ever said I wanted to sleep with you?)\" <br>\r\n            Felix sighed.  \"Ever since the attic\" <br>\r\n            Circe made an impatient sound in her throat.  \"(That was just for fun.  I thought I might give you a little thrill for once in your life)\"<br>\r\n            \" You turned yourself into a human with a book of spells you found in that attic \" said Felix.  \"And then you came up to me and try to seduce me\" <br>\r\n            Circe snorted .  \"(Seduce?!  I knew you liked it.  You can't hide anything from me, Felix.  You were turned on\" <br>\r\n             Felix blushed with made Circe cackle.    <br>\r\n           \"(It was such a nice kiss too)\" said Circe thoughtfully .   \"(You only stopped kissing me because you saw my reflection in a mirror.  I wonder what would've happened if you hadn't saw my reflection)\" <br>\r\n             \" I would've figured it out it was you eventually \" said Felix.  <br>\r\n               \"(Perhaps...)\" said Circe. <br>\r\n              \" Anyway, I'm not sleeping with you \" said Felix.  \"I only sleep with my own species....err...that is, if I ever decide to sleep with someone it would be my own species\" <br>\r\n               \" (You lack imagination) \" <br>\r\n               \"It's not happening, Circe\" said Felix.  <br>\r\n                Circe sighed.   \"(Alright, alright.  Let's get some sleep already)\" <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n            The attic was in a house belonging to an old wizard named Wiorth.   Felix and Circe had come across the house during their journey in the remote parts of the Unova region.    Wiorth himself had been a reasonably famous magician that had died of a stroke some ten years ago.   The house had been long abandoned.   <br>\r\n                It had been Circe that had suggested that he and her should stay in the house for the night and Felix had agreed. The two explored the house which eventually led them to the attic.<br>\r\n           In the attic the two had gone their separate ways looking over the books that were in the attic.   Circe had found a book of spells and so had transformed herself into a very attractive human female and decided to have some mischief.   <br>\r\n               The kiss had been long and lingering.   It was the first time that Circe had felt erotic towards a human and it was vice versa with Felix.   Felix had his eyes closed as he had kissed Circe until he opened his eyes to find out the truth.    When he did figured out the truth, Felix broken off the kiss but not before it was revealed that  he had a tent in his pants.     The two shared a genuine feeling of love in that attic.   A feeling that Felix was hoping to not to repeat.    <br>\r\n                 Love between a Pokemon and its trainer was definitely unusual but certainly not unheard of.  There were legends in the Sinnoh region that in the distant past that humans actually married Pokemon but they were only legends.    <br>\r\n             <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Felix slept in the bed while Circe slept on the floor. She was used to sleeping on the floor so it wasn't a big deal.   It took a long time for Circe to fall asleep.<br>\r\n             Circe wasn't Felix's starter pokemon.  He had chosen a froakie for his starter.    Circe had been an abandoned Pokemon left by the roadside.   Felix had taken Circe in.    It had been four months later that Felix had traded his froakie for a Honchkrow.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       For future reference, these are Felix's Pokemon (in no particular order) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Circe (f)<br>\r\n           Lycanroc (midnight form, male) <br>\r\n          Serperior (f)<br>\r\n         Honchkrow (f)<br>\r\n        Raichu (m)<br>\r\n       Feraligatr (m) </span></div></div>",

The middle of the stomach was a lake of greenish acid while the sides of it had what amounted to be a shoreline.  This shoreline was slick with moisture and was ten feet above the lake of acid.   The shoreline was also twenty feet wide and was perhaps half a mile long.   The whole stomach was perhaps a mile in diameter in every direction.   <br>\r\n            Officer Jenny wasn't the only person living in the stomach.  There were perhaps a total of sixty people in the stomach.   There were plenty of food for the people to eat.  While not an ideal place to live in it was rather comfortable.  The giant thump of Ash's heart seemed to have a calming effect on the people within the stomach.  <br>\r\n          It had been one of Professer Oak's aides that had figured out that Ash's stomach was way too big even for a person for his size.  <br>\r\n            \"He did told me he was a god...\" muttered Jenny.  Jenny had dismissed the claim that Ash had made that he was a god because of his drunkiness but now she was starting to think differently.  <br>\r\n         The lake of acid was littered with both debris and the remains of people.  It may have been possible to navigate the acid lake on the debris but Jenny saw little cause to do that since it didn't appear that there was another shoreline on the other side of the lake.  <br>\r\n             It was impossible to tell how deep the lake was because of all the debris floating around and it wasn't exactly a clear liquid either.   <br>\r\n          The stomach made gurgling and growling noises and, since the stomach was cavernous, the noises were echoed across the stomach.  <br>\r\n         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Ash drifted in and out of consciousness in the morning.  He had a tremendous hangover and he had no desire to get up or eat.....or anything else for that matter.   He had little memory of what happened last night.   He did remember what his mother had told him but not much else.   Ash continued to feel a tingling in his crotch but he ignored it.   He then wondered what had happened to Misty.  <br>\r\n             Ash had indeed shrunk in the morning.   He now resembled a snorlax but a snolax would be insanely jealous of the belly Ash was now sporting.   He had gained weight on his face giving him two chins.  He had also gained weight all over his body but most of it was focused around his belly.    Ash probably weighed at least two tons and was now ten feet tall.   Pikachu kept bouncing on his belly which annoyed Ash but he didn't have the energy to tell pikachu off.   <br>\r\n             <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    *********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     May awoke in the middle of Viridian Forest in her sleeping bag.   She had camped out last night.   She climbed out of the sleeping bag and stretched the kinks out of her muscles.  <br>\r\n         May, now a eighteen year old, had changed since her journeys with Ash.  The biggest change had to be her bust which were now a sizable E-Cup.  May always had a big bust for her age ever since she was born.  The rest of her curves were a lot more curvier.   <br>\r\n         May had received an invitation for Ash's eighteenth birthday a week before from Ash's mom Delia.   Max had also gotten an invitation but he had been far too busy to come.   May didn't mind traveling alone because she had her Pokemon with her.  <br>\r\n            May cleaned up the campsite after she had breakfast.  She walked towards Viridian City with the help of a pokenav.   <br>\r\n           It was twenty or so minutes later when she heard snoring in the distance.    Snoring that came from something big.  Her first thought was that a snorlax was nearby.   <br>\r\n              May exited into a large clearing where she saw......<br>\r\n              \"Ash?! Is that really you?\" <br>\r\n            There was no response from the enormously fat Ash, just more snoring.  May blinked at her old friend a number of times before finally noticing that he was naked.  She yelped and averted her eyes.....or tried to avert her eyes but found herself staring at the naked Ash.   <br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

She just couldn't help herself: as soon as May saw the huge belly of her friend she had felt compelled to climb on his belly and just lay on it.  Pikachu was still bouncing on Ash's belly while May settled herself on the stomach.   As soon as May did so she found herself sinking into the soft doughy skin.   She enjoyed the feeling of slowly sinking into the flab so much that she hardly noticed that she really <i>was</i> sinking into the flab until she was nearly surrounded by doughy flesh.  <br>\r\n        \"Hey, what's happening?\" asked May.  Ash's belly couldn't be that deep!   But it clearly was that deep because it wasn't long before May sank right to her neck.   As May sank ever deeper into the fatty flesh her growing fear simply evaporated.   She was eager to be surrounded by nothing but belly fat!     That's when May started to lick and kiss the stomach that was pulling her deeper and deeper.<br>\r\n            \"Pikachu! Pi pi chu chu!\" <br>\r\n           \" It's alright, pikachu\" said May in a far-off voice and her eyes went unfocused.  \"I'm with my god now\"<br>\r\n           \" Pika pi pika pika chu pi\" <br>\r\n           \"What's that?\" asked May as her head vanished from view and she was sinking even deeper into Ash's stomach.   Even though she couldn't breathe very well she found that she was getting plenty of oxygen.  She didn't knew or care just how she remained breathing within the tight confines of flab.   <br>\r\n               May continued to sink deeper.    When May had reached a certain depth she felt something happening that she couldn't quite explain.    It was as if she was actually merging with Ash.  <br>\r\n          \"Yes, let us be one\" said May in a dreamy voice.  <br>\r\n           Ash mumbled something in his sleep.  <br>\r\n             May was starting to feel less and less of herself.  She wanted this to happen so much!  She could hardly think straight at this point.  <br>\r\n          Suddenly, May felt something grab her hand and pull her upwards.  In a matter of minutes, May was back on the surface of Ash's large stomach.   May protested half-heartedly at being pulled away from her god.  <br>\r\n              May blinked and was snapped out of the trance she had been under.   She was surprised to see Delia Ketchum sitting next to her.<br>\r\n           \"Delia?\" asked May.  \" What happened to me....?  What happened to Ash?  Why am I thinking of Ash as my god? \" <br>\r\n           \"Because he <i>is</i> a god\" said Delia.  \" A demigod to be precise \" <br>\r\n         \"What?!\" asked May utterly bewildered.  <br>\r\n         \"It's a long story\" said Delia sliding off of her son's stomach and going to his crotch.  She then....well, started to masturbate her own son!  <br>\r\n       \"What are doing that for?!\" asked May sounding scandalized. <br>\r\n        \"To get Misty out of there of course\" said Delia pointing at the scrotum.    May blinked numbly as Delia continued her work.  <br>\r\n           Ash stirred but didn't wake.  He made pleasuring noises. Seeing Delia doing <i>that</i> to her son made May feel hot.   May had to use a good part of her will not to finger herself right there and then.<br>\r\n           Eventually Ash reached his climax and let loose a virtual fire hose of cum.   Misty exited the flared head of the cock completely covered in cum and May gasped when she saw that Misty was heavily pregnant. <br>\r\n           \"How many kids does she have in there??!\" asked May aloud.<br>\r\n            It looked as if Misty was carrying at least thirty babies!  Misty's pregnant belly rivaled Ash's stomach in sheer size.   <br>\r\n              Misty herself looked to be in a daze.  She wore a rather goofy smile plastered all over her face as she lovingly caressed her own belly. <br>\r\n        \"How....? What??\" asked May.  <br>\r\n        \" I said it was a long story \" said Delia.  Delia looked Misty over and sighed.  \"I don't think the poor girl can even walk\"<br>\r\n    Indeed, Misty was lying on her side attempting to get up despite being in a daze.   <br>\r\n       \"Looks like we just need to wait until Ash recovers from his hangover\" said Delia.<br>\r\n      \" Hangover?! \" asked May.<br>\r\n      \"Yes\" said Delia.  \"He...er, drank a brewery on accident the poor dear\" <br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

When she did so she seemed awfully confused as to how she had became pregnant.  Misty didn't seem that upset to learn that she <i>was</i> pregnant while caressing her own belly. <br>\r\n              \"Why should I be upset?\" asked Misty.  \"I'm having <i>His</i> babies after all. In fact I want more in me!\" <br>\r\n            \" More?! \" asked May.  \"Don't you have enough in there?\" <br>\r\n            \" Not nearly enough \" said Misty and she had a bit of a mad glint in her eyes.  Misty tried and failed to stand up thanks to the weight of her heavily pregnant self.  \"I want to be huge!   Fill me up with your babies my lord!\" <br>\r\n          \" Quiet down\" said Delia. <br>\r\n           \"Oh, hello Ms. Ketchum\" said Misty finally noticing that Delia was there.   <br>\r\n         \"Hello there\" said Delia smiling down at Misty.<br>\r\n          \"Can we get back on the subject that Ash is a God?\" asked May.<br>\r\n         \" Demigod\" corrected Delia. <br>\r\n           \"Demigod?\" asked May .  \"You mean one of his parents is a...\" <br>\r\n          Misty nodded.  \"Apparently, Delia is a goddess....his father was mortal\" <br>\r\n         \" What's the difference between a God and a demigod? \" asked May.<br>\r\n            \"Gods are immortal\" said Delia.  \" Demigods are gods that have mortal traits, such as a lifespan.   Demigods age a lot slower than mortals. Ash has a lifespan of 1,500 years\" <br>\r\n           \"1,500?!\" asked May and Misty .<br>\r\n            Delia nodded.  \"Ash is mortal but he's <i>extremely</i> hard to kill now.  For example Ash could live through explosions and he could probably live in the vacuum of space\" <br>\r\n         \" What can kill Him? \" asked May.<br>\r\n         Delia shrugged.  \"An ultra high dose of radiation could do it.  I mean radiation much higher than anything you can find on Earth\" <br>\r\n           \"Ash certainly has the charisma of a god\" said May suddenly finding herself massaging Ash's arm.<br>\r\n          \"Yeah He has\" argeed Misty who couldn't do much on the ground.<br>\r\n           \"Naturally\" said Delia.  \" It seems that Ash has  already chosen his disciples.  The first ones out of many\" <br>\r\n             Ash stirred but didn't wake.  <br>\r\n             May was massaging Ash's arm and rubbing her face on it while kissing and licking it.  Misty crawled her way towards Ash and managed to reach his hand and started to caress it lovingly.  Both May and Misty's eyes were unfocused.<br>\r\n              \"I'd just leave you three alone\" said Delia.   When Delia received no response from either May or Misty she just grinned to herself and quietly walked away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The park is like any other amusement park: it has rides, shows, stunt shows, and everything else that an amusement park has.  Ash finds out that the park is actually ran by three extremely powerful pokemon that call themselves The Three Vixens.  The Three Vixens are: Delphox, Zoroark and Ninetales.  As the name implies all three are females.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got the idea From the park in the anime movie \"Pom Poko\" which features an amusement park ran by kitsunes.  While Pom Poko is not my favorite Studio Ghibli movie, a park ran by shape-shifting foxes is a fantastic idea.  And those three Fox pokemon fit in with the kitsune myths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy only problem is I'm not sure who the viewpoint character should be.  I'm thinking of Ash.....but it can really be anyone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Zoroark can create illusions, the Three Vixens appear as three attractive human women when out in public.  Only a handfull of trainers at the park discovers the truth. One or all three can have romantic feelings towards a human.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GTS/GT can come from Zoroark's illusions or Delphox's psychic ability to make someone grow and Ninetales can turn humans into any type of Pokemon with her hex ability so there's an opportunity for TF.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Three Vixens aren't against being caught by a trainer but each of the three are unusually powerful so the chances of that happening is slim but not impossible.  Just don't let them be captured quickly or easily.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he reached the bottom of the ladder, he sensed somebody behind him.  Felix whirled around to see the hot 30ish woman that partially owned this new amusement park near the heart of the Unova Region.  The woman had fiery red hair and wearing an equally fiery red double-breasted suit.  The woman had an attractive face with high cheekbones and a smile that made Felix's knees buckle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done with the sign I see\" said the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really you, Circe?\" asked Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman---Circe--- nodded.  \"That Zoroark knows her stuff.

Felix protested at first but gave up and kissed Circe passionately.  For minutes, the two just stood there missing.

He turned and saw a woman in a black suit with red trimmings.  The newcomer had black hair with red tips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a room, you two\" said the Zoroark in her human guise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous, Zoroko?\" asked Circe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroko snorted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Grand Opening is next week\" a third voice said.  A Ninetales appeared from the darkness.  \"We don't have time for hanky-panky\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a pride, Rena\" said Circe.  \"And why aren't you in your human guise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't like the illusion that Zoroko gave me\" said Rena.  \"The breasts were too big\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix huffed. \"You gotta get used to walking around as a human before the opening\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena fixed her gaze at the human. \"Have you sent out all the invitations?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded.  \"I had help of course.  With that Bruce kid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" said Rena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away now so I can....\" started Circe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no time for that\" said Zoroko.  \"We got to hire lots of people to run this park besides us\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The remains of a campfire was still smoking but there was no fire that could be seen.  A little away from the smoldering fire was a sleeping bag with two sleeping people in it.  At the foot of the sleeping bag slept a Pikachu along with the disregarded clothes of the two people including a hard-to-find cap.  The bird-type pokemon were singing their morning song in the sky.  <br>\r\n     \"Do we have to get up?\" asked a groggy male voice belonging to a eighteen year old Ash Ketchum.  Ash had his arm draped over the other occupant of the sleeping bag, a red-headed twenty year old by the name of Misty. When the redhead didn't respond Ash blurrily looked over at his companion.  <br>\r\n    \"You're not fooling anyone you know\" said Ash.  \"I know you're awake\"<br>\r\n     Still there was no response. <br>\r\n     Ash whipped off his side of the bag revealing his nudity to the early morning.  Misty was still covered in the bag.  Ash carefully got up and went over to the remains of the fire and urinated on it.<br>\r\n      \"You're so crude\" came Misty's voice.  She propped herself up on her elbow and watched Ash urinate. <br>\r\n      \"Would you prefer that I pee on you?\" asked Ash, glancing over his shoulder.  <br>\r\n      \"Don't you dare, Ash Ketchum!\" <br>\r\n      \"You know you're jealous\" said Ash.  \"You girls don't have an attached firehose\"<br>\r\n      Misty rolled her eyes while Ash turned around to face her, his urination done.  For minutes the two lovers simply looked at each other smiling.  <br>\r\n     \"You want to get me my clothes?\" asked Misty.  \"Some of us have a sense of modesty\" <br>\r\n     \"You definitely didn't show it last night\" said Ash showing Misty a lewd look. He went over to her clothes and tossed the bundle to her.  \"Anyway, I happen to like a healthy breeze on my genitals every now and then.  We're all alone here\" <br>\r\n  \"Whatever\" came the response.  \"I'm just happy that Brock isn't with us\" <br>\r\n   \"He's already at this new theme park\" said Ash, going over to his own clothes and started to pull them on.  It was then when pikachu woke up.<br>\r\n   \"Pika pi chu pi pika\" said the mouse Pokemon.  <br>\r\n   \"Morning Pikachu\" said Ash pulling on his shirt.  <br>\r\n   \"How far is this theme park?\" asked Misty, now fully dressed and out of the sleeping bag.  <br>\r\n    \"Ten miles\" said Ash.  \"Give or take.  It opens at noon.  We should be there by then\"<br>\r\n   \"If we don't take one of your shortcuts\" said Misty in a teasing tone. <br>\r\n    \"It's not too late to spank you before we leave\" said Ash.  <br>\r\n    Misty chuckled and kissed Ash on the mouth.  \"Grab the sleeping bag and the pokeballs and let's go\" <br>\r\n   Pikachu jumped on Ash's shoulder as usual as he packed up the sleeping bag and the pokeballs.  <br>\r\n       \"Let's go\" said Ash and the two lovers began their way towards the newly opened theme park. </span></div></div>",

It's gotta be worth more than that\"<br>\r\n                    The nerdy-looking man was holding a strange-looking berry that was orange-red and covered in green patches--rather unusual looking.  It was also quite large for a berry.  While most berries were small and easy to carry for a Pokemon, the new strange berry was the size of  a bowling ball.  It looked as if no pokemon can hold it easily unless they were in their evolved form.  Also the strange berry had an odd smell.  <br>\r\n                               The clerk of the mart, a woman in her thirties shook her head.  \"All berries are sold at a reasonable price no matter if the berry is newly discovered\"<br>\r\n                              \"But...this berry is worth more than thirty dollars!\" said the nerdy man.   \"just look at it!  It's most unusual in both size and coloring!  I'll give you 70 dollars for it!\"<br>\r\n                           \"30 is the standard price\" said the clerk.  <br>\r\n                           \"But this <i>isn't</i> a standard berry\" said the man. <br>\r\n                          \"30 is my only offer\" said the clerk.  \"take it or leave it\"<br>\r\n                            The man sighed.  \"Oh all right. 30 it is, then\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                            The nerdy man walked out of the mart some minutes later.  The man whistled while he walked some distance away from the mart which was located near the very heart of Slateport City.  He ducked into an alley and made his way towards the docks through a route that only he knew.  Finally he came upon a large warehouse and entered it.<br>\r\n                               The warehouse seemed darker than it had been when he had left it nearly a hour ago.   <br>\r\n        <br>\r\n                              \"I've managed to sell it\" said the man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                               From the shadows, a loud belch was heard.   \"Excellent.  Soon I won't be the only one with this condition\" said a big booming male voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                \"If you wanted someone else with your condition\" said the nerdy man.   \"why couldn't I eat it then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                               \"I want a female companion\" said the big voice.   \"I trust you know the reason\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                  \"..and what if she doesn't want to be with you?\" asked the nerdy man.   \"and anyway, the chances of a woman buying that berry....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                     \"I know\" said the big male voice.   \"there's a chance that another male will get it and eat it.  It's a risk I'm willing to take\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                    The nerdy man nodded slightly and wrinkled his nose as he caught the smell in the warehouse.   \"Did you just....?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                    \"Right before you came back\" said the big voice.   \"would you mind dumping it in the sewer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                        \"You know it's a good thing we're such good friends\" said the nerdy man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    ***************<i>A Few Days Later....</i>***************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"That's a weird-looking berry you got there, Brock\" said Ash.<br>\r\n                                 Ash, Brock, May and Max were in the city of Slateport for the opening of the new chocolate factory there.  May had wanted to see the brand-new factory and get some chocolate candies there.  While they were waiting for the factory to open, Brock had gone shopping for pokemon food.  When he had came back to the pokemon center, Ash noticed that Brock was carrying an unusual-looking berry.  <br>\r\n                                  \"It sure is\" said Brock.  \"it's a newly discovered berry from what the clerk told me\"<br>\r\n                                   \"A newly discovered berry?\" asked Max.  <br>\r\n                                    \"What's the big deal about that?\" scoffed May.   <br>\r\n                                     \"It's not everyday that a new berry is discovered\" said Max.  <br>\r\n                                      \"Forget about the berry\" said May.  \"I'm in the mood for people food.  When does that factory open?\"<br>\r\n                                     \"Two hours\" said Max. <br>\r\n                                        \"Two hours?!\" whined May.   \"but I'm starving now!  Alright, let's go eat at a restaurant\"<br>\r\n                                         \"We don't have enough money\" said Brock.  \"I just spent the last of the money on pokemon food\"<br>\r\n                                           \"Pika!\" chimed in Pikachu who  was on the shoulder of Ash.<br>\r\n                                         May eyed the berry in Brock's hand.   \"I'm so hungry I could eat that\"<br>\r\n                                        \"Berries are meant for pokemon\" said Max.  <br>\r\n                                        \"I don't care\"  said May, snatching the berry away from Brock.

Even though it was pitch black since the sun had set some forty minutes ago, the little pokemon had no trouble navigating the forest.  None of the other pokemon that lived in the forest took much notice of the passing Jirachi.  Seeing a Jirachi wasn't all that special.  There were probably hundreds of the wish-granting pokemon wandering throughout the world.  <br>\r\n                                       Not all Jirachi took the 1,000-year sleep and certainly not this Jirachi.  Sleeping was boring.  Granting wishes was so much more fun. Carelessly granting wishes was even better.  It made stuff more interesting.  If someone happened to wish for the end of the world, this little Jirachi will grant it and gleefully watch as the world ended--only to take back the wish as though as if the wish was never spoken out loud to begin with.  Of course nobody wished for the world to end---but people did wish for interesting stuff to happen.  If the situation got too out of hand, Jirachi would reverse time so that the wish was never granted.  <br>\r\n                   Jirachi had reversed time only a hour ago after granting a human near-unlimited power and the results were truly fascinating.  Now, Jirachi was looking for a new human to have fun with.  Jirachi had wandered into this dense forest just to see if any humans were in the forest.  It wasn't unusual that pokemon trainers would spend the night in a forest like this one.  <br>\r\n                                Jirachi then stumbled upon a small campfire with four humans near it.  Two of the humans looked to be asleep while the two other humans looked to be having a pokemon battle.  Jirachi was amazed that anyone could sleep with a pokemon battle going on.  Jirachi then scanned the minds of all the humans.<br>\r\n                  It seemed that the four did encounter a Jirachi some years ago.  A Jirachi that took the \"1,000-year nap\" as this Jirachi put it.  Nothing all that exciting happened with that Jirachi....interesting, yes...but not all that exciting.  <br>\r\n                             As Jirachi watched, the battle came to an end with the boy in a red hat win.  Jirachi was resting high on a tree branch overlooking the camp site.  Jirachi decided to rest for a bit and, perhaps later, grant some wishes. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n                            \"That was a good match, May\" said Ash. <br>\r\n                              \"You're as good as ever\" said May. <br>\r\n                              \"I don't let myself get rusty\" said Ash.<br>\r\n                            \"Pika\" chimed in Pikachu on Ash's shoulder.

Although different then the first Jirachi they met she quickly understood what happen and began thinking about what her next wish should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks about what cool things she can do with the wish she already had then realized that it didn't give her the power of legendary pokemon like Dialga's time control or Dialga's power over space. Then she remembered the monster movies Max use to watch at home and thinks how cool it would be to tower of building But, the real question was does she make a complex wish that allows more outcomes, The powers of the Gods to shape the world how she wants or to just gain the power to change the size of any object.</span></div></div>",

She went to the widest of theses building and leaned over to look in the windows to see groups of people trying to escape. May feels like playing so she tells them they better hurry before she takes a wide stance. She makes fists with her hands and brings them up as she takes the buildings height. Starting and half the buildings height she grows in spurts, 3/4th height, same height, breast height, butt height, the finally knees height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay puts her hands on her hips and looks at the other buildings still at her upper stomach level. She looks down at them as she takes their height imagining the the building are cowering from her dominance. This feeling of superiority was a huge turn on so grabbed the 1st build which now sat at ankle height and laid down keeping the bigger buildings intact but leveling a few blocks. Mocking May says \"I hope everyone escaped.\" as she started to use the building as a dildo. May started slow but quickly sped up thinking of the power she held over this city, how she towered over the largest buildings, how she will crush the entire city under her shoe when she is done. Soon the building crumbles inside her so she reaches over for the next building that she shrinks to an enjoyable size before sticking it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 Orgasms and about 5 buildings later May lays there enjoying a moment of complete ecstasy She tilts her head and sees most the building are smaller the her nose height as she lays there. Then she notices a some small red lights that seem to be hitting her. Confused she sits up and looks around to see lots of spot lights pointed at her and still seeing some red lights hitting her and disappearing. She tries to think of what those lights could be and soon she figures it out. May bursts out laughing when she discovers that the red lights must be fire pokemon trying to stop her which meant that the trainer in the city were trying to stop her with attacks she couldn't even feel. May imagines hundreds of pokemon around her trying to do any form of damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her pokemon powers May spits to create a water gun attack that levels another block before see stands up at full height. She leans to the side and puts her hand on her hip as she watches the city struggling below her. The spotlight were only pointing as high as her skirt when the attacks seemed centered around her ankles. Some helicopters tried to light her face but they bothered her so May just swatted them with her free hand. Then she makes a fist and says, \"You guys sure you want to fight me?\" The attacks continue so she just shrugs and steps forward into position to deliver a mega punch right into the center of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock wave was enormous anything within near the impact was desalinated. when she pulled back her fist the crater was taller the any building the city ever had. She smiled down knowing that her message was received. with thousand dead none who survived dared to show any signs of life as the entire city went quiet. Proudly she looked over the city before say, \"Well its been fun but I think I've outgrown this city.\" Then she lifted both hands in front of her like she was holding a large ball. Then as she brought her hands together she grew impossibly, big impossibly fast reaching a size none of the cities survivors could comprehend. Then she lifts her foot probably, mere inches to her, over the city and as she lowers her foot one of the largest cities in the world is erased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay takes a moment to grind her foot over the city to make sure it was destroyed before she looks to see a mountain range that looks perfect to sleep on so she lays down and soon falls asleep dreaming of all she games she can do in the morning. But Jirachi doesn't sleep he can't sleep knowing that he unleashed this power on the world and she stopped him from being able to reverse it.

May crawled into her own sleeping bag and took longer to fall asleep.  As the darkness of dreaming took her May thought that something had flown into the campsite because of a faint whooshing sound.  She blurriry looked around but saw nothing.  Shrugging, May fell to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      May didn't knew when the dream started.  It could've been going on for ten minutes or even ten seconds.  Nevertheless the dream started for her when she noticed she was walking down a winding forest path.  The forest was dark with a full moon over it. She was all alone as far as she could tell.  Suddenly a shadowy figure jumped from the surrounding forest.  The shadowy figure was shaped just like a human but was quite weird looking. It did have two all-black eyes as well as scaley skin.  The figure seemed to be out of focus.  The edges of the figure were dancing like the creature was also out of phase as well as out of focus. It wordlessly looked her over and opened its mouth.  Two tongues zipped out and grabbed her by the head.  May's first instinct was to scream, but she reached out with her hand and said in a very loud commanding voice \"BE GONE!\" <br>\r\n         The shadowy figure vanished and so had the forest.  She was floating in a black void. Panicking May brought the forest back minus the demon that had assaulted her.  That was when she realized she was dreaming.  She had inadvertently discovered that she was in full control of the dream.  It was a lucid dream. May had only a handful of lucid dreams that she ever remember having.  Smiling to herself May built an absolutely gargantuan castle with her will.<br>\r\n          May had a secret fantasy all her life: to be a ruling queen over a country and have people bow down to her.  This time, she decided, being a queen wasn't enough. She'd be a goddess.  She practically was a goddess in her own dream.  So she wiped the castle from existence and clapped her hands together.  A great booming noise and energy came from the clap and expanded everywhere.  The forest changed into a swirling mass of stars; May had created an universe just by clapping.  Soon she created galaxies, stars, black holes, white holes and any number of spacial annomies that was seen in Star Trek.<br>\r\n     \"I am May and I am the light\" said May in a voice that reverberated with power. \"I am your goddess\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        The dream soon ended and May jerked awake.  It was still nighttime.  May sighed heavily.<br>\r\n         \"I wish I was a goddess\" she mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Jirachi perked its ears up as soon as it heard the human female utter a wish. A big wish.  A rather tall wish for Jirachi truth be told.  It had never granted godhood before.  Jirachi didn't even knew if it was even possible to grant such a wish.  It had to use all its power to grant the requested wish.  The fact that the wish was utterly ridiculous didn't bother Jirachi; it loved a challenge.  So the wish-granting Pokemon concentrated hard and  attempted to grant godhood.<br>\r\n        All that happened was that May suddenly grew fifty feet in height. She had fallen asleep again so she failed to notice her clothes rip apart as well as the sleeping bag.  Ash, Brock and Max ended up in her expanding cleavage. <br>\r\n        Jirachi blinked.  It didn't mean to make the human grow.  It concentrated again.....but only made May grow even bigger.  Again and again Jirachi tried to grant the absurd wish...and it only made May grow ever bigger.  The Jirachi stopped trying when May was near a thousand feet tall.  Jirachi was more than a little miffed about this.  Jirachi was thinking about aborting this crazy wish when it decided it would try one more time. It spent much longer concentrating and this time.....and it focused on giving the girl infinite everything.  </span></div></div>",

It was....the sky....it took Ash a few minutes to register what he was actually seeing.  It took him much longer to do much of anything than to simply stare in utter awe....and reverence.   <br>\r\n     The entirety of the sky was just an eye. An eye that bathed the world in blue light.  The eye itself was blue but the sclera was golden mixed with a deep red.  It was an unsettling sight to be sure.  The eye seemed to be looking all around unable to focus on any one thing.  It wasn't long before Brock and Max were looking up at the eye as well.  The three companions were locked in place and couldn't move.  <br>\r\n           Several minutes later, the eye shifted to Ash and his friends and the three immediately bowed as if on instinct.  <br>\r\n      \" <b>Ash? Brock? Max? Why are you so tiny?</b>\"<br>\r\n        The voice reverberated like the voice of god.....which clearly was the case.  The three had no trouble in recognizing the voice.

Then he looked at the PokeNav in his hand and squinted at it.  \"I don't see <i>any</i> towns on here\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Why did we went in this direction anyway?\" asked May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"I thought it was a shortcut\" said Ash.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                      \"You and your shortcuts\" said May.  \"don't we have anything to eat?

And anyway, it's just one piece.  Do you really think that only one piece of Rare Candy could satisfy your hunger?\"<br>\r\n                                     \"He has a point there\" said Ash.  <br>\r\n                                    All this talk about a human eating Rare Candy made Brock think back to several years ago when he had read a story in the newspaper about a human eating a Rare Candy.  For the life of him he couldn't remember what had happened to make a young trainer named Jonas to eat the Rare Candy.  But the results were startling;  Jonas had gained nearly five feet in height!  <br>\r\n                                       \"Eating Rare Candy can have unusual side effects\" said Brock and he told the others about the newspaper article. <br>\r\n                                      \"Oh come on\" laughed May.  \"You can't honesty think that some candy can do that\"<br>\r\n                                      \"How can that be possible?\" asked Ash. <br>\r\n                                       \"I don't know\" said Brock.  \"but I'd be weary of eating Rare Candy\" <br>\r\n                                       \"I'm not you\" said May and snatched the Rare Candy from Ash's hand.   \"And I don't much care either.  I'm starving and if this is the only food we have then so be it!\"  She popped the Rare Candy into her mouth and swallowed it.   </span></div></div>",

Within a couple of seconds, she rubbed her belly and let out a less than dainty burp. \"Oof...man, those candies sure are filling!

As she finished her snack, Brock and the others watched with wide-eyed anticipation to see if his fears would come true, and May was beginning to find their leering annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, guys, you can stop staring now, there's obviously nothing weird happening!\" She pouted and continued off down the forest path, leaving the boys to follow behind her. Max stroked his chin as he walked, deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I'm not surprised that there weren't any strange effects, but it still doesn't make sense for that one rare candy to have filled her up...\" He continued to ponder to himself, until his thoughts were interrupted by Ash nervously tapping him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Max... you might wanna look again,\" the trainer said uneasily, pointing a trembling finger at May. All three boys turned to watch and were shocked as they saw May slowly and steadily growing taller! Her tight red T-shirt grew even tighter over her expanding breasts, and soon began to ride up to reveal her belly. Likewise, her shorts started to look like they were painted onto her swelling ass, and rips started to rapidly spread across them and her shirt, exposing her frilly pink panties and bra. Bafflingly, May seemed to not notice her rapid growth, even as her every footfall boomed louder than the last and she passed the height of the surrounding trees. Soon, she stood at least 50 feet tall, her boobs and butt exploding out of their confines and bouncing around wildly as they expanded to their full size, and her shoes quickly blew off in turn, leaving the immense Coordinator naked as she stopped and stood in shock amid the tiny trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what the heck happened?!\" May shrieked, her powerful voice echoing across the forest and briefly deafening her friends.

Ever since growing into the huge and sexy giant she was now, the young coordinator couldn't shake a rising feeling of power and confidence building within her. She already seemed to have stopped caring about being naked in front of her friends, even as the chilly evening breeze blowing across her bare breasts began to make her thick nipples grow hard. It seemed as though being a giantess appealed to the performer in her, so to speak. What better way to have everyone's eyes on her? And besides, with size came strength, and the approaching darkness no longer seemed daunting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" she began, a sly smile creeping onto her huge face, \"We don't need to camp! Just look at how huge I am, we'll make it to Fortree City in no time if I take us there!\" The boys seemed somewhat confused by her last statement, and Max began to ask what she meant  by \"taking them\", only to be cut off as his giant sister suddenly scooped them up in her arms and began to stomp confidently toward the next town, easily plowing through though the forest trees as she did. All three normal-sized boys were shocked and embarrassed into submission, as May had proceeded to huddle them all against her massive, heaving bust as she carried them along, feeling the soft, warm breast flesh pressed against their tiny bodies.</span></div></div>",

May's footsteps were like mini-earthquakes as she strolled along.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"This is the only way to travel\" said Ash who was facing outwards instead of inwards at May's heaving chest.

It made her feel even more powerful.  She then started to wonder what would happen if she ate another Rare Candy?  How much taller would she get if she ate another Rare Candy?    That thought made May's stomach rumble which was audible to Ash and the gang.  The three exchanged worried glances.   How much would May eat at this size?!

The giant coordinator's booming laughter echoed through the city, and her enormous breasts and ass jiggled and wobbled with each step. Ash and the others struggled to hold on as they were jostled around in their soft prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May, stop and think about this, for Arceus' sake!\" yelled Brock, his voice hard to hear over the constant din of May's stomping and the panicking citizens around them. \"You're bigger than a house, what food could possibly be enough for you?!\" The girl in question merely chuckled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... well, it's not like I'll just be having one little plate-- a whole restaurant should do!\" As she finished speaking, young giantess stopped at a particularly high tree building-- much to her delight, it was home to Fortree City's famous noodlehouse. \"Mmm, my favorite!\" she exclaimed, licking her lips as she reaches out and began to pull the restaurant out of the large tree it was housed in. She was a little bit taller than the tree itself, and was just about able to handle the noodlehouse in her large but delicate fingers. With great strength, she yanked off the roof and lifted the small building up to her gaping mouth, pouring its contents into her gullet. The people inside had evacuated when they first heard about the giant girl rampaging through the treetop city, but she still ended up devouring all the food they'd left behind, along with scores of furniture, cooking equipment, and every other edible and inedible thing left in the restaurant. Once it was empty, she shoved the remains of the house into her mouth and easily chomped up the wooden structure, before patting her belly proudly and letting out a tremendous belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBUUURRRRPPPPPPPP!!!!! Mmm, now that was a meal!\" Satisfied for now, May sat her bulbous ass down on the sidewalk and leaned back against another building, rubbing her round, swollen gut. All the while, Ash, Max, and Brock had been stuck in her cleavage and were forced to watch the whole thing, feeling quite mortified at their friend's gluttonous display.</span></div></div>",

At first it sounded like the prelude to another belch but the belch never came.

The normally skinny May was gaining weight all over her body.  Her belly, hands, arms, breasts, thighs were all plumping up with fat.   May wasn't only plumping up with fat; her muscles seemed to be getting more sculpted and developed--no doubt she needed stronger muscles to support her new weight.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           It seemed that May was gaining the most weight in her belly which already was bigger than a house by itself and was still getting bigger.

But her belly remained the biggest, with her massive breasts and butt close behind. Eventually, May's growth came to a stop when her fat had grown to nearly cover the city horizontally, and by this point, she began to stir and yawn, slowly lifting her massive self up into a standing position before letting out a long, loud yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...that was a good nap,\" she remarked, her voice now deep and booming from the thousands of tons of weight she had put on. </span></div></div>",

Is this gonna happen every time I eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"Don't tell me she's still hungry\" said Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                               May looked down and saw Ash, Brock and Max were in the shadow of her vast belly.  It was kinda hard for her to see them on the ground due to her belly and she didn't dare lean forward to get a better look for fear of toppling over and squash the three boys with her bulk.   She considered Max's statement before answering.   \"I'm quite full now, little brother\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"She had better be\" said Ash.   \"if she eats another building, she might cover the city with her fat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"City-Sized me\" said May in a dreamy voice.   \"looks like I'm almost city-sized now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"So....uhh...\" said Brock.   \"what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           \"I have a few ideas...\" said May and then something happened to her eyes for just an instant;  her blue eyes had an ethereal glow around them.  The glow came and went in a heartbeat.  For that instant, Ash had the uncontrollable urge to offer food for May.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           \"Such as?\" asked Brock with just a twinge of fear in his voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           \"I feel like a queen looming over you all like this\"  said May.   \"so why not I rule this city as one?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"...What?\" asked Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"I'm large and in charge\" said May.   \"I'm the biggest one here so I should be the one in charge\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         Before Ash, Brock and Max could say anything, a new voice came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"Who says you're the biggest one around here?\" asked a new voice.  May turned around to see who had spoken.  </span></div></div>",

Except it was... well, a lot more of him than she remembered! Evidently, Drew had gotten hold of some Rare Candies as well, along with copious amounts of food afterward-- he too had ballooned into a massive blubber titan, standing more than a head taller than May and packing on even more tonnage than her. He was totally naked, of course, and sported a huge multi-rolled gut that hung well past his waist and dragged again the ground, as well as great, floppy moobs that could give May's chest a run for its money, and a round, chubby face with numerous chins that was currently displaying an arrogant smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see you becoming Queen of anything, at least not as long as I'm around!\" he boomed smugly, stomping toward May and sending his fat jiggling wildly. The slightly-smaller Coordinator fumed at the sight of her rival outdoing her again, even as she blushed a little from seeing him so huge and so... exposed. Nevertheless, her newfound domination instinct reigned supreme, and from the ground Ash could see her eyes once again light up with that otherworldly blue glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" she said defiantly, waddling up to Drew without a hint of fear. \"How about I prove who's worthy to rule these tiny people-- by beating you?\" He laughed deeply in response, seemingly assured of his victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on! So, how do you want to do this, I'm sure I'll win anyway-- oof!\" May wasted no time in tackling Drew while he was talking, slamming her heavy body against his like a powerful sumo wrestler. She pushed her bulk forward, putting the powerful muscles that resided beneath her thick blubber to good use and grabbing onto the larger boy's ample love handles for leverage. Drew was caught off guard, but soon recovered, pushing back with his own strength and sending May sprawling with a palm strike. Her fat wildly bounced and jiggled, but May herself stayed on her feet, before charging again. As their skyscraper-sized bodies clashed together, both fatty giants soon began to sweat profusely, their rolls becoming shiny and wet, and causing their grips on one another to slip briefly. All the while, their fat feet and swinging bellies smashed and crushed any remaining buildings around the two, and Ash, Brock, and Max could only watch as the two titans devastated the city in their battle for supremacy. </span></div></div>",

The two titans of flab pushed against each other, delivering punches and kicks.  Ash, Brock and Max had to vacate the area to avoid being crushed by either of the two battling giants.  <br>\r\n                      The tide turned in May's favor as she managed to deliver a hard punch right in Drew's face and causing him to fall to the ground.   It looked as though May had knocked her rival out cold.   May breathed heavily to catch her breath.    \"You know, Drew....all this fighting is making me hungry\" said May, rubbing her big belly.   \"If I want to rule this town...and it looks like there isn't much left thanks to our fighting...I'd have to eat you\"<br>\r\n                          \"She's gonna eat Drew?!\" asked Max.  \"but Drew is far too large for May to do that!\" <br>\r\n                            \"You can't eat me\" said Drew and attempted to get back up to his feet.  But May charged at Drew before he could regain his footing and Drew ended up under May.   May licked her lips and opened her mouth wide--far more wider than any human could have and engulfed Drew's head in her mouth.  Drew tried to fight off May but it was no use.  May gulped, sending Drew's head down her throat and his shoulders entered her mouth.  May wasn't much interested in tasting her large meal as she swallowed again and Drew's huge chest entered her mouth.  She then decided to lick Drew's chest.    \"You taste good\" said May, her voice muffled.  <br>\r\n               Ash, Brock and Max could only stare agape at what May was doing. <br>\r\n                \"But how can that be possible?!\" asked Max.<br>\r\n                 \"I have no idea\" said Brock.<br>\r\n                  \"Look at her eat....\" said Ash in a faraway voice.  If someone was paying attention they might've spotted Ash was sporting a tent in his pants but nobody saw it.  They were too focused on May as she devoured her rival.<br>\r\n                      It took several minutes for May to eat Drew.  With a final mighty gulp, Drew's legs vanished into May's mouth.  <br>\r\n                         \"That hits the spot\" said May, rubbing her bigger belly. <br>\r\n                            That's when May noticed something coming out of her back....and that wasn't all.  Within moments of finishing off her meal, May seemed to be going through some sort of metamorphosis.  She started to grow dragon-like scales all over her body as two small wings emerged from her back and a tail was starting to grow from the base of her back.  She was also gaining size, both in weight and muscle.    <br>\r\n                              \"What's...happening to me?!\" asked May. That's when May's face began to change too.<br>\r\n                               \"She's turning into a dragon!\"  shouted Ash.  <br>\r\n                               \"By eating Drew?\" asked Max.<br>\r\n                               \"You got me\" said Ash.   <br>\r\n                               Indeed, it looked as though May was turning into a dragon.  Her scales were dark green in color, lighter green on her underside.   It was evident that May was in great pain as she was wincing and shouting.    <br>\r\n                                The transformation took about fifteen minutes, although it seemed far longer.  When it was over with, May had completely changed from a human giant and into a honest-to-goodness dragon!  For several minutes after the transformation May just laid there on the ground.  <br>\r\n                                \"Is she sleeping?\" asked Max.  <br>\r\n                                \"I don't think so\" said Ash.   \"she's just resting\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sure enough, May soon began to stir again, before slowly pulling herself up from the ground. Ash and Max watched her closely, hoping that the newly-transformed dragon girl wouldn't suddenly go on aggressive rampage or something like that. As she opened her slitted blue eyes, her dragon snout wrinkled into an uncomfortable expression and she held her head in her hands. \"Ohh...\" she moaned, swaying back and forth clumsily on her clawed feet. \"I have such a headache right now...\" Before she could say anything else, May let out a gasp as her body once again seized up-- she could feel the waves of transformation flowing through her again, but this time they remained in her head and neck area. Her neck grew much longer, and a series of small, fleshy nubs started to grow next to it. \"Wh-whoa...what's happening now? What are these things?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nubs suddenly burst forth and grew into 2 new, equally long necks, complete with their own fanged and horned dragon heads at the ends! May's original head seemed to go into a trance afterward, staring blankly as another two heads surged out of her shoulders. Each had a slightly different shade of green to its scales, but their faces were identical to May's \"normal\" one, and even still sported her trademark hairstyle. However, a fifth one that grew in next to her central head looked quite different-- it was purple instead of green, save for a rather familiar-looking mop of green hair on top it, with its horns growing through it. Once all of the new dragon heads had grown in, May's entire body once again grew a few more feet, before suddenly petering out. All five heads hung limply from her shoulders, but now they were beginning to stir, staring with the \"original\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what happened? Where am I?\" she asked in a soft voice, craning her long neck to look around and spotting Max watching from below. \"Oh my! It's not safe for you here, dear little brother! Here, let big sister help you...\" She reached one huge, flabby, clawed arm down and picked up Max, who had quite honestly given up on figuring out just what was going on with his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing?!\" he cried, struggling as May-- or at least one fifth of her-- scooped him up and cuddled him against her giant, scaly, yet soft breasts. \"What the heck happened to you? Why are-- mmmph!-- you so freaking affectionate all of a sudden?!\" Before he could get an answer, though, the rightmost head woke up, its eyes glowing an angry blue and a nasty look on its face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who do you think you are, inviting my-- uh, our-- stupid little brother?\" she asked grumpily, taking control of the opposite arm and trying to grab Max. The nice, almost motherly first head pulled him away, pouting. \"He doesn't deserve this attention, he should be bowing to us like all the other pathetic, tiny humans!\" As the two fought over their brother, two more heads awakened, each offering their own piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop arguing, you two! I swear, you're acting like children...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggghhh...forget all this stupid crap, I need FOOD right now! Food, food, FOOOOOOD~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four May heads bickered back and forth, before the final one woke up, gasping in horror upon realizing where it-- or rather, HE-- was. \"What the... all I remember is getting swallowed by... oh no. No, no, no, this can't be happening!\" Drew's dragon neck stretched away from the other four as he shrieked madly, trying to pull himself away, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ash and Brock watched the spectacle from below with vaguely bemused looks on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't even, anymore,\" Brock remarked, to which Ash just nodded dumbly. </span></div></div>",

The shout echoed for miles around and it was followed by an inhuman roaring.  The other heads stopped arguing and looked to the \"original\" head.  Drew was trying to get as far away from the other heads as he could get.   There was a beat of an eerie silence.   Ash and Brock had to covered their ears from the shout.

So now that we're all in agreement on that, I think it's time to decide on our next move... namely, food!\" Her huge, scaly belly let out a monstrous rumble just as she finished her sentence, and the hungry head roared in anticipation at the mention of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!\" she growled, her forked tongue hanging out of her mouth as she drooled. \"Food, food, food, FOOD!! What do we eat first? There's nothing left in this puny city, we need something nooowwww....!\" The motherly head, on the other hand, shook disappointedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, no need to get ahead of yourself, dearie-- eat too much, and you'll get fat! We mustn't have that-- a healthy hydra is a happy hydra!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't know if you've noticed,\" the nasty head chimed in, \"But WE'RE ALREADY FUCKING FAT! Do you not SEE all of this?!\" Taking control of the hydra's thick, muscular arms, she grabbed two clawfuls of thick, jiggly belly blubber and squeezed, making the other heads moan a bit at the feeling. \"mmm...s-so there's no point in complaining! Let's just get as fat as possible-- bigger is ALWAYS better!\" All the while, Drew's head just sort of hung low in despair... he couldn't deny that he was hungry too, but the idea of being stuck with May and... uh, the other Mays for the foreseeable future was bumming him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so we agree that we need food!\" May's original head shouted over the others. \"Let's head to Rustboro City-- it's huge there'll be a lot of food for us to eat there!\" The others all nodded and agreed, save for Drew, and the hydra began to stop along toward the next city... albeit very clumsily, as 5 heads controlling two legs was a recipe for disaster. At the same time, Ash and the others were still stuck in May-and-company's cleavage... by now, even Ash was beginning to like it, as if the hydra had some kind of compelling aura or pheromones that attracted others to her, but he and his friends still recognized what needed to be done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're kinda stuck here for now... but we gotta try and think of something to stop May!\" Ash said, looking to Max and Brock, who were pressed up against them in the cavernous space between May's huge dragon boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say!\" replied Max, annoyed. \"What are we gonna do, have Pikachu shock her? She's way too big, plus she's probably Dragon-type now, so it wouldn't be very effective anyway...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, maybe someone in the next city can help us!\" The others looked at Brock as he spoke. \"If we can get as far as Slateport, at least May will be facing the sea and won't be able to cause QUITE as much damage...\" </span></div></div>",

The hydra walked more or less straight. Clearly having five heads controlling one body was going to take some time.  All the while the hungry head started to hum a tune about eating and eating forever.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n              \"Will you shut up about food?!\" asked the nasty head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"I can't help it\" said the hungry head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"How far is Slateport City anyway?\" asked the motherly head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Before any of the heads could reply, a familiar-looking trio sprang into view from a bush.   It was none other then Jessie, James and Meowth of Team Rokcet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Prepare for trouble!\" said Jessie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and make it......AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        James stopped the motto when he saw the gigantic hydra monster in front of him.  All three Rocket members all screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"How did the twerp get so big?!\"  asked Jessie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Can I eat them?\"  asked the hungry head.  \"pleasepleaseplease?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"And have all three of them as heads?\" asked the nasty head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Doesn't sound that appealing to me\" snorted Drew.  \"nothing but empty calories\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"I don't care about calories!\" shouted the hungry head.  \"All I care about is FOOD!\"  The hungry head gained control of one arm and snatched up the three slacked-jaw Rocket members.  The hungry head opened her mouth as the arm was bringing the arm ever closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Such naughty, naughty behavior...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other dragon head was less than convinced, though. She rolled her eyes, replying, \"Oh, please... you have the same memories as me, don't you? All these jerks ever did was annoy the crap out of us and try to steal Ash's stupid Pikachu all the time! Trust me, I'm doing us a favor by eating them... though mostly me-- I'm STARVING, and I'm not about to let you stop me!\" Wasting no more time, she threw the screaming Rockets into her mouth, swallowing them with a loud \"<i>gulp</i>\" that sent them down her throat as a visible lump that traveled to their shared stomach. \"mmm... not the most filling snack, but definitely tasty, hehe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane...\" Drew's head hung off to the right side, lamenting how his situation only seemed to grow more bizarre by the second... still, he did at least like that he was a bit less hungry after their snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so that's out of the way at least,\" May's original head piped in, getting the attention of her \"sisters\" on both sides. \"But it's like Ms. Hungry over there said, that was WAY too little to fill our stomach!\" She patted at their round, fat belly to make her point, causing it to jiggle a bit. It remained soft and yielding to the touch, a tell-tale sign that it was still largely empty. A loud, rumbling growl emitted from within, sounding not too dissimilar to the angry head as she growled in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, thanks for telling us the obvious!\" she snapped, stretching past the hungry head to address May Prime in the centre. \"I'm tired of Fatty here next to me complaining about food, and I'd like a meal myself, hopefully some time before the Heat Death of the fucking Universe! Let's just get on to Slateport already!\" They were about to move when the matronly head took control of their legs and made them stop. Well, more like made them stumble, almost causing the whole hydra to topple over. \"Ugh, what the hell is it now? Who's not letting us walk?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just had a bit of a concern,\" said the head just to May's right. \"I swear, did any of you children stop to think about what eating those three would do to us? I mean, look at Drew! The poor dear ended up a part of us after we ate him, aren't you worried it'll happen again?\" A long pause went by as all five heads pondered over the question. Eventually, May herself spoke, looking thoughtfully down at her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't feel anything. Nothing happening, nothing building up. Maybe Drew was a fluke?\" The other four heads all turned to face him, as if expecting an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How am I supposed to know how this ridiculous body works? Wait, unless...\" Placing their right claw on his chin in thought, he scoured his mind for ideas. \"Maybe... maybe I only ended up as a head on our body because I was already inside May when she transformed?\" The others all sounded off in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes about as much sense as anything else that's happened so far,\" May Prime replied. \"Okay, but enough speculating-- we've got a city to find! And probably eat...\" The hydra tried flapping its wings, hoping to close the gap of the trip with some flight, but it was a no-go-- their wings were too tiny to heft such a huge, blubber body into the air. So, they simply continued to walk, struggling to maintain balance but largely succeeding, and the city was soon in sight thanks to their massive strides. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wading through a sea of rustling leaves and branches, giant legs with long strides gave the giant hydra an easy time closing the distance to the city. Even with her vision partially obscured by her humongous titflesh, the multi-headed monster that was May took pleasure in feeling her expansive, creamy middle jiggle with each heavy step she took.  It felt good to be this big, to be so powerful. A trip that would have taken days took only a few minutes as she crushed and stomped her way forward, and the loud rumbling sounds that her belly emitted made her quicken her pace towards her destination as her thick and sinewy tail dragged a trench into the ground in their wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the city I see in the distance?\u201d the motherly head asked once the human settlement was in sight, prompting May prime to nod her head and lick her lips in response, her nostrils flaring as she took in all the delicious scents the bustling city had to offer. \"Yep, that's Slateport city. Mmmn... I hope you girls all like seafood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of all the filling treats available to the hydra prompted another loud gurgle from their shared belly, and with their hands sliding down to rub at their pliant middle in response, the greedy head roared out her impatience. \"By now I'll eat anything! What are you all waiting for? Let's go!\" Taking control of their legs, she marched the bulky hydra forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe citizens of Slateport weren\u2019t ready. May arrived with little subtlety, and the tremors her heavy stomps made could be felt far before she was even visible to those on the street. By now rumours had spread that a new giant, multi-headed pokemon was devouring everything in its wake, but as the 150 foot, stacked hydra emerged from the foliage surrounding the North side of the city, the response was still met with utter shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's Alpha head's fan-like ears twitched to the pleasant sound of human screams and yelps as she rested her hands on her wide hips and snickered at the reaction the people were having to their appearance. She had, after all, a very promiscuous-looking symbol of attractiveness; and her growth had only added to that gorgeous figure, with their incredible metabolism not only expanding their belly but also amplifying their curvaceous figure with smooth, pliable layer of pudge being deposited in all the right places on their scaly body with every meal they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Prime couldn't help but smile as well at the reaction from her observers and stepped forwards into the city's streets, sending them all running away in fear as her clawed feet stomped into the ground and cracking it under her weight. Although not out to destroy the city, she found it difficult to avoid slamming her wide hips into the sides of buildings as she stepped between them, and her tail caused mayhem of its own as its powerful length carved through streets and small buildings behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, the huge hydra disregarded any destruction she may have cause and continued to travel down to Slateport's coastline where the city's market was located, each head letting out a low purr as the scents of all the fresh seafood and other edible goods on offer made their presence below them. Wasting no time, May scooped the stalls by pairs off the ground, unintentionally shaking her giant, plush ass at any observers behind her when she had to bend over, as well as giving them a more than generous view of her prominent heated folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOne for me...\u201d May mentioned as she rose one of the stalls to her maw and shook its contents into her mouth, \"And one for one of you...\" she added before tossing the other stall into the air above her, causing the hydra's 'female' heads to stretch out and snap into the air in an attempt to snatch up the descending stall before any of their neighbors could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite each head trying their hardest to grab the stall out of the air with their teeth; using her more prominent horns, it was the hydra's Alpha head that won the competition by butting the greedy head out of the way of the stall just as it was about to land in her open maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, that was mine!\" She exclaimed in response, pouting as she watched the stall's contents bulge down the Alpha head's throat and a low purr emit from her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should of fought for it then, lardass.\" Came the response from the meaner head as she tossed the emptied stall to the ground. \"Mmmn, it was delicious though, Bet you wish you got it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you stop fighting at once!\" The motherly head interrupted. \"None of us will get anywhere arguing with each other. Apologize to her and move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You CAN'T be serious. If you think I'm going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interaction was cut short however when May prime tossed up another stall, and the battle stared again. This system continued on for a few minutes as each head got their fill of food. However the supply of fresh seafood and other treats only lasted for a short period, and the hydra that was May was forced to move onto the pokemon specific items available in the market - showing no hesitance towards continue feasting on poffins, pokeblocks, vitamins and other treats. Eventually May finished off every single stall in the market, and each head smacked their lips in satisfaction of the meal. Food intended to be eaten by over a thousand people and pokemon over the durations of at least a week was completely devoured by a single creature in the space of 15 minutes. With the immense mass of food products beginning to build up in her belly, May's arms rubbed at their swollen middle, mulling curiously over how her belly was able to stretch so much. However, the loud grumble it let out upon her touch only proved that the Hydra was still hungry.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Contemplating where to go for her next meal, May had to stop when she suddenly felt something tickle against her legs. Her brow arcing, May prime looked down past her wobbling masses of mammary flesh and her expansive creamy middle to see an assortment of trainers and their pokemon below attacking the scales of her lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttack the monster!\" May picked up from their shouting. \"We have to stop it from destroying the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I\u2019m sorry! I didn't mean to break anything. I'm just so hungry!\u201d she responded, waving her giant claws defensively while making sure one had its fingers clamped firmly around the maw of her Alpha head, who looked quite eager to say a few words to the trainers attacking them. \"I can\u2019t help what happened... Ow! Hey, stop that!\" she added when an Arcanine bit down on the flesh of one of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to it! Keep attacking the monster!\" Soon flying types began attacking her from a more advantageous position, their shots hitting her in the neck, breasts and face as she attempted to gently swat at the air around her in an attempt to deter them from attacking. \u201cI\u2019m serious; I don't want to hurt anyone. I just need something to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the fat monster! Whoever catches it will own the biggest pokemon bitch in history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. May was not about to have anyone insult her like that - especially from something comparatively as large as a bug compared to her. \"If you\u2019re going to keep calling me a monster...\" she growled darkly, her eyes glaring down at the diminutive bunch of trainers and their pokemon. Gone was the tolerant and meek trainer she once was; she was a hydra now, big and as hungry they came. They thought she was a monster; she was going to show them how much of a monster she could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her patience gone, the unbridled force of nature that was the giant red hydra descended upon the crowd with surprising speed, kneeling on one of her legs while her claw swiped across the street to snatch up a handful of trainers and their pokemon.  Bringing them up to her maw,  each of her heads gathered close to glare at the collection of diminutive beings in her  grasp as her hot breath washed over them. \u201cYou pathetic little bugs think I\u2019m a monster do you? Well, this monster is hungry and you are all starting to look like a nice snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something particularly taboo about eating a pokemon due to the amount of intelligence they possessed. Then again, it wasn't exactly ethically acceptable either to eat a fellow human being. However, the thought simply made the edges of the Hydra's many lips curl into a slightly cruel smirk. But she wasn't human anymore, now was she? She wasn't even a pokemon. She was simply a species of her own now - a 150 foot dragon giantess, an apex predator with no equal comparable to her immense strength and size, the new ruler of this world. And she was hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the dozen or so little beings in her soft scaly palm with a new ravenous light shining in her eyes, May prime could feel her mouth wetten in anticipation as a rather prominent growl emanated from the combined dragoness' sizable middle, providing an audible cue for those she was holding that any rational judgement she may have still possessed was clouded in favour of her insatiable belly. Wasting no more time, she licked her lips with her long flexible tongue and slurped the wet organ across the palm of her hand, scooping up her captives onto its warm surface in the process as she tilted her head back and let the trainers and their teams slide down into her awaiting gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! I-I never knew pokemon tasted that good!\" She chirped in surprise, before quickly letting her tongue slide over her chops to lick up the rest of her treat's delectable taste. \"And those humans didn't taste that bad either, hehe...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other heads nodded in agreement, except for Drew who was noticeably flustered by May prime's actions. \"What are you doing!\" he exclaimed in dismay, wrapping his head around to look at May's central head. \" We - I mean you, can't just eat innocent people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says who?\" May prime responded casually, picking up and tossing another group of pokemon and their trainers into her open maw. \"We\u2019re a monster aren\u2019t we? It's not like anyone can stop us. If we're hungry, we should just take what we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah\" came a roar of agreement from May's Alpha head. \"These bugs have to learn that they're nothing but a snack for us now.\" Taking control of one of their powerful arms, she scooped up a large collection fleeing bystanders and promptly swallowing a mouthful of them, a claw descending down her middle to rub at her plush belly as the other heads watched a distinct bulge travel down the hydra's throat while she purred her enjoyment of the treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Save some for me, I'm hungry too!\" Came a cry from the greedy head as she dipped her maw towards the Alpha head's collected stash. Her neighboring head was too quick however, and managed to pull their hand away before she could attempt to swipe a mouthful of them for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all hungry, lard-ass\" The Alpha head snapped back, her warm breath spilling onto the other head's maw. \"And if you have already fucking forgotten we share a stomach, and I am doing you a favor eating these bugs for you so shut up and let me eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But I'm hungrier than youuuu!\" The greedy head exclaimed in response and promptly dove her head down to slip the hand containing all the hydra's collected treats entirely into her gluttonous maw, her lips forming a tight seal around the wrist as her tongue quickly slurped each trainer and pokemon now trapped within the hot, wet expanse of her mouth down into her monstrous gullet, letting out muffled moans of sated bliss as the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when she had swallowed down every little being and licked their hand clean of their taste that the greedy head finally release her mouth's seal around their wrist, letting the Alpha head yank it back out and flick it free of the liberal coating of dragon drool now coating its scales, letting out a slew of curses as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that again and I'll claw that hand down your throat to pull each one back out\" She snarled, but her threats fell short on her neighboring head who was too busy rubbing their free hand over their taught hide, breathing a pleasant sigh as she felt their meal beginning to build up in their belly. \"Haaa~ So good...\u201d<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nAs irritated as she was, the Alpha head couldn't deny her neighbor's claim; neither could any of the other heads, as they all could taste each delicious morsel as if it was their own throat their treats were traveling down. As a hydra, each head shared each others senses, allowing them all to experience the same sensations simultaneously, and the collection of maws each let out a low reverberating purr as the hydra's second claw joined to rub along their momentarily sated belly, licking their lips and shutting their eyes at how wonderful all their squirming prey tasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly unlidding her eyes, May prime couldn't help but let out a scoff of amusement at the gall of the trainers she just consumed. Did they really think they could stop her? Did they really think a group of tiny bugs and their even tinier pets could even slow her down never mind *injure* her. Flaring her nostrils, she took in the delectable scent of the crowd of trainers and bystanders that she missed now fleeing from her immense form. She couldn\u2019t waste her time just standing around and enjoying the taste of those she had already eaten, and she still wanted to teach all the bugs in the city a lesson. No, too many delicious morsels within reach, all she had to do was take them; it was time to hunt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked around his surroundings.  The light was dim enough to allow James to see only ten feet away.   The floor was slick with moisture but wasn't actually wet.  James got to his feet and tripped over Meowth who laid next to him.  James stumbled but managed to regain his balance.  <br>\r\n                    \"Watch it!\" yelled Meowth, suddenly standing on his two feet.  <br>\r\n                     \"Where are we?\" asked Jessie.<br>\r\n                   \"Where do you <i>think</i>?\" asked Meowth.  \"we were swallowed by that hydra twerp.

The trio spent some minutes exploring the cavernous stomach although there wasn't much to see.  The stomach made gurgling noises just like any other stomach.  A very faint beating sound could be heard all throughout the stomach...no doubt it was the heart of the twerp.    Eventually, the Rocket trio did find a very shallow pool of a greenish liquid.  The pool of the greenish liquid was not quite ankle deep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"What's this stuff?\" asked Meowth.<br>\r\n                            \"Stomach acid at a guess\"  said James.  \"although I have no idea why there's so little of it in here\"<br>\r\n                           \"There must be a way out\" said Jessie.<br>\r\n                             \"Sure\" said James.  \"we just take the.....ermm.....'back exit' ....it won't be pretty\"<br>\r\n                             \"I have no interest going down a human sewage factory\" said Meowth.  <br>\r\n                              \"Well we can't stay in here forever\" said Jessie.  \"unless the twerp eats something else, we'll starve to death for sure if we're not going to digest\"<br>\r\n                          \"Isn't that strange?\" asked James.  \"I mean we're in a stomach that has no acid in it....how do you expect the twerp to survive without food?\"<br>\r\n                             \"I don't know nor do I care\" scoffed Jessie.  \"like I'm going to worry about someone who ATE US!\"  <br>\r\n                            \"Maybe she has more than one stomach...\" mused Meowth aloud.<br>\r\n                             \"I would say that's impossible but..\" said James.   \"Meowth could be right\"<br>\r\n                           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                               \"Hey, do you feel movement in our stomach?\" asked May Prime. <br>\r\n                              \"No\" said the hungry head. <br>\r\n                              \"I thought I felt a twinge earlier\" said Drew.   \"as if....someone was walking in our stomach\"<br>\r\n                           \"Team Rocket?\" scoffed May Prime.   \"they're nothing but digested goo ready to be added to our body\"<br>\r\n                           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       </span></div></div>",

When she did she remembered that she had been thinking about eating another Rare Candy, she asked Ash a question after pulling him out of her cleavage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"Get me another Rare Candy\" said May.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             Ash felt nervous dangling from May's fingers in front of her face.  When she spoke Ash could see traces of her meal on her tongue; a table there, a whole kitchen sink there and what looked like the remains of a coatroom.  For just a moment Ash imagined himself going down May's throat and it gave him the shudders.  Also Ash was impressed by the fact that May ate a whole restaurant!  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                            \"Hey\" said May.  \"did you hear me?  I said get me another Rare Candy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           \"Another Rare Candy?\" asked Ash.   \"but what--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"I want to be bigger\" said May smiling.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                            \"There's a reason it's called  'Rare Candy'\" piped up Brock.   \"it's not so easy to make and it costs an arm and a leg!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                              \"I'm sure you'll find some  in there\" said May, setting Ash down on the sidewalk in front of the shopping mart.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                              \"What if I can't find--\" started Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"Stop wasting time and get me more Rare Candy!\"  yelled May.  <br>\r\n                                   Ash had to cover his ears when May shouted.  Ash gave her a puzzled look. It wasn't like May to yell at him for no good reason and certainly not after asking a reasonable question.  <br>\r\n                                     \"Get going\" said May in a much quieter voice.<br>\r\n                                       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                         The shopping mart like the restaurant had been emptied out when news of the giantess  reached that part of town.  The mart had four floors with each floor selling different items.  Ash had rushed into the mart just to keep May from yelling at him again.  He looked at the directory of the building<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           People Food     1st floor<br>\r\n                           Pokemon Food 2nd floor<br>\r\n                           TMs and HMs 3rd floor<br>\r\n                           Rare Finds   4th floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Rare Finds sounds a good place to start\" muttered Ash.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                </span></div></div>",

Truth be told, he was more than a little frightened at her power-hungry demeanour, and really wished that he wasn't in the process of enabling her even further. Though her giant body was admittedly pretty sexy...either way, though, he was more scared of what might happen if he didn't get the candy. \"Man, where could it be?\" he said worriedly. \"Man, if she ends up yelling at me again...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, he spied a bin at the end of the isle with a large \"RARE CANDY IS HERE!\" banner above it. Quickly darting over, Ash was both relieved and a bit scared upon finding that there were quite a few candies left in it. \"Hmm...well, I guess I might as well give them to her... *gulp* no matter how big she ends up getting from all this...\" Another thought came to the young trainer's mind, though. Acting quickly, he stuffed most of the candies in his backpack, while taking just two to bring back to May. \"Just in case things get out of hand,\" he thought aloud, \"At least we have some kind of backup...\" He soon made his way back downstairs and outside, where his giantess friend was waiting impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, it's about time!\" she roared, bending down and bringing her large, glaring face close to Ash. \"So, did you find any Rare Candy or what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, just these two...\" Ash lied, holding out the two candies in his hand and dropping them into May's much larger one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" the giant coordinator exclaimed, before opening her wide mouth and throwing the two tiny candies inside. She paused for a moment, before letting out a noise that sounded like a cross between a bestial roar and an orgasmic moan, and her body immediately began to grow again. The boys watched fearfully as her 50-foot form slowly stretched taller and taller, with her already enormous breasts and ass swelling out bigger and rounder at an even faster rate. She continued to moan as her voice dropped lower and deeper, her hands drifting all across every inch of her expanding body, before stopping with one on her moistening snatch and the other groping her massive boobs. Her juices flowed forth like a river down her voluptuous thighs and formed a deep pool at her feet, as the powerful girl continued to soar higher and higher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her growth slowed to a halt at 200 feet, and May roared one more time in pleasure as she reached her final size, orgasming explosively at the same time. In addition to having quadrupled in height, her figure had reached insane proportions, with incredibly wide hips, gigantic breasts that easily dwarfed her head, and an enormously round ass of comparable size. Even her hair had grown slightly longer. She gazed lovingly at her new body and laughed in her powerful new voice. \"This...this is incredible! I'm the biggest and sexiest girl who's ever lived...no one can stop me now!\" </span></div></div>",

In the basket sat Meowth along with Jessie and James.  Jessie was the one who had spotted that they were close to Fortree City and so headed for it.  The trio had lost sight of the twerps perhaps five  days ago.  Or was it six?    The trio had scoured at least half of Hoenn looking for Ash and his friends with no luck.   Jessie, tired of looking for the twerps, piloted the balloon to Fortree City and perhaps get a bite to eat.  As per usual, Team Rocket was bordering on starvation mostly due to lack of money.  <br>\r\n                          \"Did ya hear somethin'?\" asked Meowth when the balloon had drifted into Fortree City proper.  <br>\r\n                            \"I didn't hear anything\" said Jessie.  <br>\r\n                             \"I thought I heard screaming...\" said James suddenly snapping out of the nap he had been taking.  <br>\r\n                               \"Probably just a dream\" muttered Jessie.  <br>\r\n                          \"Hey!\" yelled Meowth.  \"I see the twerps down there!\"<br>\r\n                              Jessie and James looked down to see Ash, Max and Brock down on the ground.  Ash was whispering something to Brock and Max.  There was no sign of the brown-haired girl that now traveled with Ash....was her name May or June?  <br>\r\n                              \"It's time for trouble!\" yelled Jessie.<br>\r\n                              \"And you can make it do...\" started James suddenly noticing the huge leg right next to Ash and the two boys.  James followed the leg with his eyes and....<br>\r\n                                \"Hey James\" said Meowth.  \"you messing up th...\"   <br>\r\n                                  \"HOLY SHIT!\"  said James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                Team Rocket's balloon had been steadily loosing attitude once they were in the city.  The balloon had been hovering somewhere in the 500 foot range, now it was just below the 200 foot range to the ground.    The balloon had drifted passed the gigantic May.  James pointed at the giant girl and screamed.  Jessie and Meowth looked at James and then at the gigantic May.  The balloon was just about level to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                   \"Not you three again\" said May and sighed, causing the balloon to move rapidly away.  <br>\r\n                                   \"How did the twerp get so <i>big</i>?!\" asked Meowth.  <br>\r\n                                    \"Now\" said May.   \"what should I do about you?\"<br>\r\n                                      There was a beat of silence.<br>\r\n                                       \"Bye-bye\" said May and started to blow  with her mouth at the balloon.  With her new size, the blow was like a tornado.  The balloon was blown away out of sight in a matter of minutes.  May laughed.    \"That takes care of them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                          <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The few citizens who hadn't already evacuated were either running from May's rampage or standing and staring dumbly as her gigantic breasts and ass wobbled madly with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the rest of the gang was safe for the moment, having slipped away and hidden themselves in the bushes surrounding Winona's Gym. \"Man, am I glad we managed to escape...\" said Brock, panting. \"She's completely out of control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh!\" Max replied, exasperated. \"Man, and I thought having a big sister was bad enough... having a REALLY big one is the worst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget, guys,\" said Ash, \"She's still our friend! We gotta think of some way to calm her down...\" Pikachu, who had previously expressed annoyance at not even being mentioned in the story yet, hopped onto his shoulder and offered an affirmative, \"Pika!\". As the group talked, Ash wondered to himself if he should speak up about the huge stash of Rare Candies he had hidden from May... while it was almost certainly the best chance they had of evening the odds, it was also obvious that more giants running around would make matters worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, May's anger was beginning to fade, giving way to worry. As power-mad as she'd become, she held no real animosity toward her friends, and was now worried that she may have driven them away. \"C'mon, guys, this isn't funny... where'd you go? I promise, I'm not gonna eat you guys or anything... I just happen to be huge now and want to get even huger, what's wrong with that?!\" She had toned down the destruction by now, at least insofar as her only accidentally smashing buildings with her heaving rack, as opposed to on purpose.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Rocket trio managed to land the balloon well outside the city as to avoid the wrath of the giant-sized May.  Once they were landed they all climbed out of the balloon's basket and thought of what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"How could that twerp get so big?!\" asked Meowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"How am I suppose to know?\" asked Jessie.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n                  \"One thing is for sure\" said James.  \"we can't go after those twerps with that big twerp in the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Big twerp?\" came a new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         Jessie, James and Meowth all yelped and turned around to see a towering figure dressed in what looked like a robe made from several curtains; clearly curtains from a theater.  The figure was a good ten feet tall and the head was covered in a hood that shrouded the face in darkness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                              \"W...who are you?\" stammered James.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                             \"That's not important now\" said the figure.

What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             'Came to investigate from where?' wondered James.  The nearest city was days away.

It was all we could do to land\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                The figure appeared to take a double take at Meowth as if noticing him for the first time.   \"A talking pokemon....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                \"Yeah\" said Meowth.  \"get over the shock buddy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                 \"200 feet you say?\" asked the figure.   \"she must've eaten some Rare Candy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                 \"What?\" asked Jessie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                 \"Rare Candy?\" asked James.   \"what does--\"<br>\r\n                                   \"It was discovered a few years ago that Rare Candy makes humans grow if they eat it\" said the figure.   <br>\r\n                                    \"WHAT?!?!\" asked the three Rocket members at once.   <br>\r\n                                        \"..It's a long story\" said the figure.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                               <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         </span></div></div>",

Citizens continued to gawk at the giant naked girl as she did, with those who didn't retreat in time getting flicked aside or otherwise dealt with. She had seemed to have let go of her power rush for the moment, more concerned with locating Ash and the others. The group was still huddled outside the Gym when they were taken by surprise at the sight of their friend's huge face peering down at them from above. \"There you are!\" she exclaimed, reaching one massive yet delicate hand down in their direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" yelled Max, his tiny voice still proving enough to stop his sister in her tracks, her outstretched hand still hovering over them. \"P-Please, don't hurt us...\" he whimpered, causing May to pause for several moments before offering any kind of response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to what one would expect, said response was not one of remorse or sorrow, but rather laughter. The boys stared as she let out a deep, hearty laugh, before reaching down and abruptly scooping them up in her hand. \"Hahaha... c'mon guys, really?\" she said, still chuckling. \"I may be a super powerful giantess, but I'm still me! I'd never hurt you guys...\" This remark calmed the boys somewhat, though before any of them could speak, she continued. \"Of course, that doesn't mean that I'm giving up on getting as big as I possibly can-- being the biggest, sexiest, nakedest beauty queen in the whole region is WAY to sweet of a deal to give up on! And it's not like there's an antidote to shrink me with anyway, so nyeh-nyeh-- big me is here to stay~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others collectively groaned, both relieved and annoyed that May was still... well, May, in spite of her growth and subsequent rampage. \"That figures...\" Max lamented, \"Of course my sister would see this whole thing as being like one of her stupid Contest performances...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch whose hobbies you call stupid!\" May chided, playfully shoving her little brother into her cavernous cleavage to shut him up. \"Hmph...though now that you mention it, I probably could make a big splash on the Contest circuit like this, hehehe...\"</span></div></div>",

May was careful not to step on anyone or any buildings which was a bit hard at her new lofty height.   Soon enough May saw what was clearly a Contest hall.

A handful of those people were watching May doing her seductive dance.    <br>\r\n                              '4 days?' thought Ash.

What if he took some of the Rare Candies and entered the contest himself?  Being a giant did sound like fun but it wasn't all that appealing.  For one thing what if he couldn't get back to his normal size?  Was there some way to reverse the effect of Rare Candy?  For another thing, Ash didn't felt much like walking around nude..although it looked as if May didn't mind being naked now.  <br>\r\n                        May had stopped dancing and looked around.<br>\r\n                              \"What are you looking for?\" asked Brock.<br>\r\n                          \"To see if any of the giant Coordinators are here\" said May.  \"hmm....it doesn't look that way\"<br>\r\n                               \"The contest is four days away\" said Brock.  \"maybe they're not here yet?\"<br>\r\n                               \"Good point...\" said May as she took another look around and spotted...  <br>\r\n                                \"Drew!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                               The green-haired Coordinator was in an open field near the Hall.

Drew was simply lying on the ground looking up at the stars while a large group of females were surrounding him and taking pictures with their cameras.

'Damn that jerk for being so sexy...,' she swore to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm rather surprised to see you taking a shot at the Giant Contest circuit, May,\" said Drew, flipping his hair in typical fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" May replied, a bit confused. \"You know I live for the spotlight-- there's no way I'd pass this up!\" She punctuated her statement with a slap of her plump ass, eliciting cheers from the male Contest fans gathered around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not so much that that surprised me...\" Drew laughed again, to which May rolled her eyes. \"It's just that, well... given how mediocre your Pok\u00e9mon perform, I can't imagine you yourself would be able to put on a halfway decent appeal either!\" His assembled tiny fanclub laughed with him, while the giant girl glared daggers back at her rival, mentally kicking herself for finding him attractive.

Solidad was looking down at the pair of May and Drew and smiled.  <br>\r\n                                    Ash gawked at Solidad.

As it turned out, May and her rivals were a bit atypical as far as contestants at this particular Giant Contest went, with most of the others being closer to Jerome's size range... albeit considerably less buff for the most part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah,\" he said, casually talking with Meowth. \"I've kinda been experimenting with this whole 'mysterious drifter' angle since my initial Rare Candy growth. I was already a Coordinator prior, so entering these new contests seemed like a logical step, and I figure I can incorporate the theme into my performance! Between that and these muscles, I'm bound to get some attention from the Coordinator chicks, hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dat, uh, makes sense...\" Meowth replied, already a bit lost at the mention of Contests and themes. \"Jessie really more da Contest type, compared to me and James... she'd probably know more about what ya mean. Right, Jessie?\" He turned to address her, but the redheaded Rocket member seemed lost in thought, sinisterly intertwining her fingers as she plotted her revenge against May. She was counting on the hope that the right combination of candies might bestow her with both the height to match May and the muscles to beat her, and the fact that she's be able to do so in a Contest setting, potentially with Ribbons on the line, only made her revenge seem sweeter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Jessie?\" asked James, waving a band in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um, yeah, great theme, you'll knock them dead, yeah...\" The others raised an eyebrow at her absentminded reply, but otherwise paid no mind. As Jerome turned to look for the Contest Hall, Jessie huddled James and Meowth together and whispered to them. \"We're almost at the Mart! C'mon, let's ditch this guy and grab some of those Rare Candies for ourselves!\" Her compatriots nodded, and the trio slipped away toward the abandoned store before their oversized companion turned back around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like I was saying-- hey, where'd you guys go?\"</span></div></div>",

The mart was pretty cleaned out thanks to other looters that saw their chance with an abandoned shopping mart.  There were perhaps three or four looters in the mart besides Team Rocket and they left each other alone.  Someone had deactivated all the alarms which explained the lack of any police.    <br>\r\n              It was clear that Jessie had her mind on revenge as she didn't respond to James' question.  <br>\r\n              The trio looked and looked for near thirty minutes but there were no sign of Rare Candies.  Finally, the trio decided to check the offices.   The offices were in the basement save for the office of the CEO of course...and somebody else was snooping around in the that office. <br>\r\n                 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      The basement was a maze of offices and corridors.  <br>\r\n                       \"Just how many people work here?\" asked James.   <br>\r\n                         \"Who cares?\" asked Jessie.  <br>\r\n                        The trio went into the office of the H.R. director and  found nothing but notes all over the desk.  A note caught the attention of James.  It was a letter to the manager from the H.R. director about someone hoarding all the extra Rare Candies.  The letter went on to say that the director suspected it was Jane one of the night clerks that was hoarding the extra Rare Candies but he had no solid proof.<br>\r\n                                \"That's riveting\" said Jessie losing her patience.   \"let's look somewhere else\"<br>\r\n                                  The trio finally found what they were looking for in one of the offices that had already been broken into.  In a hidden safe that had been busted open and in an ordinary box that was labeled \"Monthly Earnings\", there were several pieces of Rare Candies....about five in all.  <br>\r\n                               \"Bingo!\" said James.  <br>\r\n                                 \"Excellent\" said Jessie.  \"these will do nicely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had grown used to the sight of gigantic, bare breasts over the last day, and yet Solidad's were on a whole new level for him. More so for Brock, who had been unable to take his eyes off of her heaving rack and looked very much like he wished he were the one stuck between them. Which was par for the course with Brock, really, especially since this particular pair was far more to his liking age-wise than May's had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're fine,\" the older girl replied. \"Over the last few days, I've found that being in my cleavage seems to calm people down... not sure if it's a special effect from the Rare Candy or if people just really love boobs, haha, but it definitely works. Let's check up on our little friends, I think they've been in there long enough...\" Reaching in with one hand, she quickly withdrew both Coordinators from inside-- as she had said, they seemed to have calmed down considerably, though they still scowled at each other. \"Now, have you learned your lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...whatever,\" muttered May, as Solidad lowered her to the ground near Ash and Brock (while Max popped up from between his sister's breasts and gasped for breath). \"This isn't over, you know,\" she said, turning toward Drew, who seemed content to simply flick his hair again and slink off to join his fangirls.

He had lost in that particular Contest but it was a lot of fun.  And he then remembered that he had been in at least two other contests.  As Ash thought Brock was still staring at Solidad.     Drew had retreated back to where he had been lying down earlier and May was off registering for the contest.     Ash glanced to where May had gone and saw that more Coordinators had come--although they weren't nearly as big as May or even Solidad.   Most of the Coordinators were only ten feet tall although there were a few Coordinators that were twenty feet tall.  <br>\r\n                                 \"Say\" said Solidad.   \"I forgot how cute you are.

I guarantee, you'll love being a giant, and if not, I can make it a little more fun for you, hehe...\" The pink-haired giantess winked playfully at Ash, pushing her immense breasts together as she did, making him blush profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...okay, if you said it'll be fun, ehehe...\" he replied, reaching into his backpack and pulling out three Candies-- the amount May had taken to reach her current size. However, before eating them, he thought of Solidad's barely-disguised offer again...even as dense as he was, he could see what she had to offer. It had been a few years since his particularly dense days back on his old journey anyway, and he was old enough to know what she wanted. He grabbed another three Rare Candies, for a total of six-- the amount Solidad said she'd eaten-- and hungrily shoved them into his mouth all at once. Within seconds, he felt great power welling up within, and his body immediately started to swell upward and outward. Solidad's eyes widened as she watched, and Ash quickly began to rip out of his clothes as he reached May's initial height of 50 feet, before shooting up to 100, 200, and beyond in increasingly large spurts. His muscles took on an even more chiseled look than Drew's, and the growing arousal he felt made itself known through the towering erection he now sported (making poor Brock feel quite inadequate at the sight of it.) Ash let out a moan in his deepening voice as he continued growing and growing, before finally stopping at just a few feet (looking more like inches to him) above Solidad, who blushed hard and nervously pushed her hair out of her eyes at the sight of the towering man Ash had grown into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...hehe, I knew you'd look hot as a giant,\" she giggled, \"But this is even better than I could have expected...\" </span></div></div>",

The three had exited the abandoned mart seeing that growing indoors might not be the smartest choice.   Jessie was eager to eat them but how many should she eat?  All of them?  Eat some now and leave the rest for later?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"Didn't that Jerome say that one of those Candies will make your grow 50 feet tall?\" asked James.   \"And that twerp was what, 200 feet tall? Three should be enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"That's good thinkin'\" said Meowth.  \"I would eat three now and save the other two for later\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Yes\" said Jessie.   \"here goes nothing!\"  With that, Jessie popped three of the Rare Candies into the her mouth.  She swirled them in her mouth and lightly chewed on them enjoying their sweet flavor.  She swallowed them down and felt the sudden rush of power as she grew to 50 feet , then to 100 and finally stopped around 200 feet.  Her clothes had ripped apart long ago.  Jessie nearly lost her balance at the amount of power she was feeling, releasing quite a few drops of her juices from her large snatch.   At her new lofty height Jessie saw the Contest Hall and all of those people that were around it including May who was standing in line to get registered.  Jessie wanted to rush over there and start fighting with the twerp until an idea came to her.  They were having a Contest of giants weren't they?  And it looked like May was going to enter it.   So was Jessie.   Jessie would take her revenge by knocking out that May out of the Contest.

His eyes shifted to the slightly smaller Solidad and saw her in a new light.  Ash never realized how beautiful Solidad was before.  Of course he had gawked at her earlier but that was mostly lust.  Right now he felt really attracted to her.  <br>\r\n                         <br>\r\n                      </span></div></div>",

She stared back, utterly captivated by his imposing size and manly new features, and soon blushed as she felt his massive erection pressed against her moistening sex. Ash merely smirked confidently in return, and within seconds they were locked in a deep kiss, their hands exploring all over each other's giant bodies while their assembled fans cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't look, Max, you're too young to see this!\" Brock said in a panic, holding his hands over the younger boy's eyes while trying his best-- and failing-- to look away himself, mentally cursing his companion's superior luck with the ladies.

Ash was leaning against Solidad deep in a kiss with his massive erection just above Solidad's moistening snatch.  May's eyes seem to be drawn to Ash's endowment as much as she tried to look away.

Solidad merely looked on from the sidelines in disapproval, disappointed to see that her younger rival still had some growing up to do even after all this time... not of the type May actually wanted, of course. May herself paused to consider Ash's words, seemingly calming down a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...well...\" she muttered, as Ash's face softened and he slowly moved toward her. Before he could say anything else, though, he was shocked to find May suddenly jumping up and snatching the tiny bag from his hands, before tossing the whole thing into her mouth-- she was only pretending to stand down! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May, stop, you have no idea what that many candies will do to you!\" Solidad yelled, trying to grab the smaller girl and keep her from getting away.

By the time her whole body was in sync again, May was already rising up past Ash and Solidad's size, her monumental rack wobbling wildly as she let out a deepening, maniacal laugh. She swelled past 1,0000 feet easily, then 2, 3, 4, 5,000 and beyond blew past in seconds, with no end in sight. Her hips became outrageously wide and voluptuous, her figure accentuated by her disproportionately massive butt and boobs, the latter of which had begun to leak huge drops of milk, which fell to the ground along with the river of juices from her snatch. She eventually stretched past 10,000 feet in height before coming to a halt, steadying herself on her enormous feet and crushing a large portion of the city next to the contest hall. \"Hahahaha...NOW who's the biggest and sexiest of them all?!\" May boomed, her friends and all the other contestants standing in awe of her incredible size.</span></div></div>",

It started as a slight tingling sensation near her middle then it grew until it became a burning sensation that spread over her 10,000 foot tall frame.  The excitement that she felt while growing turned into panic as she felt as if her skin was somehow boiling.  Bubbles grew all over her skin and the burning sensation grew into agony as her body continued to boil.  Ash and the others far below stared in shock at what was happening to May.<br>\r\n                      \"What's happening to me?!\" asked May.  May's voice had an eerie echo quality to it now.   The pain of it all forced May to her knees as the pain only increased.  <br>\r\n                 All of a sudden a section of her skin on her thigh melted away revealing bright white light only.  It was as if she was growing new skin; a skin made from pure light.  She puzzled over the meaning of what was happening as more and more sections of her skin melted away revealing new skin made out of light.  It started with her thighs and then moved down her legs and at the same time the effect started to move up her body.  The pain started to go away as more of her new skin emerged.  Was this the result of her eating too many Rare Candies at once?  What  exactly was happening to her?  <br>\r\n                             The effect moved up to her stomach and then reached her breasts.  It wasn't long until it reached her head.  Soon she was a glowing being of light.  Once she was encased with her new skin the light brightened ten thousand fold....brighter than the sun.  The explosion of pure light forced everyone to look away to keep themselves from being blinded.  The explosion of light seemed to last for hours--although it really lasted about two full minutes.  For those two minutes the world was bathed in light.  Then it faded away slowly until it was gone completely.  When everybody looked back May was gone too.   There was no trace of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Uhh...what happened?\" asked Max.  \"What happened to May?\"<br>\r\n                  \"What on earth was that?\" asked Ash.

He was about to turn to Max and offer some kind of reassurance that his sister would be alright (even if he honestly wasn't sure himself), but before he could, the sky once again exploded with a blinding flash of light. Everyone present shielded their eyes, but just barely visible through the dazzling light was a vast, humanoid form that slowly coalesced out of the shapeless void. It stood at the same height May had just before disappearing, and it looked vaguely like her, but not quite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the blinding glow began to die down, and as Ash opened his eyes, he could finally see what stood before him-- it was indeed May, but not as she was. Still standing at her 10,000 foot height and hovering just slightly off the ground, her basic features remained intact, but it seemed that the rest of her had become a bizarre hybrid of traits from several different Pok\u00e9mon. Her hair had grown long, down to her waist, and had taken on the style of a Blaziken's long mane, while a pair of pointed Glaceon ears took the place of her human ones, and Venusaur like flowers grew from her hair  She now possessed a second pair of arms, with Blaziken-like claws in place of hands, while her belly had grown large and round, covered in a Snorlax's thick blue and white fur. Finally, a Skitty tail extended from her rear, and a pair of enormous Beautifly's wings unfurled from her back. Her breasts and ass remained enormous, and were in fact even bigger and rounder than they'd been before. Opening her eyes, which emitted an ethereal glow, she finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what happened to me?\" May asked, her voice now deep and booming with an otherworldly echo to it. She curiously eyed up every inch of her transformed body, moving and flexing her second pair of arms while rubbing her belly. \"What am I...?\" As Ash gazed upon what his friend had become, it finally dawned on him-- May had taken on the characteristics of the Pok\u00e9mon she herself owned. She'd become the perfect synthesis of Pok\u00e9mon and trainer. It was one of the strangest things he'd ever seen, and yet he couldn't help but feel admiration for her, and it seemed he wasn't alone in that thought-- several tiny people on the ground had already begun to bow before the evolved titaness. </span></div></div>",

Then her eyes shifted to her new transformed body and smiled.  She had become an entirely new being; half-pokemon and half-human.  As a pokemon she controlled the forces of nature...to a very small extent, true, but she had powers.  She wondered just what type of powers  did she have.  As a test May turned her head away from the city under her and took a deep breath and issued forth a blizzard.   Both ice and snow fell from the sky and the surrounding area was filled with howling winds that uprooted several trees.  As soon as May's breath ran out, the blizzard suddenly died away and the sun shone again as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n                                   \"Oh, this is <i>beyond</i> cool\" said May giggling madly.  \"I can get use to this\"<br>\r\n                                   She looked back down at all the people that were now bowing to her.  They were worshiping her!  And why not?  She was 10,000 feet tall, she was a bizarre hybrid of pokemon and she could control the elements.  The rush of power she felt was like the one she had felt earlier when she had grown for the first time...but this was ten times as powerful! She was like a queen now...no, better..a goddess.  Maybe not a literal goddess but people were bowing down to her.  People accepted her power.  <br>\r\n                                      <i>Don't let it go to your head...</i>  said a faint voice in her head.  <br>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                              \"So...\" said Ash.  \"this is different\"  <br>\r\n                              Ash had found himself bowing to May.   What frightened him was that he had no memory about bowing down at all.  What he did remember was that May had looked at him with those new eyes of hers with that heavenly, ethereal glow and the next thing he knew he was bowing down at her feet.  And he wasn't the only one bowing either; half of the people seemed willing to bow down while the other half seemed unwilling...like Ash had been.   And that frightened him even more.   He was reminded of what had happened when May grew in town; she had seemed mad with power.  But she had settled down pretty fast.   And anyway, as long as people don't look at her in the eyes......Ash then wondered what had given May those eyes with the unearthly glow.  That wasn't a part of any pokemon that she owned.   </span></div></div>",

Even Ash and Solidad, who had previously been bigger than her, were no match for her unstoppable charm. She had never felt stronger or sexier in her life, squeezing her prodigious breasts with one pair of arms while fingering her moistening slit with the other, and gazed down at the assembled crowd of contestants, spotting a giant (yet tiny to her) Jessie among them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie quickly noticed the massive Pok\u00e9mon goddess looking at her, and quickly averted her gaze to avoid falling under May's hypnotic spell, before trying to run away with James and Meowth safe between her breasts. \"I don't think so!\" May bellowed in her booming voice, instinctively extending a pair of long Vine Whips to ensnare the tiny giantess and pull her back to the Contest Hall. \"Don't be so hasty,\" she said, chuckling as she placed Jessie back on the ground. \"Your new Queen proclaims that the Giant Contest will continue as planned, with all of my subjects testing their style and grace against my own regal self.

Why should she be bothered to perform in her own Contest when there were a whole gaggle of contestants to choose from?  The question became who should go first in the Appeals round?  May looked down and considered for about a minute before coming to a decision.  She looked over to Drew, who still had fangirls all around him--though not as many as he had now.  She pointed one of her Blaziken claws at him and said in a commanding voice:  \"You should go first in the Appeals round.  Like all Appeals rounds there's no time limit so please take as long as you like but don't take all day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        At first Drew didn't move from his spot.  Indeed it looked as if he was fighting the impulse to obey his new 'Queen'.  After a minute Drew finally stood up from his spot, bowed low and summoned his Masquerain instead of his usual pick, Roserade.  That made May rise an eyebrow.  Almost all the other times, Drew started with his Roserade.  'Unless it's at the pokemon center' she thought.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       Ash looked up at May and thought about to appeal to her inner self...her true self as it were because he was fairly convinced that May's new-found power was going straight to her head.  Powerful as she was, May wasn't omnipotent.  If she was omnipotent, then she would've ordered him to stop thinking about such things.  Wouldn't she?  'I defiantly would' thought Ash as he tried to fight off the impulse to bow before Queen May.  He found that it was possible to fight the impulse but it needed strength of will.   May was completely ignoring him and watched Drew do his Appeal; something to do with Masquerain's Silver Wind attack and spinning in a rapid circle.  The effect was quite pretty.  Then Ash remembered that May had done the same  move with her Beautifly in one earlier Contest...one of May's very first of he remembered correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         'How can I appeal to May's true self?' thought Ash as he watched the rest of Drew's Appeal.  </span></div></div>",

She gulped loudly sending down entire chunks of buildings down her gullet.   'She could swallow me in one bite' thought Ash nervously.   Ash was tense to say the least.  He didn't knew quite what to expect.  Would May be angry about him asking such a question?  Would she be calm?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"I haven't really thought about it\" said May after a thoughtful moment.   \"Now that I'm this tall I suppose I won't need to eat more Rare Candies.  I might change my mind if anyone dares to get taller than I am.  Hmmm.  Hey, that sounds good.  Make that my third decree; nobody shall get taller than me\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"I wouldn't dream about it, your Majesty\" said Ash.   \"but, uh, just propose that someone should get taller than you...what would you do to that, uh, person?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n          \"Punish them I suppose\" said May.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"No doubt they deserve it\" said Ash.   \"but how...if I may ask?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"I don't like the idea of killing\" said May.  \"perhaps lock them up for months...or years\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n           'Maybe May is not too far gone as I've feared...' thought Ash.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"..And I would like a palace to live in\" said May.   \"I'm a queen after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"Your Majesty...if I might say so\" said Ash clearing his throat.   \"building a palace to your scale will be costly.

'Man, it's hard to talk like this,' he thought. 'She sounds almost like she rehearsed this crap...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course!\" May continued her noblewoman's laugh, raising her human arms skyward while her Blaziken ones idly rubbed her growling belly. \"I am nothing if not a fair monarch, you know... so long as the people of the land accept me as their Queen, I am content to share my eminence and beauty with the world. Yes, my kingdom shall be vast and prosperous, just like its Queen! I plan to travel the world and introduce the peoples of the regions to their new goddess, and I fully expect them to submit without resistance. But that comes after the construction of my temple, which will mark my seat of power here in my home region. And you, Ash... you will hold a special place in my new order!\" Ash's ears perked up at the sound of this; it seemed he'd be in an even better position than he thought to influence May and try to break through her new power-mad persona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am honored, your Majesty,\" said Ash, moving downward to massage her belly as she ate. \"What prompted this most, uh, momentous of decisions though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in spite of your earlier insolence in outgrowing me, Ash, I must admit that I still value our earlier friendship more, not to mention you were the supplier of the Rare Candies that lead to my glorious ascension, so I'm willing to give credit where it's due!\" Ash continued to listen intently, noticing as May's face seemed to soften a bit and the glow in her eyes died down considerably. Her voice retained its powerful bass, but when she spoke again, he could detect a hint of the old May again. \"I hope you don't hold anything against me, Ash... truth be told, it's always been a childhood fantasy of mine to be a princess, and now I've managed to do even better than that in real life... I could never have imagined such a thing, and I just love it so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May... is that you?\" She turned to him again, looking almost like herself again... only for the glow of her eyes to brighten again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean 'your Majesty', then yes!

Is that what happens when you grow this tall?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          May glanced at Ash.   \"You dance for me.  Or do a trick.  Just amuse me\"   She then reached for Ash with her human hands and set him down on the ground on the \"stage\".  Ash bowed then started to dance. During the first few minutes of dancing Ash got much better at it.      May then turned her attention to the other people.   \"The rest of you shall construct my temple.

Her new self.  She just had broken through to talk to Ash for a minute when her new persona shoved her away regaining control of her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   In this mental landscape were two people; two people that looked exactly alike save for the eyes.  The real May had her blue eyes while the other one had nothing but an ethereal glow in the place of eyes.  It was rather spooky looking at those eyes.   The mental landscape looked like a high hill covered in flowers--one half of the hill had living flowers and the other half of the hill had dead and rotting flowers.   The two Mays stood at the summit of the high hill looking through what looked like a window hovering in mid-air.  The other May stood directly in front of the window now.  The window was looking down at the tiny Ash dancing on the ground far below.  It was far below and yet the view was zoomed in.   The rest of the mental landscape was black; it was just a hill jutting out from darkness.  The sky was pitch black.  There were no stars in the sky, no moon...it was just...black.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"You haven't told me who you are and where did you come from\" said May.  \"were you the voice in the void?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"<b>Perhaps</b>\" said the other May.  Her voice had an echo quality to it.  \"<b>perhaps not </b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Why are you here?\" asked May. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"<b>I'm a reflection of your true inner self</b>\" said the other May.  \"<b>I was born when you ate too many of those Rare Candies.  Don't ask me how or why because I don't know myself.  You said you wanted to be a princess, right?  Well you're living the dream now my dear</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"I would be lying if I said I didn't want to be a princess...\" said May.  \"but I would like to be the one in charge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"<b>Of course you do </b>\" said the other May.  \"<b>And I don't blame you for it.

The majority of people were busy building May's temple but there was a fair number of them watching Ash dance.  May frowned slightly as her gaze returned to Ash.   Several more silent moments passed before May came to a decision.  <br>\r\n             \"Solidad, go and join Ash in dancing\" ordered May.  <br>\r\n            Ash momentarily paused in his dancing as he glanced at Solidad.  <br>\r\n            Solidad eagerly went over to Ash and started to dance.  She soon matched the style of Ash's dance.   May smiled widely revealing the fangs in her mouth as she watched the pair dance.  <br>\r\n              It wasn't long before May noticed that Ash had an erection as his eyes were fixed mostly on Solidad's jiggling breasts and ass.  It was also apparent that Solidad had noticed Ash's erection as she smirked.  The dancing pair grew steadily closer and closer.  <br>\r\n                  May recalled that minutes earlier that Ash and Solidad were making out.  May sighed and silently watched as the pair grew ever closer to each other.  <br>\r\n              Ash and Solidad ended the dance with a grand flourish and with a kiss that lingered on. <br>\r\n             \"You two have put a grand sh...\" started May as she stopped talking as she was that Ash and Solidad were feeling each other up.  May's eyes widened with a mixture of amusement and envy as Ash and Solidad's kiss grew more passionate.  May had a mind of ordering the pair to stop but found that she was actually enjoying the erotic show that was happening way down below.    <br>\r\n            Out of the corner of her vision May saw that Max was watching the show.   Brock was also watching and he looked to be crying, apparently envious of Ash's fortune.   <br>\r\n                 May whipped out a tendril from the flower on her head and guided it down toward Max.  The tendril looked like the tendril from Venusaur.  The tendril grabbed Max from behind and lifted him up to her face. <br>\r\n         \"I'm afraid you're too young to see this\" said May.  \"Sorry about this\" here, May snorted Max up her nose.   May cackled as she felt her brother struggling in her nose. <br>\r\n             Meanwhile, Ash and Solidad had stopped feeling each other up and started to hump each other.  Pleasurable moans escaped from the lips of Solidad.   The crowd surrounding the area started to cheer the pair on as the two made love in front of everyone.  </span></div></div>",

May blinked several times and then looked down at the ground which was difficult to do due to her truly titanic tits that dwarfed the contest hall.  Her tits dwarfed everything, really!  They were the size of mountains in their own right.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"Don't be afraid\" said May.  \"I'm fine now.....\"  here, she took a deep sniff.   \"is that more Rare Candy I smell?!\"  She looked wildly around for a moment.   \"the smell is coming from everywhere!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Ash and the others really weren't paying attention to what May was saying; they were busy trying not to drown in the rivers of milk or May's sex juices that had landed on the ground.

The two giants then had a shoving match with each of their fanclubs cheering them on.   The two seemed to be evenly matched with none of them gaining any ground.  Finally May kicked Drew high on the shins that made Drew back off for a second and then the shoving match continued.

Though it wasn't hard to track her down, give all the giant foot prints she left and the trees she knocked over while she ran... though keeping up with her was a different story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[Somewhere else in Hoenn] </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All man, what a nice day!\", \"I know right, I'm glad we decided to take a day off today!\", \"Yeah, we've so earned this... nice!\" Some voices said enjoying the sunlight. That was till they heard some loud foot steps coming there way. \"Huh, what is all that noise?!\" But suddenly a giant nude May appeared and stopped in front of them. They all freaked out, \"I-is that a giant naked twerpet?!\" May saw a giant Meowth Hot Air Balloon. She plucked it from the ground and wrapped it around her waist to use as clothing. May smiled and then said out loud, \"Aawwwww, now that's better. That is one problem fixed, not to find something to eat!\" May finished while running for her next objective. \"I-I don't believe it! Did our Balloon just get stolen by a Giant Nude--\",James said before he was cut-off. \"No... let's just ignore that even happen. I can't deal with those twerps today and a giant one is just too big...\" Jessie said while laying her head back down. The Team Rocket Trio sighed and continued to relax. Ash and the group were still way behind May and it was going to take a bit to catch up to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay continued to run through the woods and was kind of liking how much ground she could cover at this size, but she quickly remembered all the problems this was going to bring her, especially the eating factor... \"All man, why couldn't I just have ate the pokemon food and not the rare candy?!\" May asked herself several times. But what's done is done now and she needed to get some real food in her, how much would she need now, was going to be a lot more than what she would have needed before she grew so tall. Which made her feel even more stupid over eating the cursed item. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was running, she comes across a?</span></div></div>",

But as she cried this out, she could feel her lips growing more plumped which each word out of her mouth. But her attention was quickly drawn back to her growing assets. Her bust was quickly passing small C-cup into a mid sized C-cup and even bigger still! Her red shirt stretched tightly across her bust and started to strain under the growth that was happening underneath it. As they reached into the D-cup area, she began to hear a strain coming from her backside as she peered behind herself. She saw her butt was expanding and stretching the living daylights out of her bike shorts!  She could hear the leather fabric creaking under the stress of her expanding rear! But as she was about to place her hands on her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her hips were expanding as well along side her torso, but it was shrinking rather than growing like everything else. May couldn't believe it, but she was taking on a hourglass like appearance! She continued to change more and more until it all came to a halt. She was now a few inches taller, had a average D-cup bust, a rear end that any girl would be jealous of and a figure with a set of pouty lips that brought everything together. May looked around and found a small river near her and looked at the reflection in it. At first she was horrified, but the new look quickly got her attention and it was awesome. \"Oh wow, I look so-so... sexy. I look like a woman, well a woman with a 10 year old appearance still somewhat.\" May smiled. She looked back at her friends and they all were stunned. Max demanded she go to the hospital to fix this, Ash and Brock agreed. May laughed and asked why she would give this up, this is great she replied. \"But what if something goes wrong?\" Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay chuckled, \"Like what? I look perfect and beautiful, nothing can ruin this.\" But just as May finished that sentence, she began to feel odd once again.</span></div></div>",

It was a random hot afternoon and the Team Rocket trio were just sitting around burning up under a shade tree. \"All man... what a hot day! I wish Boss would hurry up and give us something to use against those twerps...\" Jessie complained. James and Meowth sighed heavily since Jessie's complaints where getting old and it was just too hot to hear her complaining. But just as Jessie was going to open her mouth again. A large crate dropped from the sky and landed right next them! This startled them both greatly and calmed down when they saw a Delibird land shortly after out of breathe. He then waddled over to them and had a clipboard for them to sign. The trio all gave their signatures on the clipboard. After they did, Delibird took in a deep breathe and flew off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this thing I wonder...\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but you two get it open right now!\" Jessie demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeowth and James attempted to open it, while Meowth mumbled, \"Yeah-yeah... if you only you would close something right now instead...\" The two took a few minutes, but they managed to finally get the crate to open. What was inside was a small machine about a foot high in height and was fairly lite. They picked it up and saw it was a Shrinking Machine! The trio weren't sure what to think this was really, but it sounded like this was a great delivery and possible there chance to finally please their boss. But the only question was, how does it work? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie demanded someone be a test subject. James and Meowth both denied to be one. Jessie grew a little upset and then figured they could try it on something else. They found a berry lying on the ground. Jessie pointed at it for the first try. James and Meowth looked over the whole thing to try and find a button to hit it with. But after some poking and pulling. A small shaft slide open to reveal a switch and trigger! \"Ah ha, there we go!\" Meowth yelled. He hit the switch and then pulled the trigger. A faint light pulsed out and hit the berry, it slowly shrunk in size and soon was so small it could barely be seen. Jessie jumped for joy as it was a success, \"Yes-yes-yes, it works!! Now we finally have something to take those twerps down to size!\" Meowth grinned and replied, \"Yeah, literally!\" The trio laughed evilly as they drew up some plans in their head to attack our Heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tracked down Ash and the gang down a nearby lake. Ash, Brock and Max were off behind a huge blanket wall to change into some swimsuits. While May had her own private part to change. She had picked out her swimsuit and just before she was about to change. They figured they do a sneak attack and hit May first! Meowth set up the machine and then took aim at May. Just as May turned her back to them. Meowth hit the trigger and May was hit by a sudden pulse strike. May paused and wasn't sure what had just happen. But the effects soon started to occur, but not what the Team Rocket trio had thought it would...   </span></div></div>",

However, the effect they were expecting wasn't was about to happen. As May was about to undress, she suddenly felt her bike shorts beginning to ride up her butt, thighs, and hips. She tried to correct this, but it almost felt like someone was giving her a wedge or something like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs May struggled to fix her bike shorts, \"Arrgghhh, what's going on here?\", other parts of her clothes were starting to go through a similar problem. Next up was her shoes and shirt. May had average sized girl's shoes, but they were going from kid sized to toddler sized! Her feet almost immediately started to get their circulation cut off around her ankles and heel! May squeaked in pain as the tightness grew worse and worse. She fell to the ground and forcefully removed her tightening shoes quickly, but as she struggled with this, her shirt was starting to become obvious it was getting really tight as well too for whatever reason. May continued to struggle getting her shoes off, but she was soon met with another problem as the collar of her shirt started to pull tightly across her throat. May started to choke and tried to pull her shirt's collar down so she could breathe. But while trying to do this, her shoes continued to shrink on her feet and she could feel that she was losing circulation from it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she was struggling with two major problems, her shirt suddenly burst open straight down the middle. Giving May the ability to breath once more. May choked for a second, but quickly went back to removing her shoes and with some muscle put behind it, she managed to yank them off. If she was a second slower, it would have been pretty bad. May fell onto her back and started to breath a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs May took deep breathes, \"Oh thank God that's over with!\" but her relaxing moment was cut short. As the tightening was still continuing and she could now feel her upper arms and shoulders being pinched and a more private areas feeling the same. May blushed as she tried to pull off her bike shorts, but it was just no use. They were several sizes too small and they were continuing to shrink. May couldn't understand what the feeling she was having, but in a weird way, it felt kind of good? She continued to struggle, until she heard a loud... SSSHHHHHRRRRRIIIPPPPP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay paused as she could feel a major relief occur around her bike short's area. She lifted her head up to see her bike short's had split open around her hips and thighs. May didn't know what had just happen, but it felt good. But she still had to worry about her shirt as it was starting to cut off circulations to her arms, but it too quickly met the same fate as her bike short's. May was now only left in a pair of panties and a modest bra. May stood back up and noticed the rest of her clothes and shoes were laying on the ground. She bent over and was shocked to see her clothes were oddly enough, shrinking?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't have believed it, if she wasn't looking at it herself. But yes, they were shrinking! The Team Rocket Trio sat there and were confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! It only shrunk her clothes?!\" Jessie yelled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently so...\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you idiots had hit her actual body, she would have shrunk entirely... and not just her normal day clothes.\" Meowth wise cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi grew angry and punched them on the heads, \"You morons! Do it right this time and make her shrink and not her clothes! In fact set it to make her really small!\" Jessie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye-yes ma'am!\" James and Meowth answered in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey readjusted the machine and the two took aim and fired the machine once more and this time it hit May's bare back. Then the two decided to move on two get ready for the other twerps to fire upon. But while the three snuck off. May was starting to look different, but not in a way they would have thought. May investigated her shrunken clothes and shoes, \"Wha-what happen to them and why are they so small?\" May asked herself with worry in her voice. She stood back up to her full height and decided to change into her one-piece swimsuit, since that would be better than walking out in front of her friends and little brother in her underwear. But as she was going to take off her underwear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[Slow Growth Please, No instant or Fast. Their can be time for fast later on.]</b></span></div></div>",

However as she walked over and leaned over to her bag to change, she suddenly felt odd... May paused as she stared at her bag and felt like she was rising up slowly. Kind of like how it feels to stand up straight or the likes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly May started to GROW! When Team Rocket adjusted their machine, the idiots had changed the setting to grow, instead of changing the shrinkage amount. And now it was starting to take effect like May's clothes! Slowly May felt her bra and panties starting to tug and pull tighter across her whole body. Which caused her to start blushing as the tugging was in sensitive areas like her breasts and other regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle by little, May grew an inch per second! That is till it tapered off and left her almost four inches taller! May quickly stood up straight and was confused what had happen, but then remembered what had happen to her clothes. Then she thought, what had ever happen to her clothes must have effected her underwear now too. So she quickly unhooked her bra and tugged hard to get her panties off. After removing her underwear, she felt a sigh of relief now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All man, that is so much better!\" May sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay went into her bag and pulled out her pink one-piece swimsuit and had some trouble getting her legs through the openings. She pulled on it hard and slowly managed to pull it up far enough to be in the right spot, but as she pulled the rest up her one-piece swimsuit and slide her arms through the openings there. She quickly found the swimsuit too was a tad too small. After finishing up, she felt and saw it was a few sizes too small! May blushed as it was kind of obvious this suit was a tad small on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged on certain areas to make it look better, and it worked to a certain degree, but she wasn't going to be fooling anyone really. May sighed, \"I-I don't know why all my clothes are so small and how my day clothes shrunk down! What in the world is happening, is someone playing tricks on me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as May stood there, she knew she had to leave. So she decided to make excuse to have to leave. She remembered there being a clothing shop they passed by, since she wasn't going to continue the journey with Ash, Brock, and her little brother Max in a undersized one-piece swimsuit. So as she steps out, everyone see her and they are all confused. Brock blushes at this sight of May in a undersized one-piece swimsuit, while Ash is confused as to why May is wearing such a undersized swimsuit, and Max thinking it was hilarious. May squeezed her bag embarrassed and tried not to get too upset, but it was hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team rocket trio had set up their machine once more and they saw May's wardrobe problem. Jessie stared hard and then grew mad at James and Meowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I tell you two! I said shrink her, not her clothes!\" Jessie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that is odd, we never shot her swimsuit and I could have sworn she was hit in the back... huh\" Meowth question out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie grew more angry and told them to hit her again and hit her thighs! James took aim and went to fire again and he hit her left thigh. But after firing, the machine started to act up and then became fried! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What HAPPEN?!\" Jessie demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeowth starting messing with it and found that the machine over heated and it needed to be fixed. Jessie grew more angry, but then asked if Meowth could fix it here. He shook his head no, this didn't help Jessie's temper. But she decided they needed to get it fixed now and make a temporary retreat. So the three rushed off to fix the machine. But while on their retreat. Meowth accidently turned the dial back to Shrink and pressed the button and it hit somebody... somebodies? As the three retreated deeper into the woods, what happens to May?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=Notice=<br>\r\nIf May is to grow again, it will be very small slow spurts and since her swimsuit was not shot, it's not going to grow with her. </span></div></div>",

Being a trainer meant that Felix spent many a night sleeping under the stars. Felix was your typical trainer in many ways; he had won all the gym badges in his home region of Kalos and attempted to win the championship of the Kalos region. He had lost a match in the semi-finals of the championship and he had a good run at it. After loosing his semi-final match, Felix then decided to journey to the other regions and try to become champion in at least one region; this had mix results. He didn't win any league championship but he didn't allow himself to be down after each defeat. He also spent some time in each region in order to soak in a little of the culture. He was 11 when he decided to journey beyond the Kalos region...he was now twenty and was in the Hoenn region where he had just won a badge from Norman. <br>\r\n Felix's constant companion through all of his journeys was his Delphox who was one of those pokemon that detested being in a pokeball. Felix's Delphox was different in another regard; she was a 'shiny' pokemon, that meant she had different coloring compared to other Delphoxes. Instead of a dark red \"robe\", she had a purple one and her other fur was light grey. ( she looks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2013/2...\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2013/2...</a>) She was also quite tall; standing nearly at six feet perhaps because she was a shiny pokemon. Shiny pokemon tended to be taller than the average pokemon. <br>\r\n Like a certain other pokemon trainer, Felix decided to use and catch the pokemon he captured in the region he was currently in. Only Delphox accompanied him everywhere. The rest of his pokemon were all from the Hoenn region. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Felix was lying atop of a high hill somewhere in the Hoenn region in his sleeping bag, gazing up at the stars. It was a perfect night for stargazing without a single cloud in the sky. It was a cool night but not overly so. Felix was wearing his sleepware; a simple t-shirt and sweat pants. His Delphox was a few feet away trying to start a fire without using her powers....she had said she wanted a challenge to see, as she said, \"the way humans do it\". Like all psychic-type pokemon, Felix's Delphox could talk through telepathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"[How you humans manage to survive without powers is beyond me]\" muttered Delphox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Our power is our minds\" replied Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"[Are you saying all pokemon are dumb?]\" asked Delphox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not at all\" said Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"[It's not that hard to set you on fire]\" said Delphox, emitting a low growl as she failed once again to start a campfire with a match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then you would be....\" started Felix. He was in the act of turning to face Delphox when he saw something unexpected in the sky. Above the moon was what appeared to be a comet. The tail of the comet trailed behind the comet, which made the moon look like a gigantic eye. \"Well, I'd be damned. A comet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Delphox glanced up at the sky. \"[Looks awfully close]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's probably nowhere near Earth\" said Felix. \"and yet....I don't recall seeing it last night\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"[I don't recall seeing that comet either]\" said Delphox. \"[a comet out of nowhere.....]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Maybe it wasn't close enough to be seen\" said Felix thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"[Well....unless you want to come over here and start the fire.....I....]\" said Delphox and then her voice faltered and a low growl came from her. Felix looked sharply in the direction of Delphox in time to see her start to glow from the foot up. It looked as if she was starting to evolve. But.....evolve into what? The process was slow, slowly creeping over the legs of Delphox and continued into her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What on earth?!\" asked Felix getting out of the sleeping bag and rushing over to Delphox who was standing at her full height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"[I don't know what's happening....]\" said Delphox. \"[....but it feels so good]\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The glowing continued to cover the body of Delphox over the course of a few moments. Felix was completely perplexed. The glowing light then covered all of Delphox and the light became ten times brighter....so bright that Felix had to look away until the light faded. When Felix looked back at his Delphox he was in for a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Delphox was now much more human-looking then before. She was clearly still a pokemon but now she had human-like qualities like breasts.....very big ones, in fact. Her legs, arms and torso looked to belong to a human instead of a pokemon. Her face remained fox-like. She had a lustful expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How in the world....?\" asked Felix. \"are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"....better than okay\" said Delphox in a faraway voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You talked without using telepathy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Delphox seemed to snap out of whatever state she was in. \"What happened to me?! HOW did this happen to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I have no Earthly idea\" said Felix. Then he glanced up at the sky again. \"you don't think that comet caused this to happen, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Delphox looked up at the sky. \"I don't know....maybe I guess.....it's the best explaination for now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Felix had looked down again at Delphox and found himself staring at her breasts which had to be at least a D-Cup. Felix then quickly averted his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I saw that\" said Delphox slyly. \"you like the new me don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course\" said Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Delphox looked Felix over. \"Is it....weird to admit that I find you much more attractive now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Attractive...?\" asked Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well I am a female and you're a male\" said Delphox. \"and that.....whatever happened to me....made me horny\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Felix backed up. \"You're not suggesting you and I......no....I can't do that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't you find me alluring this way?\" asked Delphox in a sultry voice. \"it is close to mating season after all\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Felix fumbled for Delphox's pokeball but he wasn't wearing his belt anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Delphox smiled and walked closer to Felix and put her breasts up against Felix's body. Then Delphox kissed him full on the mouth. Felix tried to resist but his body wouldn't listen to him anymore. He returned the kiss and breathed in her scent which seemed to inflame his lust. He didn't know what it was that inflamed his lust....nor did he much care at the moment. Felix then started to fondle the breasts of Delphox. Delphox made a pleasing sound and grabbed Felix's growing erection. The two broke away from the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's happening to us...?\" asked Felix. \"we really shouldn't....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shhhhh, shhhh\" said Delphox, pushing down Felix's pants. \"let's just enjoy this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was the comet that caused Delphox and other pokemon (not all pokemon) to mutate into a more humanoid shape. Not every pokemon was effected but it also did effect certain humans. The effect was to make humans grow to certain heights. Each human that the comet effected was at a different height. There was also reports that the comet caused a small number of humans to undergo weird and bizarre mutations. The comet would become known as \"Felix's Comet\" since it was Felix who first saw the comet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (a/n: Since this is May's story, the story can focus on May now. I just wanted to write an introduction that didn't involve any of the regular cast. I got this idea several weeks ago trying to come up with a new story idea. This idea came from several sources....like the movie \"Maxium Overdrive\" where a comet caused machines to become sentient. I know a comet making strange things happen isn't exactly new but I just wanted to do something totally bizarre like the story where May turns into a hydra. I would've put this into my own interactive story but since you need a paid membership to do those now.....I just decided to combine that idea with the whole GTS theme of this interactive. The reason I chose Delphox is because that was my starter pokemon from Pokemon Y....although my delphox was a male......)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was so hot that an egg would boil on the parched grass along the road. On the road was a covered wagon being drawn by two Ponyta. A masked man was driving the wagon. The road for the most part was smooth and even.  In the back of the wagon sat May, Ash, Brock and Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved us from being boiled alive\" said Ash. \"Thank you, Avery\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" said Avery.

She saw bottles galore.  She selected one bottle, opened it and took a drink without looking at the label.  What entered her mouth was certainly not water but a sweet tasting liquid that tasted just like honey. May was about to ask what the drink was when she glanced at the label:  <b> Garden Jumbo Gro </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plant food?!\" asked May, spitting out some of the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a gardener\" said Avery. \"I use a special type of plant food----say, you didn't drank that stuff did you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was about to answer when her stomach suddenly swelled twice it's normal size and she gained about two feet in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May?!\" asked everyone in the wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't good\" said Avery. </span></div></div>",

Everyone managed to get out by the time her head was pressed up against the ceiling of the wagon, but the cloth roof couldn't stop her, tearing easily as her face popped out the top. Her belly continued to swell out with fat, pooching out over the waistband of her tight shorts, while her hips and thighs packed on considerable poundage as well, giving her a massively exaggerated pear-shaped figure. Of course, her growth was not just horizontal, as the young Coordinator continued to reach higher and higher into the air, towering over the wagon and her friends assembled around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening...when is it gonna stop?!\" she exclaimed, the covered wagon shattering beneath her ballooning rear. Her bike shorts managed to stretch even across her rapidly-expanding lower body, but they did ride up to the point of looking almost like panties on her globular ass. Her other clothes, however, were less lucky; though her upper body didn't grow quite as much, it was still far more than her shirt could withstand-- fat arms bulged out of her tiny sleeves, swelling breasts flopped out the bottom of her shirt, and eventually the whole thing was torn to ribbons, leaving the flabby girl scrambling to cover herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the drink wore off, May found herself standing-- or rather, sitting-- at a height of about 30 feet, leaving her friends and the poor carriage driver standing dumbfounded in her massive shadow. She resembled a towering pillar of fat, billowing out wide at the bottom and tapering upward from there, with her chubby, multi-chinned face sitting atop it all. The bottle of Jumbo-Gro was somehow still intact, rolling out of the wreckage of the wagon and stopping at Ash's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this is a bit of a problem,\" Avery remarked, probably making the understatement of the century. \"Jeez, I knew that stuff was supposed to have 'side effects' when people drank it, but this is insane!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't say?!\" Max roared, waving his arms around wildly. \"You just turned my sister into a giant blimp!

It was almost odd to see Max so worked up over his sister, whom he normally considered annoying, but it seemed that he really did care about her...it was just a pity that it took her being turned into a fat giantess for him to show it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, kid, I didn't tell your sister to go drinking my plant food!\" Avery shot back, only to trail off as he noticed something odd in the sky. \"And another thing-- wait a sec...what is that?\" He pointed to the object, and upon seeing it, Ash and Brock let out a frustrated groan-- it was an all-too-familiar hot air balloon shaped like a giant Meowth's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no...not them, not now!\" Brock groaned, burying his head in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Where do you get off, shooting us down in the middle of our-- HOLY CRAP!\" Jessie freaked out upon realizing that it was not a Pok\u00e9mon attack that knocked them down, but May, who had somehow grown into a mountain of a girl. \"How...how did the girl twerp get so HUGE?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay, at this point, just sighed bemusedly at the whole situation-- after what had happened to her, Team Rocket seemed like barely more than a nuisance. \"Oh, hey, thanks for noticing,\" she said sarcastically, placing her hands on her massively flared hips and seemingly not caring that her breasts were exposed. \"Yeah, you know, I just figured I'd try a new look...what do you think?\" Stumbling a bit on her stubby legs, she stood up to her full height and gave the Rockets quite a scare with her massive girth. None of them could so much as muster a comeback before May reared back, swinging her bulbous belly forward and slamming it into the criminal trio, sending them flying over the horizon with the greatest of ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again...!\" May just sighed, having seen this thing far too many times already and being too concerned with her new state of affairs anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, for his part, just stared-- the entire situation was just getting too weird for him. \"Okay...I think I've seen enough-- I'm out!\" Gathering up whatever of his effects he could find, he ran off, leaving the case of Jumbo-Gro bottles behind. Max was about to take off after him, but stopped dead in his tracks when he heard his sister's huge belly let out another growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget him,\" she said, clutching her grumbling gut. \"I'm still hungry, guys!\" </span></div></div>",

As he watched May's stubby legs and rounded lower body a few dozen yards away slowly push their way through the forest before stopping, her upper body no doubt leaned over parting the tree line in search of him, he started to have second thoughts about trying to keep the bottle of Jumbo-Gro from her. it's not that he suddenly felt like allowing her to subdue her appetite with it, no doubt getting bigger in the process, was a good idea, but he wasn't sure he could keep running much longer and was somewhat afraid of what the angry, 30 foot tall May might do when she found him. If he hadn't stupidly left his pokeballs back at the wreckage of the wagon he might have a way to even the odds against the giant girl, but instead all he had with him was the Bottle of Jumbo-Gro. With that thought Ash suddenly had an idea, he wasn't entirely sure it was a good idea it might be the only one he had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was bent over slightly, parting the trees with her hands in various spots in the hopes of finding Ash, and the bottle of Jumbo-Gro he was carrying. chasing after Ash had done nothing to suppress her appetite and in fact had made her hungrier. She muttered to herself as she searched another spot, only to be interrupted by a tap on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, i'm busy\" May waved whoever was behind her away before suddenly stopping and realizing what had just happened. Turning around, May found herself face to chest with someone, taking a step back and glancing p she realized that someone was Ash, now 50 feet tall and in a similar shape as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh planted his hands on his hips, looking down at My with a smirk, before pulling out the bottle of Jumbo=Gro and waving it over his head. \"Looking for this?\"</span></div></div>",

It gave her some relief from her tight clothes and she looked normal... well unless you don't count the 2-foot height increase and the well under sized clothes. May looked at herself and was relieved to have a normal figure once more. Brock decided they needed to get May some new clothes, so he asked Avery if he would be nice enough to take them down to the nearest town. Avery figured it would be no problem, since he needed to get to a resting area anyways. The gang traveled for what seemed like hours, but it was more like 40-minutes to close to an hour. They had finally arrived to a small village and Avery went on his separate way.  May, Ash, Brock and Max thanked him for his trouble, while Avery said he was sorry for May's trouble and that nothing else should happen. Which made May feel very uncomfortable... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rode away, his bottle of \"Garden Jumbo Gro\" fell off and landed on the ground. Max heard this and turned to see a bottle laying on the ground with the label sitting on the ground and out of view. He thought something had fell out of May's backpack and decided to stuff it into her bag. The four walked into the village and tried to find a clothing shop. It wasn't a very upscale village, but it wasn't like one of those that fear the sun or something like that. Everyone immediately starred at May and were confused on why someone would were such undersized clothes in public. This only made May more embarrassed about what had happen to her. But she knew she would be okay when they could get this fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally found a shop and as they walked in, the shop keep was shocked by May's appearance. \"What happen to your friend here?\" the female shop asked with worry. Brock just chuckled and then replied with a simple, \"Oh she just suddenly grew is all.\" The female shop keep smiled and then said, \"Oh my? You kids are growing up bigger and faster every generation aren't you.\" She chuckled. May grew ever more embarrassed by this. The female shop keep introduced herself as, \"Amber\". They greeted Amber and then asked if she had some bigger clothes or if she could fix May's clothes. She looked at May and then smiled. She said she could make some alterations to it, but as far as having something bigger, she was out of most of her stock. The restock has been slow due to the heat. So she said she could just simple modify it. She then asked Ash, Brock and Max to come back later, while she works on May. They leave and she pulls May into the backroom. She kindly asks May to strip down to her underwear so she can get her measurements. May was a little unsure, but figured she could be trusted. She drops her bag onto the chair behind her and Amber starts to take her measurements. </span></div></div>",

May knew she was too young to have make-up, but she thought she could get some anyways to see how it looks and when she was older she could use it then. As she was attempting to put some lipstick on, she felt a sudden tingle inside her. It wasn't much, but she could feel her clothes slightly shifting in place. She stood up straight and corrected her shirt and bike shorts. But as she did, she could swear she felt her body change. She paused for a moment and then decided to just ignore it. She continued to try and sample many different types of makeups at the counter. After she was done, the saleswoman gave her a makeup box, free of charge to carry it all. May thanked her and decided to go and track down Ash and Max. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she returned to the bench they were resting on. She found they were gone! May looked around everywhere and found them at the food court! They still had her stuff, but she figured they would be waiting for her, but instead they were stuffing their faces! May stormed over to them, with her bike shorts slightly riding up her as she rushed over there. Max was slurping on a slushy as he suddenly looked up to see May rushing over. He choked on it and coughed out, \"Oh crud, May just noticed we left the bench!\" Ash made out most of what he coughed out and before the two could move. May was right on top of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I let you both rest and when I come back, you both are stuffing your faces?!\" May yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-but sis, we were hungry and we figured you wouldn't be back for a while.\" Max tried to calmly reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay frowned and was meant with a very loud stomach growl. May blushed at this embarrassing moment. \"Looks like someone is hungry now, huh?\" Max said with a smirkish  tone. May grew even more embarrassed, and after giving Max a soft pop to the top of his head, she decided to forgive them. She took a seat and told them both to bring some food and drinks to her. Ash and Max sighed as they wondered how Brock was doing. And well... he was doing great! Officer Jenny was being really nice to him and he was gladly doing every one of her beck and call with the at most grace and timing. Ash and Max brought May her meal and they were shocked to see how quickly she finished it! May let out a mild burp and quickly said, \"Excuse me\" with a embarrassed look. But what was even more shocking was she was still hungry! She demanded more and they brought her more food and drink. May continued to eat and stuff her face, which was causing her belly to swell slowly in girth a size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-What's going to happen next?</b></span></div></div>",

His clothes were riding up somewhat revealing the bottom of his stomach.  The parking lot of the Research Center was devoid of people. Ash glanced around before he ran to a black van with a big letter R on it.  As he approached the van, the sliding door opened to reveal Max and Brock <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's May?'

It took her a handful of moments for May to fully exit Ash.  Once she was freed from Ash, May had been nothing but a puddle of green goo. But she reformed into a humanoid shape.  She was made out of a thick gelatinous substance that was transparent: you could see right through her.  May still looked like herself minus being made out of goo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May\" said Max.  \"What happened to you?

In this case, I credit it to its original author, former Writing.com member SpeedDemon, whose unfinished story \"The Power of Wishing\" over on VGGTS was an early favourite of mine. This will be SIMILAR to the already-listed Jirachi option further up, but with a different twist, namely that May would gain the ability to grow as big as she wants at will from the Millennium Comet wish and use her power to fight an evil outside force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I'll be making my own additional twist onto that, as the original fic's idea of an invasion by silly-named aliens was...more than a little \"ehh\" (no offence-- it WAS a long time ago). So instead, I'll take the original pitch and merge it with some stuff from ORAS; May would make a wish on a falling star during the Litleonids shower, not knowing that the one she picked was Jirachi, and gets her growth powers just in time to defend against an invasion by Deoxys. We can have it take place in the anime, gameverse, or a hybrid of the two, so you can have Ash, Brendan, or both as her companions/love interest. And this time, there would be actual clothes-ripping/nudity. :P And we'd preserve the original fic's idea of May having been a closet macrophile since she was a little kid-- kudos to Mr. SpeedDemon for that idea, heh. </span></div></div>",

The canyon itself was quite a large one carved by a wide river.  It wasn't particularly a deep canyon.  It was barely half a mile down. <br>\r\n       The town was known for its spring which was hidden....so the name of the city wasn't too imaginative.  It was also known as a popular vacation spot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ash, Misty and Brock were down in the canyon on a dirt road that led to the city of Hidden Springs.  They were less than five miles from the city according to the map that Brock had.  Pikachu was riding on Ash's shoulder.  Misty was lagging a little behind as she was getting tired from all the walking.  <br>\r\n    \"We're almost there\" said Brock. <br>\r\n     \"That's what you said ten minutes ago\" said Misty dryly. <br>\r\n    Ash was about to add his two cents when he spotted a giant footprint.  He stopped short and looked at the print.  It looked like it belonged to somebody that would have been fifty feet tall.  Brock and Misty had also stopped and looked at the large footprint. <br>\r\n    \"That's a big foot\" said Brock.<br>\r\n     \"Fake obviously\" said Misty. <br>\r\n    \"Oh. It isn't fake\" said a feminine voice.  Ash and the others looked around until they spotted a 50 foot tall woman with blue hair.  The woman was standing in the river which barely came to her waist.  The river was perhaps 100 feet away.  The woman was naked and it took the three a moment to recognize who the woman was.  It was clearly an Officer Jenny.  She smiled cheerily at the stunned looks of the three pokemon trainers. As they watched, the giant Jenny stepped out of the river and walked towards them. Ash, Brock and Misty backed off more than a little nervous understandably.<br>\r\n      \"Don't worry\" said Jenny coming right up to the three and looked down at them all. \"I won't hurt you.  I'm still an Officer above all else\" <br>\r\n    \"How did you get to be so tall?\" asked Brock who was ogling the naked officer.<br>\r\n     \"It's the springs in town\" said Jenny.  \"There are two springs in a cave just outside town. One spring will make you grow if you drink from it.....and the other one will shrink you....The more you drink the taller or smaller you become\" <br>\r\n     \"Extraordinary....\" said Ash faintly who couldn't help but oggle Jenny.  Misty glared and bonked Ash and Brock with her handy mallet. <br>\r\n      \"It certainly is\" said Jenny.  \"The town is a popular spot for honeymooners\" <br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

It wasn't particularly a deep canyon. It was barely half a mile down. <br>\r\nThe ruins were pretty newly discovered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur heroes were down in the canyon on a dirt road that led to the archeological site. They were less than 7 miles from the city according to the map that Brock had. Pikachu was riding on Ash's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie, Clemont, and Serena were lagging a little behind as they were getting tired from all the walking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost there\" said Brock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you said ten minutes ago\" said Serena dryly. <br>\r\nAsh was about to add his two cents when he spotted a giant footprint. He stopped short and looked at the print. It looked like it belonged to somebody that would have been over 50 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock, Clemont , Serena and Bonnie had also stopped and looked at the large footprint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one big foot\" said Brock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fake obviously\" said Clemont. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That pun wasn't very funny tho\" said Bonnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth both Bonnie and Serena held curiosity over the footprint for different yet similar reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock glanced at the guide book but decided not to share the words therein<br>\r\n \"Rumor has it There are two hidden springs in 2 separate hidden caves nearby. One spring will make you grow if you drink from it.....and the other one will shrink you....The more you drink the taller or smaller you become. These rumors and legends are as of yet unconfirmed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth they had no idea what had transpired a mere few days before their arrival. Brock shrugged it off still doubtful that there was any grain of truth and suspected the footprint was some elaborate prank or landmark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Brock shrugged it off still doubtful that there was any grain of truth and suspected the footprint was some elaborate prank or landmark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****5 days ago****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young red head girl 4'8 was visiting the nearest town to the ruins. The girls name was Liv.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://m.imgur.com/TwVnolO\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.imgur.com/TwVnolO</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl unfortunately somehow got lost and separated from her friends.<br>\r\nIt had started to rain luckily she'd found a cave or rather a network of impossibly huge caves to seek shelter in. The caves extended far underground. A strange luminous glow lit up the caves and walls dimly but enough to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirsty and hungry she explored the caves.<br>\r\nAs luck would have it she'd found a set of springs down one bath. Oddly the twin springs were a hot springs and a cool lake side by side somehow. Realizing she'd gotten dirty and lacking food she decided on a drink and a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drank a bit of lake water then she undressed and hopped into the hot springs.<br>\r\nShe cleaned herself as best as she could without any proper cleaning supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later she got out. Her thirst quenched earlier and her bath needs met.<br>\r\nAs she stood up she felt strange but the feeling soon passed. Little did she realize she'd just lost 3 inches in height. Her thirst soon returned so she made her way back to the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way the strange feeling came and went again. She'd unknowingly lost another 3 inches. This time she bent down and took a bigger gulp from the lake than earlier. As Liv headed back to her clothing she realized she was still wet and chilled. She let out a sneeze. As she did so she dropped another few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the strange feeling was stronger and lasted longer as Liv walked back towards the hot springs. As she did things started to feel off. As she approached the boulder her clothes were laid out on it started to dawn on her the ceiling seemed further and further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boulder in front of her appeared to be getting larger too. A few \"small\" rocks were scattered on the cave floor near the boulder.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://m.imgur.com/7UtLt09\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.imgur.com/7UtLt09</a><br>\r\nLive looked around shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh what's going on\" she asked stumbling backwards on a previously \"small\" rock.<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later she felt something cool and smooth under her and between her legs.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://m.imgur.com/UfIfNbE\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.imgur.com/UfIfNbE</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/pklewd2015/status/772476300200140800\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/pklewd2015/status/77...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then realized she was straddling a rock that once would have fit in her hand, facing forward as if it were a lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh another boulder? But everything is still getting bigger\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet soon left solid ground as her position on the \"growing boulder\" shifted.<br>\r\nFinally everything stopped growing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young Pokemon Coordinator named Dawn, was prepping for the current contest she was about to perform in. She had made a brand new Poffin. It had a red hue color to it, with a blue spiral. It was made with a rare candy and a few other ingredients. It was truly a odd looking Poffin, but man did they look good. Dawn's Piplup really liked the batch she made before and she had to make sure he didn't eat the all again and get a really bad stomach ache. While Dawn was prepping the final look of her Poffins. Her rival, Ursula was watching from afar. She was a little peeved she had been on a losing streak as of late and decided maybe it was time to even up the score just a little. So while Dawn had her back turned. She walked over to the plate and sprinkled some odd looking dust across the Poffin. She quickly walked away and Dawn didn't even notice the added ingredient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula giggled as she thought of what was going to happen. Apparently the substance she added is suppose to cause a Pokemon to get drowsy. Which would be enough to throw Dawn off and give her a chance to turn her lose streak around. As everyone continued to prep. Dawn's stomach growled and she was pretty hungry. There was nothing nearby except for the Poffin's she made. She wasn't sure, but decided to take one and eat it. The flavor at first was bitter, but quickly turned to sweet. Dawn grabbed her cheeks and blushed by how good it tasted. It was indescribable! I mean she had tried a Poffin before, but they are really more tasty to pokemon. But this one was so good, it was good enough to eat more. But Dawn decided not to, since she needed enough for her pokemon. So she placed them into a jar in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[20 Minutes Later...]  </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Contest was underway and everyone was doing their best. Ursula did pretty well as she thought to herself, \"Oh wow, maybe I don't even need Dawn to lose now, this is great!\" Next up was Dawn she was wearing a pretty dark blue dress with a black apron tie-in and small black hat on her head. She looked like she was wearing alternate costume of Alice from Wonderland. It was really cute on her and this made Ursula very worried and now her only hope was for Dawn's Pokemon to fall asleep. But to Ursula's surprise, her Pokemon didn't even look sleepy! This upset her, that is till she noticed Dawn was starting to get sleepy eyed. Which she thought was odd, but figured. Hey, who ever is getting sleepy will work. Dawn managed to make it for a bit longer before collapsing on stage asleep! When Dawn awoke, she was still on Stage or was she somewhere else?  </span></div></div>",

She had a case of vertigo hit her like a ton of bricks! She was able to keep her stance, but things only continued to worsen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole audience, other contestants, and judges watched in confusion as to what was happening to the blue haired contestant. Then just as Dawn caught her balance, her high-heeled shoes suddenly snapped one after the other and became just regular shoes. Dawn turned her head a looked down to see what that snap noise was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, what's happening!?\" Dawn cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrsula watched in confusion, \"Wait, I thought this would just make her sleepy, but that's not happening! What is happening though?!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis odd performance continued on and it wasn't long till Dawn's skirt was starting to rise up and give everyone a good view underneath. Dawn quickly pulled down her skirt out of embarrassment, but as she pulled down the front of her skirt, she her a loud shreeep noise occur behind her and she pulled back her left arm to feel what that was and she found that the back of her dress had split straight down the center! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH! Wait what the!!\" Dawn cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone continued to watch as the short blue haired 10-year old was appearing to be growing in size and fast! Dawn just grew and grew in size and her outfit was not lasting long. As little by little each piece lost the battle of the growing little girl. With her gloves quickly splitting open completely to reveal her delicate hands and her high-heeled shoes breaking open to reveal her feet and toes. The rest of her outfit was holding on, but it wasn't going to be long as it would too lose this battle of a growing sprout such as Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could do was just stand there and try to keep some modesty as much as possible as this growth showed no signs of slowing down and her outfit was losing quite a bit of space. Dawn just continued to grow and was closing the gap pass 6-foot and still going! Dawn cried out for someone to explain what was happening to her, but everyone was just dumbfounded by this whole thing as Dawn reaches...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dawn then asked if there was anything wrong with her and the female Doctor just said, \"No there is nothing wrong. Although your blood pressure is a little higher than it should be, but you should be fine.\" Dawn sighed a expressed relief, but noticed her forehead hurt a little. The female Doctor cringed and then replied, \"Yeah... and that fresh bruise. But other that, you are okay. Just keep on resting and you'll be good as new.\" Dawn nodded and sat back in her hospital bed. She was a little upset that she had to forfeit the contest, but was glad none the less she was okay. But just as she was about to relax, she couldn't help but feel like her back was arched the wrong way. So she corrects her position in the bed and finds it pretty hard. \"What is going on?\" Dawn asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she is doing this, someone walks in and knocks on the open door. Dawn looks up and sees it's none other than Ursula! \"He-hey Dawn, are you doing alright?\" Ursula asked. Dawn cracked a smile and said she was. Dawn was shocked to see Ursula visiting, but even more shocked she was being nice to her! Ursula sat next to Dawn in the chair provided for visitors. Dawn talked with Ursula and then just remembered the new Poffin she made for the contest and didn't want them to go to waste. \"Hey Ursula, would you like to one of my Poffins I made? They are really good and I don't want them to go to waste.\" Dawn offered. Ursula faked smiled and said sure. But she knew what she had put on them and figured she had two choices. Either fake eating one or eating one and getting the heck out of there before Dawn could possibly figure out what had happen. So Ursula... </span></div></div>",

Soon Dawn's hospital gown was starting to pull tightly across her whole frame which was a little oversized before all of this.

It was a memory being played over in Dawn's mind...the time when she, Ash and Brock had helped saved the Lake Trio from Team Galactic.  But why was she having a dream about an event that had happened years ago?    Dawn thought back.  Ash, Brock and herself were riding in Cynthia's SUV when the Three had teleported them right into Team Galactic's HQ.   In her dream she had heard the Three legendary pokemon talking to each other....when they had decided to teleport Ash, Brock and Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          Dawn was lying in bed in her house in Twinleaf Town.  After all these years, the memory of saving the Three Lake Pokemon was still fresh in her mind.  It was like it had happened yesterday.  Dawn looked out of the window and saw it was mid-morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Dawn!\" came her mother's voice from downstairs.   \"shouldn't you be off to meet your old friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Ah, crap!\" yelled out Dawn.   \"that's right!  I totally forgot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       Dawn had found that Ash and Brock were in Sinnoh a few days ago.  Ash had called Dawn just yesterday to let her know.  He explained that he had been having a dream about the Lake Guardian that he had bonded with--Azelf--that told him to return to Sinnoh.  Brock, at the same time, had been dreaming about Uxie--the Lake Guardian that had bonded with him--and Uxie had told Brock to return to Sinnoh also.   At the time Dawn hadn't been dreaming about Mespirit...but on this morning she had dreamed about the Three, not just Mespirit.  Ash, Brock and Dawn were to meet in front of the Pokemon Center in Twinleaf Town.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Dawn jumped out of bed and put on her usual outfit.  She ran down the stairs and waved a goodbye to her mother and headed off to meet her two old friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   When Dawn had arrived at the Pokemon Center on her bike, there was Ash and Brock waiting for her.  The three friends greeted each other warmly and after a bit of talking, they each decided to have breakfast at a near restaurant.  The three talked things over breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"So why do you think that those Lake Guardians called us back to Sinnoh?\" asked Brock.  \"They're not in trouble again, are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"I doubt it\" said Ash.   \"No, I was under the impression that each of the Three would like to give us some kind of reward for saving them. Azelf told me so.....well..perhaps not flat-out said it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"After all these years?\" asked Dawn.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           \"The Three spent those years bickering about what kind of reward\" said Brock.   \"Uxie told me all about that.  Rather forcefully I might add\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Couldn't they have given our rewards anyway?\" asked Dawn.  \"without contacting the three of us or bringing us back together?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           \"Kanto is probably too far away\" said Ash.   \"even those Three have limits\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"Pika\" chimed in Pikachu who was sitting on Ash's shoulder as usual.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"So...do we go to the lakes?\" asked Dawn.   \"or what?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                         \"Going to the lakes sounds like a fine idea!\" said Ash.  \"....uhh...which lake is closer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         Brock whipped out a map and looked over it.  \"Lake Verity.  It's right outside town\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"Isn't that the home of Mespirit?\" asked Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                               \"Yeah..\" said Dawn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             <br>\r\n                </span></div></div>",

She was feeling so upbeat and confident for some reason, she didn't know why, but it was amazing!! The Pokemon Coordinator next in line went on as Dawn awaited her turn to act. The crowd was fired up after the Girl was finishing up her act and this made Dawn a tad worried, since it was going to be a challenge to keep this excitement level up. But after a little pep talk from her good and trusted partner, Piplup. Dawn smiled and knew she could do this, she has made it this far and there was no going back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrrrrrrrright! Everyone, our next and Final performance of the day, let's give a very warm welcome to Dawn!\" the announcer echoed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn took her first few steps and waved to everyone. As she did this, she saw Ash and Brock in the stands above and May was giving her a thumbs up from the line-up. Dawn smiled and knew she couldn't lose. She sent out Mamoswine and Piplup for her performance. It went off great as she matched brute strength of her Mamoswine and the soft dance of Piplup. The crowd was just loving it and so were the judges. Dawn had one last move she had been thinking of trying, but was unsure if she could pull it off. But you wouldn't know till she tried. \"Alright, let's do this you two. Are you both ready?\" Dawn questioned her pokemon. They both nodded in agreement. Dawn smiled and then commanded for Piplup to start spinning on his tippy toe with his beak aiming straight in the air. Piplup did this, while Dawn had her Mamoswine use a mild sized Icicle Crash up into the air above Piplup. Mamoswine created this Icicle and after it formed, it fell straight down toward Piplup and landed on his beak! But to everyone's surprise, Piplup was able to hold it up... well sort of. Then Dawn commanded Mamoswine to then use Powder Snow on the very top and to continue spraying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMamoswine nodded and unleased a stream of Powder Snow on the top of the Icicle. As this was happening, Dawn then commanded Piplup to spin as fast as he could! Piplup heard the command and did just that. When he did however, the powdered snow that was resting on top of it already, began to spin and twirl above and around the stage, with a steady stream still hitting it, caused the stage to become a beautiful snow wonderland. Everyone was just simply amazed by this performance. Then Dawn took in a deep breath and went for the final part of her Performance. \"Now Piplup, launch it into the air and Mamoswine, crash through it!\" Dawn commanded. Piplup leaped up to launch the Icicle into the air, with Mamoswine rushing forward and then a mild leap into the air to crash through it. Leaving a beautiful icy rainbow behind him. After they both landed back on stage, the crowd just up roared, including the other contestants. The judges clapped and looked at each other. After the contest was over and they went on to picking who wins. It was decided that the obvious choice was... Dawn! Dawn and May held hands as they both jumped for joy. May congratulated her on her win and Dawn walked over to claim her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the contest was over, Dawn was changing out of her outfit as she heard a knock at her door. She walked over to see who it was and it was a older woman in a business suit. \"May I help you?\" Dawn asked. The lady smiled and was...  </span></div></div>",

The Zoroark was well-hidden from view.  The lone human that was approaching was at least nineteen years old--or maybe even in his late 20's.  Zoroark had a hard time telling a human's age by sight.  The point was that the human was young but not too young.   The human was wearing jeans along with a dark red shirt and a wide-brimmed hat.  He had handsome features.  He was also pretty buff like he had spent most of the time at a gym--a real gym and not a Pokemon Gym.    The Zoroark watched in silence as the human came ever closer.  Then the Zoroark noticed that the young human had pokeballs on his belt....which meant he was a trainer.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                               \"[Here comes another human in our midst]\" said a rich female voice in Zoroark's head.  The Zoroark looked around until she saw her partner-in-crime.  A Delphox was a rare sight in the Sinnoh region but not completely unheard of.  The Delphox walked up right next to the Zoroark and the pair watched silently as the human entered the forest some 100 feet away from the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             \"[Don't scare him off]\" said the Delphox, speaking via telepathy to the Zoroark.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                             The Zoroark threw the Delphox a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                            \"[At least, not yet]\" said the Delphox.  \"[I sense that he isn't as bad as the last human that wandered into our forest]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                            \"[That last human was a bad one]\" said Zoroark through telepathy.  \"[what makes <i>this</i> human different?]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"[I sensed he has a kind heart towards all pokemon]\" said the Delphox.  \"[...and that he comes from the Kalos region.....]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           \"[So what's the plan?  Do we let him.....stay?]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"[You wanted human companionship didn't you?]\" asked Delphox.   \"[let's play this by ear for now]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          <i>One Month later.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Man, it's great to be back\" said Ash Ketchum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 Ash, Dawn and Brock were reunited once again in the Sinnoh region.  Ash had heard something about a forest of illusions that had suddenly appeared in the Sinnoh region about two months back.   A total of ten trainers had tried to investigate the mysterious forest but they had all come back half-crazy save for one trainer that didn't return.  The trainers that did come back talked about meeting up with a dark-skinned pokemon that could create all kinds of realistic illusions.  Ash wanted to catch a pokemon like that....it would be cool to own a pokemon that could create illusions.    <br>\r\n                   Dawn had heard about the forest of illusions also and so did Brock.  <br>\r\n                   The three friends had met up in Floaroma Town which was somewhat close to the forest of illusions.  <br>\r\n                  \"Pika pi pika chu\" chimed in Pikachu who was on Ash's shoulder.<br>\r\n                   \"Piplup pi pip\" said Piplup.<br>\r\n                  \"So nobody knows where this mysterious forest came from then?\" asked Brock. <br>\r\n                     \"Nope\" said Dawn.  \"one day the forest wasn't there....and then, poof, the forest was suddenly there like it was there all along\"<br>\r\n                     \"The nine trainers that came back were all half-crazy\" said Ash.  \"said that there's a pokemon there that could create illusions....\"<br>\r\n                    \"Sounds like Zoroark\" said Brock thoughtfully.  <br>\r\n                   \"I wonder if that's the same one we saw in Crown City\" said Ash.<br>\r\n                    \"I doubt it\" said Dawn.  \"there's probably a million Zoroark in the world\"<br>\r\n                    \"Well then\" said Brock.  \"should we go and investigate this forest of illusions?\"<br>\r\n                    \"I'm all for it\" said  Dawn.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Things were pretty much average as the gang was traveling to their next destination. However, Iris was getting a little board with all the same old, same old, feeling. As nothing had been happening for a while now and heck! Not even a show up from Team Rocket! So things have been pretty bland to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon our heroes arrived at an odd location in Unova, it was a super massive water and theme park! Iris's eyes quickly became delighted and she ran down the hill. Ash was a little confused, but Cilan explained that he had heard about a water/theme park opening up just recently around theses parts. Ash became super delighted and rushed down the hill behind Iris. Cilan chuckled and decided to follow suit, though he didn't run like the other two did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the park, the ticket booth clerk asked for how many and gave them three tickets as they answered three. All three rushed inside and boy was it packed and there was just so much of everything everywhere! From huge slides, massive coasters, you name it! Iris was so excited as she didn't know which one she wanted to try as Ash was doing the same and Iris then made the comment, \"Ash your such a kid...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh frowned slightly at that, but that didn't stomp out his  enthusiasm. Everyone picked there own ride, with Ash and Iris going to the same one. Though they needed to change first and they did. Ash wore some blue trunks with black and yellow strikes on the sides, Iris wore a purple one-piece swimsuit with some flower d\u00e9cors all over it, and Cilan wore a green trunk shorts with a single white strike across one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Ash and Iris went on to one of the bigger rides, the attendant stopped Iris, \"I'm sorry little one, you can't enter this ride...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one you look too young and secondly, you are just under the height requirement... so it's no go on this ride for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are the kid really Iris.\" Cilan mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris grew upset and walked up with anger. Though Cilan was just teasing her about how she is always calling Ash a kid. Iris walked to the deep end of the park and seemed a bit bummed out. As that was one of the rides she really wanted to try first. So she sat on a bench and tried to calm down enough and think of what ride she could try. That was when she noticed something sitting in between a small spacing in the wall. She stepped up to it and pulled it out. It appeared that when they built this place, this thing was built into it. Iris explained this oddly shaped gold item with a blue sapphire in the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glided her fingers lightly across the gem as it suddenly grew bright and shot a beam of light into the air and then something fell near a bush beside the bench. Iris was startled by this and didn't know what she had just done. But then suddenly a odd Pokemon floated softly out of the bushes and it yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris walked up to it and asked if it was a Pokemon and to her surprise it talked! As it spoke to her and told her it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-wait, you can talk! But Pokemon can't talk!\" Iris cried out in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actual can't talk, but I am speaking to you telepathically. So what is the wish you like for me, Jirachi to grant?\" Jirachi asked in a soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris paused and then realized what this Pokemon just asked, \"Wait you can grant me wishes?!\" Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Legendary Pokemon nodded, but added it could only grant one. Iris dropped her shoulders as she was hoping for one of those times when you get three wishes and what not, but a real wish is a wish after all she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can really grant me a wish right?\" Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi nodded, \"Yes, just one however and then I go back to sleep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris paused, \"Okay, so just one... but what?\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a quick thought came to mind, \"Oh wait! I know what I would like to wish for! Jirachi I wish to be taller!\" Iris wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi paused, \"Oh, okay... well are you sure?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris nodded, \"YES, just please grant me my wish to be taller. Then I can really show everyone who are the kids.\" Iris giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi shrugged, \"Okay then... well you wish is granted and good night.\" Jirachi said just before yawning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beam of light appeared and the legendary Pokemon disappeared once again. Iris smiled, but quickly frowned. \"Hey! Why am I still the same height?!\" Iris said while checking herself. She buffed her cheeks and grew really upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I was tricked! I mean even if I grew just an inch would have been great...\" Iris said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was nothing she could do and she decided to walk to a nearby concession. But while she did this, she was slowly starting to change? Though unknown to Iris, she should have worded her wish a LOT better. But she was going to find that out quite soon enough.</span></div></div>",

Before Serena or Bonnie realized what had happen. The movie was purchased and was starting. \"Huh? Wait what happen?\" Bonnie asked as the TV screen went black. Serena was puzzled too as the last thing she saw was a purchase confirmation title. Soon the movie started, with a deep voice narrating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"What happens when a experimental machine accidently causes a young Pokemon Trainer to change drastically?\"  </b></i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena's eye brow rose as the narration continued, while Bonnie was totally glued to every word as her eyes grew with concentration. Then they could hear some loud foot steps drawing closer and louder as the narration went silent. Then a loud, \"BOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM\" The screen goes silent and then a title explodes across the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Attack.. Of...The... 50ft... POKEMON TRAINER! </b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"></font>ATTACK OF THE 50FT POKEMON TRAINER!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whhhhaaaaa? What is this?!\" Serena shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, this looks so cool! Can we please watch it Serena, pretty please!\" Bonnie pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena still had a shocked looked on her face, but figured. Well it was bought, so they might as well. She just hoped Ash and Clemont wouldn't be back before it was over though. So Serena said they could and this caused Bonnie to jump for joy. She grabbed the remote and turned the volume up on it. The movie started off on a peaceful day and when it showed the main character, both Serena and Bonnie were shocked to see the main character of the movie looked a lot like Serena! Only with light blue hair instead of honey blonde hair. \"He-hey, she looks like you Serena!\" Bonnie cried out. Serena heard this and grew a little embarrassed, but didn't say anything in response to what Bonnie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the movie was playing, the main character spoke, \"Hi, my name is Aneres and I was a normal little girl until that day I went and visited my friend's house that is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie progressed, things only grew weirder and weirder as the movie continued. Soon it was getting to the main point and the look-a-like Serena in the movie, who name was Aneres. Entered into a attic in her friend's house. Her friend had a little sister that liked to play hide and seek. So she went up there to see if she was hiding up there. But what she found instead was a strange tri-pod with a long ray-gun on top of it. She walked up to it and started to mess with it. It lite up with a bunch of colors and then started to hum. \"How odd, what is this thing?\" Aneres asked herself. But then suddenly, someone popped out from some boxes and startled her as she fell onto her butt. \"Ouch, that really hurt!\" Aneres said with pain as she rubbed her butt. The person who popped up was the little sister of her friend and she was giggling from what she did. Aneres didn't think it was so funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the little sister came into view, Serena and Bonnie were both shocked again to now see a Bonnie look-a-like! Although, again, she had a different hair color and this time different eye color as well. Her hair was dark red and her eyes were green and her name was Annie! Bonnie's interest only grew after this revelation, while the exact opposite was happening to Serena as this movie was getting freaky. It wasn't long till the main plot of the story finally happened as Annie ran over to the machine and started to punch a bunch of buttons. \"Oh wowwe, the buttons are so pretty!\" Annie said with joy. Aneres grew worried and asked politely for Annie to stop messing with the machine. But she ignorantly ignored her. She continued to smash buttons till the machine suddenly propped up, took aim, and then zapped Aneres! Serena grew worried as to what may happen next, since the title had her worried, while Bonnie couldn't be more glued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine shut-down and started to hum quieter. Annie had realized what she had down and freaked out. \"Oopps, I am so sorry Aneres! I wasn't paying attention. Ar-are you arlight?\" Annie asked with a worried tone. Aneres replied she was fine, that is... till she suddenly felt a jolt inside her. She lifted her hands up to only witness them enlarge! Annie stepped back with a shocked expression. Then the next to happen, Aneres suddenly grew overall in a big spurt. \"Wha--wha-what's happening to me?!\" Aneres asked with fear in her voice. Annie couldn't respond to what she was seeing. Serena watched in horror as this look-a-like grew taller and taller in the movie! Her clothes quickly grew tightly across her whole body and the stitching was breaking piece by piece all across. First her shoes popped open to reveal two growing toes ripping apart the front of her shoes. While her shirt quickly rose up revealing her belly button and soon enough the bottom of her breasts. She continued to expand and expand in size until the front of her shirt spilt down the middle to reveal her bare chest! Serena grew embarrassed seeing this and shielded Bonnie's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what kind of movie is this?!\" Serena cried out while she was trying to pause it. After finding the remote, she paused the movie and told Bonnie they weren't going continue watching this and they weren't going to tell Ash or Clemont about this. Bonnie pouted, but sat on the couch with a upset tone. Serena decided to get a shower since she felt so frazzled. But when Serena left to get a shower, Bonnie waited and decided to watch the rest of the movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does this go from here?</span></div></div>",

She didn't understand why and Bonnie couldn't stand it when her older brother would do the same thing. So Bonnie made up her mind and wanted to watch the rest of the movie. It wouldn't take too long, since she knew Serena took a long time in the shower and just getting ready in general. Bonnie did wonder what all Serena did while getting ready, but the interest in the movie was weighing heavily on her mind. So when she heard the bathroom door close and the shower cut on. She quickly grabbed the remote and found the movie on the menu list. She pressed the resume button and it quickly started right when Serena cut it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Serena look a like continued to expand into a great size. It wasn't long before the girl in the movie was soon towering well over all the boxes in the attic and soon her head bashed against the attic's ceiling. She fell down to her butt and caused a massive crack to form around her as her growing figure weighed heavily against the attic flooring. \"Oh my God! What is happening to me?! Annie do something!\" Aneres cried out. But Annie didn't know what she could do, she tried getting the machine to reactivate, but it seemed to be a sort of rest mode or recharging mode. The girl continued to increase in size and soon she was starting to become quite cramped inside the attic room! She pressed her hands against the ceiling as she attempted to free herself some space, but her mass was just too big! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie was growing a little worried and started to yell at Annie to get out of the house. But when Bonnie did this, she quickly covered her mouth and remembered Serena maybe taking a shower, but she needs to keep her voice down. Bonnie got concerned and decided to turn the volume down a little to insure Serena couldn't hear. But after that, Bonnie watched with extreme worry as to what was going to happen to the little girl Annie and what was to happen to Aneres. In the movie, Annie noticed she was showing no sigh of stopping in growth and quickly decided to leave. Annie squeezed under Aneres's left leg and slipped out of the attic. Bonnie cheered her on, but back in the movie. Annie stood in the hallway and heard a loud creaking noise growing louder and louder! Annie paused as she started to see some small cracks appearing across the hallway ceiling. When suddenly! Aneres came crashing through and landed her huge body between the narrow hallway. Annie screamed as she was startled and caught off guard. However as this happen in the movie, this caused Bonnie to scream too since she was startled too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena heard Bonnie scream, \"Hey Bonnie are you alright in there?\" Serena questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie paused and stuttered, \"Uummm, Oh yeah! Yeah I am Serena, I just thought I saw a Rattata is all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright then.\" Serena replied as she closed the bathroom door and stepped back into her shower. Bonnie let out a huge sigh of relief while she thought to herself, \"Whew, that was close, I need to be more careful!\" Bonnie continued to watch the movie and the character Annie ran down the stairs and out of the house. As she stood out in the front yard. She could feel and hear the whole house rumbling louder and louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha! No way!\" Bonnie cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in the movie, a loud BBOOOOOOOOOOM! Aneres's suddenly exploded out of Annie's house and was growing at a even faster rate. She continued to grow and grow in size, till she reached and topped at 50ft tall!! Bonnie just stared blankly at the screen and couldn't process what she was seeing. She was so huge, I mean really huge! The movie character finally realized she was done growing and totally freaked out as she realized she was now in the buff! Bonnie blushed slightly, even though she was a girl, but for some reason this was embarrassing to her. As the movie continued, Bonnie saw how being so big would really suck and worried if that were to ever happen to her or Serena, that would be scary. But her worries only grew worse as the movie Character Annie went back to her home and found the tri-pod gun... Bonnie grew nervous as she continued to watch and kept whispering to herself, \"Don't do it, don't do it.\" But the movie character touched it! But before Bonnie could watch the rest, she heard Serena stepping out of the bathroom! Bonnie freaked out and turned off the tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena stepped over to where Bonnie was and asked if she was hungry. Bonnie grew a huge smile and said, \"Yeah! I'm starving!\" while rubbing her stomach. So the two walked over to Serena's backpack and handed some stuff over to Bonnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What causes Serena and or Bonnie to grow?</b></span></div></div>",

She ate her food with pure delight and was calmed down greatly from the movie, even though she was curious as to what happen to Annie... But Bonnie figured she would watch the rest later tonight when Serena and the rest where in bed perhaps. As she ate hear meal, Bonnie decided to explore the rest of the room and upon going into the hallway, she had noticed a small door on the ceiling above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie paused and stared at it, \"Huh? Is that a door?\" Bonnie asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Serena suddenly walked up behind her and asked what she was staring at. This startled Bonnie slightly, but she then replied to Serena, \"I'm looking at that strange door on the ceiling there. Where does it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena scratched her head with a confused expression, \"Huh... I'm not sure, do you want to check it out?\" Serena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Bonnie felt they should just leave the above room alone, but the little kid in her was like, \"LET\"S GO, LET\"S GO!!!\" So Bonnie's child heart won this thought battle. Though in all honesty, should have listened to her gut.... Serena got a step stool and pulled on the string to pull the ladder out. It laid softly against the floor and the two went up the steps and into the attic. Upon arriving, it was pretty dark and boy was it dusty! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena whipped her hand to clear the air in front of her as she looked for a light switch of a draw cord. While she did this, Bonnie could be heard lightly coughing in the back. It took a few seconds, but Serena managed to find a draw cord and she pulled it. A light came on, but it flickered often. Which was even more evidence that this place hadn't seen a living thing up here in some time. Serena coughed a few times now herself and as she scanned the attic, all she could see was boxes and boxes of random stuff. But tucked in the corner of the attic, behind some boxes, was something shiny poking out between them. Serena decided to go and investigate it, while Bonnie did a little exploring of her own. As Serena moved some boxes out of the way, she found something quite interesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie however only found dusty boxes, dusty boxes, and for a change of pace, a large dusty empty box... Bonnie was getting covered in a lot of dust, then she had heard Serena calling her over. Bonnie let out a cute cough from all the dust she kicked up and walked over to Serena. But as she did... she was shocked to see why Serena had called her over. Standing before them was a almost look a like tri-pod ray gun machine!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena giggled a little, \"Oh my Gosh! Doesn't this look really familiar Bonnie?\" Serena giggle again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Bonnie was laughing, in fact she was a little worried. But of course this is coming from a little girl's mindset. So it was understandable that any kid as young as her going through a similar experience would be a least a little bugged out. Serena started messing with it and some how turned it on! But it was so quite, neither of them noticed. Serena then decided to point it at Bonnie and made a joke, \"Hey Bonnie, I'm going to make you really tall!\" Serena giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie cried out, \"NOO! Please don't!\" and she then ran out of the attic. Serena called out to Bonnie to come back, but it was too late. Serena left the machine behind and as she stepped in front of it and walked towards the attic trapdoor entrance. But unknowingly to her... the machine had came on and was slowly pulsing into her, un-seeable rays into her young body! Serena left the attic and folded  back up the ladder into the attic. Serena went looking for Bonnie and when she did find her, she found her to be upset. Serena felt bad now and tried to explain to Bonnie that it was just a joke and that type of stuff is only in the movies. This cheered Bonnie up a little, but she was still a little upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on with really nothing eventful and soon it was nightfall. Ash and Clemont had finally returned from where they were all day and when they asked what Serena and Bonnie did today, they both agreed to not explain any of it. As night drew in deeper and everyone was asleep, while everyone but Bonnie. As she was very curious to how the movie end, so she quietly got out of bed and snuck down the hallway and into the living room. She turned the TV on and found the movie was left exactly where it was left off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Next? </b></span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, as Bonnie was attempting to watch the last part of the movie. Serena was fast asleep and something was happening... fast! Serena was on her back in a pair of pink PJs. But as she slept, the bed started to shift very slightly all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena turned onto her side and this noise continued. Slowly her bed sheets began to move as her overall body started to increase in size! It was slow and steady, but didn't take too long to start becoming noticeable. Serena moved to the other side again, as if she was becoming uncomfortable. Was it because she was growing or was she having a nightmare? Which one it was would be difficult to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as Bonnie continued to watch the rest of the movie, Serena was still growing and growing in mass. Soon her pink PJs were starting to shift a whole lot as her overall size was passing normal size for a 10-year old girl and reaching more along the lines of a teenage girl instead!  Her pant's legs slowly glided up her smooth legs and as they neared her knees, they hit a snag and began to slowly tear apart as they continued to be pull further and further up her legs. While this was going on down there, her upper body was getting the exact same treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sleeves pulled pasted her wrist and as they passed her elbows, the same issue that happen with her pants started to do the same. But nearly as bad as her forearms were far more slender than her legs and thighs were. But they were getting tight. The next thing to occur was Serena's buttoned up front started to space further and further away from each other as her torso was widening and stretching in length. While her bust remained the same size. It didn't matter much as her overall size was going to be too much growing anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her clothes continued to tighten and in some places rip, Serena was suddenly awoken to a shout coming from Bonnie. Serena quickly sat up and left her room to just catch Bonnie leaping for the trapdoor string. Serena stood there still half awake and asked Bonnie what happen. But Bonnie just panicked and requested Serena grab the string quick. So still half awake and not understanding what was happening. Serena grabbed the string cord and pulled the trapdoor to the attic down and Bonnie nearly tripped over her own feet trying to get up to the attic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on Bonnie?\" Serena asked as quite as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-we need to make sure this thing doesn't come on and zaps one of us!\" Bonnie said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena quickly ran up the attic drop door stairs and placed a finger over her lips, \"Sshhhhh! Bonnie, Ash and Clemont are trying to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie ignored Serena as she stood in front of the tri-pod gun trying to figure out how to insure it doesn't get turned on and cause either Serena or her to go through a giant growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Which one occurs? Does Bonnie get a dose of the ray as she stands in front of it and will start to grow just like Serena or will Bonnie be lucky and avoid it like in the movie, but to only have what happen in the movie happen right now?   </b></span></div></div>",

Serena had stepped all the way into the attic and was starting to not feel so well. Bonnie continued to mess with the tri-pod as Serena's condition continued to worsen. Bonnie wasn't paying attention, till she heard a moan come out of Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to face Serena and saw she was hunched over in some mild pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ar-are you alright Serena?\" Bonnie asked with a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena sat on a plastic box to rest her legs as she held her face. Bonnie stepped up closer and could see Serena was sweating quite a bit. As Bonnie raised her hand and extended her arm to Serena, it was then she noticed something happening! Bonnie wasn't sure at first, but it wasn't long till she began to realize Serena's night clothes looked all a bit tighter!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that could be, Bonnie thought to herself. But soon enough, Bonnie got her answer and at the same time her worst fears were coming true right before her very eyes! Serena's clothes continued to stretch slowly and tighten more across her whole body! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie slowly backed up as Serena slowly looked up and saw a petrified expression on Bonnie's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what... is it Bonnie? Wha-wha-what's wrong?\" Serena struggled to say as she felt so strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be, is-is Serena really growing!?\" Bonnie thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena then pulled away her hands and stared at both of them as they started to tingle... as she stared at them, her expression went to complete shock as they both suddenly enlarged a great deal! Serena's eyes quickly opened wide as she darted her head left to right as she cried out,  \"Huh, wait? What's going on!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie only grew more scared as it was quickly becoming apparent Serena was growing in size and quick! Her nightshirt was starting to rise up now, which began to reveal her belly button. The spacing between her buttons only grew wider and began to expose more skin behind it all, Serena then cried out, \"WHA-what's happening to my nightshirt!?\" as she pulled on it to keep it from spacing any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with all this tugging from both ends, Serena and Bonnie heard this loud, 'SHHHHRRRRIIIIIIIP!' Serena felt this and tried to turn her head to see where that noise came from, but as she could feel this could draft hitting her back, she had a pretty good idea to what that noise may have been. As Serena struggled to keep her clothes from taking away her modesty, she just continued to grow, grow, and GROW. Her clothes were tight fitting before all this in the attic, but were not ripping at the vary seams and threating to show off some very young skin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena looked up at towards Bonnie and plead, \"Bonnie, get Clemont! Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie stood there in fear and wasn't sure she could move. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess I'll just take this over to that group that has the gym leader with them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she grabbed the hexed macaroon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later she arrived at Ash's table with a few plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok sorry for the wait. For the adorable little girl we have a deluxe pink delight\" said the waitress giving Bonnie's the hexed treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the Pok\u00e9mon we have the Pok\u00e9Roon platter. For the gym leader we have this. For the showcase finalist we have a smoothie and a delight parfait. Lastly for the Kalos league finalist we have a club sandwich and a mini macaron sampler. Enjoy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds of the waitress departing Bonnie eyed the hexed desert.<br>\r\n\"Aww it looks kinda small\" <br>\r\nWith that she ate the thing fairly fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy but I'm still hungry\" complained Bonnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't want you spoiling your appetite but you are a growing girl so I'll share with you\" said Clemont.<br>\r\nHe then gave her 1 of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did either of them know that Bonnie's 1st one was hexed.<br>\r\nNor were they aware that the hex would transfer to Bonnie herself or that because it was originally intended for deserts the 2nd one she ate would become hexed too making her twice hexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon finished.<br>\r\nThe Hex Girl finally got up and noticed her desert was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey waitress what happened to my Macaron\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry your order seemed to be someone else so I gave it to that person. In fact the group seems to be leaving. It's the group with the adorable little girl there\"<br>\r\nShe said pointing to the group that was walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? Do you have any idea what you might've just done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hex Girl was about to take off when an officer Jenny approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss please calm down. I was called here for a commotion and a theft but I also noticed you're disturbing the peace and trying to run out on your tab\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Bonnie as of yet seemed unaffected.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was so hot that an egg would boil on the parched grass along the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur  heroes were in a harsh Kalosian desert area. They had been hiking for some time when they finally happened upon a farm slash ranch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gruff stern looking man was tending to some ground near some berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well howdy there strangers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group couldn't believe that he seemed so unbothered by the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Need water Clemont\" whined Bonnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it y'all are city folk\" said the man.<br>\r\n\"Well if y'all wanna rest and wet your whistle you're welcome to do so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he grabbed Ash, Serena and Clemont a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry youngin I ran out of drinks out here but while your friends rest in the shade you're free to grab what you like in the house\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie nodded and made her way into the house. Inside she saw interesting decor.<br>\r\nWithin moments she happened upon a shelf.<br>\r\nOn it was a few boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie opened the closet box to her. She saw bottles galore. She selected 2 bottles as she was quite thirsty, opened 1 and took a drink without looking at the label. What entered her mouth was certainly not water but a sweet tasting liquid that tasted just like candy. <br>\r\nIt was also oddly cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Mmm yummy\" said Bonnie. She quickly drank the 1st bottle. She made her way outside started on the 2nd which was identical to the 1st.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie stepped onto the porch gulping down the last of the 2nd bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was about to ask what the drink was when she glanced at the labels: <br>\r\n <b><i>Berry Plentiful Garden Jumbo Gro.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth had under the writing the same pictures.<br>\r\nA normal sized Berry, then one 2x its size then one 3x that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh that was plant food?\" Questioned Bonnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a berry rancher and farmer in case you hadn't noticed youngin\" said the man. \"I use a special type of plant food----say, you didn't drank that stuff did you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea for plant food it was amazingly delicious\" said Bonnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh that's not good\" said the man nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonnie what were you thinking? What's going to happen to my sister\" panicked Clemont.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hopefully nothing but truth be told I've only tested it on my berries and veggies.

Can you stay out while I grab a new bar\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie nodded.<br>\r\nMoments later after Serena left a girl approached Bonnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there runt. I couldn't help but hear you'd like to be bigger\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie looked at this girl and was in awe.<br>\r\nShe looked like Serena but with red hair , even better skin , mysterious silver eyes and most notably was very tall for a girl Serena's age and even slightly tall were she a grown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you're even taller than Serena! I'm so jealous\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl grinned.<br>\r\n\"I'll take that reply as a yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I'd do just about anything to be as big as big sister Serena or you miss! You're both so amazing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I have a little gift for you. Make sure you keep it safe and only use it on yourself\"<br>\r\nWith that the girl gave Bonnie a unique and large bar of soap in a wrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie was about to thank the girl when she vanished.<br>\r\nShe looked at the label.<br>\r\n<i>Super Suds Super Nutrient Soap, guaranteed to make the User grow healthier and feel better with each use and each rinse. Caution DO NOT Ingest and avoid excessive contact with liquids within 3 hours of each use.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie was admittedly curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened it and lathered herself up.<br>\r\nShe felt odd tingles run through her body and felt oddly good and energized.<br>\r\nThe feelings stopped within seconds of her rinsing the suds off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this soap really does feel good. From now on I'll have to clean myself and use it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to feel good again she lathered up again.<br>\r\nThe tingles and feelings returned.<br>\r\nShe rinsed and repeated a few times before Serena returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I found more soap but there's not enough for 2 of us\" said Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries this kind girl gave me some\" said Bonnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well then would you like me to finish\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks big sis in fact if I'm ever going to grow up I'd like to start doing my own bathing from now own\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that's very mature of you Bonnie! You're growing up into a good young lady already\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Bonnie does one last lather and rinse with the soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls finish their bath.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In Saffron City Gym, it had been less busy season with the trainers. Sabrina was residing by her desk, having taken care of the more mundane paperwork required regularily from a Gym Leader. Yes, not something really shown, often because it is simply boring to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she has always taken pleasure of her position, challenging the trainers to duel against psychic types and learn what works best against the type. That was one of the important points about different gyms specializing in different types. No matter how much a trainer would be intending to specialize in certain types, they would have to at least learn the basics and that includes becoming familiar with the pokemon types out there. This would softly force them to train at least one or two pokemons strong against certain types so they will not be caught too offguard when things would get serious. And thus, become better trainers in general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what was burdening Sabrina at the time was less involved with pokemon and more about the other big thing in her life. Being a psychic. She was a real deal, able to match and exceed most psychic type pokemon with what she can do, from similar things to the techniques they use to... something different. She has been known to be able to shrink down people, perhaps through molecular rearrangement or some other means. Would perhaps be too complex to explain without it looking like pulling something out of one's arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there is people who doubt psychics are real, whether because the ones getting in news or heard about in contests turn out to be fakes, only aided by their pokemon... or they are just people taking advantage out of gullible people. It can be argued that such uncertainty can be an advantage to keep people away from bothering psychics, though she did get frustrated whenever people specialized in busting hoaxes and supernatural phenomenon would appear. Seriously, nitpickers raise their ugly smug heads even when you have ghost pokemon messing up conceptions about afterlife or you get the occasional possible alien pokemon if what is told of such creatures as Deoxys is of any indication. Those people could be annoying with their nosy attitudes and not believing even the most obvious signs of her about to prove her powers on their sorry asses. And sometimes she did. Such satisfying moments, seeing them squirm or trying to futilely argue that her towering over them was just a hallucination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, she'd not do any permanent damage on them, just a trauma at most, hopefully making them stop being such annoying little fu-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Then she came to what she had been also frustrated about. She knew her psychic powers were immense. But how immense? Has she ever really pushed her abilities to their extend or what her limits were... no, she didn't have any ideas of world domination or anything. She was... just feeling impotent. Feeling like she's confined within a box too small, not really being able to stretch out, not without breaking things like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... More the reason that she had to really finally do something about it. Making sure no one was looking, she stretched and let out a long groan or yell to relieve herself a bit. Get some clarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, looking upon a spoon on the table. Bending it was really one of the first things she did, that was child's play. Literally... but what if she tried something else to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down on it... then with little effort, she shrank it down. That was not a problem. Then she made it resume in size... and then made it grow bigger... and bigger... then it was the size of an oar when she snapped out of it. With a doll on a shelf sitting down, almost as if in looking down at what she was doing, Sabrina examined the spoon. It was feeling the same. With its structure having been adjusted within so that it did not collapse under its weight. Not even if it was made much much bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps... she could do the same on a living being... or maybe even herself...</span></div></div>",

After all, she has been held off by herself so long. Either way, she was not going to hold back any more. She was going to let herself loose. Hard. That thought set such a wide satisfied grin on herself. She can't remember when she was this excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd probably can grow her clothes alongside too when it came down to it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After minutes of walking, Sabrina had gone to the center of the vast field, feeling the wind un-filtered by any trees or such breezing over. It was a good, nice summer day. Barely a cloud in the sky. However, if her plan does work, there will be a shadow upon the area soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing her mind, letting herself feel her own body throughout, deeper than what an untrained mind, especially a non-psychic would, understand. Perhaps what she was about to do was about rearranging her base components or adding up to them through whatever means, who knows? She either does not care to let on any secrets or just never bothered about it unless if she met one she'd figure would understand or at least truly appreciate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore this, she had taken measure from a nearby tree, at a convenient 50 feet roughly. She had measured it through a technique a landscape designer mentioned once; taking a 3-foot long stick, holding it up vertically and counting the steps she'd take, each about 3 feet long until the stick would match with the tree. It was just a neat moment of applying a random nice piece of trivia at least once. And adding a little something to what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, a familiar sensation would run through her... surging the energy she would use on others, downsizing them or even transforming them into puppets. This time it would however be aimed at herself, giving an extra tickling feeling and massaging feeling... and she knew she had to keep eyes open too. Good thing as well, as she suddenly felt herself lifted up higher... only to realize that yes, it was actually her having gone taller. She touched the tree... and she was reaching halfway its height. The tree also felt much leaner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not stop here. If she was going to do this, she was going to do it well. Then she focused again... and seeing herself rise up along the tree... until she faced its top... then higher... and higher... she was now leaving the tree facing her waist... and she would keep growing. Funny, it actually turned out to be simpler than she thought. Most of all, that earlier impotence and frustration felt more vented the more she stretched out like this. It was a relief... beyond words. An air of freedom would surround her as she stretched out with what would be about 150 foot tall form. She paid little mind to whoever may have been around as she swung her hair and then poked that tree with her foot... then stroked it. It was like a flower to her by now, but then stopped as she found some bird pokemon flutter out of it, and stood back to her height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is amazing... she could have done this all along... and she didn't feel anywhere close to being strained. Sure, it took a little re-orientation as she walked around, almost falling a bit with the new height but stabilizing herself. Especially when each step she took may have been causing a little rumble, or at least made her wonder about the amount of weight she put on per foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was time to look around again while considering growing more at times...</span></div></div>",

So that's why we find it hard to believe you actually have done these things.

There is no way she would let this pass. And sometimes, one could and should screw subtleness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose up and suddenly there was some odd feeling in the air... the crew behind the interviewer looked worried but the interviewer just looked barely phased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

By the time Sabrina reached puberty, she could shrink people down or turn them into dolls--something that other psychics couldn't do.  Perhaps that was the cause of Sabrina's identity crisis a few years back.   Back then she was more of a wrathful goddess than a mere human with psychic powers; she turned people who lost to her in gym battles into dolls and put them in her toybox, she insisted on getting a dais and a throne for herself and she had changed her own mother into a doll.  After the crisis was over, Sabrina changed all the dolls back into people and apologized for her behavior.  <br>\r\n                                Sabrina still kept the dais and her throne because she wanted them.  It made her feel like a queen; the queen of her own castle--of her own gym.  <br>\r\n                                 As she grew older her powers only increased.  Now she could hear the thoughts of people  if they were close enough.  The radius of it seemed to be only a few feet surrounding her.  Sabrina could control that power at will and it was lucky that she could do so or else she might've gone insane by listening to all those thoughts.  <br>\r\n                      Sabrina had redone her gym--or at least the inside of it.  Now it was filled with rooms that could only be reached by teleport pads.  The junior pokemon trainers that worked at the gym would each get a room and would challenge any to a pokemon fight.   It wasn't uncommon for gym leaders to redo their gyms on the inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   Sabrina wandered down the aisle of a mart.  She needed potions and other supplies.  As a gym leader she would've asked one of the junior trainers at her gym to fetch things for her but all of the junior trainers were on vacation now, thus forcing Sabrina to go to the mart herself.   Even though it was the \"off\" season, Sabrina still had to fight trainers that came to her gym.  Only junior trainers got time off and Sabrina didn't mind that at all.  <br>\r\n                             While Sabrina was wandering down the aisle something caught her attention; it was a fruit basket with a quite large orange.  The basket had a label on it that read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"These fruits were specially grown in the Xanadu Nursery using a new method, causing these fruits to become larger than before!  Now on sale!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"Hmmm....\" said Sabrina as she took the large orange.  It was about three times the size of a normal orange.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     After she was done shopping, Sabrina walked out of the mart and decided to eat the orange she just got. She was simply starving and the orange did look good.  She got out a knife and cut a large slice from the orange and took a bite out of it.  The orange was quite tasty.   </span></div></div>",

Now then...\" and she zaps them back to the pokeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... still, wish I had at least something to show my true stature over Dawn, and perhaps over everybody else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as she was saying that, she was suddenly knocked on a head by a container, it opening up and covering her and her clothes with goo. As she was barely blinking and gawking, with the sudden situation having literally hit her, there was someone yelling \"Are you alright miss!?\" Followed by \"You idiot! That one contained the liquid form of rare candy that was being experimented on and THAT happened to be right in the front and with only the lower bottle restrained!?\" yelled by who could be assumed to be the foreman or whatever in the truck. His assistant complained that the way the containers were formed, it looked like just one big container. Not that it made too much difference, as one should have put the restrained on the middle rather than one third of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor any of that mattered to Ursula \"YOU IDIOTS! What the hell you think you're doing there!? That could have broken my neck for all I know and all this goo-\" to her surprise, the goo was... gone? Only slight moisture reminding of it ever being there. She was wondering about that as she was angrily climbing up and up... and then was surprised at... looking down on the escort. \"What the fu-?\" as she looked down... the crew and the vehicle... appeared... so tiny... her mind was having hard time processing this as it hit her. It also gave the crew ample time to look at her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The crew were looking at her mostly still clothed form. \"How the hell could it make her clothes grow as well, I thought its only on living matter... \" -\"Or then its molecular-level, I don't know!\" argued the two truck crewmen. Either one was a scientist or at least genre-savvy and has read about such crap. Either way, they both realized that Ursula had not moved much, as she was deep in thought or shocked... making her suddenly moving again more of a shock and quite intimidating, seeing something that gigantic, maybe 100 feet tall or more, move at all. Then she reached down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh man... is this... for real...?\" Ursula asked, as she was slowly reaching down to touch anything at all. The crewmen were moving too fast. Not that she couldn't just swap them in her hand quickly as she would soon learn, but she settled in picking the truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat truck looked like it easily weighed more than a filled bus, perhaps with some hightech stuff inside it... but she was picking it like a child would pick a toy and she took it in her hands, weighing it and silently looking down on it. And then inside it as well as any details she could. One of the truck crew was about to yell at her, but then seeing how she was holding that mighty vehicle of SCIENCE be picked up so easily by this young girl... a girl they soon would have wished they had not met, not that it was with fatal consequences. Especially when a grin formed up on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No way... I am really gigantic... Aah! Need more proof!\" She said as she roughly placed the truck down and reached at one of the crewmen. It was amazing. She had snatched a human being and lifted him up like he was nothing. And far smaller than any pokemon in her team. She did not pay mind to the screams and him begging her not to hurt him, at least not until she deemed it amusing to do so. She picked one of his hands between thumb and finger and caaaarefully moved his arm up and down. She was being careful, bloody stuff is not her thing. And she'd prefer him to bow down with both hands. Why? She was simply just... so much bigger. The thoughts started to form up, perhaps scrambled initially but they did eventually form a clear picture of a simple situation. She was a giant. Looming over these tiny people...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it may end up presenting itself with awkward situations perhaps, unless if there was going to be some convenient explanation for why she doesn't have to... worry about the most awkward of them. Or maybe she could shrink back too but first... \"So, what was in that container and how did it do this to me?\" she asked the blonde guy in her hand. Her fingers were unbudged by his struggles, giving her more satisfied grin, that mere feeling of overpowering such helpless little thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A liquidated form of rare ca-\" he was cut off by who she assumed to be his superior (or at least someone with more sense)... and she cut him off by putting hand down on him, hearing muffling beneath it. Unfortunately, the boss had done his deed and the assistant was reluctant to let her know more. So instead, she let him go... and then snatch the first thing he was going after. Looking at it, it looked like a container similar to what cracked on top of her head. She was having devious ideas. \"Any idea how long this will la... oh right, you would tell me very short time, huh? Well, doesn't matter! Don't worry. I'll be nice...\" she said... this time letting out a long laugh, putting a hand in front of her mouth and then both hands on hips \"I AM F**KING GIGANTIC! Now everyone knows who's standing above them now!\" And kept laughing... and poked the guy as he was accusing her of repeating herself some. And crunched the hood on the truck with a flick of her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow... what to do, she was thinking as she put the container in and looked in for more in the truck as well as picking the name of the lab on its side. Maybe there'll be more wherever it was heading to or was going to if she was going to grow more... But for now... </span></div></div>",

The blonde guy looked to be at barely 20's, with the dark-haired senior being somewhat older, though not by much. Still, neither looked bad if it came to it. Of course, it didn't matter too much as these two looked less like people and... more like toys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr still people, but that makes her situation all the better! Those two grown men would be helpless before her, simply because of her size. Confirming this by poking and pinning down the dark-haired guy with but a single slender finger, a sadistic grin was inevitable. Ursula could feel the guy trying to push off her finger as much as he could but there was no budging it. Even when his buddy tried to lift it off from the side, it barely budged tiny bit and she added more firmness. They might just as well had pushed a giant statue. Except unlike any huge intimidating statue leaving buildings in their shadow, she was alive and with a will. And that will came with desire to abuse the new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose two guys will serve as warm-up, so perfectly as she lifted the finger and poked the other guy back. Again, he was pushed like nothing. And then she decided to let him rise up, just to poke him down and push him around, let loose... and push him again. She grinned at the frustration and fear she could sense as the guy realized he was but a plaything to a giant who could so easily crush him and there was nothing he could do. The senior was looking around, as if in for anything to help the situation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fudge you want of us, miss!?\" the blonde guy finally shouted. Apparantely, they were slowly coming to senses when they could barely get over the overwhelming presence that is Ursula. She did ponder...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Silph Co. is responsible for much of the technology behind Pokemon.  It was Silph Co that created the Pokeball and other kinds of Pokeballs including the Master Ball that could catch any pokemon without fail; you don't even have to battle a pokemon in order to catch it with a Master Ball.  The cost to make a Master Ball is far too expensive to mass produce them; only  very few people have a Master Ball.   A couple of years ago, Team Rocket took over Silph Co in order to get a Master Ball.  Back then the security of Silph Co was a cruel joke; the company spent little on security and the little security they did have didn't even have Pokemon to battle with and thus the takeover took place. It was a cakewalk for Team Rocket.  Luckily a Pokemon trainer by the name of Red saved the company by pushing out the forces of Team Rocket...for his help, Red got the one of the first Master Ball that was ever produced.  Red then went on to capture a Zapdos that had made its home in a power plant.  (a/n note:  Obliviously, not the same Zapdos that lives in the Orange Islands and I did tend to use the Master Ball to capture Zapdos.  I thought Zapdos was more cooler than Mewtwo) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                However this story isn't about Red and his adventures.  After Red saved Silph Co, the company took security a little more seriously.  To that end, the company hired a bunch of security guards with Pokemon in order to stop any future trouble.  However that doesn't mean that trouble won't happen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   Silph Co had its headquarters in Saffron City, the largest city in the Kanto region,  A city so big that it has two pokemon gyms but only one of them is an Indigo League gym while the other gym is an actual gym.  This story isn't about Sabrina or....whoever runs the other gym.  Hey, give me a break here people. It's been years since I've played Pokemon Blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Ahem<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   This is a story about Officer Jenny of Saffron City.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     ------<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                 Officer Jenny sighed as she went over paperwork at the police station.  It was boring work but it needed to be done.  She would prefer to be on patrol tonight but she had put off doing the paperwork for far too long now and she needed to do it.  Anyway there would be nothing happening this late at night.  The crime rate of Saffron had fallen off dramatically ever since that trainer drove out Team Rocket.   Jenny wondered where was that young man now..what was his name? Red?  A funny name to have Jenny had always thought.  Why name someone after a color?  Last names she could understand but first names?  Jenny shook her head and continued to the paperwork before her.  <br>\r\n                       Jenny wasn't the only officer at the police station of course.  The station was filled with officers of both sexes.  The room was filled was chatter and the ringing of phones.  <br>\r\n                               \"Jenny!\" yelled a young male officer.  \"would you go over to Silph Co?  They say there's a masked man prowling around\"<br>\r\n                               \"Yes please\" said Jenny.  \"I'm tired of this dull paperwork.  Anything else?\"<br>\r\n                               \"One of the security guards said that the masked man wasn't alone\" <br>\r\n                                \"Right\" said Jenny.  \"I'm on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                  Jenny arrived at Silph Co some ten minutes later on her motorcycle.  She saw no evidence of a prowler anywhere near the building.  She parked the motorcycle across the street and walked in the front door.  A security guard met her at the reception desk. <br>\r\n                                           \"You say you have a prowler?\" asked Jenny.<br>\r\n                                            \"Yeah\" said the guard.   \"I noticed him outside just twenty minutes ago along with at least a dozen or so people following him.  I hope it's not another take over\"<br>\r\n                                       \"I doubt it\" said Jenny.    \"the leader was wearing a mask?\"<br>\r\n                                         \"Yeah\" said the guard.   \"I didn't get a very good look at him though\"<br>\r\n                                       \"What--\" started Jenny.<br>\r\n                                       \"Weezing, smog!\"  yelled a male voice.  Jenny turned in time to see the front door burst open and a man wearing a mask came in with a Weezing right in front of him.  The Weezing opened its mouth and out spewed a thick dark cloud that quickly filled the room.  Jenny threw her pokeball, releasing her Growlithe while the guard released a Staraptor--a rather interesting choice since Staraptor weren't known to live in Kanto.   What happened next completely surprised Jenny.<br>\r\n                          \"Staraptor, use Take Down on Growlithe!\" ordered the guard.  <br>\r\n                          Growlithe was taken completely by surprise as the Staraptor attacked.  Growlithe was hit squarely which made it stagger but it didn't fall down. <br>\r\n                          \"You're no guard!\" said Jenny. <br>\r\n                           \"What was the first clue, honey?\" sneered the guard.   <br>\r\n                              \"Growlithe, Flame Thrower!\" ordered Jenny.  While giving the order she heard a dozen footsteps behind her.  It sounded like a dozen people were entering the building.    'This is a distraction'  Jenny realized.    Jenny couldn't see much because of the smog left by Weezing so she couldn't tell where the people were going.<br>\r\n                     Growlithe fired a Flame Thrower at Staraptor who dodged it.<br>\r\n                       \"Growlithe, you take care of this\" said Jenny.   \"I'm going to---\"<br>\r\n                      \"No you don't!\" yelled the fake guard who pulled some kind of gun out of a pocket and pointed it right at Jenny.  It didn't look like a normal gun.  <br>\r\n                       \"Nighty-night\" said the fake guard who fired the gun.  The gun shot out some kind of bullet that hit Jenny squarely in the chest.  The bullet wasn't going anywhere near fast enough to do damage but upon hitting Jenny, the bullet released some kind of gas that made Jenny black out.  The last thing that Jenny knew before darkness took her was the sight of her Growlithe attacking the fake guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"Hey, are you alright?\" asked a voice.<br>\r\n                          Jenny opened her eyes to see someone in a lab coat standing above her.  Her eyes focused on the nametag on the white lab coat:  Professor Timothy Tidwell, head of the Black Department*<br>\r\n                           \"I think so\" said Jenny seeing her Growlithe beside her.   \"what happened?\"<br>\r\n                           \"I don't know\" said Tim.   \"the last thing I knew the whole room went black. When I came to I went down in the elevator and found you here. I think we had a break-in\"<br>\r\n                             \"Yeah\" said Jenny.   \"was anything stolen?\"<br>\r\n                               \"We're still figuring that out\" said Tim.   There was something about that statement that made Jenny think that Tim was hiding something.  <br>\r\n                            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n *The Black Department of Silph Co runs top-secret projects. Not even the other departments of Silph Co know what kind of projects the Black Department does.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          (a/n note:  This is a story where Jenny doesn't grow right away nor is it clear what will make her eventually grow.  I wanted to start off on a mysterious robbery and leave it to you, the reader, to continue this story at this point in the story.  I also wanted a story in which the main character doesn't grow right away.  So I ask you not to make Jenny grow in the next chapter.  Of course you can do anything you want because I can't stop you.  I just don't want Jenny to grow because of that gun...why would robbers want to make a police officer grow?) </span></div></div>",

Coronet.  She appeared in a brilliant flash of light that filled the tunnel with blinding light.  When the light dimmed Cynthia was there.  She didn't look any different now but power radiated from her like heat from a blast furnace.  She looked up and down the tunnel until she decided to walk in a direction.   In her mind, she could hear all of the people in the world;  she could her them talking, laughing, crying, praying, making love and much more.  <br>\r\n                         'What to do now?' wondered Cynthia.  'I can't very well act like nothing has happened.   Do I....start a new religion? Do I make a church for myself?  Okay....first things first...better start off with some ground rules like not messing with free will....yeah....yeah, I like that.  Don't mess with free will....and....uh....'<br>\r\n                       Cynthia stepped out of the tunnel and into daylight.  As she was making her way down the mountain, she started to grow.  With each step she took she gained another ten feet.   Her clothes tightened and then ripped apart as she grew and grew.   She couldn't have stopped growing if she had wanted to;  it was her new-found power that was making her grow.  'Well, the gods were giants in those old stories after all' thought Cynthia.  'so who am I to argue with that?'<br>\r\n                               Cynthia eventually stopped growing until she was a little over 200 feet tall.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n                                 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now standing at her new giant height, Cynthia began to walk, taking great thundering strides that shook the earth with each step. Normally, being naked this far up Mount Coronet would be freezing, but hardly anything about Cynthia was \"normal\" anymore-- after all, she was a goddess now. She felt quite comfortable, actually, warmed by the heavenly power that emanated from within her, yet still able to enjoy the pleasant breeze across her nude body. Within a few moments, she could already feel her nipples hardening in the wind, and blushed. Looking down at her breasts, she could see that they had apparently grown bigger, even in relation to how huge the rest of her was. She had always taken pride in having a rather large rack, but now their size was positively unreal; with each booming step down the mountainside, they bounced and jiggled wildly. Instinctively reaching behind her, Cynthia could feet that her butt and hips had grown accordingly as well, giving her a full and quite enviable hourglass figure, worthy of a goddess like herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Heh, looks like being a deity gave me more than just infinite power,' she thought happily to herself, and knowledge instantly spawned in her mind that she could change, grow, and otherwise alter her form as much as she wanted now. For the moment, though, she was content to keep her \"giantess supermodel\" look. Within just a couple of minutes, Cynthia made her way back down the mountain, her immense form towering over the verdant Sinnoh landscape. Thinking over her next decision, she decided to head toward Celestic Town-- her home-- first, figuring the highly spiritual residents (including her own grandmother) would have good advice on how best to establish her godly reign... as she trained her mind on the small mountain town, she suddenly began to hear all of their thoughts at once, wincing for a moment before trying to shut them out, \"Oof...that could get annoying,\" she noted, hoping that she'd be able to keep her new omniscience under control after some more practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stomped through the forests toward Celestic Town, though, her godly mind homed in on a single source-- a familiar one. She instantly realized that the person in question was her young friend Lucas, the plucky young Trainer from Sandgem Town who worked for Professor Rowan and helped battle Team Galactic at the height of their threat. He was currently hiking along in the woods and training his Torterra, only to be taken by complete surprise when he saw the heavenly giantess that was now Cynthia stomp into view from the treeline. His mortal mind was overtaken by her godly aura, and he instinctively bowed down to Cynthia, while sneaking a glance upward to admire her sexy body... it was at this moment when he recognized her, partially snapping out of his stupor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...C-Cynthia, is that you?\" he asked, trembling slightly as he stared up at the radiant, naked body of his friend. Cynthia giggled and smiled warmly, able to sense his nervousness and finding it rather cute. She reached down and gently picked him up in one hand, and he could instantly feel her warm aura seep into him, putting his mind at ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! As you can see, I've had a bit of a, er....makeover since we last met!\" Cynthia said, giggling some more while trying to keep her powerful voice from sounding too loud. </span></div></div>",

The warm aura made no demand whatsoever at being revered and worshiped but Lucas felt that he should worship Cynthia.  It was as if the warm aura was an extension of Cynthia's godly power and that power was overwhelming to behold...like it <i>needed</i> to be revered but it also made no such demand. <br>\r\n                      Lucas just stared up at Cynthia and didn't see her as she appeared to be;  Cynthia was bathed in a bright light that shined on her alone and she seemed tall without measure....as if she were <i> thousands</i> and <i>thousands</i> of feet tall.   Perhaps it was the warm aura itself that had altered Lucas's perception of Cynthia.   It didn't matter much to Lucas what caused his perception to alter when he was looking at Cynthia.   Lucas's knees started to buckle and, after a moment, he fell to his knees and prostrated before Cynthia.    <br>\r\n                       Cynthia was going to protest that her friend didn't need to bow before her when she felt something enter her body.  It was as if she was being fed food without eating.  As if she was gaining something by Lucas's act.  It was hard to put into words.    She felt stronger somehow.  Not that she didn't feel strong already with her new-found omnipotence but she felt somehow stronger now that Lucas was now bowing down to her.  'Well' she thought.  'maybe gods feed on worship the same way that mortals need to feed on food and water.....but I didn't tell him that he should worship me...I didn't mess with his free will.....did I?' No.  Of course she didn't.  It was his decision.  <br>\r\n                          \"I can be anything you wish me to be\" said Lucas, snapping Cynthia out of her inner thoughts.   \"I can be your priest or your prophet....all I want is to serve you my goddess.   I am but your humble servant.  I will follow you until my dying breath, until kingdom come, until the end of time of you should so wish it.  I only live to serve you, I only live to please you, I only live to worship you.  I will follow your every order without question.  I would sacrifice myself to you if you but ask.  I--\"<br>\r\n                     \"Enough\" said Cynthia in a very quiet voice.  \"you don't have to swear your allegiance to me.  You're my friend, Lucas.  I would never ask for you to sacrifice yourself to me.  Would you even look at me when I'm talking to you?\"<br>\r\n                            \"It's a sin to look upon such beauty\" said Lucas.  <br>\r\n                              \"Let me decide what's a sin and what's not\" said Cynthia.   <br>\r\n                               Lucas looked up at Cynthia but didn't meet her gaze.   <br>\r\n                              \"I'm very flattered that you feel the need to worship me\" said Cynthia.   \"but you don't have to\"<br>\r\n                               \"I...I feel that I need to\" said Lucas.   \"It's hard to explain but once you picked me up I felt the need to swear my devotion to you\"  <br>\r\n                              \"I see\" said Cynthia and sighed.   \"well, I'm on my way to Celestic Town\"<br>\r\n                              \"I would feel honored to accompany you, My Lady\" said Lucas.    <br>\r\n                                  \"Alright\" said Cynthia.  \"I don't see why you shouldn't come with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tried to look at the giantess in the face but found that his eyes couldn't focus on her eyes....her deep eyes that one could drown in. Lucas also felt unconditional love pouring into him probably coming from Cynthia's aura.  It took Lucas several moments to regain his composure which was a bit hard to do but he did it. <br>\r\n                               \"How did you get this big?\" asked Lucas.   \"what....what happened to you?\" <br>\r\n                                Cynthia considered for a moment and figured what was the harm in telling the truth on what happened to her.  So she told Lucas what had happened to her.   <br>\r\n                           Lucas didn't doubt that Cynthia was a goddess now;  it was pretty apparent with the godly aura surrounding Cynthia.  <br>\r\n                           \"So...\" said Lucas.   \"you were going to your hometown to see how to go about with your...reign?\"<br>\r\n                        \"Yes\" said Cynthia.   \"you see I'm not sure what to do with this power of mine.  I could be a vengeful goddess...but I don't want to be.  That's the one thing I am sure about; I want to be a good deity...and the people of my hometown are highly spiritual and they would give me advice on what I should do\"<br>\r\n                          \"You have found your first follower at least...\" muttered Lucas in a distant voice.  Then he shook his head.  \"whoa...did I just say that??\"<br>\r\n                            \"You sure did\" said Cynthia who giggled.  <br>\r\n                            \"...Did you make me say that?\" asked Lucas.<br>\r\n                              \"In a way I suppose I did\" said Cynthia.  \"I mean I <i>am</i> a goddess now.  Maybe in my presence, you say things that you wouldn't ordinary say or the fact that I'm a deity makes you want to....be my follower, as you say\"<br>\r\n                                          \"And the fact that you have huge breasts now is making me....horny\" said Lucas.   Cynthia laughed at that.  A very musical laugh.<br>\r\n                                         \"That I have no doubt\" said Cynthia.  \"but I'm afraid that..err..'fun time' is going to be postponed for the moment\"  <br>\r\n                                         \"I completely understand\" said Lucas.  <br>\r\n                                          \"Let's go to Celestic Town first\" said Cynthia.<br>\r\n                                          \"You and me?!\" <br>\r\n                                            \"Why not?\" asked Cynthia who smiled.  \"you are my follower after all\"<br>\r\n                                             </span></div></div>",

Lucas grabbed onto a lock of her golden hair to keep balance.  His eyes drifted to the enormous rack of the newly-minted goddess.  Lucas pictured himself in the valley of her cleavage and enjoying himself.  Cynthia glanced at Lucas the gave him a smile that made his heart flutter.  It was a smile that Lucas always wanted to see.  Lucas avoided Cynthia's eyes lest he should melt....or whatever.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"How is it like being such a lovely goddess?\" asked Lucas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Intriguing question\" said Cynthia in a thoughtful voice.  She considered the question before answering <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"There's nothing hidden from me\" said Cynthia.  \"I can read your mind like a book.  I know your every thought, your every emotion, your every longing.  I know what's going to happen tomorrow with such clarity.  I know absolutely everything.  I feel powerful.   It's like gaining a new sense with an infinite amount of information.....and yet, I can't quite filter out all the noise yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was then that Lucas noticed something <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey, where's your pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Cynthia lifted her hand up and concentrated.  A tiny little belt containing her pokeballs appeared in her huge hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Would you like to battle me?\" asked Cynthia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Maybe later\" said Lucas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As Cynthia continued to stomp her way towards her hometown, Cynthia didn't notice that she was passing random pokemon trainers far below.  Every trainer stood in awe of the heavenly girl and bowed down much like what Lucas did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I was seeing the world through a keyhole\" said Cynthia.   \"I see much more now.  I see things that your mind can't possibly perceive. I am omnipotent\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So....what plans to you have for your reign?\" asked Lucas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Start off small and then the real fun begins\" said Cynthia.  \"I still need to get used to my new powers and learn how to control them.  I'm guessing I'll need about a month to get used to my apotheosis\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That seems an awful long time for a goddess\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Cynthia threw Lucas a look and real anger flickered through her majestic face before giving him another smile that made Lucas's heart flutter again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You try wielding all this power\" said Cynthia.  \"If I'm not careful I can easily destroy the world....even destroy the entire universe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well...a month sounds reasonable then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Cynthia stopped and looked around along the ground. She had a puzzled look on her face as she looked around the surrounding area.  Cynthia had sensed something.....but she didn't knew quite what she had sensed.  As luck would have it her mind was again overtaken by billions of voices.  She shook her head gently and moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What?\" asked Lucas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"....nothing\" said Cynthia, willing the voices in her head to stop.  It took a handful of minutes before all the voices were once again silent.  </span></div></div>",

There were people wandering about the tiny town going about their business.  Most people were milling about the shrine that was at the center of the tiny town.  As Cynthia entered the city everyone turned to see her.  Most people were overwhelmed by Cynthia's divine energy and instinctively bowed much like Lucas had.  Cynthia stood next to the shrine that predated the town itself.  <br>\r\n          \"Hello everyone\" said Cynthia in a soothing voice.  \"As you can see something happened to me during my latest journey to Mt. Coronet\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Much later Cynthia had shrunk herself down to her original size.  She had explained to the people of her hometown what had happened to her and asked for advice.  The people gave her varying levels of advice most of it was that Cynthia be a benevolent goddess.  As the townspeople was giving her advice she sensed a strange duality in one of the many people within the town.  She couldn't pinpoint the person but she knew the person wasn't a native to Celestic Town.......or, indeed this dimension which greatly concerned her.  As she tried to focus on the person in question she was again overwhelmed by the multitude of voices.    Once she managed to quiet the voices again the sense was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The townspeople insisted on having a grand feast to celebrate Cynthia's apotheosis.  It was a feast fit for a goddess.  All throughout the feast Cynthia had personal feeders which greatly amused her.  Cynthia had dressed herself in her regular clothing and she had sat on a throne that she had conjured from thin air.  Lucas was one of her many feeders that happily fed the new goddess by themselves.  Cynthia was waited on hand and foot.  Lucas in particular took great delight in shoving food into Cynthia's mouth all throughout the feast.  The feast lasted all day and well into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After the feast Cynthia had retired to her old house.  Her grandmother happened not to be in town.  It was perhaps ten minutes after the feast had ended when Lucas entered Cynthia's house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hey there\" said Cynthia smiling at her old friend. <br>\r\n   \"I thought I might stop by to.....\" began Lucas.  He averted his gaze. Cynthia chuckled.   <br>\r\n      \"Look at me when you're talking to me\" said Cynthia in a soothing voice.  After a minute Lucas shifted his gaze right at her.  That's when Cynthia gestured for Lucas to come forward. The two were in the living room.  Cynthia was sitting on a couch. Lucas came over to Cynthia like an obedient puppy which pleased Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <i>Submit......<br>\r\n        Worship.....<br>\r\n          Obey......</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Those three words began to echo in Lucas's mind.  He was looking right into Cynthia's eyes and he couldn't look away. Cynthia smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Ready for your first worship session?\"  She purred. <br>\r\n      \"What.....?\" asked Lucas sleepily.  <br>\r\n       \"You said you wanted to be my follower\" said Cynthia in a soothing voice while tracing her finger on his chin.  \"I'm ready to be worshipped.  I suppose I was during that feast but since we're alone together....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <i>Submit.....<br>\r\n        Worship....<br>\r\n          Obey......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       No need to think....</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Lucas slipped deeper into the trance.  His eyes were unfocused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Deeper...\" purred Cynthia.  \"You feel your mind becoming fuzzy.  It's getting harder to think.  There's no need to think.  Just let yourself be mindless and blank......Ready to become a good pet for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    At this point Lucas fell to his knees.  He started to massage Cynthia's feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes my pet\" cooed Cynthia.  \"Start with my lovely feet\" </span></div></div>",

He was totally mindless and blank. Only Her voice was in his head.  A voice to respect and worship.  The voice of a goddess.  As Lucas slipped even deeper into the trance he started to kiss Her foot all over.<br>\r\n            Cynthia was rubbing Lucas's head like he was a pet.  She brought her foot even closer to Lucas as he kissed every inch of her foot. In a moment Lucas started to lick her thigh.  <br>\r\n            \"Worship every inch of me my pet\" said Cynthia and her voice reverberated throughout the room and it had gained an eerie echo.   <br>\r\n       \"I worship you with every fiber of my being\" said Lucas in a toneless voice.  <br>\r\n      \"Yes\" said Cynthia as she snapped her finger and the two were suddenly naked.  Lucas's eyes shifted to Cynthia's naked crotch and started to lean in closer to the exposed vagina but Cynthia gently stopped him.  Lucas turned his eyes to her face silently pleading with her.<br>\r\n        \"Please goddess\" said Lucas.  <br>\r\n        \"Again\" commanded Cynthia.  <br>\r\n       \"Please goddess\" said Lucas.  \"Let me closer to your womanhood so that I may worship it\" <br>\r\n       Cynthia smiled and shoved Lucas's head right into her vagina.  Lucas took in her natural scent which sent him even deeper into the trance if that were possible.  He then started to lose his sense of time.   <br>\r\n         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Lucas woke with a start next to Her.  She was awake and it was morning.  Morning sunlight poured into the room.  <br>\r\n       \"You're still up?\" asked Lucas.<br>\r\n      \"I think I'm beyond the need for sleep\" said Cynthia.  <br>\r\n       \"So how long was I your pet?\" asked Lucas. \"I kinda lost my sense of time\"<br>\r\n        \"All night\"  <br>\r\n        \"All night?\" asked Lucas.  \"I'm not beyond the need...\"<br>\r\n        \"Don't you remember?\" asked Cynthia.  \"I hypnotized you so that you feel well-rested when you come back from your trance\" <br>\r\n      \"No I don't remember any of that\" said Lucas.  <br>\r\n      \"Really?\" asked Cynthia sounding genuinely surprised.  <br>\r\n      \"Really\"<br>\r\n     \"Huh.  I wonder.......\" muttered Cynthia.  Then She started counting down from ten to one. As she did so Lucas's mind became more unfocused and more submissive.  When Cynthia reached one Lucas was totally and blissfully blank.  <br>\r\n          \"Well that works\" said Cynthia.  Then she counted up from one to ten.  As she did so Lucas became more aware.  When she finally reached ten Lucas was back to his old self. <br>\r\n        \"Oh now I remember....\" said Lucas.   \"But I thought you said...\"<br>\r\n        \"I still shall be a beneficial goddess\" said Cynthia.   \"But that doesn't mean I won't have fun\"<br>\r\n         \"You call that fun?\" asked Lucas. <br>\r\n          \"Yes\" said Cynthia simply.  \"I am entitled to have fun with my pets\" <br>\r\n           Lucas was about to object to being called a pet but he found that the words wouldn't pass his mouth.  Lucas was initially angry that he couldn't object but then he changed his mind...and Cynthia didn't change his mind for him.  <br>\r\n            \"I guess you do\" he finally said aloud.  <br>\r\n             Cynthia said nothing but smiled. Seeing Her smile was like watching the first ever sunrise or biting into freshly baked cookies.  Lucas felt warm all over.  I'm<br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

Unless....you're beyond the need for food\" <br>\r\n            \"I still need food it seems\" said Cynthia.  \"What about you?  What would you like? \" <br>\r\n              Here Lucas noticed that Cynthia's breasts were much more bigger.  She always had a huge rack but now it seemed that her breast were truly gigantic now, bigger than beach balls.  The rest of Her body was more sculpted than it was before.   Perhaps it was the simple fact that She was naked that made Lucas think that Her body was even hotter now.   Cynthia smiled when She noticed where Lucas was looking at. <br>\r\n           \"Would you like to drink from me?\" asked Cynthia cupping Her breasts which made Lucas's libido skyrocket  and made his mouth water.   He took several steps towards Her and slowly nodded.   When Lucas was within reach, Cynthia grabbed him tenderly by the hair and guided him to Her breast.  Instinct took over and Lucas started to suckle the nipple in his mouth.   Warm, sweet milk flooded his mouth that he eagerly swallowed.   He was greedy so he just kept drinking.   All the while Lucas was sporting a diamond hard erection.   Why was his libido acting this way?  Babies didn't get hard from drinking from their mother's breast.  <br>\r\n           \"Drink all you want\" cooed Cynthia.  \"I can make plenty more\" <br>\r\n           Lucas stopped drinking until his stomach was full.  Then he stumbled backwards and almost tripped. <br>\r\n             \"Thank you goddess for feeding me\" said Lucas in a faint voice.  He was still sporting an erection. <br>\r\n             \"Oh my\" said Cynthia.  \"Does my divine self effecting you that way?\" <br>\r\n       Lucas nodded wordlessly trying to hide it from view. <br>\r\n     Cynthia chuckled. <br>\r\n     \"So....you don't need sleep any more?\" said Lucas.  \"What...what were you doing while I was sleeping?\"  Did he even sleep?  Cynthia had said that She had fixed it so he felt well-rested after he had came out of his trance. <br>\r\n       \"You slept for about three hours. You still need sleep, after all\" said Cynthia answering the unasked question.  \"I was busy with testing my powers\" <br>\r\n        \"And are you truly omnipotent now?\" <br>\r\n         \"Not quite yet\" said Cynthia with a slight frown.  \"I told you I need a month to get used to my divinity.  But I can do stuff like <i>this</i>\" <br>\r\n           Here, Cynthia pointed at the floor right beside Lucas and a chair appeared from nowhere.  It was an ordinary chair.   She then pointed at a spot twenty feet away and a couch appeared.   <br>\r\n            \"Is that all?\" asked Lucas.  \"Not that I'm unimpressed.  But just creating furniture isn't what I would call....\" <br>\r\n              Lucas stopped short when he noticed that Cynthia was now pointing at him.  Then he started to shrink.  Lucas shrank and shrank until he was only inches high.  Cynthia smirked and then Lucas found that he returned to his normal size.   <br>\r\n             \"Now that was impressive\" said Lucas in a faint voice.  <br>\r\n             \"I thought you might find that impressive\" said Cynthia.  \"I can also rewatch what happened yesterday with perfect recall.  I was trying to make sense of what I sensed yesterday.  I sensed a weird sort of duality from a person in this town\" <br>\r\n          \" Duality? \" asked Lucas. <br>\r\n         \"I sensed two people in one\" said Cynthia.  \"And one of those people didn't belong to this dimension\" <br>\r\n         \"What? \"<br>\r\n        \"It was there one moment and gone the next\" said Cynthia shrugging.  \"Whatever I sensed went away\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n        <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

The pokeball looked to be made out of some kind of shiny crystal. She balanced it on tip of her finger and then rolled it in her hand three or four times before throwing the pokeball at Lucas's feet.   Before Lucas could react the ball sprang open and started to pull him in!   Lucas couldn't have stopped himself from being pulled inside even if he wanted to.   The ball snapped shut and it wiggled on the ground like all pokeballs do.   In short order the ball stopped twitching.   Cynthia then climbed to her feet and picked up the pokeball.   Cynthia brought it to her lips and kissed it, leaving behind the mark of her lips.<br>\r\n                \"That marks you as my prophet\" said Cynthia releasing Lucas.  Lucas had the mark of her lips on his cheek and he lovingly caressed it.  It was as if caressing Cynthia herself.   <br>\r\n        \"Your prophet?\" asked Lucas.   <br>\r\n          Cynthia nodded.  \"A god needs her prophet after all.  Go forth and spread the word about me....but, uh....not quite yet\" <br>\r\n            That's when Cynthia locked her eyes with Lucas and Lucas fell into her eyes once more.   Lucas fell to his knees and started to lick the offered leg of Cynthia.  He licked it slowly and carefully, making sure to lick every glorious inch of her leg.  <br>\r\n              Lucas only had the vaguest sense of self.  While he knew that someone else had entered the house he couldn't tell who it was.  It was simply unimportant to him.  Nothing else mattered but serving Her.  Making Her happy was his his duty.   <br>\r\n               There was an exchange of words but again Lucas paid absolutely no attention to what was said.   It wasn't that long a conversation.   After the conversation was over with the two were left alone.<br>\r\n              Cynthia gently lifted Lucas's head and kissed him on the lips.  The kiss grew passionate and Lucas snapped out of it. <br>\r\n              \"I can't....you're too pure\" said Lucas. <br>\r\n               \" Ever since this happened to me my libido had quadrupled\" said Cynthia running her hands through Lucas's hair.  \"Whatever goddess I want to be I'm sure it won't be a virgin goddess\"  here , Cynthia gave Lucas another kiss.  Lucas eagerly returned the kiss and the two ended up on the floor with Cynthia straddling him down.   The two started to make love.  <br>\r\n                   \"Worship me\" breathed Cynthia.  And so Lucas did, praising Her beauty while panting and thrusting deeply into Her.   Lucas hardly noticed that he was slowly, ever-so-slowly, being pulled up Her vagina every time he thrusted up to meet Her when she came down.   <br>\r\n           \"This feels amazing!\" yelled Lucas.  \" It feels better than anything I've ever felt!  I worship your thighs and your eyes and your legs.....and....and... \" he stopped short finally noticing that he was now hip deep in Her and was being pulled in.   Lucas didn't feel scared at all.  In fact he was overjoyed!  <br>\r\n              \"Yes!  Let me in your divine depths\" said Lucas no longer paying attention to what he was saying.  <br>\r\n               \"You're about to enter the sacred chamber that is my womb\" said Cynthia pulling Lucas even deeper.   She placed Her hands on his shoulders and gently pushed him in. <br>\r\n              \"Yes!\" yelled Lucas.  <br>\r\n                Cynthia gently traced her finger on his chin and kissed him one more time before pushing Lucas all the way in.   Lucas was wrapped up in velvet as Her lower lips swallowed his head , sealing him away in Her womb.<br>\r\n           Inside Cynthia's womb a great sense of tranquility came over Lucas.  It was as if a great weight was lifted from his heart.  It felt absolutely like heaven being in here.  Being in Her felt so very good that he never wanted to leave this comfortable place.   In here Lucas felt no worries, no stress, no concerns.  He was perfectly at calm, at peace.   <br>\r\n            Outside, Cynthia gently rubbed her pregnant belly lovingly.  It felt good to have Lucas in her.  She had taken Lucas within her on insnict alone.  <br>\r\n              \"I think I know what kind of god I want to be thanks to this\" cooed Cynthia to her baby.  \"I'm going to be a mother goddess\" </span></div></div>",

The research center was a brand new building hardly a year old.  Access to the building was restricted to all but a few scientists that were working on highly secret projects.  What those projects might be was unknown.  Naturally, Giovanni wanted to know what was in the center.  Unluckily, the only ones available to go on the mission were James, Jessie and Meowth.  Giovanni had regretted it but he sent the three Rocket members anyway.  Giovanni's orders were simple;  get any notes on any of the many projects that were in the center.  If the center was working on something that interested him, he would send somebody else to take over the project.   <br>\r\n                         Getting into the center was surprisingly easy  all because of a lazy security guard.  Now James, Jessie and Meowth were walking down a well-lit corridor.  <br>\r\n                   During the day, the Rocket trio spent their time in studying a stolen floor plan--provided by Giovanni--and made their decision.  Near the back of the center was a lab that was only labeled  \"Restricted Access - Lab 11\"   There were other labs of course but Lab 11 caught Jessie's eye.   The floor plan explained what the other labs were working on but not Lab 11.   Jessie figured whatever was in Lab 11  was what the boss wanted.  Their decision made, the trio waited until night to enter the center and steal whatever was in Lab 11.<br>\r\n                           \"Where did the boss get the floor plan of this research center?\" asked James now.<br>\r\n                           \"He didn't say\" said Jessie.  \"and why should it matter?\"<br>\r\n                           \"There it is!\" yelled Meowth.  \"Lab 11 is straight ahead!\"<br>\r\n                           \"Quiet!\" snapped Jessie.  <br>\r\n                          The doorway to Lab 11 was a simple door but it needed a keycard.  Luckily Meowth had stolen one from the lazy guard with his quick paws.  Meowth handed the keycard to Jessie.  Jessie slid the card through the reader and the door opened.  The trio entered the darkened Lab 11.<br>\r\n                        <br>\r\n                            The lab was a typical lab with three long tables right down the middle.  All of the tables had vials and beakers filled with liquids of all the colors it seemed.  Notes were scattered here and there on the tables.  A number of super computers lined the walls of the lab.  The only light came from moonlight spilling in through the windows which gave the lab an eerie sight.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n                              \"Hehehe\" giggled Meowth.  \"we managed to get in here without being caught.  Dis is a jackpot!\" <br>\r\n                             \"Well now\" said a familiar voice.  \"I wouldn't say that\"<br>\r\n                              The trio turned around and saw Ash, Brock and Misty were there!<br>\r\n                               \"Why are the twerps here?\" asked James.<br>\r\n                             \"Did you actually think we wouldn't notice you three sneaking around?\" asked Ash.  \"we were on our way to take a vacation cruise on the S.S. Anne when we happened to see you three sneaking into this place\"<br>\r\n                             \"We called the cops\" said Brock.<br>\r\n                               \"They should be here any minute\" said Misty.<br>\r\n                                 <br>\r\n                              \"What do we do now, Jessie?\" asked James.<br>\r\n                              \"What else?\" asked Jessie, throwing a pokeball.  Seviper came out.  \"Poison fang!\" <br>\r\n                             \"Go, carnivane!\" shouted James throwing a pokeball.   \"use....<i>attack the twerps not me!</i>\"<br>\r\n                               \"Go, Pikachu!\" said Ash.    Pikachu jumped from Ash's shoulder.   \"use iron tail!\"<br>\r\n                                 <br>\r\n                              Predictably, Team Rocket lost the fight.  Unpredictably, however, during the last few moments of the fight Ash just happened to be standing near several of the vials filled with a purplish liquid.  An errant vine whip from Carnivine had hit several of the vials, causing one to shatter.  The purple liquid went everywhere including on Ash who got drenched with the stuff.    When the fight was over, the trio were blasting away again thanks to Pikachu.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                            \"Are you alright, Ash?\" asked Misty.<br>\r\n                              \"Yeah...just got covered with...whatever this stuff is\" said Ash.   \"I hope it washes off\"  <br>\r\n                                 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n            Nobody knows what made Gary Oak grow into a 100-foot-tall giant.  Gary himself claims that he doesn't know what made him grow either.  Some people are of the opinion that Gary is withholding that information; that he doesn't want to tell what made him grow because he doesn't want  anybody else to grow.  What <i>is</i> known was that Gary was wandering in a remote area of the Viridian Forest, chasing after a rarely-seen pokemon in the Kanto region--Gary said it was a Victini.  It is not known that it was Victini that caused Gary to grow or some other unknown force.  The point is that Gary became a giant overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 The person who discovered the giant Gary was Ash Ketchum who was training his pokemon in the large forest.   Ash wasn't even looking for Gary nor did he know that Gary was in Viridian Forest.  Instead of going to sleep at night, Ash decided to train all night--he had taken quite a long nap earlier in the day so he wasn't sleepy at night.  <br>\r\n               That night was especially dark since it was a new moon instead of a full moon.  It was also quite foggy...so seeing in the forest was pretty much impossible.  Because of this Ash got lost easily and stumbled into what he thought was a large boulder.  He decided to stop training and rest. Ash had wanted to make a campfire but he didn't want to go off looking for firewood in the fog at night.   <br>\r\n              Ash had  woken in the late morning. The fog had lifted.  Ash then made a shocking discovery.  The boulder that he thought he had stumbled upon turned out to be...a scrotum.   He was between the legs of a giant man.   It was ten seconds after that realization that Gary also woke up   Gary was just as surprised as Ash to find out that he--Gary-- was now a giant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       It's now a week later.  Gary still maintains that he has no memory of what made him grow.  The last thing that Gary remembers from that night was a bright flash of golden light. <br>\r\n              Seeing that he was far too big to fit in his house, Gary decided to make his home just outside Pallet Town.  Whatever caused Gary to grow also enhanced his looks; he had a bit more muscle than before and he had a sculpted look.  There was nothing to do about his nakedness since there was no clothes big enough for him.  Not that he minded being a naked giant.  Perhaps due to his new looks, Gary was attracting a lot of female attention.  <br>\r\n          'It's a pity my cheerleaders aren't here' Gary thought with a smirk on his face now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Gary was lying down outside Pallet Town looking straight into the sky.  After a week of being a giant Gary didn't knew what to do now. He was just lying there considering what to do.  </span></div></div>",

Silph Co. were the ones that made the Pokeballs and the Masterball but the company did create other stuff as well.  Top secret stuff.  <br>\r\n                     Now the warehouse served as a home, of sorts, to slaves.  There were perhaps fifty bunk beds and two slaves for every bed--and this is just one warehouse.  Other warehouses were said to hold a lot more slaves.  The warehouse was divided into two sections; one for the slaves and the other for the Jessie Squad.  The Jessie Squad were mostly made from former members of the now disbanded Team Rocket.  The Jessie Squad were mostly females but a few males had been allowed to join the Squad during recent months.   The  Jessie Squad were the slave drivers; they were the ones in charge when the \"goddess\"  herself wasn't around.   The slaves had little freedom while the Jessie Squad had free reign--as long as they served Jessie.  <br>\r\n                            In the far corner of the warehouse in a bunk bed next to a loose floor board that only a handful of slaves knew about, Ash Ketchum woke up.  <br>\r\n                             \"Another day\" muttered Ash.<br>\r\n                             \"Hey you!\" yelled a voice that Ash had no trouble in recognizing.   It belonged to Cassidy who happened to be the Captain of the local Jessie Squad.   \"get up!\"<br>\r\n                    Ash quickly got up from the bottom bunk bed and stood at attention as Cassidy reached his bunk bed.  Cassidy was wearing a white Team Rocket uniform. <br>\r\n                 \"Get going\" said Cassidy.   \"you're working on the temple today.  It just might get finished today\"<br>\r\n                  \"Yes, Ma'am\" said Ash.  He was in the act of shifting his weight to walk away when Cassidy stopped him short.<br>\r\n                   \"Where's your bunk mate?\" asked Cassidy.<br>\r\n                   \"I don't know, Ma'am\" said Ash.  \"he didn't come in last night\"<br>\r\n                      \"Did he now?\" asked Cassidy.  She then gave Ash a hard slap across the face.   \"you're supposed to look after your bunk mate\"  <br>\r\n                        \"I'm..sorry, Ma'am\" said Ash.   <br>\r\n                         \"Don't be sorry\" sneered Cassidy.   \"if you don't find your bunk mate by tonight, I'm personally putting you on the menu\"<br>\r\n                          Ash gulped.   \"I'll try my best\"<br>\r\n                          \"I'll try my best, <i>what</i>?\" <br>\r\n                            \"I'll  try my best, <i>Ma'am</i>\" said Ash, failing to keep the anger out of his voice.<br>\r\n                          \"Don't get smart at me, slave\" sneered Cassidy.   \"or you'll regret it.  Now out of my face and report for work at the temple\"<br>\r\n                           Ash didn't say anything as he walked away from Cassidy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          Ash walked out of the warehouse and into a gloomy morning; it was overcast and it was spitting rain.  He made his way slowly to the temple which once was the pokemon gym of Viridian City.  Now the gym served as the temple of Jessie the Great--the new goddess of the age.  Goddess of the age indeed!  Jessie had no supernatural powers at all; she just called herself a goddess only because she was 800 feet tall..which was a very good reason to yourself a god Ash supposed.   Nobody could challenge her rule....unless, of course, someone else were to grow like Jessie had.  But nobody knew what had  caused Jessie to grow.  Jessie had forbidden anyone to ask that;  if anyone disobeyed, they would get eaten.  <br>\r\n                                      Ash made it to the temple and saw that about a thousand slaves were putting the finishing touches on the temple.  Cassidy was probably right about the temple being finished today....and then Ash and the other slaves would  get another assignment like trimming the toenails of Jessie or something else degrading.  <br>\r\n                        \"Ash\" cried a voice.   Ash looked and saw Misty,  <br>\r\n                         \"Hey Misty\" said Ash.   \"have you seen Gary at all?  He didn't come in last night\"<br>\r\n                        \"I'm afraid I haven't\" said Misty.<br>\r\n                          \"Hey, you two!\" yelled a slave driver.  \"quit shirking and get working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Anyone remember the kind of Pok\u00e9mon GTS stories that used to be common a few years ago? Where they almost universally revolved around the anime, plot was a minimal concern, and they usually involved the main girls getting huge through some silly filler episode-esque shenanigans and proceeding to go on a fun and sexy rampage across the region? I sure do! And I think it'd be fun to go back to those roots, with fun and accessible expansion antics that need not overly concern themselves with gimmicks, superdense plotting, or anything else like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow granted, there are still some rules, albeit loose ones. All stories take place in the Pok\u00e9mon animeverse, though contributors are free to bring in elements from any other canons (the games, Pok\u00e9mon Special, other mangas, etc), and the main focus is growing to giant size, but other types of expansion (fat, muscle, BE, even some transformation) can be added later on if it serves your plot. Unlike the stories I'm homaging, gender of the characters who grow is not a concern, though girls ought to remain the focus. And, as usual with my interactives, there is to be no gore, pee, or scat. Sexual content is encouraged regardless of age or gender, as is cloths-ripping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, though, go nuts! As much debauchery as possible is encouraged, the plots don't need to be \"serious\" at all, and otherwise, just have fun like it's 2005 all over again.</td>",
