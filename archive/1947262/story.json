You look up to see the sight that almost takes your breath away just about every time -- your gorgeous blonde sister, fully made up to go out, a skimpy minidress clinging to her curvaceous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to keep reminding yourself that this is your sister. It was bad enough a few years ago when you went through puberty and really started to notice her, but she's just kept blossoming as she's grown, to the point where she's practically a wet dream come to life. Hell, you've masturbated while thinking about her, with appropriate amounts of guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey, Dan,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift yourself off the buttery leather. She doesn't often deign to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell Mom and Dad I'm, uh, going to the mall.\" Oddly, she doesn't quite seem to have the usual I'm-beautiful-and-know-it persona that you remember, and she's looking around almost as if she doesn't recognize the place, like the furniture's been moved around or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding, right?\" you ask. \"Mom's in Paris all week, and Dad doesn't really care what you do now that you're 18.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" she says, as if it's the first time she's heard that concept. \"Okay, yeah, right. Well, I'll see you later, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts walking off, and call after her, \"Susan, aren't you driving your Beemer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beemer -- yeah. What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, didn't you leave it in the garage when you came home from your friend's house?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, the garage,\" she says. \"Which I'm guessing is <i>this</i> way.\" She starts walking in the other direction, almost collides with the maid, looks like she's seen a ghost, and practically scurries off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with your sister?\" Francesca asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" you retort. Ugh, now this 40-something maid in which you have no interest is in your brain. You try to remember how good Susan looked in that minidress. And, wait a minute, you remember that notebook she'd been carrying when she got back from her friend's house...</span></div></div>",

And now, the way she was clutching it as she headed out the door \u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething wasn't right, and you had a sneaking suspicion Susan's funny looking notebook was at the bottom of all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sis!\u201d you call out. \u201cOne quick thing, before you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan whirled around, her long blond hair whipping about her shoulders as though she were a supermodel in a fashion magazine \u2026 which, come to think of it, she easily could've been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll think it's weird of me, but can I see that notebook of yours?\u201d you ask innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour suspicions were instantly confirmed when your sister's face went white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said very quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began edging nervously towards the door. That's when you noticed something else funny about all this. Susan was teetering awkwardly in her high heels. It was as though this was this first time she'd ever worn heels and she looked clumsy in them. That wasn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan, what's going on?\u201d you ask. \u201cI know something's up. And I know it has to do with that notebook. Level with me \u2013 what's happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know what you're talking about,\u201d she replied, suddenly bolting for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it out the door and off into the garage, but then you heard the clatter of Susan tripping and knocking over a stack of boxes. This gave you the advantage \u2026 and sure enough, by the time you followed Susan into the garage, she was still sprawled out awkwardly on the ground, legs akimbo and surrounded by the debris she'd toppled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, her notebook was within easy reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Dan! Please don't \u2013\u201d she started to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you picked up the notebook and flipped it open. Inside, it looked like a perfectly ordinary pad of lined paper. On the paper, neatly written in Susan's handwriting, were the following lines:<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I were older than Daniel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if I were a gorgeous blonde with the body of a supermodel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if I had all the latest fashionable clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if our family had a maid and a bunch of luxury cars and really fancy furniture?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if Mom and Dad were millionaires and were always taking trips around the world?\u201d</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan, what's going on?\u201d you say, feeling a little faint. You've got the terrifying sensation that everything you know is wrong and the life you remember has all been a dream or some elaborate lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe notebook makes anything you write come true,\u201d confesses Susan. \u201cWe're not really rich. We don't have a maid or a BMW. This isn't really even my body. I'm actually you're little sister. I'm only eleven years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there dumbfounded for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't believe this,\u201d you say finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Susan has picked herself up and dusted off her mini-dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry it yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cWrite something in there. Only let's both hold the notebook at the same time. Otherwise, I won't remember the change. That's why you don't remember things the way they used to be.\u201d</span></div></div>",

And my feet clicked oddly when I took a step back from Susan. Glancing down at myself, I instantly felt long, luxurious black hair sweep  down both sides of my neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that wasn't even the worst of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had boobs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat big, firm, fleshy, enormous melons pushed up proudly from my chest now.

Below that, my legs were bare aside from a pair of knee high, glossy red, high-heeled boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat just happened to me?\u201d I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy voice was the breathy, sensual voice of a mature woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood one, Dan!\u201d giggled Susan. \u201cYou got your wish. You, uh, just changed yourself into Wonder Woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there speechless for what seemed an eternity while Susan giggled, much like the eleven-year old she claimed to have originally been. Was this really happening? Had Susan actually acquired a magic notebook and re-written the history of our family?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that I was now indisputably in the body of a fictional character seemed to support Susan's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything you told me was real,\u201d I finally whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy new body felt powerful \u2013 somehow charged with an energetic strength and athleticism I'd never possessed before.

In any case, you were now obligated to put your powers to use in order to save your mom. Besides, you've always wanted to be a hero anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Mom; I'll deal with it.\" You said in a surprisingly heroic tone. \"Thanks, dear. Do be careful,\" your mother warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Your sister asked, looking puzzled. \"Apparently,\" you said with a sigh disguising your excitement, \"I need to go save Mom from some terrorists. But you're still changing me back when this is over!\" \"Alright, I'll think about it. Just make sure Mom's okay!\" You nodded, and then got the location of the hotel your mother was staying at. You started to leave; but then it occurred to you that Wonder Woman can't fly. \"How am I supposed to get to France in time?!\" The maid overheard this exclamation and suggested you take the jet you now apparently own. \"Oh okay... Uh, thanks.\" With that, you were off on a super jet bound for France to fight terrorists. <i>What has happened to my life?</i> You overcome with nervousness and fear for your mother and the people in danger, but also excitement for all your dreams of being a superhero coming true! Well, sort of. You didn't necessarily imagine yourself as Wonder Woman, but it could be worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving in Paris, it didn't take long with your enhanced speed to find the hotel. Indeed, it had police cars surrounding it, trying to negotiate with the terrorists. \"Wonder Woman, it is you!\" One officer exclaimed, \"we could use your help. The terrorists are demanding we hand over a special book.\" \"Book? What kind?\" \"I don't know. They claim it can rewrite reality. They must be mad!\" <i>That sounds familiar...</i> you thought, but you needed to focus on the situation at hand. \"Where are the terrorists?\" The officer then proceeded to explain all the places where snipers were spotted along the roof, but they had no intel on who was inside. \"Alright, leave it to me!\" You exclaimed and then ran up the wall of the hotel to the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, there were three snipers on the roof just as the police said. You were too fast for there bullets, dodging and weaving past them in order to strike them hard and fast. It was over in a moment and all the snipers were unconscious. <i>This is so awesome!</i> You were filled with pride and adrenaline, amazed by your own strength and agility. But it was time to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went down through the hotel, floor by floor, clearing out terrorists until you found your mother being held up at gunpoint by one of the enemy. \"Ha! Wonder Woman! I knew you'd come!\" The terrorist exclaimed, \"now give me the book and I'll let your mother go free!\" You shook your head, \"I don't have any book.\" \"Check her!\" The leader ordered to one of his lackeys, who indeed checked you and found nothing. \"Sorry sir, she's not lying.\" The leader seemed surprised by this. \"I was almost certain... a woman with powers like yours must be using the book. Ah well, our associates in America will soon be searching her house. Perhaps they will find it.\" This threw you into a rage born of worry; your sister would soon be in danger. You managed to tackle the leader to the ground, but not before his gun discharged into your mom's shoulder, causing her to screech in pain. The next few seconds were filled with noise and violence as you brought the remaining terrorists down. Then you turned to your mother. \"Mom, are you alright?\" \"Yes Diana, I will be. You need to save your sister!\" You nodded, and then helped the police and the medics get into the hotel. With that done, you returned to your jet ready to get back home <i>To think, this all started with what I thought was a joke.</i></span></div></div>",

To your surprise and relief, your sister was alive but bound and gagged. Unfortunately, the terrorists were nowhere in sight. After untying Susan, and Francesca, your sister started crying, \"Dan, I'm so sorry; they stole the book! I tried to protect it, but...\" You shushed her and wrapped her in a warm embrace. \"Relax, sis. I'm just glad you're alright. Besides, this means my family's out of danger.\" \"Wow,\" Susan exclaimed, \"you're starting to sound like a real superhero. Enjoying this?\" She winked with that question. \"Maybe a little,\" you admitted with a blush, \"but I really just want things back to normal. Do you have any idea where the terrorists might be going? How'd they even learn about the book in the first place?\" Susan shook her head. \"I  have no idea. I got the book from some weird old guy at the antique shop. How was I s'posed to know some bad guys wanted it?\" Your sister's eleven-year-old way of speaking was a bit strange coming out of her adult body. \"Well, maybe I should go pay this old guy a visit. Where can I find him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter receiving directions from your sister, you went to your room to change. You'd attract too much attention in your Wonder Woman outfit, after all. You weren't surprised to find that all of your clothes were now replaced with women's attire. After changing into a light summer dress and sandals, you inspected yourself in the mirror. Your new body gave you some really nice legs to pull the outfit off. \"I could get used to this,,\" you said out loud. <i>Oops, I hope Susan didn't hear that...</i> You pushed your thoughts to the back of your head and walked to the antique shop. It felt sort of empowering noticing all the men, and some women, checking you out. When you arrived in the store, you found a young man standing behind the counter, not matching your sister's description at all. \"Um, hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man behind the counter didn't respond at all. \"Hey, earth to...\" your sentence trailed off when you realized you didn't know this guy's name. Not that it mattered; he was still just staring, it was becoming unsettling until you realized what he was staring at. \"Hey, eyes up here asshole,\" you said with a snap, causing the man to be startled. \"Oh, sorry ma'am. C-can I help you with, uh, something?\" You nodded. \"My sister spoke to an older man here yesterday. Can I speak with him?\" The man shook his head with a sad look. \"No, you must be referring to Mr. Wong. I'm afraid he passed away last night. What did you need from him?\" You sighed in response. \"He gave my sister a special book. I was hoping to learn more about it.\" When you finishing uttering that, the man's eyes suddenly widened. \"Oh! That explains so much! His daughter Angela was looking everywhere for that book but couldn't find it. Maybe you should talk to her?\" You tilted your head sideways. \"I could... but shouldn't she be grieving right now?\" The man nodded. \"She is. But the funeral's tomorrow; maybe come back the day after that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll be back.\" At least two more days as Wonder Woman. Now what?</span></div></div>",

I wish I could at least be superhero like you! It must be fun.\" You pursed your lip. \"Sort of. But there's a lot of responsibility knowing that other people's lives depend on you.\" As if on cue, the news Francesca was listening to mentioned a bank robbery nearby. \"Huh, I guess I should go help?\" Your sister nodded in agreement, and with that you changed back into your superhero uniform and left for the bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robbers were just common thugs, no match for your superior prowess. Crowds of people gathered outside to cheer for Wonder Woman; and yes, you basked in the glory a little. You were a hero; strong, brave, beautiful, and loved by many. Why give this up when there were so many people you could help with these powers? You definitely had a big decision to make when you get that notebook back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, you finished your dinner, showered, and changed for bed. The pink nightgown you wore was certainly more comfortable than the pajamas you wore as a boy, and you looked so good in it. Who <i>wouldn't</i> want to stay like this?

It was long and exhausting; superheroing wasn't all about looking cool and getting fans it turns out. It was also hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you arrived home later at night, hoping it would be the last time, your sister seemed to notice your fatigue. \"You alright Dan? I don't think the world would mind if you left things to the cops and firefighters for a while.\" You nodded in response. \"You're probably right... I just think I'd feel guilty if I heard someone died while I was playing a video game or something.\" \"You're so sweet all the sudden,\" Susan remarked. \"Wish you could've been this nice before you became Wonder Woman.\" You sighed, but nodded. \"Yeah, I guess I liked to pick on you, sis. But I really do care about you.\" Susan smiled at this. \"This whole superhero thing has impacted you for the better. Just make sure you don't forget what you said after you get the notebook back!\" She chuckled, but you found it hard to laugh back. \"Look, uh, Susie there's something we need to talk about. About when we get the book back...\" \"Yeah?\" She asked, with a puzzled look, \"what is it?\" You hesitated, not sure how to explain. \"Well,\" you started, \"I think I might like to stay as I am when this is over...\" Your sister stared at you with a blank look. \"Um... Really? Do you like being a woman or something? You could always become a male superhero if it's about the powers or something.\" You shifted in your seat a little. \"Well, ah, I do like it. I like my body, the way it makes me feel. Maybe there <i>is</i> a reason I wrote down \"What if I was Wonder Woman?\", maybe I have always wanted this, deep down...\" Your sister coontinued to stare at you in silence for some time, before shrugging. \"Whatever. Dan, Diana, brother, sister, you'll always have my support! Just promise me one thing.\" What's that?\" You responded. \"Make me your sidekick when you get the book back!

This time, a young woman was there, going through the shelves; Angela Wong you presumed. \"Are you Angela?\" you asked. The woman nodded as she turned to face you. \"That's my name all right. Who're you?\" \"Diana. I think your employee should have mentioned me?\" After hearing your answer, she looked you up and down, taking you in. \"Huh. You're that superhero aren't you? You look different wearing normal clothes. \"Yeah, Kenny mentioned you'd be coming; you know about my father's notebook? Where it went?\" You proceeded to explain to her the story so far, leaving out the part about formerly being a boy. \"I see...\" she sighed, taking in all the information. \"I always wondered where you got your superpowers. But now I guess those memories are artificial? Or are they real because in this universe you've always had powers? I wonder...\" She began trailing off into a series of theories about the nature of memories in the multiverse, but you decided to interrupt her. \"Ahem. Do you know anything <i>useful</i> about the book?\" \"Oh,\" she gasped in surprise, \"sorry. I didn't mean to get distracted. To tell the truth, I don't know a lot about the book. I just hoped my dad would tell me whenever he decided to pass it down to me. But he chose your sister instead... I wonder why - was I not good enough or something?\" She began tearing up as she spoke. \"Angela,\" you stated in the most reassuring voice you could assume. \"I'm sorry about your father. I'm sure he had his reasons for why he didn't choose you; maybe he thought holding the book was too much of a danger to you. Remember what I said happened to my mom and sister?\" She nodded at this, sniffing a little. \"Thanks, maybe you're right. Anyway, we need to focus; now if your name is on the same page of the notebook as the newest entries you'll be able to notice any changes to reality as a result of those entries. So maybe you should browse the news to see if you notice anything strange?\" You shrug your shoulders; you had watched the news a lot the last couple of days in order to keep tabs on crime, but maybe there was something you missed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about thirty minutes of scrolling through the news on your phone, you saw nothing entirely new. Lex Luthor was still the President of Earth, slavery was still legal, the world was still at peace under the American Empire's iron fist. \"But wait,\" you suddenly thought out loud, \"what if the book thieves already knew that? They'd be able to change reality and we wouldn't even notice. What then?\" Angela furrowed her brow in though for a moment, then answered. \"Well, then we'd have to guess. When you used the book you gave yourself superpowers; what if these terrorists also made themselves more powerful?\" \"But I'm still the only super-person in the world,\" you countered. Angela shook her head. \"Not necessarily superpowers, there are a lot of powerful people in the world. What about one of them?\" You nodded, finally seeing her point. But how could you narrow it down? You <i>could </i>just start with the most obvious suspect...</span></div></div>",

But as with incontinent adults you wore thin 'protective underwear.' which looked like regular underwear.  Susan had expected you to wear thick ones like babies did.

She smiled at the look.  But when Dan returned to say he was back sucking his thumb Susan decided to make more changes to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try something else,\" Susan told Dan.  \"What if Dan doesn't change his own diapers,\" Susan wrote.  \"How do you feel now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan took his thumb out of his mouth again.  \"I don't know,\" he said hesitantly.  \"I'll go back to my room and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, do you need to be changed?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not right now.\"  Since Dan doesn't change his own diapers now, someone has to change them for him.  Thus being asked this question no longer seemed weird.  In Dan's world usually his mother or Francesca change his diapers but sometimes when they aren't around Susan changed him too.  But that is a last resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?  Let me check while you are down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure.  Why do you want to change my diaper all of a sudden.  I thought you hated doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am getting older,\" Susan lied, \"and I thought I would try and be more responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking about this a little while, Susan convinced Dan.  They went back to his room and found that it had changed a little bit.  There were changing supplies in his room that hadn't been there before.  There was also a changing mat and of course diapers filled what once was his underwear drawer.  there were also extra diapers in his closet.  His mom would buy diapers in bulk when they were on sale.  Susan realized she really didn't know how to change her brother though, she had never done so in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get something,\" she said.  Then she wrote in her notebook, \"What if I knew how to change my brother.\"  Then remembering Dan's room she decided to add on another page, \"What is Dan slept in a crib.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she returned to his room, she noticed that not only had Dan's bed changed to a large crib that couldn't be opened (or closed) from the inside.  But also a changing table had also appeared.  Without a bed to lie upon, Dan needed a place to have his diapers changed.  Susan was now an expert on changing Dan's diaper so she professionally pulled down his pants, removed his old diaper, cleaned him up with a baby wipe and then refastened a new diaper upon him.  It took less than two minutes to do.  Susan left the room as fast as possible.  She wanted to laugh about the state of her brother, but she didn't want to do it in front of him.  Dan didn't know anything was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

A thumb in his mouth really calmed him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan wasn't finished with tormenting Dan, even if Dan didn't realize anything was changing.  She wasn't sure what to do though.  She wanted to make Dan more babyish but hadn't decided upon how.   She decided to write, \"What if Dan had lots of stuffed animals and dolls and always carried his favorite around with him.\"  She had seen little kids carry their teddy bears everywhere and she thought it would be fun if Dan did the same.  She was about to check up on him when Francesca told Susan that dinner was almost ready and she should get her brother.  Susan was heading that way so she didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Susan got to Dan's room she saw plushies everywhere.  They were on all the flat surfaces of Dan's room,.  They were a few in his crib and a few on the floor.  Dan was watching TV, he had his left thumb in his mouth and his right hand was hugging a teddybear.  She tried not to smile.  Dan saw her and asked what she wanted after taking his thumb out of his mouth.  \"Francesca said dinner is ready.\" Susan told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll be right down....Did you think of how to get this thumb out of my mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, but I am working on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan thought that Dan looked like such a toddler sucking his thumb that maybe she would do something else.  Instead of going straight to the dinner table, Susan stopped into her room and wrote, \"What if Dan ate like a toddler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Susan found Dan at the table.  Francesca was cutting his food into small pieces for him.  Dan was drinking from a sippy cup with one hand and still had this teddybear clutched in the other.

He was still clutching his teddybear although his thumb had fallen out of his sleeping mouth.  His thick nighttime diaper was clearly evident under his pajamas.  Susan thought he looked sweet.  He certainly looked too sweet to be heading off to ninth grade in the morning.  She thought maybe he should stay home with the rest of the toddlers.  But she wanted him to go to school.  She went back into her room and wrote, \"What if Dan attends kindergarten.\"  then she waited for the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan could hardly sleep.  In the morning she went back into Dan's room.  She found that Dan was still asleep. Looking at him she saw that Dan had been reduced to a little kid of about five or six.  This wasn't what she intended.  She wanted him to stay as a 14 year old, just that he should attend kindergarten.  But the book had decided that if he was going to be wearing diapers and attending kindergarten then he should be a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan ran back into her room and wrote another what if.  She wrote, \"What if Dan was 14 years old\" then she continued so that there wouldn't be any ambiguity, \"and he attended kindergarten.\"  Returning to his bedroom, Susan found that Dan was back to his original age.  Although, he was still wearing a diaper and had plushies in his crib.  Everything seemed to be going fine.  There was still some time to wait before it was wake-up time.  Susan couldn't stand the wait, but she endured it the best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time to wake up, Susan went into Dan's room again and unfastened the crib to wake him up.  Dan didn't seem to think that this was too unusual.  He needed to be let out of the crib each morning, he didn't care who did it.  He was actually pleased that he didn't have to wait for anyone to let him out.  Susan was about to leave when Dan said, \"I'll be finished with my shower in ten minutes. remind Francesca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone has to put on a fresh diaper.  Unless you want to do it.\"  Dan said matter-of-a-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, give me ten minutes then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike many toddlers, Dan could take off his diaper pretty easily, it was putting one back on that he had trouble with.  Despite this, Dan could put on all other aspects of his wardrobe.  Susan waited.  After his shower Dan came out of the bathroom wearing only a towel around his waist.  He then got onto the changing table himself and Susan removed the towel and put him into a fresh diaper.  Then Dan looked at her as if to say, \"Hey, I can get dressed all by myself now, scram.\"  Susan did indeed leave the room, she had to get ready for school herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Susan got to the breakfast table, Dan was already there.  he was wearing a bib.  That was the only way to keep the food off his school clothes.  he had a bowl of sugary cereal in front of him.  Like a toddler, he was messily using a spoon to feed himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Dan took a book bag and went to wait at the bus stop.</span></div></div>",

The exhibition game starts in an hour.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it, you'd forgotten that the girl's had a special exhibition game today against a rival school.

And the only thing you'd really done with it was turn yourself into a little girl to make your sister happy.  Sure it was nice and all but now that you didn't have the notebook anymore it felt like kind of a waste.  You looked to your mom and said, \"Since you have it, can you go ahead and fix me, please mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom smiled and wrote in the notebook, you expected to turn back into a teenage boy but as soon as your mom finished writing you noticed that nothing had changed.  Well one thing had changed since your mom had written down, 'What if Daniel was potty trained.  Daniel. Carrie'  You looked and sure enough you were no longer wearing pull ups and instead were wearing white panties with a cute duck logo on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but that wasn't what I meant mom,\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you probably meant but...humor me.

You wanted to turn back to yourself, but you figured that if you could make your mom happy before you did you might as well.  What's the worst that could happen?  Besides, if your mom had a good time with you, you'd probably be able to make any wish you wanted with the notebook once you turned back.  Might even be able to get a car set up before you even have your license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure mom, sounds fun.  So what do you want to do?\"  Your mom smiled and seemed to be practically bouncing.  \"Oh good, I can't wait to see you on the stage, you'll look so cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, stage?

You were in such a bad mood for some reason and were being a bit of a bad sport.  But why should you?  You were at going to be on stage for the beauty pageant and you were going to do your best to win.  It seemed crazy that just 2 days ago you had been your normal teenage self and now you were a 5 year old girl and one of the top beauty pageant contestants in the state.  You never would have dreamed that you would be in this position, but after your mom told you she wanted you to try out a pageant it all seemed to click.  It all of the sudden was like a secret desire you didn't know you had.  Sure being a 5 year old girl was a little bit of a drag but a 14 year old boy beauty pageant didn't have the same mass appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day couldn't go slow enough for you.  You were taking everything in from mom helping you out with your make up and Susan helping too getting your dress on.  The three of you made your way to the center where the pageant was being held.  All the other little girls and their moms were in a tizzy and seemed to be very nervous but you felt calm and collected.  You were going to go out on that stage and own it.  Everyone's eyes would be on you and not anyone else.  You had all the cuteness and charm of 5 year old girl and the poise and cocky confidence of a teenage boy.  These little girls didn't stand a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danielle, you're up.\"  A stage hand said giving you your number.  69.  Even with the body of a little girl, the teenage boy let out an immature giggle for a brief moment, but play time was over.  You had a pageant to win.</span></div></div>",

The papers were signed and the agent went right to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she did was have you come in for a photo shoot to get his headshots and all the other promotional materials done for your new career.  The photo shoot was so much like the pageants that you were a natural at them too.  You loved changing in and out of costumes, putting on and reapplying your makeup and posing all dolled up.  There was also a video shoot and DVD made.  Everyone said you were a natural, from the photographers to the director of the video.  You got your first job almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't all fun and games, you loved the commercials and all the attention that that brought, but you didn't like being treated like a very little child.  No one listened to what you had to say, you were always taking orders from adults.  When you weren't working on commercials or pageants you were back in kindergarten.  You didn't like that you didn't know the complete alphabet yet nor that you weren't sure if you skipped numbers when you counted up to twenty.  All the the kids you were supposed to be friends with were just little babies to you.  You couldn't go anywhere without an adult being present.  You couldn't even cross the street or walk in a parking lot without an 'adult' holding your hand.  But the worst part about it, was that you couldn't talk to cute teenaged girls the way you wanted to.  You wanted to ask them out but that wasn't going to happen.  When you were fourteen, you had had a few girlfriends that you kissed.  Your mother knew that you had had playboys in your room.  You were 'hiding' them from her, but she knew they were there and she didn't mind.  Of course they were gone now, along with everything else you had that was for a boy or for a teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan wasn't happy either.  With all of your success she felt left out.  She wondered why she wasn't entering pageants or doing commercials.  She had never gotten the chance.  So now she resented you because of it.  She wanted to be the little girl who was winning everything and everybody loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom felt guilty.  She didn't tell you about her last wish.  She thought that if you knew that you only loved pageants because she wished it that you wouldn't have agreed to stay a little girl and be in commercials.  She felt this way even though she didn't know that you still had feelings for teenaged girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father wasn't too happy either.  He had always wanted a boy and now that he didn't have one, he was starting to pressure your mom to have another baby.  He also didn't like that the house was empty because you and your mom was always out doing things for your commercial career or for the pageants you still attended, not to mention the dance and singing classes you 'still took.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Daniel really wanted to go back to being himself, but he just couldn't bring himself to tear himself away from the spotlight.  He had even gotten so far to pull the notebook out of his mom's luggage on day but couldn't bring himself to even open the book to make the proper wish to fix himself (or notice his mom's manipulation of his mind).  So he put the notebook back, but what he didn't notice is that his snooping sister Susan had seen him go through mom's stuff.  Wanting to see what the big deal was, she picked up the book when Daniel left the room.  And when she opened it she felt like her eyes had been opened for the first time in a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the notebook she saw that she had originally owned it, but Daniel had taken it from her, and then mom had taken it from him.  Well, now Susan was ready to take it back.  She got a pencil and added her name to all the other 'What if's' that had been written down and then added one of her own.  \"What if Daniel and Mom completely forgot about the notebook and it's power.\"  A few seconds later Daniel re-entered the room.  Susan hastily hid the notebook as Daniel started talking, \"Susan, can I just tell you how much this sucks?  I mean, ever since I somehow turned into a little girl last month I've tried to adjust and make mom happy by doing all this pageant stuff, but I miss being the real me.  I hope I turn back soon, somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's eye's widened, looks like what she had written had some interesting effects.  \"But don't you love doing all the pageant stuff?  The stage, the trophies, the attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel blushed, \"It's...ok.\"  He said not wanting to admit how much he loved that part, \"But that's only a small part, the rest of the time I'm still a 5 year old girl.  I love the pageant stuff but I don't know if it's worth losing everything else.\"  Susan started to feel really bad for her big brother when their mom called out, \"Hurry up Danielle, we have another appointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom.\"  Daniel said dutifully, \"Thanks for listening Susan, sorry I wasn't always the best big brother.  But I'm glad you're being cool big sister helping me out with this whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"  Susan said as Daniel left to go do his thing.  Susan looked down at the notebook, \"I'll turn you back...eventually.  I promise, but I need to punish mom first for what she did, you taking the notebook was mean but you've...almost been punished enough.  But mom needs to be taught a lesson.\"  Susan got the pencil again and wrote down, \"What if Mom...\"</span></div></div>",

She was in a light blue linen skirt suit with a white scoop neck blouse underneath.  She wore the same stylish hose she always wore when accompanying Danielle to her photo shoots.  Her heels were stylish with a small two inch heel. All in all she looked professional.  She even wore the same makeup and hair style she always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan,\" she said, \"there you are.

Susan and Daniel's mom still had their dad's body, but instead of her still being confident and wearing her normal clothes, she looked nervous and was wearing a suit that their dad would normally wear to work.  She even had a rough 5 0'clock shadow and a few cuts from a bad job shaving.  Susan giggled as she listened to her mom talk to herself (she didn't notice her kids had walked up).  \"This is insane.  I have my husband's body all of the sudden a bit earlier but everyone thinks it's normal but me, Daniel didn't think it odd nor Robert when I called him.  He seemed to be me with my voice but he didn't think anything was odd, he seemed to even think he was me.  Am I going crazy?  What's going on.  Oh hi kids!\"  Their mom changed her tone quickly when she finally noticed the two of you were back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is everything ok dad?\"  Daniel asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mom seemed taken aback by the question when she realized her (former) son was referring to her as Dad, \"Of course it's all right, why wouldn't it be all right everything's just perfect.  I'm just going to...go to the room for a minute to...get some ice.  Then we'll be off.\"  Susan was trying not to laugh as they saw their mom in a fit of nerves go back to the room to probably have a nervous breakdown.  And Susan couldn't get enough of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is dad going to be okay?  I mean, with the weird stuff happening to me turning me into a little girl, maybe something weird is happening to dad too?\"  Daniel asked his sister concerned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably nothing, daddy is probably just nervous because it's your last commercial shoot today for a while.  Hey I got an idea, while she, I mean, he is freaking out, let's go order some fancy desert and charge the room.  You're getting paid enough for this commercial stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel still seemed worried about who he thought was his dad, but the idea of fancy food seemed to entice him.  \"Sure, why not, the crazy sugar rushes are probably the only good thing to come out of having this body.  Let's do it.\"  Daniel led the way while Susan lingered behind with the notebook as she prepared her next 'What if'.  As she twirled the pencil in her fingers she has a random though, \"I've always wanted a kitty but mom wouldn't let me, this way I can get one.\"  Susan said with a smile as she put pencil to paper.</span></div></div>",

You're the best kid a mom could ask for!\" your mom says and gives you a hug. \"This is going to be so much fun!\" In your memory, she's never hugged you this hard. Likely because you can't remember being this small! \"Now I know that you're probably thrown off by this honey, but you are probably in your leotard for a reason. It's Sunday, so I'll bet you have a morning performance now!\" \"You mean that you're just going to drop me right in?\" you ask. \"Honey, you know that the best way to respond to a new situation is to jump straight into it.\" \"But mooom,\" you say. \"But mom what?\" Her eyes shoot daggers at you.

Five <i>other</i> little girls you think to yourself. At first, you do poorly. You trip over your own two feet and don't recognize any of the moves the instructor calls out. Eventually, he pulls you over. \"Danielle, is everything all right?\" \"I don't know,\" you respond. \"I guess I'm not feeling like myself today.\" Behind him, you see your mother writing something. All of a sudden, your posture shifts and you feel a sense of confidence. \"Actually, I'm feeling a whole lot better. Thanks for the talk!\" After that, you tear the floor up. You're fast, limber, and graceful, even more than the real girls. Afterward, you return to your mom. \"I'm so proud of you, you did such a good job!\" she says. \"You were a bit shaky at first, but I think that you really pulled it together!\" \"You know I'm still a 14-year-old boy, right?\" \"Not until I change you back, you're not.\" \"I thought that was it,\" you say. \"I already gave you world-class ballet skills,\" she says. \"I don't see anything wrong with keeping you this way a while longer. The big recital is this Friday, and Danielle is the star! Can't you tough it out for your mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you feel about this?</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, he forgot all about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time Daniel was in the girls locker room with scantily clad teenaged girls, Daniel felt strange again. But this time he wasn't worried. When he got dressed, he walked over to one of the naked older girls and said, \" You look pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was in arm's length of the naked girl. He could see the girl's shaved pussy and developing breasts.   He was much shorter then the girl since he was five. He could look straight up at the girl's breast without her thinking it odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"  Thank you.  You look very pretty too.   What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My name is Daniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and the girl had a conversation in the locker room. The girl was naked and Daniel was staring at the girl's breasts the entire time.   Daniel's funny feeling grew, but without a penis no one could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the feeling got too much for Daniel and he grabbed the girls boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I do not want to be a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sighed and wrote something in the notebook, but even though you weren't touching it, you felt like you knew exactly what she wrote.<br>\r\n<b>What is Dan didn't speak like a French maid and was 20 years younger.  Dan.</b>  All of the sudden a few minor aches you didn't know you had disappeared, your skin smoothed out nicely, and your large breasts firmed up and actually might have gotten a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks I guess, that's two out of three, do you mind making me a guy again?  I could deal with this situation much easier if I were a butler and not a maid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan giggled and said, \"I can't make it too easy on you.\"  As she wrote something else in the notebook.  As soon as she finished a horn blew in front of the house.  \"And that would be my ride to our family's new private jet, see you later...Dancesca.\"  Susan laughed loudly at her little joke as she left with the notebook as you remembered the times you rode on the family private jet before you remember that Susan probably just magiced it like your house and so much other stuff out of nowhere.  When the limo pulled out of sight you give a heavy sigh as you poke at your breasts a little before you say to yourself, \"There'll be time for that later, I guess I'd better get to work.\"  You say as you go get the vacuum cleaner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Susan's ride to the airport she couldn't help but think about your situation.  She laughed to herself as she thought of different ways to make it more rough on you, it would be pretty funny to pay you back for years of making fun of her.  But then again she'd already done enough to you and you probably deserve a bit of a break, after all you are her brother and even if you could be a pain you both love each other.

After you put up the last of the dishes you start to think about looking around the house to maybe see if you notice anything out of the ordinary, when suddenly the doorbell rings.  Confused you walk to the door to answer it, you weren't expecting anyone were you?  You get the nagging feeling that this might have something to do with Susan, but even with that in mind you make your way to the front door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are greeted with a surprise hug from a stranger as they say to you, \"Great to see you Francesca, you ready to hit the town?\"  They break the hug and you are a bit stunned as you look at this stranger who you vaguely feel that you are supposed to be very good friends with.</span></div></div>",

After you got out of the shower this time you heard the family limo pulling into the driveway.

You find it hard to believe that your parents approved of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you <i>really</i> find it hard to believe that they would approve of you having sex with a maid -- with anyone, really -- and they would have to know, right? You take another look at what you'd written, \"What if Francesca the maid was totally hot, and I had sex with her a lot?\" She'd obviously changed to become hot, and, you guess, other things had to change to make it so that you had sex with her a lot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down at your desk in front of your Alienware system and bring up Facebook on the middle monitor. Nothing seems too out of the ordinary at first glance, but you just have to scroll down a little bit in your newsfeed until you get to Scott Hernandez saying, \"Lindsey and I fucked for the third time in three days!\" There are a couple of \"whoo-hoo\"-style comments, and then Brian Fink replies with \"Let us know when you get to 7! That's where I was at with Aimee until she got her period. :(\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext one down is Eric Yount: \"Lizzie was feeling good after cheerleading practice, so she let me try anal. It was awesome, although she wants to do some stretching exercises before next time.\" That has a smattering of comments, including Megan O'Dowd replying, \"I told Lizzie she'd like it almost as much as you would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the next one down is Erin Willis. \"OMG, Pablo ate me out after cheerleading! What a talented tongue!\" You're a little surprised, since Pablo is kind of a geek -- but then you happen to hover over the \"Like\" list, and see both Jennifer and Ron Willis, Erin's parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo from what you can tell, the world -- or at least your school friends and their parents -- have become more accepting of and open about sex, all because of your \"what if.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back a page in the notebook, to look again at what Susan wrote. All the evidence seems to point to the fact that Susan <i>wasn't</i> an 18-year-old hottie, and that your family <i>wasn't</i> super-rich. You try to imagine yourself living the way most of your classmates do, in a relatively small suburban house on a relatively small piece of land, with only seven or eight rooms and no live-in staff. It's very hard to picture, since all your memories are of growing up in a life of wealth and privilege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what would happen if you crossed out something already written in the notebook -- but then you flip ahead, to an inviting blank page, now believing you can write \"what if\" <i>anything,</i> and things will change to accommodate it.</span></div></div>",

Still, as she twirled the dress raised up revealing a decent amount of her sexy legs. And it was cinched in at her waist and clearly pushed out by her chest so her shape was obvious, but the minidress she'd went to the mall in had been sexier. This outfit was merely pretty, but I guess it was something she could wear to mom and dad's party functions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second outfit was a long dress again, but this one was more of an evening gown - figure hugging from top to bottom, it had a long slit up the side and a neckline that plunged deeply enough to ensure that it could not be worn with a bra without showing off the bra.. and Susan's full firm breasts were definitely not showing off a bra. This was more like it and I could feel myself getting aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third outfit caused my eyes to widen, a sight which brought a sexy smile to my sister's face. A tight mini skirt, ending mere inches below the curve of her ass was accompanied by a tight tank top that left bare near a foot of my sister's tight, toned stomach and pressed her breasts up into a mesmerising display. If she kept upping the ante with each outfit, I was beginning to think I wouldn't last through the fashion show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she came over in was a one piece swimsuit, with cutouts on the sides that went from just above her hip to just under her armpits, showing off much of her tight stomach and the bottom of her unsupported, yet still very firm, breasts. Every inch of her mile long legs were on display and though her cleavage wasn't visible the suit clung tightly to her body to show perfectly the curve of her breasts. Susan licked her lips when she saw my hand start to move towards my pants as I was barely able to keep myself from jerking off right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more to go, then the big finale.\", she said as she sashayed out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came back she was wearing a tiny bikini - barely two small patches of cloth to cover her nipples and areola and another patch of cloth over her pussy, and when she turned her ass was on full display as the bottoms were a skimpy thong style. I couldn't take it anymore and got up and started to approach her - my lust obvious in my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\", she whispered, putting a hand on my chest. \"You've yet to see the finale.\", and she shoved me backwards, back to my seat before leaving the room. </span></div></div>",

I'll be back in a little bit alright?\" Susan said, stepping out and closing the door behind her. It doesn't take her long to return, she must not have had to go far to find the items you'd sent her after, though where the heck she'd gotten them from you have no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you wanted bro?\" She asks, holding up the items in question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a cursory examination of the items, you pronounce \"They'll do. Now, for your next task, I want you to strip naked and then put these on.\" you said, handing the items back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What sort of sick game is this?\" your sister demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're the one who's always bugging me, wanting me to have sex with you. If you really want it as bad as you claim you do, then this is part of my price.\" you said. \"Though you can always refuse if you're not interested.\" you added, wanting to offer her an out, knowing she wouldn't take it if that last what if changed things the way you thought it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright, if this is what it takes to get you off I guess I'll do it.\" your sister reluctantly agreed, slipping out of her dress, followed by her underwear, then lifting up her long hair and slipping the collar around her neck, then clipping the leash to the front of the collar before picking up the handcuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out and taking them from her you said \"Hold on sis, I'll take care of that.' you said, before spinning her around so her back was facing you, then snapping the handcuffs around her wrists, pinning her arms behind her. \"There, comfy?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there a little tight.\" your sister complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea.\" you said. \"By the way, do you happen to know where the key to these is?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in my purse.\" Susan said, nodding in the direction of said item. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short search, you find the key to the cuffs, and slip it into your pocket, before picking up the end of the leash and heading towards the door. \"Wait a minute, where are we going?\" Susan demanded, starting to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere special, just a quick trip around the grounds, at least for starters.\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but what if someone sees me?\" your sister asked, seeming more than a little frightened by the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, there's nobody here but us and the servants, and they won't tell anybody. Lord knows we pay them enough not to.\" you said in an effort to reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have worked, because the next thing she said was \"Well, okay, as long as it's only around the grounds it should be alright.\" she said, following you out the door of your room, down the hall to the staircase, down the stairs and along another hallway, until the two of you finally reach a door leading outside, the servants stopping to stare as the two of you pass, causing Susan to blush from the tips of her toes to the roots of her hair, but nobody says anything, simply turning and going back to their business as soon as the two of you have passed, just as you said they would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading your naked and bound sister out into the garden, you inform her \"You're doing pretty good so far sis, but you're not done yet.\" you tell her.</span></div></div>",

The hard on you had worked off so recently came back with a vengeance at the site of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer incredibly long legs were clad from toe to knee in tight black leather boots with at least 6 inch spiked heels on them - the boots laced at the front all the way from her ankle to their top. Above that her thighs were completely bare showing off a lot of skin all the way up to high on her hips as she was wearing a leather thong. Her upper body was encased in a black leather corset that cinched her waist even narrower and pushed her full breasts up and out even further. Each hand had a long black glove up to the elbow. Her hair was pulled up into a pony tail from the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hand she held a cat of nine tails.

It has both an electrical plug and a USB connection to your computer, and there's an Apple logo on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit confused, you bring your computer out of hibernation and first check the Windows start menu for an unfamiliar program that might control this device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it is, right at the top, as if you use it fairly often: \"iFuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA program opens up that kind of looks like iTunes, but instead of album covers, it shows the faces and names of women. Some are movie/TV stars, some are porn stars you recognize, some appear to be Playboy centerfolds, some are even your classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you pick one of your classmates and hit control-I for \"get info.\" The window that pops up, incredibly, gives you a decent full-length nude image of her, along with various statistics about her -- and it appears that you can even change the stats. It says her bra size is 32A, but there's a slider bar which you move; going to the left, it makes the image completely flat-chested, but to the right, her breasts quickly get massive, soon overwhelming her torso. It looks weird, so you move the slider back and end on 32D -- still large on her teenage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a button at the bottom of the window that says \"Activate in iFuck Device.\" If that does what you think it does...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how is this even possible? The first thing you think of is Wikipedia, so you switch to Chrome and look up the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The <b>iFuck</b> is a computer peripheral device and accompanying software designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The purpose of the device is to create a temporary simulacrum of a human for purposes of sexual intercourse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops as you continue to read the article in its matter-of-fact tone. The iFuck can create simulacra of nearly every post-puberty woman (and man) in the world, via files downloaded from Apple's iFuck Store for no more than a few dollars each; and the simulacra don't just <i>look</i> like the person, but for all intents and purposes, they <i>are</i> the person, with all kinds of data from photos to Facebook posts to supposedly-private phone calls -- of course, some things have to be extrapolated when the data doesn't exist, such as the <i>full</i> bodies of people who have never been photographed naked, but the article cites plenty of references of people being impressed by the correctness of the extrapolated info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe article says that the simulacra will disappear if they go outside a radius of about 6 meters from the iFuck, and that the iFuck itself can't be moved while it's actively creating a simulacra. And as you saw, the iFuck software allows the simulacra to be physically altered from the original person to an extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes have pretty much glazed over by the time you get to the portion of the article detailing the worldwide court decisions, but it appears that it's not just legal, but accepted -- the device is apparently in \"over half\" of bedrooms in the U.S. at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally close your browser and go back to the iFuck software, shaking your head at how the notebook's magic interpreted your \"what if\" statement. Time to take advantage.</span></div></div>",

However you find the idea of her having sex with you just a little too creepy. It was funny as a joke but you're only 14. It just didn't fit with the Francesca you knew at all. Fortunately fetishes were a completely different story in your book.<br>\r\nyou grab the book and looked at the line <i>Francesca the maid was totally hot, and I had sex with her a lot?</i> You at first you are about to completely cross it over however you can't deny that Francesca look really hot. You just cross out the part <i>and I had sex with her a lot?</i><br>\r\nThen you wrote down <i>what if Francesca wore a diaper</i>underneath you wrote <i>Daniel</i><br>\r\n\"Francesca!\" You shout.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Daniel?\" she says coming out. She sounded different now, more casual like what you're used to with her. She's still wearing the same outfit though it seems fuller and puffier than before. She still was just as hot and with her now fuller outfit she seemed even hotter and kinkier than before.<br>\r\n\"Turn around and Bend over now\" you demand.<br>\r\nRight away her face goes from casual to irritate.<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to?\" She asks in an annoyed voice like this was the umpteenth time you had asked this.<br>\r\n\"Yes, please\" you say. \u201cI can\u2019t find my Smash Bros game\u201d you say as an excuse.<br>\r\n\"Argh, fine\" she says exasperated and she turns around.<br>\r\nAs she bends over her skirt lifts up and reveals the plastic wonder underneath.<br>\r\nYou immediately feel yourself getting excited and your dick starts to harden right away. Francisca\u2019s hot ass clad in a thick diaper is just so mesmerizing.<br>\r\nYou feel the incline to run up right away and feel it though you restrain yourself from doing so.<br>\r\nUnfortunately you didn\u2019t have much time to enjoy it as she right away picks up your game from the floor and hands it over to you.<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just laying right there, you just wanted to peek again didn\u2019t you\u201d she says, her voice taking on a threatening tone.<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you stammer, at a loss for words.<br>\r\n\"Well?\" She says, getting agitated.<br>\r\nYou slap your cheeks to snap yourself out of your stupor.<br>\r\n\"No, no, just wanted to check if your diaper was fine\" You say.<br>\r\nYou hear Francisca mumble something in anger as she lifts herself back up though she makes sure you can't understand it.<br>\r\nShe then comes closer to you and stares you right in the eye.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Francisca she says as she looks you straight in the eye \"They've been part of the uniform for years and yet you still keep dragging me in here to peek at them?\" She says in an exasperated tone. You can clearly see she's agitated though she tries to hide it and remain polite towards you.<br>\r\n\"You know...\" you say with a hinting tone, a bit baffled as to why she is reacting this way. After all wouldn\u2019t diaper checks be routine?<br>\r\n\"Yes I know I rest assured that I will tell your mother that you've again just wanted to peek at the diaper\" she says in an imperious voice.<br>\r\nShe then turned her head away from you \"If there is nothing else I will be going now\" she said as she walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis totally wasn't what you had imagined would happen. Though with Francisca's personality you really should have.<br>\r\nEven though she was the maid she made it clear that she was the older one and when your parents were out for extended periods of time she was usually the babysitter, though by now those instances were very rare.<br>\r\nHowever then the sight of Francisca\u2019s diaper popped back into your mind \u201cWow, was she hot\u201d you say dreamily. You just so much wanted to call her here in again and really feel that hot diaper of hers. You know though that she would not fall for the same trick twice in a row.<br>\r\n\u201cBut why did she react like that?\u201d you ask. She said that you had peeked at it many times but didn\u2019t she need to be checked to see if her diaper was still dry?<br>\r\nThen you understood it, you may have given her a diaper but that didn\u2019t mean she actually had to use it, it just was part of her uniform.<br>\r\nYou again grab the notebook and ponder what to do.</span></div></div>",

The smell coming from her diaper is nasty but at the same time intoxicating.<br>\r\nSuddenly you are jolted as Francesca snaps her fingers.<br>\r\n\"Daniel!\" she says with a warning tone.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Francesca\" He says almost on instinct.<br>\r\n\"Just how many times do I have to do this Daniel?\" she says with an exasperated tone.<br>\r\n\"You know very well that you're not allowed to peek or change my diaper so why do you keep trying?\" she asks.<br>\r\nYou snap your head away in anger and don't reply.<br>\r\nShe then sighs deeply as she forces herself to calm down.<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel her hand rubbing your back.<br>\r\nYou turn back to her and she now has a maternal but still stern look \"Just why can't you accept the privacy of woman?\"<br>\r\nYou growl at her but she remains unfazed by it.<br>\r\n\"Daniel just why is it so difficult?\" she asks seriously \"You've been grounded, scolded thousands of times and even spanked but yet you insist on trying to get at my diaper.\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't take that tone young man!\" she scolds.<br>\r\n\"Yes Francesca\" you say exasperated.<br>\r\n\"So why?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" you lie, you don't like lying to Francesca but you don't want her knowing about the notebook.<br>\r\n\"Don't lie to me\" She snaps and suddenly a influx of fear fills you. Did she somehow figure out about the notebook?<br>\r\n\"I know all about your diaper fetish\" you sigh in relief which Francesca fortunately didn't spot \"but why can't you learn to keep that to yourself and your online friends?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't like punishing you Daniel but I will if you can't learn\" she says in a serious tone. \"So what do you think can make you stop looking at my diaper?\"<br>\r\n\"We could always pull out your internet connection but I would really hate for it to get to that point\"<br>\r\nYou snap your head away in frustration. You actually do want to be honest with her but you just don't know if you can.<br>\r\n'if only you knew' you thought. You couldn't just control it because it was all just here. You had dreamed about seeing Francesca in a diaper ever since you discovered your diaper fetish and now it was here. It was just so hot you couldn't help it.<br>\r\nYou struggled 'maybe I can tell her after all' you thought. Right away though you shook your head 'yeah right: Hey Francesca I gave you a diaper and made sure you piss and shit in it and have to walk around in it for hours. Yeah that'll go over well'<br>\r\nnot to mention you had to tell her about the notebook and who knows what she would do with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you know you can trust me right?\" Francesca says snapping you out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n\"Yes I know\" you say as you crack a smile.<br>\r\nFrancesca always had been like a big sister or mother to you. Susan never wanted to spend any time with you as she always was out with her friends or considered herself too good to play games. Your mom was always on business trips.<br>\r\nMaybe you could tell her about the notebook after all. If you couldn't trust Francesca then who could you trust?<br>\r\n\"How have you come along with Pok\u00e9mon Daniel?\" Francesca asked changing the topic.<br>\r\n\"Not that much\" you say a bit flat. Still considering whatever or not to tell her about the notebook.<br>\r\n\"Come on, yesterday you seemed so excited\" she said trying to get you excited.<br>\r\n\"Didn't you catch Xerneas?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it was WAY too easy\" you reply a bit frustrated.<br>\r\nAfter that the two of you talked about Pok\u00e9mon and the other games you played. As you talked the topic faded from your mind.<br>\r\nShe then did a round of smash bros with you.<br>\r\nThe smell of her diaper remained intoxicating for you though and you lost most matches because you just couldn't concentrate. You kept peeking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour there is a sound at the door.<br>\r\n\"Ah, that must be your father\" she says as she puts her controller down.<br>\r\nYou feel frustrated that you lost so many matches to her, normally you completely dominate her but the diapers.... they were just so irresistible.

Francesca often drops you off there for several ours when she has errands to run.  You enjoy daycare because there is all sorts of things to do there and lots of other kids to play with.  Cyndy was five foot three with still developing B-cup breasts and a nice figure for her age.  She had long blonde wavy hair and brown eyes and the cutest smile.  In another life, when you were both freshman in high school you had a huge crush on her, but you were too embarrassed and immature to ask her out.  But now you were the best of friends and she had a sleepover like she was doing tonight when her parents wanted some privacy at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dressed in your footie pajamas for the evening, but when Cyndy got there she was still dressed in her day clothes.  Despite the beginnings of womanly curves she wore an outfit that would look perfect on a toddler.  She had on a top and skirt set with a ladybug print.  She wore white tights and black maryjanes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, she ran over and hugged you screaming your name.  She was so excited to see you as you were to see her.  You led her to your room and Francesca followed.  \"OK, Missy,\" Francesca said to Cyndy, \"lets get you out of those things and ready to spend the night.\"  She then started to undress Cyndy right in front of you.  She pulled off her top exposing her breasts still encased in a cutsy bra.  She then made her turn around an unhooked the bra allowing her boobs for be exposed.  Cyndy didn't have any embarrassment at being dressed like this and you watched as if her getting unchanged in front of you was perfectly natural.  Next Cyndy's shoes were kicked off and then her skirt and tights were removed leaving her wearing nothing but her diaper.  Francesca saw that the diaper was a little damp but not too much.  But Francesca decided that since she was dressing Cyndy anyway she might as well put her into a new diaper too.  Francesca was led the the changing table and while you watched she was stripped of her diaper and a new on was refastened.  Then like you she was also put in footie pajamas and Francesca left the room giving you an opportunity to play with your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Cyndy was dressed in a sleeveless baby creeper with a snap crotch which gave easy access to the diaper she was wearing.  She wasn't wearing any shoes or socks and was supporting herself by the bars which were around your bed.  If she didn't hold them, she would fall on her butt after a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyndy had been woken up by Francesca about an hour before.,  She had been changed and bathed in a bath which contained several floatie toys which she played with while Francesca washed her thoroughly. After getting dressed for the day in the clothes she was now wearing, she was led to the kitchen when Francesca secured her in a high chair and fed her baby mush and a bottle of formula.  Cyndy made a mess but she was wearing a bib to keep her clothing clean and a quick wipe removed anything that was left on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of the high chair, Susan took Cyndy by the hand and led her to where she is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean he doesn't know anything is wrong?\" Cyndy asked incredulously.  She saw Daniel peacefully asleep in the fetal position still wearing his footie pajamas.  His stuffed dog and paci was laying randomly in his bed.  His thumb was firmly in his mouth.  Even though the diaper he was wearing was partially hidden under his PJs, it was evident that it, was wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Susan explained, \"as far as he knows everything is perfectly normal.  When we wake him up, he'll have the lifestyle of an infant and won't notice a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that he can be so oblivious to what is so clear.  Will he speak like normal or babble liek a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll speak like he always has.  But for most other things he'll be as helpless as an infant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your mommy will be here soon, you had better just get ready for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  But I wish I could see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe next time.\"  Susan then took Cyndy's hand and guided her the few steps to her stroller.  The diaper bag which was attached to the back of the stroller contained all of the things that Cyndy had brought with her the day before.  Once in her stroller, Susan buckled her in and then proceeded to put socks and shoes on her.  She had just finished when Cyndy's mother arrived at your house.  She was in a hurry though.  She thanked Susan and Francesca for all their help and rolled Cyndy towards her car.  Cyndy was secured in the baby seat in the back of her mother';s car.  The stroller was placed in the trunk and Cyndy was driven aray.  Cyndy wanted to tell her mother about what had happened to Daniel, but her mother was too busy to to pay attention.  At a stop light, Cyndy's mother put a pacifier into Cyndy's mouth.  She smiled under the pacifier thinking how clueless Daniel truly was about his predicament.</span></div></div>",

He was a year under her in school, but somehow they had become pseudo-friends.  Susan knew that his big brother Gerald, who was seventeen was picking upon him.  He called him a sissy all the time, because of his caring ways.  After Susan received the notebook she once again saw Roger being picked upon by his jock-type brother and his brother's friend Dilton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrote in her book, \"What if Roger was as mature as Gerald and Gerald's stopped maturing at the age of two.\"  Then she wrote, \"What if Gerald's friends were as mature as he was.\"  Finally she wrote, \"What if Roger sometimes looked after Gerald and his friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan hadn't realized how many people (Gerald's friends) were doomed to have the maturity of a two year old.  Most deserved it, but some did not.  Francine, Gerald's former girlfriend, would never know how lucky she was that when they broke up, Gerald didn't simply say yes, when she said they could be friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to present:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger continued, \"My brother has a lot of friends special like him.

Susan was alone with her brother at home.  She started writing, \"What if Daniel went into Mom and Dad's room and then got dressed in Mommy's clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good start she thought, it would be funny to see her brother in her mom's clothing.  She would use her camera phone to take a picture of her stupid brother when he was all dressed up in Mommy's clothes.  But then she thought, Mom had jeans and t-shirts like everyone else.  That wouldn't be funny enough.  So she wrote another entry.  \"What if Daniel put on one of Mommy's dresses.\"  That was better.  It would make for a much funnier picture but it was not enough.  She continued.  \"What if he put on a pretty outfit that Mommy wears when she goes out with Dad.\"  Then she added, \"What if he put on her jewelry and make up too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great,\" Susan thought.  But if he did that he could be out of it by the time anyone got home.  She would have a picture but Daniel was bigger than her, he might be able to erase the picture first.  Just wearing Mommy's clothes wasn't enough either.  She wrote again, \"What if Daniel called Daddy after he was all dressed up and pretty.  What if he waited in Mom and Dad's bedroom for Daddy to see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan thought that Daniel would be in so much trouble if he was caught in his parent's bedroom wearing Mom's clothing.  Daniel and Susan had been warned not to go in there when Mom and Dad weren't at home.  But if dad caught him in there wearing mom's dress he would be grounded for a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was only eleven years old.  She didn't realize what she was making Daniel do, she thought it would be fun and that Daniel would get into a little trouble but that was all she thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew he had done this before  Diving deep he looked into the hamper.  It was full of the clothes of the entire family, him, his sister, mom and dad.  It took some looking and he found what he wanted, a pair of panties, a bra and pantyhose.  The apparel wasn't coordinated in anyway they were all just his mom's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he put on was the panties.  That was the easiest to get on.  The next thing was the bra.  He fastened it in the back and then pulled it over his head like a t-shirt.  The cups hung loosely but he didn't care.  Finally he sat on the toilet and pulled up the pantyhose.  He wasn't an expert on doing so, but he got it up his legs without tearing them.  He didn't get any sexual thrill from putting these things on.  Susan didn't write that.  Susan didn't know there could be such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed, he put on his jeans and t-shirt.  The panties were completely hidden and the t-shirt was black and loose so the outline of the bra wasn't apparent.  Now he had to decide whether to put on his socks over the hose or not.  he decided that his jeans were long enough so he didn't have to.  Finally he put on his sneakers.

It was a strange feeling he has as his mothers nylons rubbed against his pants legs. He closed his bedroom door and started to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off his shirt and pants. He was standing in his room in his own mother's underwear.Without the shirt and pants on the underwear seemed and felt lighter then what he normally wore. He took his pants and shirt and put them in the hamper that was keot in his room for dirty laundry. He didnt feel uncomfortable or strange walking around his room in the lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided that he should just put his pajamas over his mom's clothes. After all he felt very fortunate that he did not get caught. His pajamas consisted of a rock t-shirt that clearly showed the outlines of his bra. Hmm, he liked the sound of that. His bra. Maybe it is. His mother did not noyice it going missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he pulled up some shorts over his nylon encased legs. He scarmbled into his bed and pulled the blankets over his head. He felt the coolness of the sheets on his legs. He also felt the bra constrain him and the underwire made it difficult to get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny climbed out of bed and decided that the bra should be taken off. So he undid the hooks and pulled it off. Danny then found a spot in his sock drawer and buried the bra. He felt a little sad as he returned to his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he closed his eyes his mind began to wonder about school tomorrow. What is he going to do? He knew he had ro keep wearing his moms things. It made him feel so good.</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to rub his penis because he was wearing the panties.  Well he didn't want to rub it anymore than a fourteen year old wants to rub his dick.  But what he did enjoy doing was rubbing his nylon clad legs under his pajama bottoms.  The material felt so smooth, it felt good and it was fun.  It was just like the feel of a well broken in pair of jeans.  Eventually he feel asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning he had to do something.  He realized he couldn't leave the stuff in his room.  He knew his mom would visit his drawers just to put his newly washed clothes away.  When she did, she would see her clothes in his drawer and then there would be questions.  Danny didn't want that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to the hamper after mom took her shower, but even though there was a pair of panties in there now, there wasn't a bra or hose in there.  He couldn't leave them there.  What if mom noticed in the hamper a bra.  She would know it shouldn't have anything like that now.  Everything was clean.  With no other choice, Danny put back on the bra he hid in his drawer and then put his outer clothes over it.  Once again no one could tell he was wearing women's lingerie under his clothing.  Even though he had worn the same clothes for two days in a row, clothing his mom had wore the day before that, he felt great.  The clothing was so comfortable.  But for added insurance, he used an extra dose of deodorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was sure no one would notice, Danny started to enjoy wearing his mom's clothing outside.  This was the first time.  By the end of the day in some respects he didn't realize he had them on at all.  The day passed quickly and he returned home.  He had to wait for his mother to finally put her days clothes in the hamper so he could do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the time came and he could see mom's newly worn lingerie in the hamper, Danny decided it felt so good that he took of the panties and stuff he was wearing and replace them with the new panties and stuff.  He had even grown used to the bra.  Over that he put on his pajamas and got into bed.  He was soon fast asleep for the second night in lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He put the robe on over his mother's lingerie.He tried to sneak into his mom's room. He had the weirdest idea. What if I traded my robe for moms? The idea made him feel good. I will have to work on that. Then he walked to the bath wearing nothing but bra and panties. He went to the hamper in the bathrrom and went through it. He found the panties his mom wore yesterday and put them and her bra from yesterday on the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then proceeded to remove his bra and panties and put them in the hamper. He happened to see himself in the mirror. His chest was outlined like the  bra. He turned around and saw the indentations the hook made over his back. For some reason this made him comfortable. So comfortable he smiled and got into the shower. After his shower he put the new(old) lingerie on. He proceede to put his robe back on, then got dressed in his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never wore anything to tight and had to struggle with finding bigger clothes. He was tempted to go try on one of his mothers blouses, but thought better of it. He headed to school as usual  becaus, he sometines ate breakfast at school and he was in a rush. A friend of his had stolen the answer to this weeks test and made him a copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got to the cafe and saw his buddy, Sam. \"Hey man, you got the paper?\" Danny said. He liked the way the nylon of his moms panties felt against the jeans he had on.He pretended to have an itch and adjusted his bra. \"Yeah, dude its in my locker, I will give it to after PE.\" Danny felt dazed. 'We have PE today? But Sam had left the table and started walking. Danny got up and walked in the opposite direction. He went to get in line for breakfast. Panic started to set in. How will I explain what I am wearing to the guys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided that maybe if he went into the bathroom he could go in one of the stalls and get out of his mom's underwear. Then not wear any underwear in PE. He could make up an excuse about not having clean underwear. That would be better then being caught in bra and panties. He picked up his bcak pack and headed to the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so desperate that he skipped breakfast and headed to the bathroom. He was in luck there was only one person in the bathroom. They were washing their hands and getting ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny headed to the stall. He quickly peeled off his T-shirt and pulled his pants down. He stumbled because he still ahd his sneakers on. He felt the strap of the bra slip a little and he stopped struggling with his shoes to adjust the starp back into place. He slipped his feet carefully through the holes of his pants. Then he stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had gotten the bra completely off when the door swung open. Timmy Johnson and Butch Williams came barging in. Juust the two nimrods I dont need to see. Timmy was Danny's rival, he kissed a girl and this gave Timmy status. Butch was just a loud mouth. He was joined at the hip with Timmy. They could ruin a kids rep, very easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys were laughing about some event that Danny did not undertand at first. \"Im telling you Butch, Laura is so mad at you.\"  Butch said he did not care and that hed make it up some other time. Danny quickly pulled the panties down and in the process banged his head against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Timmy asked. Butch looked under the stall door and recognized Dannys shoes. \"Hey, Danny how are things?\" Butch bellowed. Danny was able to kick the panties toward the back of the bathroom away from Butch and Timmy. He was now naked except fo the bra in his hand. He quickly stuffedi it in his back pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats when Bucth caught a glimpse of Danny. \"Danny why are you naked in the stall?'  \"Well Butch, I am sick if you must now.\" Danny repiled and \"I throw on myself.' \"Well look buddy, Ill go get the nurse.\" Timmy and Butch left Danny alone. He quickly put the bra in his back pack. Then he put got dressed and stepped out of the stall to get the panties back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not know how to explain that no throw up was on his clothes. He went to the sink and splashed water on his shirt to make it look like he at least tried to wash of the puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a close one, Danny's heart never beat harder, but there was no harm done and it got Danny out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom knew how it could be when someone was nauseous and and made sure that people gave him easy access to the bathroom.  She told Danny to just rinse out his soiled clothes and then leave them in the hamper, even though she never saw them.  This was perfect for Danny, just leave some damp clothes and no one would be the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe should have just put on his own underwear, but when he looked through the hamper he saw something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually his mom wore a bra and panties with control top hose.  But today she wore something different.  Today she didn't wear hose, but she wore her panties with a tight panty-brief and with her bra, she also wore a cami-slip.  Danny hadn't wore these before and was intrigued.  He put on the panties and the shapeware briefs and found that this smoothed out his silhouette.  Then  when he put on the bra he found that the slip completely hit it from view.  That is what it was designed to do.  Without pantyhose on his feet to give him away, he could wear everything even the bra under his pajamas (or even his regular clothes) and there was no way anyone would be the wiser.  The panty-girdle (and slip) was in white like his underwear.  As long as Danny went to the bathroom occasionally like he was nauseous, no one would suspect a thing.  He could even report later that he was feeling better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the big problem was gym, what could he do there.  By accident he found a solution.  In the hamper, he saw his mom wore a pair of gym type shorts.  She called them active wear but despite it's color (a deep blue) there was something different about them.  Inside the shorts was another pair of shorts designed to be worn next to the skin, they are like having a pair of boyshort panties inside the the shorts.  He put them one and not only did they hide everything, but they were his mothers and no one would ever know.  He loved that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he wore those under his clothes when he went to school, he wouldn't have to change in PE.  Lots of students wore their shorts under their clothes.  With the cami-slip no one would know that he was wearing a bra under his shirt either.  This would work out.</span></div></div>",

He woke up every morning and went to the bathroom.  Inside he would lock the door and look into the hamper.  In the hamper would be the clothes mom had worn the night before.  It was like a Christmas surprise every morning.  He would grab the newly used lingerie and look at them.  It they were white or nude he could wear a white shirt and no one would notice the clothes underneath.  If they were other colors he would have to match the shirt he wore with the bra.  If he didn't have that color, like pink or mauve he could always wear it with a black or dark blue shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bra and panties always matched, but he didn't notice and quite frankly didn't care.  If there was shapeware he would always wear them.  If he had gym then he probably couldn't wear his mother's socks and certainly couldn't wear her pantyhose/tights.  He also had to put on his gym shorts and wear them all day under his clothes.  He couldn't change into them in the locker.  He didn't bother to wear his own underwear anymore.

As she folded the clothes she was again noticed that here was no boys briefs in the load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis struck her as strange. Is that boy going around without any underwear on? That is not very smart mom thought. She decided to take the laundry upstairs and headed straight for Danny's room. His door was closed and she knocked lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you in there?' Danny had stolen a nylon pajama set from his mother's room, it was on her bed and was the one she wore last night. Mom always wore her pajamas more then once. So Danny just went into the room and borrowed them. He was going to return them after he  was done reading his comic books. Danny was on his bed lying on his stomach when he heard the knock.He almost walked to the door and opened it. Then he realized what he was wearing, and the door was unlocked. Before he could start shedding the clothes the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Danny I wanted...\" Mom started and stopped. \"Danny, my god what are you wearing?\" Mom shriekd. Danny could not do anything but adjust the strap of the bra. \"I am sorry mom, I just..\" \"You have just lost your mind. Why are you wearing my pajamas? And my bra and panties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny hung his head. \"I just like how they make me feel.\" Danny meekly replied. \"Well young man you march back into that bathroom and take all of my things off. I am going to have to wash all of my stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny walked to the bathroom and and started taking off his mom's Pjs. His mom was right behind him. \"Danny, those panties are the ones I wore yesterday what has gotten into you?\" Danny had no response he was utterly humilated. His sister who owned the magic book was in her room and heard the ruckus. She started laughing so hard. She walked out of her room and saw a naked Danny walking back to his room with mom berating him the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSis returned to the room and pulled out the notebook.

After a couple of minutes he took the bra off and then fastened the hooks.  He wasn't sure how to put it on now.  He decided to put it on the same way he put on his panties.  He stepped into the bra and pulled it up his legs, past his panties and his torso all the way up to his chest.  The he pulled his arms through the arm straps and said \"Ta Daaa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was snickering all through the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't how it's done,\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not.

Due to your sexual desire still being there you was beside yourself and sighed deeply. \"Maybe not yet, still seems wrong but we can do this right sis?\" You asked and she blinked as she was a little confused before you wrote that she was already pregnant with your baby in the book and she blushed deeply as you wrote she was 20 weeks along which her belly was now swelling as a fetus was rapidly growing inner womb until it was at the age that you wrote. Her flat belly now ballooned out nice and round as she sat in her diaper and bicker shorts with her shirt stretched tightly around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel it moving inside me. I love you.\" She said to you as she wrapped her legs and arms around her belly happily, and the sight of her pregnant only seemed to turn you on more. This made you make another entry that you could do whatever you want and people will not find it bad or weird and will accept it. Your mind was slipping to more perverted things that you could do in public to random strangers. Feeling your sister lean against you and gently taking your hand and placing it on her belly. \"Feel that it is our baby.\" She cooed happily and this made you blush deeply as you kept your hand there for a moment.</span></div></div>",

This thought came from a couple of old men on a bench not that far away talking about the good old days, as well as two young girls that where playing on the swings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought on what would you look like as a girl went through your mind as well. On if you would look simular to your sister or completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell. You only live once right?\" You smile as you had to correct that. \"Well in my case I will life forever.\" You opened the book and to write a very detailed what of entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What if I could not die, and live forever. That if something was to kill me I would heal instantly. And had the ability to change me shape and form as I wish into what ever I want and people will be perfectly find with that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath after writing that and closed the book before closing tour eyes.  'Okay 4'2\" 65lbs, 26,23,27. Long golden brown silky hair down to my knees.\" You thought to your self and your body started to change to the sizes that you thought of. You was now sat there in your old over sized clothes in your smaller form. You was still a boy for you didn't  think of changing genders, but you looked like a girl with your thin curves and long hair. Looking down you shook your head and then wrote on the next page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What if I can mentally change my clothes to be what ever I want them to be, as well as change the clothes that other people are wearing at wI'll as well.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think on size 8 girls boy in underwear, tight jeans, a low cut tank white tank top with a blue hoodie. You watched as your clothes changed to matched what you wanted before standing up and picking up the book and started to walk over towards the girls to say hi. You now looked about their age now despite still being a 14 year old boy.</span></div></div>",

You had to do everything Susie asks of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were gone, Susie looks at the book to go over what was written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first sentence she liked very much, \"What if Daniel was never potty trained? Susie, Daniel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sentence worked for her too, \"What if Daniel was a pretty teenaged girl? Susie, Daniel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was the next what if, \"What if Daniel didn't know how to put on clothes in any way and mom usually chose what Daniel wore? Susie, Daniel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowed by \" What if Daniel has to follow every order I give him? Daniel, Susie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen \" What if Daniel will wet himself every time he hears the word \u201cpeepee\u201d? Daniel, Susan\" and \"What if Daniel will mess himself every time he hears the word \u201cpoopoo? Daniel, Susan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose last two were really unnecessary, Susie thought.  Who says peepee and poopoo.  Besides, Daniel had to do everything she said.  He isn't potty trained anymore anyway.  He would have to pee and poo eventually.  So she erased those commands.  But she wanted to write something.  Then she came up with a great idea. She wanted Daniel to have big boobs and stuff, but she didn't want it to get out of hand.  With a moment of inspiration Susie wrote, \"What if Daniel had bigger boobs than 75% of the girls his age? Susie\"  Then she backed up and changed the his to a her.  But why stop at boobs continuing she added, \"What if Daniel had wider hips and a bigger butt then 75% of the girls her age? Susie\" She didn't include Daniel's name, let her enjoy the this herself.  Daniel already knows he shouldn't have boobs and that is good enough.   Susie thought this was perfect.  His boobs and stuff would be on the pretty big' side, but not too big to look silly. They would just be bigger then three out of every four girls around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was pleased with herself and was about to put the book away to see how Daniel turned out.  \"It was funny that he couldn't dress himself but....\" Susie's mind drifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another inspiration came.  Just because he couldn't dress himself doesn't mean he shouldn't be able to look good.  Susie wrote down, \"What if Daniel was an expert when it comes to makeup, fashionable hair and pretty nails.  she always carries a purse containing her fashion supplies and constantly checked his appearance to fix any imperfections? Daniel, Susie\"  Susie knew girls like this who were constantly looking at themselves and touching up their appearance.  It was a great contrast that Daniel couldn't put on his clothes but would be powdering his nose, or reapplying lipstick, or adjusting his ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie decided to wait in her room.  She was sure that Daniel would be back to see her as soon as his diaper was changed and his makeup was applied.  The wait was killing her but she was sure it would be worth it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But just because he needed it didn't mean he had to act like a baby or use babyish terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother,\" he said trying to be more formal than his usual 'Mom' greeting.  \"I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Danni?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sort of made a little mess and I need you to help me fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's mother didn't know what he meant for a second but soon the smell caught up with him.  \"Oh you need to be changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if you aren't busy,\" Daniel said trying to hold onto his dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem.  I'll get the mat.\"  Daniel's mother fetched the changing mat and the supplies she needed and placed them on her bed.  \"Hop right on up,\" she said indicating the mat.  Daniel did as bidden and his mother set out to change her daughter.  Neither noticed when Daniel's boobs expanded to new proportions along with the bra underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My you certainly did a number on your diaper,\" Daniel's mom said pleasantly after she released the tabs and could see the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I couldn't help myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's mother pulled the diaper out from under him and then set upon wiped his butt clean.  It took several wipes to complete the job.  She also wiped the urine from his crotch.  She didn't notice that as she was working, Daniel's hips and butt expanded like his boobs had done a moment before.  Daniel was now very curvy for his age.  At 14 his curves will expand even more as he gets older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" Daniel started, \"do you think you can teach me how to use the potty?\"  Daniel reasoned if Susie wouldn't fix this maybe his mother could.  Just because he hadn't been trained yet, didn't mean he couldn't be trained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brought this on?\" his mom inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fourteen, I think I should be potty trained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's mother knew that she had never trained him, but she couldn't think of a reason why she hadn't.  She hadn't taught him how to dress himself but she didn't know why that was either.  Daniel was a normal girl, there shouldn't be any reason why she couldn't be trained.  \"Are you sure?  It's been a long time.  How come you haven't asked me before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought now was the time.\" Daniel said.  he knew that he hadn't asked before was because he had been trained a few hours ago before all this started.  Daniel's mother was finishing up the diapering by rubbing baby lotion all over Daniel's crotch and putting baby powder into his diaper.  A procedure she thought she had been doing since the day he was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I guess I can get you a potty.  Sure why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Daniel said as his mom finish fastening the tabs.  She then stood him up and pulled up his pants.  His pants had expanded to adjust to his new wider hips and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done,\" she said and then she handed Daniel his purse.  Daniel didn't remember bringing a purse with him, but it was obviously his.  He decided to take out a mirror to look at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw his reflection, he was shocked.  He wore no makeup at all and his hair was a mess.  He had all his cosmetics inside his purse, but since he had so much to do he decided it would be better to do it in the bathroom in front of a full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took well over a half hour to make his face look presentable.  He started with concealer, then foundation, blush, lipstick, eyeliner, eye shadow the list of cosmetics and colors went on and on.  Even though it did take an half hour, a hand what wasn't as expert as his would have taken much longer, since he knew every shortcut there was to bring out the beauty in his face.  He couldn't put on his own t-shirt but with cosmetics he was a Picasso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Susie assumed that no one would react well to a teenaged girl who wasn't potty trained.  She didn't want that.  She thought about what to write and decided to fix things a little.  Opening up the book in the next blank line she wrote, \"What if Daniel's former friends all thought that girls who wore diapers were hot?\"  Susie liked that.  Now Daniel's friends would be extra friendly to Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she thought again, was 'hot enough?  She decided to change it.  She changed the line to \"What if Daniel's former friends all thought that girls who hadn't been potty trained were very sexy?\"  Daniel was already pretty with very big boobs, this should give him a lot of attention from his old friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she added the final touch by adding hers and Daniel's name so he knows what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then,\" Susie thought, \"what about the girls?\"  Daniel should have some friends his own sex.  \"What if girls commonly asked Daniel for makeup advice? What if Daniel enjoyed giving his advice to the girls.  Susie\"  That should make Daniel popular with the girls.  This time she didn't add Daniel's name.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was taking a while and Daniel still hadn't come to her.  Susie decided to go and find him.  Daniel was still working on his face in the bathroom.  His hair was already combed into a nice style, but he was still working on the makeup around his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were Becky, Miriam and Amy.  \"Hi Danni,\" they all said in their own style as they entered the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey brought with them drinks and snacks for the evening.  Daniel ushered them into the living room to watch a movie.  During the movie, Miriam remarked, \"Danni,\" I just love your eyes.  How do you get them to look like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before the movie was abandoned and Daniel was giving lessons on how to blend shadows to bring out one's eyes.  This was an advanced makeup technique that Danni knew well, but few other fourteen year olds knew how to do.  Daniel wet himself a little while showing off his techniques.  But not enough to need a diaper change.  No one, not even Daniel noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Daniel's cell rang.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Daniel said.  \"Well the girls have come over.  We are having a party....I'd invite you over, but it's only girls....What have you been up to?...Really, that is great....Oh, how come?...Really???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continued.  Robert had called.  He was one of Daniel's former friends, but now he had a crush on him.  Robert was too young and inexperienced to ask Daniel for a date even though that was the purpose of the call.  In the end, Robert couldn't bring himself to ask Daniel out.  Daniel was afraid that Robert would ask him out.  He wasn't sure what he would say if he did.  This made Daniel wet even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Robert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

Daniel was like his former friends and had never asked a girl out.  Susie wrote in her book, \"What if Daniel thought boys were cute and sexy?  What if Daniel always flirted with boys?   What if Daniel loved to kissing  guys, Susie\"  Susie was eleven and didn't know very much about what dating meant.  Then Susie debated writing, \"What if Daniel's guy friends asked him out on dates? Susie, Daniel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Susie could complete her entry, Daniel's mother entered the room, she got a pink and red, nylon and lace nightgown and a pair of thick nighttime diapers for Daniel.  Daniel couldn't change his clothes in anyway.  he couldn't even put on a nightgown which required nothing more than slipping it over his head.  Not to mention he hadn't a clue how to change his own diaper which required more skill than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls,\" she said, \"I have to change Danni for bed.  You had better get changed too.\"  Then she led Danni away to change him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You had seen diapers changed, but those 'babies' had been lying down.  If you tried to do it standing up that seemed really really hard.  Lying down seemed even more difficult.  But you needed your diaper changed and only your mom could do it.  You decided to get into character and tried to cry like a baby.  But that sounded fake to you so you just called out instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommmmy, moommmyyy,\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you mother was at the door and you told her you needed a change.  You sort of felt embarrassed now that she was here to change you but she didn't seem to think anything was wrong.  She helped you up on the changing table and then unfastened the button on your jeans and pulled down the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that you realized how ridiculous this must look.  You weren't a baby, you were a boy (at least you thought you were still a boy) fourteen years old.  You were taller than your mom at this point.  But she was about to pull down your pants and change your diaper like you were a little baby.  You decided to try and prove to your mother that you weren't a little baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you know I'm not a baby,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are mommy's big girl. Aren't you, aren't you???\" Your mother said it in a sing song voice reserved for little kids.  \"Lift,\" you mother said.  She needed you to lift your butt to get your pants down.  You did as she requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am older than that.  I know math and I can read and write.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can.  My little princess is very very smart.\"  Then she pulled the tabs off of the diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really, I can spell words like, ummm,ummm,\" you said thinking of a big word, \"like computer.  It's spelled C-O-M-P...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sweetheart, now lift your butt again so I can get the diaper off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing, \"U-T-E-R...See i can spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good dear,\" she said.  Now she was wiping your privates with a baby cloth.  You were glad to see you still had a penis.  You thought you had, but you weren't a hundred percent sure without seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can't you see.  I'm almost fifteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are older than that, you are over two years old.\"  Soon she had a clean diaper under you and she threaded it through your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought maybe if you did some math.  You tried to remember what they were teaching you in math this year.  But nothing came to you.  You tried some multiplication instead.  \"Seven times six is 42,\" you announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done,\" she said as she started to fasten the tabs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babies can't do multiplication can they?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mom ignored you.  \"All done,\" she said as she pulled your pants back up.  Then she back up to let you get up yourself.  You hopped of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can't you see, I'm not a little baby.  I'm taller than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You you are my big girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even a girl,.\" you said, making a muscle with your bicep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love to pretend don't you,\" she said with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what you said or what you did you couldn't convince your mother that you weren't a toddler girl. Then you thought maybe it was just a practical joke on you.  So when she was done, you ran towards the door and then out into the street.  You were looking for anyone.  Maybe they would see you aren't a little baby.  You found a woman walking on the sidewalk.  You came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whow little darling,\" she said, \"where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother was only a few steps behind you.  \"These little ones are fast,\" she said, \"you have to watch them every minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" the woman agreed, \"I've had two myself.\"  The woman and your mother talked as if you weren't there.  By now your mother had grabbed a hold of you so you couldn't get away.  But there was no where to go anyway.  Susan was right.  Everyone thought you were just a little baby girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Then you decided that the only way out of this was to just wait it out.  Susan say she would return things to normal after a week or so.

You were frustrated so you started to whine.  \"I want to go inside,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In just a minute,\" your mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to get really annoying.

You found that you could do anything you wanted and no matter what you did everyone just said, \"She's a baby, she doesn't know any better.\"  The house seemed to be baby proofed for you so you couldn't get hurt.  The furniture couldn't be moved.  Drawers wouldn't open, electric sockets were covered so you couldn't get hurt.  You didn't have to worry about anything anymore.  You didn't have to go to school, you didn't have to worry about someone making fun of you.  You didn't have to worry about what anyone thought.  f you were bored the people around you would entertain you.  Having a pacifier in your mouth felt really good.  You found that playing with toys was a lot of fun.  You could build block castles anyway you wanted.  You could pretend to be 'grown-up' and go to school and all your stuffed animal friends would do whatever you wanted.  Your mother dressed you in the morning and even gave you baths while you played with floaty toys.  The shows for children were bright and colorful and always taught some sort of lesson.  In your room you slept in a safe crib and there was even a nightlight to keep monsters away. You didn't have to walk if you didn't want to, your mother would push you around in a stroller.  When you was out, people would always say you looked so pretty.  You could say the rudest things you could think of, right to people's faces and everyone would say, \"She doesn't know what she is saying.\"  You didn't have to worry about anything not even going to the bathroom you could do it anywhere you wanted and someone else would clean up the mess.  You could even fall asleep anywhere you wanted and you would be taken care of and kept safe.  The cutest girl in school would come over and babysit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was wonderful you thought.  You began to wonder what you ever thought was good about being a teenager.  It was hard.  You had to go to school and learn stuff.  You had to fit in in a crowd and people expected things of you.  Anyone could make fun of you and you would have to defend yourself.  As a teenager, there were so many things you wanted to do but you were too young to do them.  After a while, you couldn't think of one good thing about being older.  You were at the perfect age (two years old) you thought.  It was an age where just sitting there, looking pretty was enough to have everyone fuss over you.  You loved it.  You lost track of time, it didn't matter anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, Susan came to you and said, \"OK, Dan, I've grown bored.  You can become your old age again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

If you wanted something, someone would get if for you.  If you didn't get it, you would get distracted and forget all about it anyway.  You didn't care about what happened ten minutes before or what was going to happen in ten minutes you were always living in the 'now.'  In your playpen you could play with a toy for a few minutes and get bored with it and move onto another toy.  Then get bored with it and move on to the next.  Get bored with the last one and start playing with the first toy again as if you had never seen it before.  The same music would play over and over and you wouldn't even notice.  On TV, which was in front of your playpen, all the shows were bright and happy.  The plots were simple and easy to follow.  Everything turned out OK in the end.  Some of the most popular girls at your high school would babysit you. (Susan had written, \"What if the cute girls wanted to babysit for Dan.\")  The girls who wouldn't give you the time of day before would watch you, play with you and change your diaper when you needed it.  You were fed when you were hungry and put to bed when you were tired.  Life never seemed more perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting on the floor playing with a stuffed turtle.  You were wearing a cute toddler dress with puffed sleeves and polka dots.  Under the dress you were wearing nothing but a thick diaper.  On your feet you had a pair of socks that also had polka dots.  Susan who happened to be minding you said, \"Time is up.  I'm ready to return you to your normal life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? already?\" you asked.  It didn't see like such a long time.  Time had lost all meaning for you.  It could have been a day or week a month or even a year since this all started.  You didn't know and you didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm going to change everything back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do.  I can't make the whole world believe you are a baby forever.  that takes too much power,\" Susan said but she was lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to stay like this,\" you started to cry.  Crying came easily to you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but it's time to grow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna grow up.  I want to be a baby forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You can't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, please please,\" you sobbed.  You even started to cry harder when you realized that you had to go back to being a teenaged boy again.  You hated the idea.  You couldn't see anything good about being older let alone being a boy to boot.  It was actually terrifying to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this to me!!!\" you screamed through your tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

After looking at yourself, you said \"Dank oo\" to your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to go back to your room to play with some toys like you had done before.  But when you got there, although you found the room was made for someone of your knew size (less than two and a half feet tall) it wasn't a baby's room.  Everything was in your room the same as before, but made for a small person.  (Susan had made a mistake, she had a verbal tick of saying the word 'like' in her normal speech so that now you weren't a little baby, you were a fourteen year old who was 'like a fourteen month old'.) You found you had all the limitations of a little baby with the expectations of a teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her statement had been recorded exactly as she had said it. She thinks to herself and grins wickedly. It was time to make Daniel leave her alone. After much deliberation, she comes up with two ideas. She can make Daniel enjoy being treated like a baby teenage girl, or she can erase Daniel's name from the statement. The first option would keep Daniel the same age and height, but he would enjoy dressing and acting like a girl. The thought of Daniel wearing a prom dress and a diaper gave Susan a fit of giggles. The other option would make Daniel forget that he asked Susan to change him and he would go on with life as normal, looking and acting like a toddler, but being treated like a teenager.</span></div></div>",

Daniel started to grow again.  Daniel could see it was working and started to smile.  But as his size grew his mind dimmed.  His fashion also became a strange mixture of teenaged fashion mixed with baby style.  Obviously his briefs became a thick pair of pampers with a princess design on them, but his pants became teenager leggings (which made his diaper very apparent)  and his shirt became cropped top with puffed sleeves which proclaimed him \"Daddy's Big Princess\"  Under his shirt her was wearing a bra as he now had small but developing breasts.  Even though he was at the same height he was before, his growth spurt had ended and he was never going to be any taller than five foot four.  He was still not very steady on his feet nor was he capable of speaking sentences longer than four or five words long.  Inside his diaper, his penis had gone but he didn't know what should be inside his diaper anyway.  His entire body was a curiosity to him as he couldn't name most of it anyway.  Satisfied he toddled back to his room.  On the way he stuck his thumb into his mouth.  Once he got there he found some toys and haphazardly threw them onto the floor until he found the stuffed animal he liked.  He then set upon to create a pretend adventure with the toy elephant he preferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is how his mother found him when she came into his room.</span></div></div>",

Daniel was wearing an aqua colored scoop necked romper with cap sleeves in a soft jersey knit.  It had snaps along the inseam for easy dressing and diaper changing.  The bulge around the crotch of the romper demonstrated that he was indeed wearing a diaper.  On his feet were slip-on shoes with an all-over 'fun print' or animated animals like elephants and lions.  He didn't wear any socks.  In his hair were cutsie bows.  He was dressed like an over grown toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the living room he saw his best friend Robert.  Robert was fourteen like he was except he was dressed in a sparkle cami dress for toddlers in his size.  With only his cami straps his shoulders were bare unlike any boy or man ever had been.  It was a gold colored dress with a seamed front waist, elasticized in back and a flared skirt.  But despite the skirt being flared it couldn't hide the diaper he wore underneath.  His legs were covered in white tights and he also wore slip-on shoes except his had a bow.  In his ears were wire earrings that couldn't be removed without cutting them off.  He was carrying a stuffed doll in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was standing protectively behind his mother when you entered the room.  Upon seeing you his face lit up with excitement and he ran towards you and grabbed you in a big hug as he wrapped himself around you.  During the hug, Robert gripped his doll tightly not wanting to drop it.  After a moment he released you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny, get your toys and go play,\" your mom said.  In the corner of the living room was a box full of toys.  The toys had been placed inside haphazardly.
