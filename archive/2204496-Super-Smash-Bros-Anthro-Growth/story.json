            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a nice calm day in the smash mansion, as of now it was mostly empty as matches were in full swing. One of the residents in the manor was a young man with silverish grey hair and red eyes, his name was Corrin and he was one of tge fairly new fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough instead of relaxing after a good team match he won, Corrin was making his way to the room of one of his fellow fighters. He was the anthro vulpine Fox McCloud, a pilot and leader of the space mercenaries Star Fox. He was a little shy to be honest, seeing the muscular pilot fight alongside him was definitely...cute. Fox not only gave his own strength but also helped him when Corrin was in a pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso the Tactician Robin had summoned him to Fox's room in the first place. Stating that something urgent had happened, worry rested in Corrin's stomach as he tried to to assume the worst has happened to Fox. Soon reaching Fox's room, Corrin found the white haired shepherd rubbing his chin deep in thought, though he grew a small smile as he saw the dragon hybrid walking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin thank you for coming.\", the white clad male nodded before looking at the door to the pilot's room with concern. \"Is something wrong with Fox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin rubbed his head as he had a troubled look. \"Well...he's not in any pain or anything! Fox is just a little different from the last time you saw him.\", knocking on the door, Fox's familiar voice told them to come in. Though Corrin noted the voice seemed...bigger somehow. Opening the door, Robin quickly ushered him in before closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin widened his eyes as a strange and confusing sight awaited him. On his bed Fox was sitting and relaxing, except for the fact that the vulpine now looked to be ten feet tall! The orange furred vulpine's head was nearly reaching the cieling, additionally Corrin's pale cheeks grew a faint pink as he saw the effect on Fox's body. The silver jacket looked torn as a pair of large creme pecs pushed out from them and the sleeves were completely torn off showing a pair of huge and buff arms. Below the pecs was a firm row of six pack abs leading to a bulge wrapped in his green trousers. The toned legs had his trousers that looked painted as they miraculously haven't ripped. Finally his large paws were barefoot though his normal sized boots rested besides his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox's green eyes brighten as he smiled at the sight of the human/dragon hybrids. \"Oh hey Corrin!\", the pilot flexed one of his buff arms as he awkwardly rubbed the back of his head. \"I must look different from last time huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin stared for a few seconds before blinking as his blush darkened. \"Um..yeah you do- but what happened Fox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin frowned as he walked up. \"It seems I'm to blame, i recently came across a unknown tome that said it would grant strength. But..i didn't think the results would end like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox smiled as he leaned forward onto his knees. \"Don't beat yourself up Robin, I offered to have the spell done on me. I was hoping to get stronger for the next match so i recklessly jumped at the chance.\", leaning back Fox let out a yelp as his bed suddenly crumpled under his firm and large rear. Rubbing his now sore butt Fox looked up with curious eyes. \"But is there a way to reverse it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I still need to do research, Corrin could you stay with Fox in case he experiences any changes?\", the tactician asked Corrin, he quickly nodded and smiled. \"Ok don't worry I'll make sure nothing happens!\" Nodding gratefully Robin made his way out of the room, leaving the silver haired boy with a giant Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin tried to suppress his heating face as he walked up and sat down before the buff Fox. The pilot smiled as stretched out his toned legs resting them on both sides of Corrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about this Corrin, your pretty much babysitting me because i was reckless.\", Fox frowd rubbing his thick neck. Corrin reached out and rubbed one of the firm and warm legs. \"Don't beat yourself up Fox, everyone's had a moment of wanting to get stronger, and to be honest it's kinda...nice seeing you so big!\", Corrin closed his eyes and chuckled. Fox smiled as his buff chest grew warm at the cute face of the dragon hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

All expect one as Wolf O'Donnell walked down the empty halls until he reached the storage room for the items. A smirk then spread across his face as he carefully used one of his claws to unlock the door to the room. And upon hearing a click and opening the door the space pirate quickly stepped into the room and shut the door behind him. He then walked through the room and looked at all of the large bins that had each item stored them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once the anthro wolf had found the bin that contained all of the Super Mushrooms he walked up to it and hit the large button on it five times which caused five mushrooms to fall out of it. After this happened Wolf carefully knelt down in front of them before he opened up his purple coat and revealed five syringes in the inner part of it. He then carefully took out the juices from inside of the mushrooms with the syringes until all five of them had a orange liquid inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin then spread across the lupine's face as he picked up the remains of the mushrooms and threw them away into a trash bin. He then took out one of the syringes and stared at it for a bit while he said out loud to himself, \"Now that I've got this no one will be able to stop me. Not even Fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then put the juiced filled item away into his coat as he proceeded to walk out of the room, but not before locking it thus making it seem like no one had been there to begin with. But while he walked down the hall and into his room he thought to himself, \"<i>And the other benefit from me doing this is guaranteeing mine and Corrin's victory in any team matches that we'll find ourselves taking part in. Well after I rigged the random select function when we selected our partners before the team tournament had started.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once Wolf had entered his room and got into his nightwear and laid in bed he fell asleep still with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon waking up the following morning Wolf decided to.......</span></div></div>",

Lucina was right. Mewtwo looked horrible, most of his psychic based attacks were much smaller and weaker, he wasn\u2019t jumping as high, he was all around a mess. And it was the things like that, using up so much energy on things for other people, that caused it. As this went down, Corrin walked over and picked up 2 of the trays for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you can ask someone for help, you know. This isn\u2019t good for you, no one wants to see you like this.\u201d As Corrin said this, it became clear that Mewtwo didn\u2019t want to hear that. \u201cI am NOT weak.\u201d He said as he threw Corrin against the wall, both of them passing out, Corrin from the blow and Mewtwo due to having so little energy left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin woke up a few hours later, with Charizard and Ridley both next to him, but Charizard\u2019s attention was split between his fellow dragon and the other Pok\u00e9mon. \u201cHe threw you against the wall,\u201d Ridley said,   \u201cBut your dragon armor kicked in right before you hit the wall. He had literally zero psychic energy left, he couldn\u2019t even move properly.\u201d It was rare to hear Ridley speak, other than Samus he didn\u2019t talk to anyone, but he still had a charm to him. Corrin sat up, feeling a little dizzy but otherwise alright, when he got up and looked at Mewtwo\u2019a bedside. A lot of complicated machinery he didn\u2019t understand, all he had was a heart rate monitor, while Mewtwo\u2019s has as many things fit into a screen as possible. He couldn\u2019t make sense of it, but Ridley could. Or at least he tried. He could explain some of the scientific stuff, but the psychic stuff was completely foreign to him.

So I figured what better way to start then by remaking a Super Smash Bros growth interactive story that I had made many years ago. However, since I say remake this one is very different then the old one. Now yes, you can pick one of the anthro Smashers and they can grow huge in a variety of ways. However, the only romantic choice in this story is Male Corrin. So this story is strictly M/M. Which leads into the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. As stated above this story is M/M focused. However, other characters can show up as side characters and try to help find a solution to whatever problem Corrin and said growing anthro are dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No gore of any kind or death, or any kind of toilet stuff please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Another character can grow along with the first choice. However, they must be anthro. Like for example if Fox is chosen then Wolf can grow as well since he is a bad guy in Star Fox Zero where the Star Fox fighters from this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Please try to use good grammar and spacing when making your chapters/additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Have fun, but please try to stay focused on the plot of whichever story path you add to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Please try to keep the max size of said giant anthro reasonable. So let's have the max size be 10,000 feet. (considering how huge Bowser is at normal size) So no bigger then that, please and thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Even though this story focuses on growth make sure the point of view is from Corrin's. But to make it easier for everyone have the chapters be set in the third person.</td>",
