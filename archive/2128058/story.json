You ring the doorbell, and then you rock back and forth on your feet as you wait for somebody to let you in. A few seconds later, you can hear somebody run down the stairs inside, and then the front door finally opens to reveal Stephanie, your younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake!?\u201d says Stephanie, wrinkling her nose and cocking her head to the side. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear you were throwing a party,\u201d you say teasingly. Stephanie rolls her eyes at you, but then she gives you a quick hug and leads you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment is surprisingly quiet. You can\u2019t even hear anyone else walking around, though occasionally you hear the odd sound or two from upstairs. After showing you around, your sister brings you to the kitchen and hands you a peculiar-looking bottle of beer. Assuming it must just be some local microbrew, you accept the drink without a second thought and take a sip. You head back to the living room and sit down on the couch, but after a few more moments you start to feel very tired. After absently taking another sip of the beer, you pass out on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you fall asleep, your body shrinks down to the size of an ant. Where are you when you wake up?</span></div></div>",

He figured he must have slid down a bit in his sleep and tried to sit back up straight. He did, but everything still looked like it was higher. Then he turned and saw the armrest of the couch. Only now it looked as tall as a mountain. His senses coming fully back, he stood up and turned around seeing that he was standing on the couch, but he himself had shrunk down. The cushions that he had not too long ago pressed his back into had suddenly become the equivalent of Mount Everest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Okay Jake just calm down.\" He said trying not to panic. \"This is just a dream. That beer Stephanie gave me must have been stronger than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to test his theory, he raised a hand and brought the palm to his own face slapping himself. It wasn't a dream. The pain felt too real. Which meant this too, was actually happening. He had shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening?\" He thought aloud again. \"What did I even do? All I did was come in and Steph gave me......that beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit him like a sack of bricks. This was Stephanie's doing it. It had to be. But what was he supposed to do about it now? All it would take was a light breeze and he could go flying to who knows where. Then footsteps were heard coming closer to the couch. Jake saw one of Stephanie's friends come to the couch wanting to sit down and rest her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

You sit up, shaking your head to clear the grogginess, and you immediately realize something is very wrong. When you look straight ahead, you appear to be sitting in a fairly average bedroom. Upon further inspection, however, you notice that everything looks bigger than it should. You turn to your right, and you see what appears to be a pillow. You're clearly sitting on a bed, but the pillow looks like it's a football field away. Lying back down, you stare up at the ceiling. This almost looks normal too, but the ceiling is clearly much too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...\" you groan to yourself, barely able to believe what's happening. That beer Stephanie gave you must have been stronger than you thought. But that can't be right either: you don't feel even a little bit tipsy. You sit up again, and you finally notice that there's a desk across the room from you. Somebody's sitting at it, facing away from you. They look somewhat familiar from behind, but obviously they're just as big as the rest of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose room are you in?</span></div></div>",

Steph!\" Jake yelled, finally regaining the mental awareness necessary to identify the person sitting at the desk as his sister. \"Steph, what the hell is going on?!\" he demanded, beginning to climb down from the bed so he could make his way over to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake plopped down onto the floor of his sister's room and turned around to face her desk. \"Hey! Yo, Steph!\" Jake tried again as he jogged over to Stephanie. Clearly he was too small to be heard from such a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the desk, he looked up at his sister's tremendous figure occupying the chair. She seemed to be writing something, as her right arm was moving a bit but the rest of her body seemed fixed. For a moment the back of her head moved as she reached her left arm up to her face to rub her eye, but she soon resumed her pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! STEPH! SIS!\" Jake bellowed fruitlessly. His giant sister showed no signs of acknowledging his presence. \"My God, this is insane,\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSizing up the leg of the desk chair in front of him, Jake wrapped his arms and his legs around it and began to climb it like a smooth tree. Though the lack of rough bark was pleasant, it also made gaining traction that much more difficult. Huffing and puffing, Jake struggled to scale the leg, but eventually was able to reach upward and grab onto the seat of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoisting himself up pull-up-style, an exhausted Jake climbed up onto the seat of the chair, right next to his sister's left thigh. Grabbing the denim of Stephanie's jeans, Jake pushed on his sister's leg, but there was no way he could possibly make her budge. Jake sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he called, looking up at his sister. \"This is ridiculous, Steph, what the hell did you do to me?!\" Still no answer. \"Damn it,\" he muttered, feeling defeated. Grabbing Stephanie's jeans again, Jake climbed up onto his sister's left leg and sat down. \"Well, there's really only one thing to do now...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"If she won't notice me down here, maybe she'll notice me in front of her face!\" With that, Jake stood up on Stephanie's thigh and turned to face the rest of her body. She was still not moving much; Jake suspected she was still intent on writing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now I guess she might be a little easier to climb up the front,<br>\r\njust because of the way she's shaped. Ugh, if only it wasn't my sister I have to climb up,</i> Jake thought, unwilling to grab Stephanie the way he'd have to in order to scale her from the front. <i>I'm going up her back,</i> he decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake approached his sister's waist and carefully shimmied himself around to her lower back. \"Okay, here goes!\" he announced, grabbing handfuls of the girl's shirt. The climb actually wasn't too bad -- it was certainly easier than climbing the smooth wooden chair leg straight up. Soon Jake had reached Stephanie's shoulder, and he grappled his way on top of it. He looked down and saw that Stephanie was reading a book. A pencil in her right hand indicated that she was also making some notes in it. <i>I guess she's working on some homework before the party? Or did I miss the entire thing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turned to face Stephanie's neck, then yelled up at her ear: \"Hey, Steph! It's me, Jake! What the hell is going on?!\" Jake seemed to have finally reached the right height, because Stephanie immediately responded to the noise. Turning her head inquisitively to the left, she shifted her eyes down just a bit and spotted her tiny brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, jeez, you scared me! What are you doing over here?\" She reached up to her shoulder with her left hand and, before Jake could even dive out of the way, she grabbed him with her thumb and index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaarrgh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop! <i>Careful</i>!\" Jake protested. Stephanie opened her hand, releasing Jake into her palm, which she brought in front of her face. \"Oh my God, this is crazy! I've got to be dreaming right now!\" Jake exclaimed, slightly terrified as he looked straight at the face of his sister, a face he knew quite well, now simply monumental in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie gave a little nervous giggle, flashing teeth larger than Jake's entire body. \"No, this is totally real!\" she insisted. \"Look, I'm really sorry, but I can't have you interfering in my party tonight. That \"beer\" you had when you walked in was -- well I don't really know what it is, but it's the reason you're so small. I didn't know you'd get <i>this</i> tiny, though,\" she admitted, bringing her brother up closer to her eyes and looking at his little figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steph, are you insane?!\" Jake responded, infuriated. \"Great, so you didn't know it'd make me this small. Why'd you try to shrink me in the first place?! And when the hell does this stuff wear off?!\" he demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ummmm, I don't really know that either--\" the girl admitted further, shifting her gaze away awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?!\" Jake roared. He was beginning to panic. \"It's not permanent, right. Right?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's definitely not permanent! It'll wear off, I -- I just don't know when,\" Stephanie said, embarrased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, great!\" Jake screamed sarcastically, throwing up his hands. \"Why can't I come to your party anyway? I'm only your damn brother! And if you didn't want me here, why not just not invite me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Stephanie began sheepishly. She was beginning to feel a little stupid for doing all this in the first place, but the last thing she wanted to do was admit she was wrong to her brother, who she was still confident was in no real danger, so she began to get defensive. \"Well, I don't know, this way seemed like more fun, I guess! You can be a real pain at these parties, and I don't need you hitting on all my friends. Besides, I didn't really invite you, you just sort of found out about it, and this was another plan I had up my sleeve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your plan sucks, and you need to make me normal size again right now!\" Jake shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Stephanie exclaimed, pulling her hand and Jake away from her face. \"I don't even know if it would work, and I can't trust you not to be a nuisance at this party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, give me a break!\" he argued. \"I'll just go home then, you jerk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't trust you to do that either,\" his sibling retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for God's sake, just do it! I promise to leave!\" Jake pleaded with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie rolled her enormous eyes and brought her brother up closer to her face. Jake kept his balance as her hand moved, placing him just in front of her nose. Her nostrils were frighteningly large compared to Jake; he could feel the gentle breeze from them every time she breathed in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Steph spoke calmly to Jake, teasing him a bit. \"Just be a good little guy for the next couple of hours and <i>maybe</i> I'll introduce you to one of my friends.\"</span></div></div>",

Looking up at his sister's nose, with it's huge, breathing nostrils, Jake gulped over what he was about to do, then took a running leep off of Stephanie's palm, aiming straight for her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Jake--\" Stephanie began, but before she could continue trying to bargain with her tiny brother, she noticed that he had just launched himself off of her hand. \"Wait, what the hell are you doing?!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sailed through the air briefly, spread eagle and reaching out as far as he could in front of him. Fortunately for Jake the first step of his wild plan was successful; his hands met with the flesh of Stephanie's left nostril, which he gripped tightly. Stephanie let out a squeal of shock when he did so. The momentum he had from flying through the air transferred and immediately allowed him to swing himself up into the nostril. Jake landed flat on his back on the moist wall of Stephanie's nose, his adrenaline still pumping furiously from the stunt he had just pulled off. He grimaced a little as he looked around at the inside of his sister's nose. Wind from her breathing rustled his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Jake! What -- did you just -- did you just --\" Stephanie stammered, unable to process what she had just witnessed. \"Jake, what the hell? Get out of my nose, you freak!\" she demanded, shock quickly turning to anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake caught his breath. \"Wow, I can't believe that worked!\" he said to himself, quite satisfied. He sat up in Stephanie's nose. \"Gross,\" he complained as his hands made contact with the slightly wet flesh. \"Hey, Steph!\" he shouted to his sister, announcing his plan. \"You said you don't know when this stuff wears off, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why, are you talking about?\" Stephanie shouted back, wrinkling her nose. Jake's presence was irritating in more ways than one, and she didn't have time for his games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whoa,</i> Jake breathed, struggling to maintain balance as Steph's nose moved. <i>God, I hope this works. </i> \"Well, now you have no choice! Promise you'll make me normal right now or I'll just chill here 'til that stuff wears off! I don't think you want a normal-sized me inside of your head,\" he teased, trying his best to scare her a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought Jake had just planted in Stephanie's head <i>did</i> frighten her a little. Jake, that little itch in her nose, was now worrying her. Steph's eyes widened as she realized that what Jake was talking about was entirely possible. \"You wouldn't ...\" she started, trying to call her brother's bluff, but she didn't want to let on the fact that Jake's suggestion had actually scared her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Jake replied, putting his arms behind his head and leaning against the inner wall of Stephanie's nose. \"I don't know, Steph, I don't think you want to try me. It's really pretty relaxing in here! And all I have to do is wait,\" he warned. He hoped he could scare her out of calling his bluff, because truthfully Jake knew there was no way he could go through with what he was threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's right</i>, Stephanie thought, looking around for a way out of her situation. She hated that he was right. Stephanie didn't want to let Jake win this, but she <i>was</i> also too scared to call his bluff. The girl looked down at her right hand, which was now tightly gripping her pencil in fear, and decided how she was going to deal with the tickle inside her nose.</span></div></div>",

As she thought, she absently wrinkled her nose again as Jake's subtle movements tickled her slightly. Stephanie puckered her lips and wiggled her nose back and forth, and once she realized what she was doing, her eyes widened as she began to formulate a plan. Standing up from her desk, Stephanie walked over to her wardrobe and threw it open. She pushed past her clothes until she found a ridiculous and colorful feather boa. Stephanie wasn't really sure why she still had this thing. She only ever wore it once as a joke, and she never had any plans to wear it again, but she supposed she was glad to have it now. Starting to smile, Stephanie grabbed a single feather and pulled it off of the boa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful, Jake,\" said Stephanie, twirling the feather between her fingertips. \"You're tickling my nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jake asked, genuinely confused. Before he could figure out what his sister meant, what Jake could only describe as a giant pink <i>tree</i> suddenly burst in through the opening of the nostril. It only took Jake a second to realize what Steph was doing, and it became obvious that she had called his bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't,\" Jake mumbled, far too quiet for his sister to hear. She seemed to respond anyway as she began to wave the feather up and down, gently tickling the inside of her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie wrinkled her nose and squeezed her eyes shut as she began to stir up the urge to sneeze. The inside of her nostril tickled horribly, though she wasn't ready just yet. She took a deep breath, causing her head to tip back, and once she regained control of herself she only tickled more intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Ah-Ahh-Ahhh-!\"</span></div></div>",

He probably had very little precious time before she sneezed. Starting to panic, he grabbed on tightly to one of Stephanie's quivering nose hairs and shut his eyes. He began to plead with his sister: \"C'mon, Steph, please! Stop it! With me at this size, if you sneeze you could kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ... Aaahhh ... know not to ... aaahhhh ... climb inside people's noses?\" the girl retorted, breathing heavily as the urge to sneeze intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!\" Jake yelled back. The inside of Stephanie's nose was starting to rumble. She could sneeze at any moment. \"I wasn't actually gonna go through with it anyway, I was just bluffing! Just stop and let me out of your nose, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie's eyes were shut now and her mouth was open slightly as she prepared to let the sneeze out. She actually did take pity on Jake and was beginning to reconsider her actions. She certainly didn't want to hurt her brother, but she needed him out of her nose, too. The only problem now was that the sneeze was pretty far along already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Knock, knock, knock</i>. \"Hey, Steph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's eyes popped open as he registered the sound of someone at Stephanie's door. <i>Yes!

But it's too dangerous for me to leave you here alone, so you gotta come with me,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed. It didn't sound like he would be getting out of his sister's nose anytime soon. \"So, I should stay where I am? You better treat me well or, you know, I can make you sneeze all over your friends,\" he teased, gently moving the nose hair back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph rolled her eyes and rubbed her nose. \"Oh, please, you were practically panicking before when I almost sneezed.\" She did actually feel a little bad about that. \"I think we both know the ball's in my court on that one. <i>You</i> better behave <i>yourself</i>, or I can sneeze you out pretty fast, bro,\" she said, flaring her nostrils. \"I mean, you do kinda tickle in there ... I don't know, what do you wanna do?\"</span></div></div>",

He was pretty hungry, although the general atmosphere of his surroundings was rather unappetizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed. Growing more and more bored by the minute, he grinned when he thought of a way to have a little fun with his sister by annoying her. She deserved to be a little embarassed anyway, considering all she had done to him. Standing up and stepping away from the nose hair, he turned around to face it, then kicked the wall of Stephanie's nose near it lightly. He smiled. \"Gonna make your nose itch worse than Beth's,\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie wasn't nearly as pleased. She was currently sitting down on the couch, in the middle of talking to Natasha. She definitely felt the kick, although it wasn't really enough to produce more than a little tickle. <i>Damn it, Jake, what the hell are you doing in there?</i> she thought to herself, reaching her finger up to rub the bridge of her nose.

Even if she really did have to pee, she wasn't sure if she'd even be able to, knowing her brother was inside her own head and all. She simply sat on the closed toilet seat lid for a moment, stood up, and flushed. Hopefully that would be enough to get Jake to buy it. Either way, she also didn't see the point in telling him. Knowing Jake, he'd simply take that as permission to go back to tickling her. Stephanie was sure Jake would figure it out eventually, but at least this might buy her another moment or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jake walked calmly away from the opening of Stephanie's nostril, heading deeper and deeper into her nose. The web of hairs became thicker as he progressed, but eventually it began to thin out again. Before long Stephanie's nose hairs had all but disappeared, leaving only the smooth surfaces of her nasal passages and a few mounds of mucus. This far away from the opening, it had also started to get rather dark. Jake was still able to see, but the light coming in through Stephanie's nostril was more like the end of a distant tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, kind of spooky,\" Jake said out loud. Stephanie either didn't hear him or was ignoring him, but he didn't really expect her to reply anyway. He continued even farther, and unfortunately by the next time he stopped himself, the light from the opening of the nostril was so dim he couldn't tell what direction it was coming from anymore. Jake assured himself he could simply go back the way he came, but the more he thought about it, the more he felt like he might have gotten turned around.</span></div></div>",

A gust of wind whipped Jake in the face as his sister sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my God, he's at it again!</i> \"Jake, what the hell is your problem?\" Stephanie demanded, opening her eyes after having squeezed them shut in irritation. \"Stop tickling my nose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um --\" Jake cleared his throat, slightly embarassed by his predicament. \"Hey, Steph ...

Hoping Natasha wouldn't think anything of it, Stephanie pressed her finger against the side of her nostril. Maybe that would get Jake to stop whatever he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake let out a yelp as the nostril caved in around him. Luckily Stephanie released him quickly, and her nose sprang back into place as if nothing had happened. Sitting up, Jake scowled. There was nothing to stop Steph from just doing that again and again, so if he really wanted to bother her, he'd have to try something more intense. Jake pushing himself up to his feet and walked to the nearest nose hair. He knelt down beside it, and then he began to tickle the base of the hair with his fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph's eyes immediately began to water. She clenched them shut and took a deep breath, her head rearing back slightly. As much of an airhead as Natasha could be, she definitely noticed <i>that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Steph!\" she giggled, placing a hand over her mouth. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie shook her head as she gasped again, and she started fanning her face with both hands as the tickle in her nose took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna...\" she wheezed, her head tipping back farther and her nostrils flaring. \"Gonna sneeze! Ah... Ahh... Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jake couldn't help but feel that he'd made a mistake. At first he only wanted to give Steph an itchy nose, but he should have known this would happen. Once again, his fate was in her hands. His sister took one more deep breath, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH-CHHEEEW!!!\"</span></div></div>",

Natasha seemed to have mostly gotten over it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Steph,\" she giggled, earning a slight smile from her friend. Stephanie's smile disappeared when she caught sight of her brother, however. She never would have seen him if she wasn't looking for him, but since she was, she managed to spot his tiny form hanging on to Natasha's shirt. Suppressing her anger so that she wouldn't squish him, she scooped up her brother in the tissue and crumpled it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll throw this away,\" said Stephanie, giving Natasha a slightly forced smile. She carried the tissue into the kitchen, hoping she'd be alone there, and then she unfurled it to reveal her tiny brother stuck in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sat in the middle of the slightly damp tissue, staring up at his sister. She was holding him in such a way that he was forced to stare up at her face from below, making her look fairly intimidating. Her huge nostrils loomed above him, and they got even bigger when she flared them in anger. Not sure what else to do, Jake grinned stupidly and gave his sister a wave.

Eventually his efforts were rewarded, and he arrived at the top of his sister's head. It was a bit difficult to see through all the hair, but eventually Jake managed to make it to Stephanie's bangs. He supposed he could stay right where he was if he wanted to. There was a lot to hold on to, if nothing else.

Probably as much about him endangering himself as him embarrassing her, now that he came to think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, he didn't want to deal with it. Jake had learned form long experience that the best way to deal with his sister when she was like this was to leave her to simmer and come back when she'd had time to cool off. Besides, with him at this size... he knew she wouldn't hurt him <i>deliberately</i>, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Jake hid behind a lock of Natasha's hair as Steph got close enough to see him. He peered out between the curly strands, and for a moment his heart stopped as Stephanie scanned the wet spot on Natasha's shoulder where he'd been mere moments before. He was all but sure he'd been spotted when Steph frowned and began to check the carpet, causing him to let out a massive sigh of relief. He was safe, at least for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this presented Jake with the problem of where to go now. Natasha's hair had hid him once, but it wasn't a permanent solution. The giant girl would only need to tilt her head wrong and he'd be exposed. And, of course, nearly every part of her body had the risk of him being accidentally crushed or brushed off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake realized that this was really the same problem he had faced with Stephanie earlier. Whether it was Steph or Natasha didn't matter, the safest place for him to hide was going to be inside her nose. He sighed as he began to climb up the party girl's massive neck. At least he was <i>already</i> covered in snot this time...</span></div></div>",

Jake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie paused in shock as she watched her brother disappear into her best friend's nostril. What? And, frankly, eww! True, he had been in her nose first, but... No, wait, that made it worse! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore to the point, why was he doing this? Was that why he had made her sneeze, to escape to someone else?

It didn't matter exactly what Jake was planning, she had to stop it! She had done this whole thing to prevent him messing with her party, and running around inside her friends' bodies definitely counted. But how, exactly? The only way he'd been able to get out of her body was by making her sneeze...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph's eye's widened. Of course! She'd have to make Natasha sneeze somehow. Jake seemed to have survived it fine the first time, and then she could catch and hopefully talk some sense into him. Or at least trap him somewhere until the \"beer's\" effects wore off. But how? Natasha would get suspicious if she just walked up and started waving a feather under her nose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Natasha raised one eyebrow at her friend's obviously fake response. <i>Something</i> was up, even if she didn't know what yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Stephanie try to make Natasha sneeze?</span></div></div>",

She wasn't sure if Natasha was allergic to anything, so there weren't any obvious solutions. Eventually, Steph let out a sigh and resolved to try something a bit on the cliche side. Maybe it wouldn't even work, but it was worth a shot. Putting on a playful smile, she gave Natasha a gentle push on the shoulder and stood up from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait right here, I'm going to grab some drinks,\" said Stephanie, skipping off to the kitchen. Natasha was about to follow, but Stephanie left just a little too quickly. Why was Steph acting so weird? There was no reason why they couldn't have gone together... Deciding not to dwell on it, Natasha shrugged and sat back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving in the kitchen, Stephanie quickly grabbed two beers from the cooler and placed them on the counter. Then, after glancing around to make sure no one was watching, she shook a bit of pepper into the palm of her hand. Steph took a pinch of the black powder between her thumb and forefinger and shook the rest of the pepper off of her other hand. Then, she grabbed both beers with her free hand and returned to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back!\" she declared, standing behind the couch. Natasha tipped her head back and stared up at her friend. Seeing a beer practically with her name on it made her forget all about Steph's strange behavior. She quickly snatched it out of her friend's hand, nearly making Stephanie drop both of them, and she immediately took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natasha settled back down on the couch, Stephanie remained standing over her from behind. Leaning over her friend, she could see the top of Natasha's nose peeking out below. After another quick glance to make sure no one else was watching, Stephanie held her other hand over Natasha's head and began to sprinkle the pepper she had been holding onto her friend's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jake had no idea what was going on. He couldn't see Stephanie's awkward facial expressions, and based only on hearing what she'd been saying, he didn't suspect a thing. Or at least not until Natasha suddenly sniffed hard, scrunching up her nose. Jake was briefly lifted up by the rush of air, and he quickly grabbed onto a nose hair the second he was able to. He hoped that was just a random sniff, but then Natasha did it again, twice this time. The ground below Jake's feet shook violently as Natasha wiggled her nose, and Jake could only pray he wasn't about to be sneezed out a second time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natasha sniffed sharply and scrunched her nose as a pungent scent invaded her nostrils, seemingly out of nowhere. It brought along with it a strong tickle, her nostrils flaring involuntarily. The blond girl frowned. It almost smelled... spicy? She knew that strange scent was familiar, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Natasha put it out of her mind... or tried to. The itching in her sinuses was getting really insistent, and she knew wouldn't be able to ignore it for much longer. Not wanting to interrupt the conversation, Natasha wiggled her nose back and forth trying to dislodge whatever was irritating her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it wasn't enough. No matter what the did, the sensation gathering in her nose only got stronger, fast approaching critical levels. Finally, she spoke up. \"H-hey Steph?\" She began breathily, \"D-do you smehhhh... smell s-something...?\" Her eyes were unfocused, staring into the distance as the sneeze gained momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Steph replied, to distracted for a more detailed response. She was studying Nat's face carefully, trying make sure she saw where Jake flew when the explosion came. As she watched her friend's eyelids began to flutter, her round nostrils flaring widely. Nat took a deep breath, head tipping back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and nothing. \"<i>Uhggggg...</i>\" Nat groaned, scrubbing furiously at her nose with her wrist. She <i>HATED</i> when that happened. The urge to sneeze had vanished at the last second, but her nose still <i>itched</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there must be something in the air,\" Nat complained, not noticing Stephanie's frustration. \"First you sneeze, then me... well, almost... guh, it's still <i>itchy</i>...\" Nat sighed, finally removing her wrist with a quick sniffle. Was this what Beth felt like all the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jake groaned as he peeled himself off Natasha's nostril wall. He supposed he should be grateful that he hadn't been sneezed out, but Natasha rubbing her nose like wasn't exactly pleasant either. The fact that Nat's nostril walls were squishy and bent rather than crushing him had prevented serious injury, but he'd definitely be sore in the morning. Hadn't he come to her nose to be safe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pain faded, though, Jake couldn't help but wonder about Natasha's sudden sneezyness. He didn't think that she was sensitive enough to be set off just by him climbing inside. Almost as soon as he asked the question, he spotted a clue: the countless grey and black objects strewn across Natasha's nasal landscape. They definitely hadn't been there when he came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe objects came up to between his ankle and his knee, and in fact looked remarkably like rocks. Given the scale, though, they couldn't be. Jake leaned down to examine one, only to frown at the smell. Pepper? Had Steph brought chips along with the beer or something? And how had it gotten inside Nat's nose? There was some tiny detail that was nagging at the back of his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakes blood froze as he remembered it. Pepper. Known for making people sneeze. Hardly daring look, Jake scanned the nostril, confirming his suspicions. The light pink walls of Natasha's nose were deepening to red, mucus beginning to drip down them and pool on the 'ground'. As if to underscore the point, The world around Jake shuddered and Natasha's nostril gave a small twitch. She might not be on the edge of sneezing at the moment, but her nose was definitely not back to normal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile. Stephanie's eye twitched in frustration as she saw Natasha's sneeze vanish at the last moment She had been <i><b>*so close*</b></i>. Well, there was nothing else for it, she needed to get Jake out of there. Who knew what he was getting up to in there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Stephanie do next?</span></div></div>",

As mad as she was at Jake, she didn't want Natasha to be mad at her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie suddenly had an idea. She looked down at her hand, and there was still the tiniest amount of pepper left on her fingertips. It probably wasn't enough to do anything significant, but it was worth a shot. Steph watched Natasha sniff and wrinkle her nose for a few more seconds, and then she lifted her finger and placed it firmly under her friend's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help,\" Stephanie said with a giggle, hoping Natasha would just think she was messing around. She turned her finger over, placing the peppery spot right underneath Natasha's left nostril. Stephanie watched as Natasha immediately clenched her eyes shut and sniffed. It was working! Better yet, if Natasha did sneeze, Jake might get blown right onto her finger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steph, I...\" wheezed Natasha, prompting Stephanie to smile. \"I'm... I'm gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie's eyes widened in anticipation as Natasha took a deep breath, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha let out a little sneeze, her head barely bobbing forward. Jake stumbled forward, but compared to Steph's sneeze, that was nothing. Little did he know, however, that Natasha was only getting started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Hn-Choo! Choo! Ha-Choo! Ih-Choo! Choo! CHOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie could feel the spray of Natasha's sneezes on her finger, each one a little bigger than the last, but she didn't care. Her plan had been a success, and she was about to have Jake back in the palm of her hand, almost literally. She smiled as Natasha gasped for breath and then gave a final, big \"Ah-CHOOOO!!!\" that left her feeling defeated and out of breath. Stephanie quickly removed her finger from under her friend's nose and stared down at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gesundheit,\" said Steph, barely paying attention to Natasha anymore.

Then she gave a strong sniff, nostrils flaring, hopefully sucking Jake far enough back that he won't be able get out again quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, sorry,\" Steph said to Nat, preparing to get up. \"I'll go get us some tissues.

There were no nose-hairs this far back, only smooth pink flesh and glistening snot structures that hung like brides between the two walls of the massive organic cavern. The light from Stephanie's distant nostril was a dim and defuse, barely enough for Jake to see his hand in front of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of hands, Jake used one to rub the back of his head. \"Owwww.... Steph's got some lungs, apparently.\" Thank goodness her nasal walls weren't hard. Although... what had she been doing? Had she not realized he was on her her finger? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake began to survey his surroundings, but he froze when he head Stephanie's voice echo through the chambers inside her head.

She bit her lip, wiggling her freckled nose back and forth in a desperate attempt to alleviate the urgent itch building inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she was out of sight, Steph book into a run, clamping one hand over her nostrils. She was <i>so close</i>, the doorway to the kitchen was right int from of her, but she didn't know if she could make it that far. Her nose was sending itchy, irritated signals to her brain stronger than ever, and no matter how hard she tried Steph couldn't stop her body from responding. She felt herself take a deep breath, then another as her lungs filled up, preparing to blast her annoying sibling from her nasal cavity. She was in from of the cupboards now but she couldn't <i>see,</i> her eyes were fluttering shut and filling with tears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaintly Stephanie heard Jake laughing inside her head, taunting her.

Y-you're nah<i>hHH</i>! n-not escaping this tihhh... t-tehhHHhhHHHH...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his sister's head, Jake grinned. Steph was about to about to blow, no matter what she said. She couldn't even finish the sentence! The pink slimy wall beside him was stolen and throbbing, bright red with irritation as he raked his fingernails across it, as well as giving the hypersensitive membrane the occasional kick. A sudden gust of wind nearly blew Jake off his feet as Steph's chest expanded, taking in air. This was going to be a wild ride... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hheeEEH<i>HhhHHHH...</i> HAA<i>HHhhhHHH-!!</i> <i><b>KATCCHHHHEEEEWW!!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake whooped as her felt throughout the air to freedom... only to land hard, far earlier than he expected.

She was going to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"huTSHEEW!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake cringed as he was showered in moisture as Steph sneezed again.

Stephanie grinned. \"Sorry Jake, but did you really think I didn't realize you'd be a able to... make... me... <i>onesec</i>...\" Stephanie turned and sneeze a final <i>he-TCHHH!!</i> over her shoulder, making the jar wobble. She laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...make me sneeze. Wow Jake, you really did a number on my nose. Shame you couldn't do it faster, but hey.\" She shrugged.

That was Brianna in a nutshell: always happy, even if it didn't make much sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, Brianna,\" Stephanie replied. Her urge to sneeze had died down, but she still felt a pretty potent tickle in her nose. No longer caring if anyone noticed, Stephanie reached a finger up to her nostrils and rubbed back and forth underneath. That dulled the tickle enough for her to ignore it, but she knew it would be back sooner or later. Turning her attention back to Brianna, Stephanie was a bit surprised to see the energetic girl simply staring at her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you need something?\" asked Steph, oblivious to how rude that might have sounded.

Then again, when three of the other choices consisted of a girl who hated him for no reason, his sister, and his sister's right-hand woman, that wasn't a high bar to clear. In any case, getting sneezed onto Brianna was surely preferable to whatever Stephanie had in store for him. Luckily for him, he was so far back inside Steph's nose that he barely had to do anything to irritate her. In fact, simply running back and forth seemed to do the trick...</span></div></div>",

What ever Jake was doing, it was working, causing a powerful itch back between her eyes. She scrubbed furiously at her nose again, but Jake was too far back, out of her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph's eyes crossed as she stared at the offending organ, trying to will the tickle out of existence. Her face went red with effort as the tried to control her body, stopping it from expelling Jake, but it was no use. All the social butterfly's body knew was that some foreign object had gotten to somewhere it definitely didn't belong, and it needed to be removed by any mean necessary. Stephanie held her breath, her cheeks puffing out in a last ditch attempt to halt the burgeoning reflex, but the frantic itching in her nasal cavity signaled that it would't be delayed for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Stephanie only lasted a few seconds before her breath escaped in a huff. Her head tilted back with a small gasp, nostrils flaring massively. The giant girl's lips trembled as familiar sounds began to come from her mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ahh... HihhHH...! h-HEHhh...! <i>hUHH-!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna might have been oblivious sometimes, but she definitely noticed <i>THIS</i>. In a couple more seconds she would have put it together, but for the moment all she realized was that her friend was making a strange face and weird noises. Oblivious to what was about to happen, an expression of concern spread across Brianna's face. She peered at her distressed friend, unknowingly placing herself directly in the line of fire. \"Steph, are you alri\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>HUTSHHEEEW!!I</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake curled into a little a ball Steph sneezed directly into Brianna's face, placing his arms over his head.

Opening his eyes, he got a view that was rapidly becoming way to familiar: Human skin viewed from really, really close up. Wonderful. Now where on the body was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncurling from a ball, Jake saw the tremendous brown globes of Brianna\u2019s eyes hanging above him, currently opened wide in shock.

What was it with him and noses, it had all started with\u2014 STEPH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake whirled around to see his sister stating facing Brianna, her eyes still closed as she tried to fight off another sneeze.

It still seemed huge from his tiny vantage point, but luckily Brianna's face was far enough away to keep him out of reach. Deciding not to waste any more time, Jake continued on as Stephanie suffered through the rest of her sneezing fit. It wasn't easy, but Jake managed to swing himself into the opening of Brianna's nostril just as Steph sneezed again. Before taking any time to look around, Jake laid down at the edge of the nostril and peeked outside. Brianna's nose was upturned enough for Jake to see Stephanie's lower body, and since he couldn't see her face, he hoped that meant she wouldn't be able to see him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Brianna giggled, amused by her friend's continued sneezing. \"Gesundheit, Steph. You know, you can squeeze your nose to hold the sneezes in. That's what I do. Like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jake could realize what Brianna was saying, the opening of the nostril suddenly closed up around him as Brianna pinched her nose between her thumb and forefinger. He was small enough that being squeezed by Brianna's soft skin didn't hurt, but he could barely breathe and he couldn't move at all. Luckily it didn't last long, and Brianna quickly released her nose. She giggled again, hoping Stephanie might take her suggestion, but the other girl simply groaned and stomped out of the room.</span></div></div>",

He could be anywhere by now, and at his size there was no way she'd be able to spot him unless he was literally in her face.

Although the collection of tiny hairs inside Brianna's nostril looked like a forest from his perspective, they weren't <i>really</i> a forest. As Jake relaxed a little and leaned against a nearby 'tree', the nose hair bent under his weight in a decidedly un-tree-like fashion. Before Jake could realize what was going on, the tip of the bending hair poked into the sensitive inner wall of Brianna's nostril, then skittered ticklishly across it as the hair bent further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna's nostril twitched. A moment later she gave a tiny sniff, not even consciously aware of the small tickle in her left nostril. It would have gone almost completely unnoticed in any normal conversation, but under Stephanie's laser-like gaze it was as good as a flashing neon sign saying 'Jake in residence.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it must have been my imagination. Sorry!\" Immediately Steph pulled back, all smiles and apologies. Behind her cheerful facade, though, her brain was working at a million miles an hour. Could she get Brianna to sneeze Jake out? That hadn't exactly worked so great last time... they were in the kitchen, maybe she could get her to sneeze him into a jar or something? It wasn't a good plan, but what was the alternative, just telling her?

His sister's <i>left</i> nostril had nothing of the sort, but she had gotten a small stud in the right one a couple years ago. He just needed to get over there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to tickle Steph's nose any further, Jake slowly tiptoed over to the edge of her nostril, sitting down and dangling his legs over the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made the mistake of looking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had never thought of himself as the type to be scared of heights, but even he felt a wave of vertigo strong enough to make him close his eyes. At this scale, Stephanie's body didn't even look like a person anymore, just a sheer, endless cliff of fabric and pink that he had to keep reminding himself was actually skin. Up till now he had thought of himself as tiny rather than everything else as large, but now the whole affair flipped into a terrifying new perspective. Exactly how many miles up was he, relative to his size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think too hard about what he was doing, Jake slid down onto Steph's upper lip. <i>Don't look down, don't look down...</i> Instead, Jake did his best to look outwards as he slowly shuffled along his sister's upper lip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in time to see Natasha look up from wiping her face. Jake could see an expression of mixed shock and disgust move across the giant girl's face as her eyes locked onto him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Steph...?\" She began hesitantly, gesturing in the vague direction of her upper lip \"You've got a little, uh, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie clapped her hands over her nose and mouth, cheeks burning even brighter in humiliation. As flustered as she was, it didn't even occur to her that the booger Nat had spotted might be her brother. All that crossed her mind was that she had snot hanging out of her nose for all the world to see. \"I-I, uh, I've gotta...\" Stephanie stuttered out, before turning tail and fleeing in search of a tissue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jake pulled himself up into her right nostril, heart still pounding. Having two building-sized palms slam to a halt mere feet (from his perspective) from his face was a bit of a shock, to put it lightly. Still, at least now he was within sight of his goal. Seen on this scale, the inner end of Stephanie's piercing looked like a small radio tower jutting out from the wall, or maybe some massive work of abstract art. Jake sighed with relief. It was the kind that came in two parts, and the inner half had some very convenient loops as part of its structure. Jake took off his belt and threaded it through one of the loops, effectively lashing himself to the large metal anchor. The shrunken sibling grinned. He'd like to see Steph sneeze him out <i>NOW.</i> And now that he could tickle with impunity...</span></div></div>",

Locking the door behind her, she grabbed some tissue paper and stood in front of the mirror, pushing her nose up at the tip with her index finger to expose her nostrils. She scanned them for her brother, but wasn't able to spot the tiny troublemaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake!\" she hissed between her teeth. \"What the hell is your problem? Jake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's that, sis?\" Jake answered sarcastically. He hadn't begun to tickle her again just yet; he had realized that she was upset and planning something, so he figured he would toy with his sister first. \"Are you not happy anymore having me inside your nose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you jerk!\" was the reply he earned. \"You just made me sneeze all over my best friend! Now get the hell out of there or else! I warned you to behave yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Jake began. \"Get the hell out or else ... what? You'll sneeze and blow me out of here?\" he mocked, pulling the nearest nose hair toward him and letting go. It swung back and forth like a tree branch. \"I don't know, Steph, I don't really find your argument that compelling. If I do recall, you already sneezed less than five minutes ago and -- well, I'm still here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie realized that, although she had no earthly idea how her brother had pulled off that feat. She wasn't going to give in to him: \"Well, you just got lucky! I'll just -- I'll just keep sneezing until you're out of there!\" she threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did get lucky the first time, I can admit that. But I don't need luck any more,\" Jake proclaimed, holding proudly onto the belt tying him to his sister's nose piercing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie had no idea what her brother was talking about. \"Whatever, your luck just ran out, you little pain. I don't have time for your games!\" she said, pushing her nose up again to look for Jake, who she hadn't actually found yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, do your worst!\" Jake called her bluff. He was ready to have some fun with this, now that he was sure Stephanie couldn't launch him from her nose. \"What, are you gonna go get that ridiculous pink feather again? Or am I just gonna have to do all the work for you?\" he teased again, shaking the blonde nose hair near him up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie could feel that disturbance inside her nostril. <i>Seriously, what the hell is his problem? Is he actually gonna try to make me sneeze again?</i> \"You're crazy!\" she sniffed, rubbing a finger under her nostrils. She was starting to get genuinely upset that she no longer seemed to be able to intimidate her brother. He had some sort of new wave of confidence that was beginning to irritate her. Moreover, it was a little embarassing that Jake was flaunting more power over her nose than she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could,\" Stephanie said, referring to retrieving the feather. \"Or I might not even need it.\" She rummaged through the bathroom and found a q-tip. \"I think this would work, too,\" she warned, trying her best to scare Jake, but the feeble attempt was unsuccessful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake yawned. \"Well, go ahead! Bet I can beat you to it,\" he said, lazily swishing the same nose hair near him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister wrinkled her nose up in response. \"Stop!\" she whined, embarassed again by the fact that she knew he was right. \"That tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no kidding,\" said Jake, unphased. \"So are you gonna make yourself sneeze or what?\" He impatiently continued to play with the nose hair. His sister snorted, blowing Jake off balance, but his belt kept him securely anchored. He grinned.</span></div></div>",

He threw all of his weight against the nearest nose hair, causing it to sway from side to side. After building up some momentum, he managed to bend the hair far enough that it bumped against a second hair. It seemed like that was too much for Steph to bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake smirked as his sister gasped for breath. She lost her grip on the q-tip, causing it to fall straight out of her nose, and she began frantically waving one hand up and down in front of her face. The tickle in her nose was already strong enough to make her eyes water, and that was the last thing she became aware of before completely losing herself to the urge to sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Aah... Aaaah...\" Stephanie wheezed, her head tipping back with each breath. Jake was confident in the strength of his belt, but he stopped tickling and held on to Steph's nose ring just in case...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH-CHHEEEEW!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie doubled over with the force of her sneeze. It was even bigger than the one she had let out all over Natasha, and both she and Jake could feel it. The powerful gust of air picked Jake up and caused him to flail around like a tree in a hurricane, but he remained securely fastened to the nose ring. He did feel a bit wetter after the sneeze was over, but he was still in decent shape and he hadn't been blown out, so he still considered it a victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Steph wasn't so lucky.She firmly rubbed her finger back and forth under her still-tickly nose, and after she opened her eyes, her face turned bright red when she looked up at the mirror. A few boogers had splattered in the middle of the reflective surface, obviously blown out by her sneeze. Biting her bottom lip, Stephanie let out an embarrassed whine and began to wipe the mirror clean with a tissue.</span></div></div>",

I'm gonna sneeze you out of there eventually!\" She didn't know exactly what he was doing to keep himself from getting blown out, but she was <i>not</i> going to loose to him damn it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Jake drawled, smirking. He supposed it was possible that she might be able to do it eventually, but he was almost certain she hadn't thought this through. \"And what are you going to do when you come out the bathroom twenty minutes later looking like Beth in the middle of a field ragweed?

Sure, messing with her might be satisfying, but... there was a difference between a prank and ruining this party that she had been setting up all week.

He undid the belt lash tying him to Stephanie's piercing, and dropped down to the floor of her nostril. \"So, are you gonna give me time to get all the way back there? Or--\" before Jake could finish his question, Stephanie plugged her left nostril with her finger and sniffed hard.

After picking himself up, he immediately started to run toward the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hihh!\" Stephanie gasped, and Jake nearly fell as her nose trembled. The light at the end of the tunnel dimmed for a second as Steph rubbed her finger back and forth under her nose again, partially blocking the opening of her nostril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, that tickles,\" Stephanie complained, prompting Jake to roll his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?

This time he walked a bit more slowly, and while Stephanie didn't react, the opening of her nostril was so distant that Jake could hardly tell if he was actually getting closer to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, how long has it been?\" asked Jake, annoyed that he even had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost a minute,\" answered Steph. Jake slapped a palm to his forehead, and then he increased his pace to a jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're tickling my nose,\" Stephanie said again. It wasn't as bad as last time, but she wasn't exactly fond of the sensation in any amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!\" yelled Jake, fighting the urge to break out into a run again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should,\" Stephanie continued. \"It's going to make me sneeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Steph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Jake threw caution to the wind and resumed running. Stephanie's nose seemed to be a bit less sensitive here, and the increasingly-dense nose hairs limited how fast he could go anyway. Before long, Jake was about as close to sprinting as he could get, and the opening of Stephanie's nostril was almost in reach.</span></div></div>",

He decided to try his makeshift ladder idea instead, though that was still a bit tricky. None of Stephanie's nose hairs were quite that close to the openings of her nostrils, and on top of that, his arms and legs could barely reach all the way across her septum even when fully splayed. This time, Jake didn't even make it as far as his first attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up on trying not to make Stephanie sneeze, Jake turned his attention back to just one nostril. Knowing he had no time to lose, he began to climb straight up Steph's nose hairs. He slipped when Stephanie gave a shudder, but that only spurred him on harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... Haahhh...\" Stephanie breathed, genuinely feeling a sneeze coming on. Jake didn't have time to think about whether or not she was faking it, so he just kept going. The final stretch was going to be difficult. Steph's nostrils didn't quite reach all the way to the tip of her nose, so Jake had a bit of bare skin that he needed to traverse. Standing up as tall as he could, Jake reached his hands up toward the tip of the nose, and the instant he felt he had a good grip, he pulled himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, you made it,\" said Steph, noticing the tickle in her nostril suddenly vanish. She crossed her eyes and looked down the bridge of her nose to see Jake sitting on the tip, looking exhausted. Smiling to herself, Stephanie lifted a finger up to her face and rubbed back and forth under her nostrils, nearly knocking Jake off her nose as the tip squished from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steph, come on...\" Jake groaned, too tired to raise his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you tickled my nose,\" Stephanie replied, continuing to rub. \"Your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever.

I thought for sure you would've made me sneeze!\" Stephanie tried to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's called losing a bet, Steph! Now you have to pay up!\" Jake demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But -- but that's the thing,\" she stammered, raising her finger again to rub her nostrils, causing Jake to clamp the tip of her nose with his hands and thighs for support. \"I -- I really don't know how,\" she sighed. \"All I know is it's not permanent, but I don't have, like, an 'antidote' or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotta be kidding me,\" Jake muttered darkly. His sister sounded sincere. \"Really? So you're telling me you let me take that bet and you knew damn well that you couldn't deliver? You liar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't lie! Well, not really ... I mean, you wouldn't get out of my nose and ... and you originally came up with the deal, I just changed the task, and ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" an aggravated Jake yelled. \"If you don't have to hold up your end, then I don't either! That means I'm not gonna stop bothering you until your party's over!\" He quickly dropped down to Stephanie's upper lip. Though he was growing awfully tired of it, there was really only one place where Jake was free to torture his sister. Looking up the nostrils again looming before him, he kicked her septum in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie gasped a little. \"Ow! Wait ... wait, Jake, I ... hehhh ... I have to get ... hahhhh ... back to my party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake charged straight back into Stephanie's nose right after he delivered the kick. It was totally worth it to express his anger, but now he had to make a run for her piercing and grab on again in case she sneezed.</span></div></div>",

When Stephanie returned to the living room, Veronica was in the middle of a round of beer pong with Natasha. Once they finished, Stephanie stepped up to face Brianna. Brianna went first, missing her first toss. Then, once Jake was fairly sure that Stephanie was about to make her throw, he struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out as far as his belt would let him, Jake gave one of Stephanie's nose hairs a kick. It swayed back and forth, and from the rumbling all around, Jake could tell Steph had wrinkled her nose. Once the nose hair swayed back to him again, he kicked it a second time. The hair bent farther away, and this time it even reached far enough to hit another hair on the other side of the nose. That had worked fairly well last time, so Jake hoped it would have a similar effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... Haahh...\" Stephanie breathed, feeling a sneeze coming on. She rubbed a finger back and forth under her nose, nearly dropping the ping pong ball from her other hand. For better or worse, she didn't have long to think about it before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-CHEEEW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Bless you, Steph!\" giggled Brianna. \"Still got a case of the sneezes, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so,\" Stephanie grumbled, rubbing her nose again. After a few more rubs, she firmly pressed her nostrils up with the side of her finger, hoping that would at least jostle Jake around a bit. Steph took her toss, and she also missed. All the while she could feel another tickle building up in her nose, but only time would tell how bad it would get.</span></div></div>",

It was delicate, dangerous work, and he knew doing it tickled, but he thought he was getting the hand of it. Every time he shifted his weight to a new hair Steph's nose would tremble slightly, and he would carefully wait for it to settle down before moving on. Out of the corner of his eye he kept an eye on her expression in the bathroom mirror. It was pretty comical at the moment actually, with her staring at her nose crosseyed and biting her lip. Still, it was worth watching out for signs of an approaching sneeze that wouldn't be visible from the nose, like fluttering eyelids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake smiled as he pulled himself higher. For the first time since starting this bet, he was confident he could pull it off. He felt Steph's nose twitching under his hands, but as long as he was careful to not tickle her that extra little bit he could make it to the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, of course, was when everything went wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake frowned as a shadow fell across him. For a moment he thought it was just a cloud passing in from of the sun, before he remembered that the alien landscape of his sister's nose was still indoors. When he twisted around to to look, the thing floating between him and the celling light did indeed look like a gross parody of a cloud. It looked like a tangled, fluffy mass of fibers and particles, all slate grey. Several more hovered behind it, seemingly without support. It took Jake a few moments to process what he was seeing. They looked huge because of his size, but he was looking at several flecks of dust floating through the air just outside Steph's nostril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake ran through that sentence again in his head. His eyes widened. \"Wait, Steph, don't-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. Jake watched in horror as the specks of dust disappeared into the depth of Steph's nose, sucked up as she inhaled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment there was silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jake saw Steph's expression in the mirror. Her mouth had gone slack, and her eyelids began to droop. The nostril shook and then <i>stretched</i>, nose hairs moving away from each other as the massive structure flared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ehh... h-hihh... hhuHH...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake clung tightly to his nose hair, halfway up the side of his sister's nostril. He hoped desperately that Steph would be able to hold back, but it was looking less and less likely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haahh... AHHH... het-<i>CHOOO!!</i>\"</span></div></div>",

He must be somewhere in the bathroom now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing, he slowly picked himself up. The thick dust clung to him. He was going to be covered in bruises tomorrow after that... Where the heck <i>was</i> he? He hadn't seen much of the bathroom, but this didn't look like any part he recognized. It was too SMALL. The metal ceiling above looked cathedral-sized to him, but he doubted someone on Steph's scale could even fit their head in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Jake spotted what looked to him like a sheer cliff, the floor just <i>ending</i> beyond a set of massive metal pillars. Except they were't pillar shaped exactly, the looked more like vertical sheets of metal. Approaching the edge, he could see the top of Steph's head far below as she frantically searched the bathroom. Wait. The top of her head? He must be up near the ceiling... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the scene flipped into a new perspective. He was in... Well, it was a hole in the wall near the ceiling... Those pillars must be a grate of some sort... An air conditioning vent? Now that he though about it, Jake could feel a steady breeze flowing from behind him out into the room. So he was in a vent. More importantly, how the heck was he going to get Steph's attention from up here!? He actually felt a little bad for her as she checked every surface in the bathroom for him. She actually looked legitimately worried. \"Come on, Steph!\" Jake urged, waving his arms \"look up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she didn't seem to be catching on. Maybe he was simply too tiny and far away to spot, or maybe she just never thought to look up, but Jake's heart fell as Steph began re-checking the same places, panic apparent in her expression. Nervously he eyed the drop. Hey was pretty sure that being tiny made falls safer, it was pretty much the only explanation for how he'd survived that sneeze, but he didn't want to test if her could fall <i>that</i> far. Could he climb down? He'd climbed Steph before, but a smooth tile wall was very different from soft flesh and fabric. He needed to make up his mind soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...too late. Jake watched in horror as Stephanie left the bathroom looking dejected, worry and guilt showing on her face. Jake softly heard her mutter \"...find him when he's back to normal size...\" as she flipped off the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake stood in the dark for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, <i>fuck</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

Afterward, she lets out a sleepy moan and brings one hand back to her face to rub her fingers back and forth under her nose. After rubbing for a second, Beth lets her hand fall back to her side and she sniffs, nearly knocking Jake off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake waits for a few more seconds to see if Beth will move again. She keeps still, and then Jake resumes his climb. He starts getting worn out once he's halfway up Beth's cheek, so he decides to stop and rest for a moment. To the side her can see Beth's ear, partly covered by her brown hair but still accessible. Ahead, he can see Beth's nose peeking above her cheek, air flowing in and out as she breathes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Jake decide to go?</span></div></div>",

Jake notices these small hair's coming out from her ear. He hops down from her tragus and gets a good long look at the inside of Beth's ear canal. Much to his surprise, it was loaded with earwax and hairs. It was almost nauseating to him seeing all these wads of yellow waxy boulders and sludge piles coating the walls of her ear canal. Having some brown hairs protruding and breaking through this oppressive heap of wax. Jake then stops to think to himself about how he could get Beth's attention from in here. </span></div></div>",

It was awfully dark inside the nostril, but he could see a little bit farther inside. He naturally never really thought about what the inside of a nose would look like, but he certainly hadn't imagined anything like this. Long, dark hairs protruded from every surface, and everything looked slimy, whether it was Beth's skin or giant mounds that Jake could only assume were boogers.

The girl certainly <i>did</i> notice that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she had been lightly sleeping, Beth's brow furrowed in reaction to the unexpected stimulus, and she began to come to. \"Ughhh,\" she moaned softly, cursing her allergies in her head and slowly opening her eyes to locate her tissue box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside, Jake could feel Beth's response to his elbow. The walls of her nose had grown moister, and her groaning echoed throughout the cave. \"Hey, finally! She acknowledged something!\" Jake announced with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's excitement was short-lived, however, because as soon as Beth found her tissue box, which she had placed conveniently right next to her bed, she groggily pulled one out and brought it up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous wind immediately threw Jake off balance, even though he was still sitting down, and he instinctively reached up to grab onto something. His grasp caught one of Beth's nose hairs, which he was forced to tug on as Beth continued to blow her nose. \"Whoa!\" he let out, holding onto the hair for dear life as the girl threatened to blow him right out of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Beth groaned again, pulling the tissue away from her face and trying to resume her nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Jake was not prepared for Beth to stop blowing her nose, and the abrupt change sent him face first onto the squishy floor, ripping the nose hair clean out of her nose as he fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AUGH!\" Jake spat onto the floor, pushing himself up onto his knees, nose hair in hand.

Beth wasn't sure how to describe it, she just knew it wasn't the same as usual. Worst of all, this strange tickle in her nose didn't even make her want to sneeze. At least if she sneezed, maybe the itch would go away for a while. Not sure what else to do, Beth scrunched up her nose as tightly as she could and snorted in through her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second ago, Jake had almost been blown out of Beth's nose. Now, he found himself being sucked in even deeper. The cavernous opening of Beth's nostril grew smaller and smaller as Jake was pulled away from it, and before long it was nothing more than a distant light source. Eventually, Jake collided with a rather large booger, emitting a wet <i>splat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's great,\" Jake groaned to himself when he realized his left arm and leg were trapped in the glob of snot. He tried to pull himself free, but after a few seconds of struggling he found that he was completely stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth!\" shouted Jake, more desperate and annoyed than angry. \"Beth, I swear to god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Beth couldn't hear a thing Jake said.

It wasn't a plan he liked very much, but there wasn't really much else to work with. Unfortunately, Jake was so deep inside Beth's nose at this point that her nose hairs were very few and far between -- certainly none were in reach of his free arm. \"This would be a lot easier if I had one of her nose hairs, but I'll give it a shot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jake leaned over and put his free right hand down on the floor of Beth's nose. Though he felt pretty silly doing it, he started to wiggle his fingers around and tickle her as best he could. \"Coochie, coochie, coo ... This is never gonna work,\" Jake said, shaking his head. \"But maybe if I ...\" Jake reached up to his head and twisted his index finger and thumb around a few strands of his medium-length hair. Wincing just a little, he plucked them from his scalp, and then went back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleepy girl finally reacted to him. She groaned softly and wrinkled her nose and forehead, reaching her finger up to her nose again to rub her nostrils. Though the tickle from before wasn't enough to provoke a sneeze, this deliberate attempt by Jake to force one out was a very different story. Beth groaned again and flared her nostrils. She was done rubbing her nose -- she figured she would just let this annoying itch run its course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Beth,\" said Jake, who could feel the girl's stirring from inside her nose as he continued to sweep his own hairs across it. \"This chick is probably always sneezing from her allergies, and now the one time I actually need her to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhhh ... aaaaahhh ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, there we go!\" Jake exclaimed, satisfied but also a bit nervous. At this point, though, there was no turning back. He tickled the girl a few more times with his hairs for good measure, then shut his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAaahhhh ... Ah-aahhhh ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake tensed and curled up into a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AACHOOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth sneezed violently, ripping Jake free and throwing him straight out of her nose through the air.

Speaking of, after a moment Jake noticed that the booger he had been stuck on was strewn about Beth's shirt in several pieces.

Then, turning around, he grabbed the tissue again, this time behind him, and held it to his shoulders like a huge, thin cape. \"Thank God these are so light. Here we go!\" Jake bolted across Beth's room, heading toward the door, all the while dragging his tissue paper cape. <i>Beth won't notice me, but she'll sure as hell notice a tissue dragging itself across her floor!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, just as Beth crumpled up her current tissue and tossed it to the side of her bed lazily, she turned on her side in her bed and made eye contact with -- a moving piece of tissue paper?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--?\" she breathed, rubbing her eyes and reaching for her glasses.

Her first thought was that a rather quick-moving ant was stealing her tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake stopped running when he heard Beth's voice. <i>It worked!</i> Catching his breath a bit, he jogged around to the front of the tissue and made direct eye contact with the enormous girl. \"Hey, Beth!

He landed hard against Beth's forearm, though fortunately her skin was soft enough to cushion the blow. Jake began to fall again as Beth took another step, so he stuck out his hands and tried to grab hold of whatever he could. Beth's arm hairs weren't especially long or plentiful, but they were just long enough for Jake to hold on to and keep himself from plummeting all the way to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Beth! Gross!\" Stephanie groaned, watching the used tissue fall from her friend's grip. \"You dropped your snotty tissue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth frowned in embarrassment, turning her head down to stare at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie sighed, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's okay. You're so clumsy, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Beth repeated, starting to reach her hand up to her face. Softly wrinkling her nose, Beth began to rub her fingers back and forth under her nostrils. She just knew her allergies were going to act up during the party. This always happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itchy nose?\" Stephanie asked with a laugh. Beth nodded, and then she pressed the underside of her nose against her wrist and began to drag her nostrils across her forearm, wiping away the rest of the tickle. While that certainly made Beth feel better, Jake wasn't especially well off. He could only stare in disbelief as the side of Beth's nose swept toward him and picked him up, putting him right back where he'd started a few minutes ago.</span></div></div>",

Beth turned to her and raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No boyfriend or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's eyes widened and her face turned bright red.

What little dancing she had already done, on top of confessing her crush to her friend, had left her exhausted. Instead of dancing some more, Beth sat back down on the couch with her half-empty can of soda and let out a sigh. Jake bounced as Beth settled, but he still felt reasonably safe on her chest once she was stationary. Tipping his head back, he stared up at the giant girl from below. From here, most of her features were obscured by her jaw, but Jake could make out Beth's glasses as well as most of the underside of her nose. Beth's long, thin nostrils flared briefly, and then she reached up a finger to rub underneath them. Jake was confident that he wasn't discovering any long-hidden feelings for her or anything quite like that, but after hearing her profess her crush on him, he had to admit she could be pretty cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Beth!\" said a cheerful voice as another girl sat down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Natasha,\" Beth replied, still rubbing her finger under her nose. Jake didn't know Natasha especially well, but from what he could remember, she was nice enough, but hyper and bubbly to the point of being annoying. Beth seemed to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help!\" Natasha chirped, noticing Beth's itchy nose. She reached out a finger, touched it to the tip of Beth's nose, and then pushed up firmly. Beth scrunched up her face, recoiling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, is that better?\" asked Natasha, giggling as she continued to give Beth a pig-nose. Still wrinkling her nose, Beth forced her eyes open and gave Natasha an unimpressed stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha had barely done anything and Jake was starting to feel annoyed on Beth's behalf. After just a few seconds, he wasn't sure if Natasha wouldn't happen to simply slap him off of Beth's chest, either crushing him or sending him to his doom.

For a second Jake thought Natasha was about to give the bespectacled girl a kiss, but then Natasha simply touched her nose against Beth's. Beth's eyes widened in self-conscious horror as Natasha gently nuzzled her nose with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Natasha, stop it!\" Beth pleaded, starting to blush furiously. Natasha shook her head, only causing her noses to press together even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. You know you like it,\" she teased, her voice low and calm. Beth's nose was a bit bigger than Natasha's, but it was also softer, allowing Natasha's nose to squish it around easily. She would never admit it, but Beth did actually notice the itch in her nose starting to die down, at least for a few seconds. Before long, Beth noticed a sweet, flowery scent worming its way into her nostrils. Wrinkling her nose, she took in two rapid sniffs and realized what it was: Natasha's perfume. Luckily Beth wasn't allergic to perfume, but her nose was already itchy enough that the fragrance was starting to push her over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh... Natasha...\" Beth breathed, her eyelids starting to flutter. \"Y-your perfume...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You like it?\" Natasha cooed, continuing to nuzzle Beth. The shy girl shook her head, unable to open her eyes anymore as the urge to sneeze started to take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... It's tickling my nose! Ah... Ahh... Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that Beth had a sneeze coming on, Natasha finally stopped nuzzling her and leaned back.

Then, her expression instantly changed to a goofy pout. \"Beth doesn't like the perfume you picked out for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie gave an amused snort and then turned to Beth, who still had her nose buried in a tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tickles my nose,\" Beth confirmed, gently massaging her nostrils through the soft paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything tickles your nose, Beth!\" laughed Stephanie. \"Isn't that how allergies work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not allergic to perf-\" Beth began, but she quickly realized neither of the other girls were listening to her. Natasha suddenly stood up and leaned her face toward Stephanie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I just showed Beth,\" she said, her voice low and sultry again. Stephanie scrunched up her face as Natasha began to nuzzle her nose too, but unlike Beth, she simply smiled and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Natasha,\" Stephanie sighed, gently pushing her friend away. \"How are you this drunk already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Knowing that the girl was particularly prone to sniffling and sneezing, however, this was not a spot he really wanted to be in for too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake reached up and grabbed more skin, pulling his body upward toward Beth's eyes.

Then again, he could only see one of her eyes, and the lack of an immediate reaction made him worry. Jake could only stare as Beth's eye blinked once, twice, and then it clenched shut. He was afraid that she was about to sneeze yet again, but Beth simply scrunched up her nose and rubbed her hand back and forth under her nostrils. Unfortunately, this was still less than ideal for Jake's hold on Beth's glasses. Her nose squished from side to side as she rubbed under it, and this jostled her glasses just enough to cause Jake to lose his grip. He let out a yelp as he plummeted, but luckily he didn't fall too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a second to clear his head, Jake found himself sitting back on the tip of Beth's nose. Feeling defeated, he simply stared up at the giant girl's eyes. They were still clenched shut behind her glasses, but eventually they slowly opened. The creases in the bridge of Beth's nose disappeared as she relaxed her face and stopped rubbing her nostrils, and then to Jake's surprise, she reached a hand up to her glasses and removed them. Beth turned her glasses around and stared at the lenses from the front. Jake immediately jumped to his feet in excitement. Maybe she hadn't noticed that it was him, but she definitely noticed him in some capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth!\" Jake shouted, waving his hands in the air.

She was fairly sure something had just landed on them, but now she couldn't find any evidence of that having happened. Abandoning the search, she brought her glasses down to the bottom of her shirt and gently rubbed the lenses clean with her fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her gaze shifted down to her shirt, she noticed from the corner of her eye a small black thing on the very tip of her nose. <i>A-ha! There's -- well, whatever it is.</i> Beth reached her right hand up to her nose and swiped it across the tip, then replaced her glasses on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAUGH!\" Jake yelped as the enormous hand squished and bent the platform he had been standing on. He immediately lost balance and fell backwards, luckily landing on Beth's finger, which he grabbed with all his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth, somewhat curious, quickly inspected the thing that had ended up upon her nose, and then froze when she realized it wasn't simply a large piece of dust or something similar. Her eyes widened -- at first, she thought it was some sort of insect, for it seemed to have little appendages, and she experienced an instinctual pang of fright. Almost immediately, though, she recognized that this was neither an inanimate object nor an insect, and her eyes grew even wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth! Hey, wait, don't freak out!\" Jake bellowed as loud as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Beth had already been focusing directly on Jake, this time she managed to hear him, although she wasn't quite sure she believed her own ears. Startled, the enormous girl shook her finger a little, knocking Jake off, and pushed her chair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOF!\" Jake moaned as he slammed down onto the pages of Beth's textbook. Groaning, he picked himself up and looked into the slightly horrified eyes of the enormous girl. \"It's me, Jake! I don't know how I ended up like this, but --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What -- what are you -- how are you doing that?\" Beth stammered, rubbing her eyes underneath her glasses and looking around her room for evidence that she was dreaming or that someone else was messing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's like I said, I don't really know what's going on either, but you gotta take me to Stephanie. I think she knows what's going on,\" Jake tried to explain. \"Sorry for startling you, too. I've been trying to get your attention for a while! I know this must be really hard to believe; you're not dreaming, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -- no, I must be -- really? No, this can't be real!\" she protested. She was currently flooding with emotion due to the awkwardness of having a crush on Jake mixed with her inability to accept the reality of what was actually happening. <i>She must have fallen asleep studying, and now she was having a dream about Jake because she had mentioned her feelings for him earlier to her friend and he was still on her mind. Yes, that made perfect sense!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really! You're not dreaming!\" Jake insisted. \"I'm sure I can prove it, somehow! Would you just take me to my sister, though? It'd be a big help.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jake even felt a little intimidated, though he supposed the fact that Beth was the size of a building compared to him didn't help matters.

How are you going to know if I'm telling the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth blinked, and after thinking on it for a moment, her self-conscious personality returned. She blushed subtly and she began to fidget, refusing to make eye contact with Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, um... Sorry. That wouldn't make any sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, even if you are just dreaming, can't you help me out anyway? Trying to study in your dreams probably isn't going to do you any good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling defeated Beth hunched over and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. I... I just... Ahh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's eyes widened in horror as he watched Beth's face. Her eyelids fluttered behind her glasses, and her normally thin nostrils flared outward. Placing a palm on his forehead, Jake groaned quietly. This was Beth he was dealing with, and especially after everything that had happened already today, he really had no excuse for not expecting this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth?\" Jake warned, wagging a finger at the giant girl. \"Don't even think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she sneezed now, Jake had no way of knowing what might happen. Maybe he'd get lucky and the force of the blast would be directed somewhere else. But, if he wasn't lucky, he might get blown right off the desk.

She reached out an enormous hand and put it down on the floor next to him. Jake looked up at Beth, then approached her hand and climbed into her palm, grabbing her thumb for support. Beth brought her hand back up to desk-level. \"Sorry,\" she offered again, sniffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I guess. Just don't do it again, okay?

She stopped before climbing the little steps; she could hear the girls laughing and talking up there. \"Ok, Jake, I don't know what you wanna do. I'm not gonna be able to just confront Steph about this -- she's with everyone else. I don't wanna make a scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed. \"Fine. I don't know, can you try getting her to come downstairs to talk in private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Beth replied. \"I'm not that good at coming up with something, though. What should I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Beth. Tell her Veronica's looking for her or something. Tell her the toilet's not flushing, or--\" Jake paused momentarily, his eyes lighting up. \"Oh, I got it! Tell her I just showed up to the party! That'll really confuse her, since she already knows I came early but doesn't know you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's good! Okay,\" Beth responded appreciatively. \"If it doesn't work, though, and we're just up there with all of them, are you gonna try to get to Steph yourself or stick with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't know ... we'll figure it out. It'll work though, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassured, Beth climbed the wooden steps up to the attic.</span></div></div>",

To make matters worse, dust immediately began to tickle its way into Beth's nostrils. She stopped halfway up the stairs and rubbed her nose, letting out a frustrated groan. Jake was tempted to tell Beth to keep going, but he knew he was already asking a lot of her. It quickly became apparent that the itch in her nose wasn't going to go away, so Beth decided to quit stalling and push forward. Peeking her head through the top of the staircase, Beth spotted the other girls sitting in a rough circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Beth!\" greeted Brianna, being the first to notice the new arrival. Stephanie and Natasha turned to the staircase at the sound of their companion's voice, and although they were all friends, Beth felt a bit nervous being stared down by the three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey,\" Beth replied, continuing the rest of the way up the stairs. The ceiling in the attic was only barely tall enough for her to stand up, and even then, only in the center. Hunching over awkwardly, Beth shuffled a bit closer to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys doing up here?\" asked Beth, feeling too nervous to try pulling Stephanie away right off the bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth or dare,\" Brianna answered with a giggle. Beth raised an eyebrow. Now she understood why Veronica wanted nothing to do with this. Weren't they a little old for truth or dare?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" mumbled Beth in acknowledgement. \"Well, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come play with us!\" Natasha interrupted, patting the floor between herself and Stephanie. Beth shook her head, but before she could respond, two of the girls grabbed her and gently pulled her into the group. The sudden movement kicked up a cloud of dust, and Beth found herself plopped down with Natasha on her right and Stephanie on her left. Jake tugged on Beth's hair to try to get her back on track, but she was too distracted to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Haahh...\" Beth breathed, feeling a sneeze coming on. Her eyes fluttered behind her glasses and she waved a hand up and down in front of her face. Once Jake realized what was about to happen, he grabbed another lock of Beth's hair and held on tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, who wants to go next?\" asked Stephanie, looking back and forth between her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh... HA-CHOOO!\" Beth suddenly sneezed, her head bobbing forward into the center of the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for volunteering, Beth!\" teased Natasha, slapping the timid girl on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? But I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth or dare?\"</span></div></div>",

Truth,\" she chose, reasoning that it was the easier choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay ... Hmm ... Is it true that ...\" Natasha began, looking around the attic and thinking. \"Is it true that you have a crush on someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Nat, what are we still in middle school?\" Brianna criticized. \"We can come up with a better one than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an easy one! But we're just getting started!\" Natasha defended herself. \"So?\" she asked, turning to Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's face went a little pink, and she rolled her eyes. \"Sure, I guess. Kinda,\" she admitted, rubbing her nose. The other girls smiled a little. Beth's answer was somewhat interesting to them, given her shy nature, but without knowing on whom the crush actually was, it wasn't exactly earth-shattering information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's ears had perked up upon hearing the question posed to Beth. He recalled how he had learned earlier that Beth's crush was apparently on him. He looked around the room, thinking about what to do next. Stephanie was not sitting directly next to Beth, so getting to her would not be that simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Now it's your turn, Beth,\" Stephanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Okay ...\" Beth began.</span></div></div>",

She was too worried that everyone would think it was weird if she pulled Steph away, so she decided to play along for now and hopefully make things seem more casual. After looking back and forth between the other girls, Beth eventually settled on Brianna. If nothing else, she was always nice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brianna,\" Beth said, rubbing her nose again. \"Truth or dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Brianna pondered, placing a hand on her chin and staring up at the ceiling. \"Dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth hesitated for a moment. She realized she had no idea what to ask for, regardless of whether Brianna had chosen truth or dare. As she tried to think of something, the attic's dusty air began to tickle her nose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I... I d-dare you to... To... Haahh... I dare you t-to... Ahh... Ah-Ahh... HA-CHOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare me to sneeze?\" asked Brianna with a giggle. Beth rubbed her nose and tried to shake her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I... I dare you to... I daahhh... Ah-CHOOOO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth gave a big sneeze, causing Stephanie and Natasha to recoil away from her. Straightening up, Beth furiously rubbed her fingers back and forth under her nose, feeling like the irritation inside might never stop. Eventually she did manage to get the itchiness down to a bearable level, and after taking in a deep sniff she forced her eyes open and turned her attention back to Brianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Ugh. I just dare you to get me a box of tissues or something,\" Beth groaned, pressing her nostrils against her forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, lame,\" Natasha teased, but Brianna didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's okay,\" she said, standing up and walking past her friends back toward the stairs. \"I'll be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching Brianna descend the stairs and leave the attic, Beth dragged her tickly nose across her forearm and turned back to the other girls. Maybe she could have planned this better. Now Brianna was gone, and she was stuck with Steph and Natasha...</span></div></div>",

Then maybe we can follow her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth gave a tiny nod that neither of the other girls noticed. \"H-hey, St--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess one of us can go while Bri's downstairs,\" said Steph, who hadn't heard Beth's attempt to speak with her. \"I mean, it's her turn, but she can go when she gets back. You go, Nat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Natasha began. \"Hmm. Well I'd dare you to chug your beer, but you don't have much left. Mine's empty, too.

Jake took the opportunity to climb down from her shoe, and he found himself standing in between Beth and his sister.

With the current lighting, he could really only make out her eyes clearly, which reflected green. Under these conditions, it would be a little risky to move onto her face. Still, his sister's lack of allergies meant he was not likely to be sneezed off her face suddenly, as was always the risk with Beth.</span></div></div>",

Tipping his head back, Jake looked up Stephanie's nostril. He could always climb up there and make her sneeze, but the attic was dusty enough that she might not think anything of it. He'd have to get more creative than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth felt herself starting to panic. For all she knew, Jake was still trying to survive on the floor of her bedroom. To make matters worse, her allergies were constantly prodding at the back of her mind. Dust flowed up into her nose every time she inhaled, and she was already starting to feel another sneeze coming on. Stephanie's body language was making Beth suspicious that she really did know what was going on, so if she ended up being distracted by a sneezing fit, Stephanie might try to get away. Trying her hardest not to think about it, Beth firmly rubbed a finger back and forth under her nose and tried to think. Even if she didn't know where Jake was, maybe she could at least say something to stall Steph or catch her off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought, Beth caught sight of something out of the corner of her eye. A thin lock of hair was starting to slide across Stephanie's face, inching ever closer to her nose. She only noticed because it looked less like it was falling of its own accord and more like it was being pulled. Not long after Beth realized what was happening, the ends of the hairs were suddenly turned upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Steph!\" yelled Jake, hoping his sister would notice him. \"I'm right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jake shoved the lock of hair into Stephanie's nostril as far as he could manage.

Impressive as it was, she knew Steph wasn't going to sneeze from just that.

Turning his eyes from the reflection to the side of the girl's head, Jake noticed the tip of her nose protruding out past her cheek. Shrugging to himself, he figured that would be the best place for him to go; at least he wouldn't have to hang on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing some of the girl's hair, Jake began to climb up the side of her neck.

It was risky, but if he used her hair like a rope swing, he might just be able to make it to her nose. Jake thought about trying to simply get in front of her eye, but she probably wouldn't be able to tell he was even there if he simply swung some of her hair in front of her face.

For such a mundane thing, from this perspective the spectacle of Brianna powdering her nose was actually almost beautiful.The clouds of microscopic makeup particles drifted and wafted in the light streaming in from the nostril, forming glowing patterns in the air. The nose hairs were silhouetted against the light, casting long shadows. The overall effect was a little bit like being in a mist-filled forest at sunset, provided you didn't think about where you actually were. Jake got lost in his thoughts as he watched the pink slimy floor turn skin-colored at the drifting makeup settled to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake blinked. Was it just him, or was a LOT if powder getting inside Brianna's nose? The inside of the nostril seemed practically coated in the stuff.

He'd never applied makeup himself, but this looked really uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna's powder puff stopped, her hand hovering halfway between the table and her face.

Brianna stood rigid for a second, holding her breath as she hung on the edge of a sneeze, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Heiinnt!</i> Choo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna pressed her fingers against the underside of her nose just in time to stifle her sneeze. She let out a high-pitched breath afterward, but the force of the sneeze had been mostly contained. Opening her eyes, Brianna stared at herself in the mirror and let out a half-embarrassed giggle. Her freckled nose was caked in powder, and she looked especially silly with it squished up on top of her fingers. Smiling to herself, Brianna gently rubbed her nose, oblivious as Stephanie's patience finally ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brianna!\" she exclaimed, bursting the door open and quickly stepping into the room. Giggling again, Brianna turned to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I sneezed,\" she said, unable to stop herself from smiling.

Jake heard Brianna talking to his sister, but he was barely paying attention as he struggled to free himself.

If Brianna tilted her head at the wrong angle, \u2018down\u2019 could easily become the vast drop outside her teardrop shaped nostrils\u2026 or worse, the lightless depths leading to her respiratory system. She was in a game all about natural poses and contortions, it was only a matter of time before the party girl innocently tilted her head forward or back and her fell to his death. He needed to do something!</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the remake of Too Nosey for Your Party!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy account will merely be the one hosting the story, with his permission.  Everything here belongs to Blah-San, the original maker of the interactive.  This is his premise and first chapter too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, let's get into the premise.  Everything after this point is written by Blah-San, so any business regarding it should be taken up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re a young man visiting a small party hosted by your sister. Your semester ended just before hers, and once you heard she was throwing a party, you couldn\u2019t help but drop by. The only problem is she doesn\u2019t want you interfering with her plans\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after arriving at the party, you find yourself shrunk down to barely the size of an ant. With no idea how long it'll last, you need to find a way to survive the party until it wears off, and that's if it wears off at all. Do you just try to hide and stay out of trouble, or do you try to get some of the girls to help you? Who knows what kind of trouble you'll find yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Don\u2019t kill any characters.<br>\r\n- Some adult content is okay, but don\u2019t make it pornographic.<br>\r\n- It\u2019s okay to have some of the girls shrink too, but try to keep it limited. For example, only one shrunken girl per story path.<br>\r\n- Like I\u2019ve said a million times before, I\u2019m pretty much only into nose vore. That\u2019s likely the only thing I\u2019ll be writing, but feel free to include whatever you like in your own paths.<br>\r\n-Please right in the third-person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main character was named Jake in the old version of the story, but this time I\u2019ve decided to make him more of a blank slate. I suppose he can still be named Jake for ease of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20196\u201d<br>\r\nHair: Blonde, long, curly.<br>\r\nEyes: Blue<br>\r\nInfo: Stephanie is Jake\u2019s younger sister, and she\u2019s something of a stereotypical queen bee. She\u2019s generally polite and nice to her friends, but she\u2019s also selfish and short-tempered. Stephanie can get along with her brother, but she generally dislikes it when he interacts with her friends. Despite wanting to get him out of her party, she wouldn\u2019t actually wish any extreme harm upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20195\u201d<br>\r\nHair: Brown, short, straight<br>\r\nEyes: Brown, glasses<br>\r\nInfo: Beth is the most unlikely of Stephanie\u2019s friends. They don\u2019t have very much in common, but they were roommates in their freshman year and they decided to stick together. While Stephanie is stylish and outgoing, Beth is nerdy and shy. In fact, she\u2019s probably too busy studying for finals to participate in the party, not that she\u2019d want to anyway. Additionally, Beth is allergic to pollen and dust, and she has a bit of a crush on Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u201945\u201d<br>\r\nHair: Blonde, short, curly<br>\r\nEyes: Green<br>\r\nInfo: Natasha is Stephanie\u2019s best friend, and the two of them are remarkably similar. If Stephanie is the queen bee, Natasha is her second in command. This isn\u2019t to say they spend all their time gossiping and picking on people. On the contrary, the two of them will have fun together no matter what they do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica<br>\r\nAge: 22<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20190\u201d<br>\r\nHair: Black, long, straight<br>\r\nEyes: Brown<br>\r\nInfo: Veronica is one of Beth\u2019s closest friends, despite being a year older and a star player on the women\u2019s basketball team. Although she primarily came to the party to keep Beth company, Veronica will likely spend most of her time drinking or dancing. She\u2019s mostly tolerant of Stephanie\u2019s behavior, but she doesn\u2019t seem to like Jake very much. He\u2019s never quite been able to figure out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20193\u201d<br>\r\nHair: Blonde, medium, straight<br>\r\nEyes: Brown<br>\r\nInfo: Another friend of Stephanie\u2019s from freshman year, Brianna is energetic and fun-loving. They get along well, though Brianna seems generally unaware of Stephanie\u2019s occasionally rude behavior. Also, unlike most of Stephanie\u2019s other friends, Brianna doesn\u2019t really know Jake at all.<br>\r\n</td>",
