You look back outside to see a small glint of light in the distance. As you watch it, you realize that it's getting closer. As the object reflecting the light of the sun grows ever closer in the three minutes you've been here, you hear a sound of... jet engines. Originally, you thought it was a small reflection. Nowyou see that it IS in fact a jet... and it's still getting closer. By this time, the jet should've turned away from where you were at. But it didn't. AND IT WAS STILL GETTING CLOSER. A thrill of terror passes doown your spine as you run back into the TARDIS, keeping the door open in order to see what would happen. In 15 seconds, the jet looks big enough to be a passenger plane. You can make out American Airlines on the side of the jet as it gets closer. Five seconds pass and you realize that the plane is going to hit the North Tower.</span></div></div>",

Is this possibly the end of the human race, or merely a down trodden point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by an alarming noise - gunfire, distant but possibly getting closer. And then out of sight some odd humming noise coming from high in the sky. Perhaps London isn't as deserted as you first thought.

You could either try the nearby old warehouse, investigate the source of the gunfire cautiously, or explore the rviverside further and see what you could find.</span></div></div>",

Upon seeing this the girl lets out a loud scream you quickly clasp a hand over her mouth not wanting to alarm anyone in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth? This is it? Why it looks like one of those British Police Box things!\" She exclaimed once she got over the shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only in appearance, Mary, it's a lot bigger on the inside. Trust me, and there's a lot more to it than meets the eye. It's called a TARDIS and it can take me anywhere I want to go.\" The girl is barely listening as she's busy walking around the police box examining every inch of it. Finally she turns back to you, by her expression it's hard to know what she could be thinking. \"So you were telling the truth after all? This is extraordinary and hard to me to grasp but can we go inside it? I'm anxious to see what it looks like inside. You did say it was bigger on the inside, didn't you?\" You nod, escorting her inside. As the doors slam shut you begin showing her around, mostly how the control panel functioned, you were still new at mastering the fullness of the TARDIS yourself what with there being no instruction manual. \"So how does this Tardis thing work?\" Mary asks after a while of looking at all the numerous too many to count rooms. many fascinated her. You lead her over to the control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By way of this; I'm still fairly new at this and haven't gotten all the bugs out but it works well enough to send me across time and space.\" Then she asks the one question you know she's dying to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you take me with you then, Willy?

I typed in the date I wanted to explore: 05-12-1943 and also typed in the country I wanted to visit, then the area in that country. Germany, Warsaw.<br>\r\n   Locks began rooting from the door behind me and somehow managed to lock the door inside out and outside in. The tardis began shaking me violently this way and that. I felt like I was a part of a salad-in-the-making and began to heave a little: I never liked roller coasters, so why would I like this? A light as white as the heavens above flashed before me from all directions and I shielded myself from this annoyance and fell to the corner of the rectangle I was trapped inside. For what felt like a rocky five hours I sat there in beetle position waiting for the worst\u2026 and then it all just stopped. A warm sensation cuddled inside my stomach when I rose up. The locks were no longer there and I opened the door.<br>\r\n  Before me stood a room of white or rather, an eternally of white backdrop. I was afraid then for my life; I went from a popular school boy soon-to-be-historian to a crazy man possibly entering the end or just another bad dream. How am I supposed to know? I woke up like this after all. I was about to plant my foot onto the white ground but then the tardis began beeping loudly; I turned around and found a watch in the corner where I almost pissed myself. I grabbed it and put it on.<br>\r\n  When I stepped onto the hard ground colors were added to my life slowly and gloomily as if this were just another boring stroke of a water-paint masterpiece. Eventually smells and sounds were added into the picture and I found myself standing beside a woman holding a baby; she was sobbing hysterically and trying to soothe her baby. It was a complete failure, if I must say.<br>\r\n  Instantly I knew where I was because this was where I requested to go: I, Ryan Rakile, stood beside a Jew or Gypsy girl during World War II: the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. The room I was in was very small and had something that couldn\u2019t have been a mattress but looked like a large pillow instead. Weapons hung around the place and the woman was now crawling in the closest corner with her baby in hands. I looked at my watch; my tardis was hidden inside it.<br>\r\n  Naturally I grabbed one of the small guns. I remember studying that there were only 59 pistols used in this fight. I grabbed extra ammo and stored it in my jeans pocket and before I left the room I stopped beside the girl. In German I told her simply that I love her; she stopped her crying and looked up at me with a two-tooth grin. Yes, at times like this they yearned to live- he thought to himself and exited the room.<br>\r\n  A man dressed in rags motioned me over to him. He mouthed crawl in German; I thanked myself for those German classes and I crawled his way. He told me where the enemy was and that the sewers would be the escape route if they were going to burn this hell-hole down like the rest of the places.<br>\r\n  \u201cFew people are left on our side. We are outnumbered by so many but you know what? We will win! We will rise. For now help the wounded; they are in the second room to the right.\u201d The fighter commanded.<br>\r\n  I ran inside the hallway. I was greeted with flying bullets and the sound of a machine gun firing away at her own entertainment. I fell to the floor and crawled quickly, making sure to avoid around the windows. I crawled into the room and I wasn\u2019t sure which did it; the smell or the missing limbs, but I fainted.</span></div></div>",

If you ask me she's worse than a heretic, she's an agent of the Devil himself!\" You hold yourself back. If you started fighting now you would expose your motives and the whole castle would be heading for you. Instead you decide to use a diplomatic trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take out your text-type translator and get it to print off a parchment that would look as though it is an official order from a cardinal.

A lowly man is sitting in the corner of the dungeon fast asleep; his hand barely clutches the bottle of ale he must've been swigging and there, hanging from his waist-side, are the keys to the cells.

The brilliant white flash was dulled due to the goggles, but it was still like the sun HAD been brought to Earth. The light began to dim, though, and soon, 10 seconds had passed. Reluctantly, you both raise the goggles up from your eyes to your head. A brilliant ball of fire rose up into the air as the mushroom cloud began to develop. \"Joan... welcome to the age of the atom bomb,\" you said somberly.</span></div></div>",

You then show her the food replicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to eat?\" You ask her. Uncertain at first Joan asks for some meat and accompanying sides. After due consideration as to what this means you go through the menu and select roast chicken, baked potatoes, courgette and button mushrooms. Joan watches in astonishment as food materialises in the alcove under the touch panel; taking the plate in hand she inquires as to the yellow-grey-brown lumps on the plate. \"They are potatoes,\" You answer, \"Root vegetables from a far-off land that shall be named North America.\" Curious Joan sits at a convenient table and tucks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she has finished her meal you then show her the mechanical replicator, setting most of the gadgets you have used in the dispensary tray and setting the dematerialisation process in motion before selecting a discreet two-way translator for Joan, she asks as to how things appear and disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matter-to-energy.\" You explain. \"It will be proved that, theoretically, matter can be turned into energy and energy can be turned into matter by the early 20th Century but actual conversion at this level is futuristic even by my standards.\" Next you use the suit replicator; indicating to Joan where her suit of armour comes from. When you've changed into clothing that you find more comfortable and appropriate for your time period Joan asks for the same. When it came to deciding on what to wear it was useful to Joan that the menu displayed images of the garments; she now wears a pair of blue jeans, a white blouse, a blue jacket, green socks and black high-heeled shoes.

At the middle of the forest, you saw a knight coming from his hunt for trophys or just from abusing his power on the French. You moved ahead of him and waited behind a tree on his path. When he past by you, you jumped on him an stunned him with your gun. You tied him to a tree, stole his armor and horse, deciding to take Joan disguised as one of their own men. You rode to the end of the forest to castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entering part was quite easy since the guards recognized your armor and bowed when you passed, not noticing your face behind the helmet. Inside your took off the armor and hid inside a room because guards were patrolling the corridors. For your surprise, the room you entered belonged to a member of church, so you headed to the wardrobe and took a church cloak and put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to the dungeon, now dressed as a priest, you searched for Joan's cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey, who are you ? \". You looked back and saw a guard coming your way. Thinking fast, you reached your pocket inside the vests and found onething you didn't realized you had it: Psychic paper. You headed to the guard and spoke with a loud and religious voice \" How dare you speak to a member of His Santity's House ?\". \" I've never seen you here before, and i've not been noticed of any visits to any of the low-lifes i keep in My dungeon. You picked your glove and slapped him with it saying \" Keep your mouth shut, don't you recognize a member of the High Church of Canterbury ? \" ypu showed him the paper, hoping it showed him a seal of the church. It worked. The guard threw down his sword and bowed to your feet asking for pardon. You told him \" Don't worry, God will surely forgive you \" You had no idea where those lines were coming out from you. Maybe it was the cloak. \" I'm here to talk to that who challenged the church of England \". The guard, now totally convinced, fetched the keys and lead you to the right door.</span></div></div>",

This is more about travelling anywhere and anywhen rather than going on the kind of adventure usually seen in Dr Who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sexual content<br>\r\nNo toilet scenes<br>\r\nMinimal swearing<br>\r\nNo naked scenes<br>\r\nEnjoy yourself!</td>",
