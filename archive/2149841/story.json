Your current project is finding a way to make trained pokemon larger, as to make major spectated battles an even bigger spectacle than they already are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour research as led you to build a size altering ray. Said ray is capable or growing or shrinking just about anything it hits, especially pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been given the go-ahead to use the ray on a living test subject. Nonliving test subjects have been a complete success, so there's no real chance of anything going wrong. Good thing, too, it's late at night and there's no one around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour test subject is a little Eevee. She's quite the docile creature, rather harmless and unintimidating. You often play with her when taking breaks. She's also generally obdient, so you figure she's the perfect test subject for the growth ray as she's less likely to go rouge once she gets bigger.

Its large size coupled with its shape reminds her of a bottle they use to feed certain pokemon with when they're young or need liquid medicine. Thinking its a drink, she takes the end of the ray in her mouth and begins \"drinking\" it. you try to stop her, but no matter how docile she typically is, you're now much weaker than her and she wants a drink, so there's no way you can stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sucks on the growth ray she winds up triggering it, causing her to grow even bigger. At this point her body is too big for the room and it pushes the walls as she grows, squishing you a bit as well.

The rest of her body begins to burst through the ground floor, quickly filling it, and only minutes later, the second level floors has been broken through, and finally the Eevee bursts through the roof, and the building, having lost many support beams, collapses upon itself.

That can only mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking up, you close your eyes and mumble to yourself. \"Ok, let's see, the power plant fuels the entire city at about an average rate of 55 megawatts a minute. Its rate should continue to power the city for 7 hours without recharging....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open in shock again. \"If all the power generated from the plant is drained, then that can only mean....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, you glance up to your Jolteon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, you find yourself looking up....and up......and up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Jolteon has grown to monstrous proportions. You can estimate an unbelievable height of two miles! In front of you is his foot-paw, which is already at a giant height of 250 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tail wags quickly, scattering clouds in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's so big that each of his paws is on a different block of your avenue, and crushing several houses in the process. Lucky for your neighbors, a sheer amount of luck had been upon them since his paws were considerably soft. So, in general, even in such a gigantic state, he couldn't harm anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouses and other buildings, on the other hand, were a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance to his hind paws, and you're not getting any better results. Huge, 50 foot deep and 75 foot long craters were visible, leaving the road and sidewalk battered and ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish you had brought a brown paper bag to hyperventilate into, regarding the fact that if it were possible to view the Earth from space, your Jolteon would appear as a tiny yellow dot in an urban area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't until now that you see your Jolteon, both overjoyed and astonished at his growth, begin eying the ground in which was barely visible to him. He's obviously worried about you, which gives you some relief that just because he's humongous, he's not going to be evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans his head down in an effort to find you, and you can't help but fall down at the rushing wall of fur that scanned the landscape with eyes three times as big as your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually notices you, which surprises you, being a speck to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles. \"JOLTEON!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a calm and soft voice coming from him, his voice sounds like a horde of bombers raining over the city. You cover your ears in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, his titanic pupils notice this and attempts to lick you in comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, boy! Don't!\" You shout, desperate and hoping that he can even hear you. His tongue, the size of half of a skyscraper, halts. He tilts his head curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look, boy,\" you say, trying to regain your nerve. \"I pretty sure you've noticed by now, but you're the biggest Pokemon alive! Heck, I'm pretty sure you're the biggest thing on the PLANET! I don't think it would be a good idea randomly causing damage, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinks. In the next second, he sits down, completely crushing the lower half of your block. His pads may have been soft and harmless, but you're afraid to say that his rear wasn't. Anything caught in its way was destroyed in a matter of one little second. The ground below you shakes, knocking down street lamps like a 5.0 earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready you could hear the sound of the ground compacted underneath his incredible weight, and mutter about how big of a crater THAT was gonna be....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of like that, boy!\" You say with a bead of sweat falling on your forehead. \"That's what we don't want, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Jolteon only stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis enormous eyes tell a tale of curiosity, but eventually, you see him smile and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief. \"Good boy!\" you say, and slowly pet your Jolteon's toe, which was already bigger than your house entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOLT!\" he cries happily, forgetting his voice is too powerful for your eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a little dazed, but in some weird way.....you're happy to be the owner and trainer of a two-mile tall Jolteon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you can't help but have the feeling that the military might not share the same viewpoint with you, and you begin to consider if being in the city is save for the both of you...</span></div></div>",

There would be military forces here soon and if they attacked Jolteon, well, in a fight he'd level anything in his path with ease. His feet were already big enough that he'd level stuff just moving, but an attack would be devastating. He was after all around 4000 times his former size, so he had something like the electrical power of a very powerful nuclear weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright buddy, lets get out of here while we can\" you yell, \"pick me up and head for the mountains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the Jolteon bent down like he did to pick up everything. Quadrapedal pokemon more often than not did carry things using just their mouths. Looking up, a view of fur, teeth, tongue and slobber dominated your view. When he wasn't even a meter tall you were fine with that, but at two miles, his tongue would be able to cover your whole neighborhood, his teeth were like 'little' skyscrapers and the slimy saliva could easily lead to your drowning or tour of a Jolteon's guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this flashed through your mind and the bond from trainer to pokemon was enough that he seemed to know it and changed tactics. The enormous toes in front of you moved back and then suddenly the ground rocked and was carried up atop a single digit on a splayed set of toes. At his head, he held the paw out and shook until you and a good piece of your now abandoned neighborhood slid off and into the fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a trainer, you expected to see weird things, but never a view of your pokemon from their fur or on their head. Weird stuff happened though, some people rode on their pokemon rather than the case of smaller ones riding on their shoulder, but at least in those cases, the pokemon hadn't been over a meter shorter than them earlier. In the next instant, the paw disappeared and like that the enormous creature ran off. Nobody was killed, but his enormous feet threw dirt and destroyed anything man-made in their path as 500 foot long and probably 200ft. deep craters marked a trail across the area.</span></div></div>",

But how could something that small create such a big Pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" you mutter, racking through memories. \"There was....an explosion, and.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. You're not getting anywhere. All that's clear is that your Jolteon is now twice as big as any skyscraper in the world and that you were trying to keep him to avoid any collateral damage as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparky seems intent on this goal, as well. Despite flattening thousands of acres of the forest below his massive foot-paws, he looks as if he wishes for the same thing. You're not too keen if he wants to return to normal size, however, as you can remember how happy he looked after his first overdose of growth. For your sake, you can only hope he doesn't get any BIGGER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, though, ever since he first grew, he hasn't had any other growth spurts. And it wasn't because there weren't any power lines around in such a barren land. You figured because of his size he'd be absorbing electricity from the dark clouds that loomed all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, he hasn't, and you wonder if it's because he believes he's already big enough for you to handle. After all, if you both didn't have an unbreakable bond, he'd still be in your neighborhood wrecking havoc to anything in his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel kind of stupid at this thought listening to the trees snapping hundreds of feet below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had bigger problems to think about. [Pardon the pun.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, you think that everyone in your neighborhood would be reporting the sight of a two-mile tall Jolteon to the government. And with the crater-sized footprints leading the way, you would only have a certain amount of time before the military discovered your whereabouts, and that was the last thing you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't because you weren't worried about the military hurting Sparky. After all, a tank shell would probably only cause a teeny smudge on his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you were worried about was Sparky's reaction. If he were intrigued by the tiny tanks and helicopters firing at him in an effort to take down his titanic form, he would probably think of them as toys. Or worse, FOOD. You shudder at the thought of Sparky gobbling up a bunch of tanks thinking them as appetizers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's the thought of him getting angry. Never in your life have you seen Sparky upset, and you worry about what could happen if he thought of the military as enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......\"Best not think about that...\" you say, shocked at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you near the mountains, you can only be amazed at how quickly this was taking you. A trip by any other means, preferably by car, would take hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy means of riding on top of a two-mile-tall Jolteon, it only took ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, you can see the mountains, snow-peaked and rising above the clouds. As Sparky nears them, you can't help but notice the most surprising thing about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Sparky notices it too, as he comes to a complete stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparky was staring up at the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you've both been through, for some reason, it felt weird looking up at something taller than Sparky. They had to be at least five miles tall, towering over Sparky like a skyscraper in a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if he stood on his hind legs, he'd still only come up to halfway up the mountain. Which gives you some relief. He may have been the biggest Pokemon on the planet, but he wasn't the biggest OBJECT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill....that could change in an instant, and once again you're concerned about the dark clouds that loom all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to Sparky's Volt Absorb ability, he grew to monstrous proportions just by lying on electric cables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning carries at least five times more of a shock than cables do. If Sparky were hit by that......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, maybe it's best not to think about that, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Sparky sits down and holds you in his front paw. His reassuring smile eases you, and for once you're not as freaked out looking at his huge face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for your next plan of action. You need to think of a backup plan because all of those footprints are going to lead the military straight to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, you could continue to find refuge and hopefully a place where Sparky isn't as dangerous to the environment around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you could wait for the military and calmly explain that Sparky means no harm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparky tilts his head at your thinking face as if waiting for your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, you look up at Sparky and say.....</span></div></div>",

Right now, he was getting both and as he got bigger, the charges he could harvest increassed, not to mention that which he pulled through not one but now several power lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, just one of Jolteon's toes took up your entire neighborhood. That area was a quarter mile squared and your pokemon looked at it as less than an inch. The edge of the giant's toes started just under a half-mile up, giving it a total of a half-mile for every inch. 27 inches, times a half and you get pretty much 14 miles tall if you also account for fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacro-sized, the Jolteon was frightened as everything seemed to disappear to him. He couldn't see you or any familiar surroundings at his size, must of the world he knew was underneath of him. Static charges built up around him as a result of the shock and fear, not to mention loneliness as the biggest pokemon to ever live. For him, the world he knew was gone, but unknown to him it was right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar below, you felt the energy off the enormous foot in front of you. Normally a scared Jolteon only made little static discharges, but these were full-blown lightning strikes. If a lightning strike didn't get you, then the aurora of electricity flowing over the giant creature would. His shocks were huge and now you had no idea what to do except try to calm him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jolty! Its alright, I'm right here!\" You yell, \"left food, middle toe.

Your only around a foot tall, so its about twice your height to the ground if you fall off the huge back. If something's bad out there, you'd have to find out but at the same time you didn't wanna leave the safety of your pet either. At this point, he was the only thing that could keep even a little kid from hauling you around like a rag-doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShakily and sweating in fear, you stand on Sparky's back. He makes a very low \"jo\" in curiosity but then falls silent as he watches for threats and lets you do whatever the hell it is your doing. For a few seconds you manage to stand up but then just as quickly fall back down again as a wave of vertigo sweeps through when you noticed that the distances seemed to still be changing. The thought is pushed out of mind however and dismissed as an illusion brought on by your fear of dieing an embarrasing death, by falling off a Jolteon's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there, you notice something odd. Right in front of you there's two almost identical black marks. Each one has a main-body of sorts, longer than it is wide and ending with five dots. Around the middle of each, the shapes move to their individual inboard's in a curve. There s a slight rattle as a train rolls through town and you look away for a minute just in case that booming is another threat about to blow down your whole house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the marks, you find they've multiplied greatly in size, spreading to cover more of the Jolteon's back. For a second, you think it could be some sort of biological weapon acting against your formerly little best buddy. As you look up you see that is far from the truth as you know have to look up to see Sparky's ears where before you could look down at them. As you examine your surroundings, you find that your legs are also no longer going over the sides as the back is now broad enough that its more flat than round to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, you go to walk onto the enormous head but stop as you see more black spots behind you. It suddenly rushes in, they're footprints. Yesturday, you had forgone showering and had worn sandals all day, combined with a little sweat, that turned Sparky's amazingly soft fur into a wash-cloth. The stuff though is even smoother to you know, for a second or two, you wish your whole house had carpets made like this.

As you walk forward, it already is happening as things are getting bigger to you. All that your pet would have been able to safely notice though was the reduced weight on him, not that you'd weighed all that much before, it was certainly far more than now. Currently, 4 inches tall, yourself from a few minutes ago was a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the forward half of the back, you were walking through a field of fur that was at your waist and very, very rapidly climbing to pass that. By the point that you're at the shoulders, they're huge as your bare feet trod across warm skin, beneath the fur. Each tower is about 60 feet tall to you, formerly just two inches. Its odd to move under the fur like this, most people never thought about a pokemon's skin, just that it had a lot of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on the enormous shoulder muscles, you are suddenly launched into the air, as what you take for ground suddenly shifts with a force that would have knocked over a city skyscraper. By now, you weigh in at probably half a pound or less, the pet's muscles hold up over 100 times that just to stand. Landing several feet back you look up and see the black fur from one of your footprints earlier, you weren't as big as the toe on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, you realize that you're lost, not sure which way is forward or back, the forest of fur around you blocks too much of the sky for you to get a good view of the head or its ears, which were really your only landmarks. The body was wider than a football field, even counting in the stadium and on top of that, the fur was so thick you couldn't see the sides if you had wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievable, you were lost on your own pet Jolteon...</span></div></div>",

Anyone in a forest would have done this, and well, the fur was as big as trees anyway, so it only made sense. A higher view would let you see what was all around afterall, and then it would be pretty easy to walk up to the ears and get some help. The head was your objective as it seemed safer than being here, assuming you survived this next act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to a stalk of fur, you looked up a huge climb to the top, it seemed bigger than earlier, but that was just a fear of the climb striking, that's all. There were no branches or things to help you get up there and it was perfectly smooth too. After a few failed attempts, you eventually find what appears to be a split piece of fur and use it as a rope, put it around the stalk, hold tight and use it to hold yourself against it. Bit by bit you work your way up it like this. Black footprints trail your path upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the climb, it seems as if the 'rope' is getting more and more slack, yet the 'tree' isn't getting any thinner, not at all. Soon you cannot even hold onto the 'rope', its too heavy and very quickly you end up hugging the strand of fur, its like a giant red-wood now, despite nearly being to the top of it. As you slide down, there is a quick glimps of Sparky's ears in the distance and then they're gone as you slide down to the ground, taking longer to reach it than it took to leave it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom, you find a huge black mark on the fur, bigger than you were, running the whole way up. It was your footprint. Normally, feet are 1/7 to 1/8th the size of the person, so 1/7 to 1/8th of 1/4th was around 1/32nd of an inch, and you were shorter than them, so you were smaller than that! This forest had just gotten really big, a whole lot bigger than before as now, your pet's head was probably over a kilometer away. Briefly you consider sliding down the legs, but then realize you'd have to get through 1000ft of toes too.</span></div></div>",

Before heading out though, you look down at your enormous 32nd of an inch long footprint, now 64 feet long, which put roughly every 2.5 inches of Jolteon at a mile and your current position on the back somewhere close to the shoulders as far as 5 miles of uphill walking from an ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing the direction you figured the ears to be in, you walked on over soft warm skin beneath your feet and feeling the movement and power of miles and miles of muscles. Figure afterall that your just barely bigger than 1/300th of an inch tall, the Latimus Dorsi, a muscle running the length of most mammals backs, would stretch nine miles. You were somewhere around 1/20,000 your normal size too, so the small 54 pounds this thing carried just to walk was literally just shy of a million pounds and you knew the creature could carry far more. So, the muscles moved vast distances as you walked over them and they lifted your near non-existent 0.0045 grams of weight. If the creature were to buck or anything you'd be catapulted off for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill however, you moved forward, what choice did you have? You needed an express elevator to get on your own flipflops, a jet to get to bed and move around, and feared just about everything in existance. Outside little kids at play would crush you or send you across the town with a single kick without knowing it, in here you Jolteon's three inch tall paws now toppled miles and could easily crush your tiny form on the floor and never now it, even a but was measured in hundreds of feet.

At this point, you were maybe a quarter of your size before starting off, but the ears were in sight, reaching 6 miles above your head. For every inch of ear, there was quie a deal over a mile and a half now. It was among your higher hopes that this would stop soon as if you got much smaller you figured that the titan would not even be able to hear you when you got into the ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there's a whoosh of wind, and you have just enough time to see the first strike. Jolteon's back leg is scratching ferociously at the ears. The enormous paw is as big as the ears and they're just a half mile away. The first few hits don't grab you, thanks to the huge gaps in the toes. Eventually, your hit though smothered under a huge sweaty pad. The gooy grime that served to cool feet, skin and more on numerous species carried you with it across miles of space. Somewhere in there, you got loose of it and free-fell for a while only to land between the mountains again, four or five miles off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trip just shot into the double digits of miles, a little over 2 feet tall and about as long to Jolty and anyone who wasn't shrunken, you now had to climb up the leg and cover the back for a total distance of 87 miles. With that figured it now scared you with how big a 'little' kid would be.The drop to the ground seemed small now, at least compared to the massive distance to scale your Jolteon.</span></div></div>",

The entrance was a little ways off, and there what seemed like a bed made of leaves in the corner. \"Apparently, I'm in some Pokemon's cave. Must've brought me here after seeing me unconscious.\" you think to yourself as you look around. A few seconds afterwards, however, there's a figure in the entrance of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Those Mightyena followed my trail!\" You try pulling out your cutting knife to defend yourself, but to your surprise, a lone Glaceon appears with what looks like a bunch of berries. You quickly put your knife away as it walks towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Glaceon drops the berries and scans your body, cheering happily after seeing that you were okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were the one that saved me, huh?\" you asked it, petting it on the head. It's says its name happily in reply. It had a feminine like voice from what you could tell, so it must have been a girl. \"Well, thanks for getting me out of the cold. I don't think I would've made it if it wasn't for you.\" The Glaceon purrs after hearing this. \"You know, it seems to really enjoy my company. Is it really that lonely up here in the mountains?\" you pondered to yourself. Suddenly, you hear loud barking in the distance, Glaceon hearing it too as her ears perk up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, it's those Mightyena! They caught up!\" you shout, again pulling out your knife, knowing you couldn't run from this fight. Glaceon runs out the cave towards the pack, apparently going to try and fight them off. \"Glaceon, wait!\" you yell to her, but to no avail. In seconds you hear a lot of savage fighting, and quickly run to scene to see Glaceon fighting a losing battle, with it being five to one. Not wanting to see the person that helped you injured, you jump into the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this!\" you shout, cutting across the side of a Mightyena with your blade, injuring it. You continue to fight off the Mightyena until Glaceon manages to recover and help you out. Finally, after chasing off the pack, you stop and take a look at the Glaceon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was collapsed on the ground and breathing heavily. There were a lot of bite marks and slashes all over her body, and she was bleeding a large amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I gotta do something.\" you pick up the Pokemon carefully and headed back into the cave. You started a small fire, not knowing if that would help or not, and begin treating the wounds, putting antibiotics on them, then wrapping them in bandages. You feed the Glaceon the berries she picked and then lay her on her bed. She licks your hand to show her appreciation. You smile at this as she slowly drifts off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm sleeping here tonight, then.\" you say to yourself quietly as you pull out your sleeping bag, as you too drift off into a deep sleep...</span></div></div>",

Your vulpix might not like it. You have a new respect for him at his size, you REALLY don't want to disappoint him. As you enter the city your vulpix has already attracted attention. You can see your vulpix walking with its nose up in the air, you can tell he's proud of himself. About halfway to the store there was a very large crowd on the side of the road where you were walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vulpix makes slight tremors every time he steps, you have a small amount of trouble keeping balance, but it's not the easiest way... As you walk by the crowd you fell the tremors stop. You stop and turn around to see your vulpix growl at the crowd as a joke then walk quickly toward you with its tail up high. That growl rattled you from over here. You have a slight fear of him now, but you're sure it'll go away soon. You continue walking. You feel the tremors stop again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to see a child, about the age of 5, scratching your vulpix on the head with his hand. Your vulpix is adjusting his head to let the child scratch the right spot. You cross your arms and tap your foot. Your vulpix immediately looks at you then gets up, almost knocking the child off his feet backwards. You reach as high as you can, but only reach up to his chest to rub him. You then turn around, kind of embarrassed at how your vulpix, the smallest point of the pokemon's life, is much taller and stronger than you, and you can only reach up to its chest. You just walk on and the tremors start again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually make it to the store. The store just so happens (coincidence?) to be 25 feet tall, allowing your vulpix to enter. When you get in, you look at the counter toward the back then turn around to see your vulpix step over most of the aisles toward the right wall. You walk over to the counter and begin to talk to the clerk, who is looking at your vulpix sniffing the products on the wall. After a lot of distractions you finally buy the fire stone. It feels a little lighter than you expected it to be. You walk over to your vulpix, it takes about a minute to get to where he's standing in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see him nudging some giant ink pads with his nose. You figure you could leave some autographs of your vulpix behind. You buy the ink pad and step outside. You don't immediately give out autographs. You walk a ways and at only a couple points you take out the ink pad to let your vulpix give paw prints on books. Your vulpix's paw took more space than the pages in the book, so they were pretty incomplete. You gave the suggestion of having him stamp it somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone randomly yelled from the crowd to have him stamp on their backs. (ink pad stamps, not stomping down on their backs when their lying down, that might hurt!) You ask your vulpix if it's okay. He nods, you wonder why he doesn't speak. You suppose he doesn't want to surprise everyone... they're surprised enough already. You line up about 10 people, have your vulpix put his paw on the ink pad, then place it on their backs. Most of the people say it tickled while some mostly commented on how good it felt. You then start running out of the city in a playful mood with your vulpix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to run as your vulpix is stamping the last signature. He turns his head toward you and starts sprinting toward you, putting paw prints with his ink-soaked paw on the pavement. Within a couple seconds he was caught up with you and not even running to keep up with you. Once you are sure no one has followed you and you are out of sight you ask if you could feel how getting his paw stamped on your back felt. Your vulpix agreed. You lift up your shirt and he lifts up his paw and presses against your back. Goosebumps go over your face the first few seconds from the new feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tickled and really felt good. He held his paw a lot longer there than he did for the people in the city. He eventually put his paw down and you quickly said \"Lets try this stone out!\" Your vulpix responds, \"Yay! I can't wait. I'll be so pretty and strong!\" You get out the stone, which seems a lot lighter than before, out of your backpack. You ask him to lie down. He does so and you have to reach up slightly to place the stone on his muzzle. (you placed it there for fun) His nose is about as big as a basket ball. You wait... and wait... and wait... and.... wait... nothing happens. Your vulpix is still closing his eyes waiting for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the \"fire stone\" off his muzzle and look at it. You grip it tightly. It's pretty firm. You ask your vulpix to bite it. He complies. When he does, it crumbles to dust. Your vulpix got a sad look on your face, while you think about that money you spent on that thing. You tell your vulpix to come on (AGITE!-that just means \"come on!\" in latin) and you start walking back to your house. You spent most of the money you had. After about half an hour you arrive back at your house. Your vulpix won't fit through the door so you have him walk around back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the house then open the gate. You see him further down the fence and easily step over it. You had kind of a \"...\" expression on your face. Your vulpix still seems kind of upset. You walk over to him as he says, \"I could have been stronger... faster... bigger...\" You immediately remember about that stone. You run over to it. You pick it up and it's either scolding hot, or dry ice-cold, because it begins to burn at your hand. You throw it behind you. You fall to your knees and grab your right wrist with your left hand. You see the stone drop to the ground a few feet in front of you and slightly to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to \"not\" see your vulpix. You turn back around, still grasping your fist and look for your vulpix. The last direction you look is up, and you scramble to you feet to find you only cover about 1/4th the distance from the ground to your vulpix's chest. You run forward to the fence that your vulpix is facing. You still have to tilt you head pretty far back to be able to see your vulpix's head. He's about 50 feet tall in your estimation! You slowly walk back over and feel your vulpix's front left leg. He lifts his front right leg in response. As you rub you look up as your vulpix's face. You then look forward to see his tail swing from your left to your right. You stop rubbing his leg and run in between both of his legs to get a good look at his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Vulpix turns his head to see what you were doing. You tried to grab his tail to feel it. It was about two times as wide as you were. He held it still for you to pet. You then walk over to the open gate and close it. Your Vulpix turns around and...</span></div></div>",

He gave you a loving yet questioning look as he awaited your response. You couldn't help but feel aroused just from him being big, you admire his body from up and down, from the cute curls on his head, to his soft-looking fur, right down to his special package. That's when you noticed something about it, it was huge. Sure he was now 20 feet tall, but by proportions, he shouldn't have had a sac that big. Had he grown in more ways than one? Or did you always have a well-endowed vulpix and never know it? Whatever the reason, it just turned you on even further and was the final sight to remove any doubt in your mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" Your vulpix asked as you remained silent for some time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more than ok,\" you say to him as you kiss him. You begin to run your hand through his fur as you slowly make your way to his hind legs, seeing him so big...you knew there was no chance in hell it would fit. But to see him climax, just the thought of it excited you. You could hear and feel him murr as you slowly climbed up onto his belly. You begin to remove your clothes as you stare at his still soft member<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for this?\" He asked as you remove your final article of clothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more than ready,\" You say to him, as you run your hand across the tip of his rod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohhh....\" He moaned out loud as he began to become erect. You watch lustfully as you see him harden, this made you want to rub him faster. And you could tell from the noises he was making, that he was enjoying it all<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...Mistress, your hands are so soft...\" he complimented through his moaning. By this time he had fully erected and was dripping with pre. Gazing up at his huge malehood, you could see that there was no way he could be this big without you noticing, it was without a doubt that when the stone grew him, it doubled the treatment to his rod. You hug and rub him as he began leaking more pre, you let some of it fall on you. You noticed that he had a nice spicy taste as you tasted some of it, this causes you to rub faster, rubbing your whole body against his rod, you could feel from his throbbing that he was going to burst soon. All the heat and excitement had you nearing climax too. Finally, not being able to hold on any longer, he gives off a loud, echoing \"VULLLLLL!\" as he shot his load, showering you with his seed. This seems to go on for a while longer, with you enjoying every bit of it, once he calmed, you crawled over to his chest and hugged him as best you could, with him returning it. Both of you were now sticky with his juices, and neither of you cared. You cuddle up with him as you slowly begin to feel</span></div></div>",

You think \u201cIs this really happening?!\u201d You are quite frightened now that because of your small size, you are now vulnerable in getting hurt or perhaps stepped on... perhaps by your own Pok\u00e9mon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all these things are happening to you, your vulpix was also disoriented by the flash of the object it was holding and once it regained its vision, you were gone. It was a bit confused in why and or how you just disappeared out of nowhere. Even though the vulpix is quite a handful, it still loved you as it\u2019s trainer. On its way trying to look for you, it walked to the back door of the house looking through the glass to find you but you weren\u2019t anywhere. Being even more curious, it started to walk and smell it\u2019s way toward where it last saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the time you were studying your surroundings finding out that your still in your backyard and based on what you remember, all fences and doors were closed. Even though you were so tiny, you were a little relieved that you are at least safe where you are... for now. Just then, you became a tiny bit lightheaded which you assume was a small side effect of the very bright flash from the rock. It only lasted for just a few seconds then you were fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to wonder, \u201cwas that stone my vulpix was holding the reason I shrunk?\u201d You almost forgot that your Pok\u00e9mon was in your yard as well. \u201cCould it have shrunk as well?\u201d You ask yourself. Just then you hear some thumps from a distance, then they started to get louder... and closer. Looking at the direction of these thumps, you see the tails of a Pok\u00e9mon which you notice to be the ones of your Vulpix. These tails began to get closer and more of your vulpix was being revealed from the very tall grass. At your normal size, your Vulpix was the average small size but from the perspective of your new size, it looked absolutely massive now. Those thumps became uncomfortably louder as your first thought was that my own Pok\u00e9mon could step on me without even noticing. You didn\u2019t think it was much but you ran to the nearest grass blade and hid behind it hoping that it may increase your chance of not getting stepped on. As the thumps and booms of the vulpix\u2019s steps became closer, you then heard another noise coming closer. The noise sounded like sniffing. You peak from your hiding place to see that the vulpix\u2019s head was now visible and based on what you saw, it seemed like it was looking for something. You then think, could it be looking for... me? However, since the booms were getting louder, it started to shake the ground around you a little and you lost your balance while peaking and fell away from your hiding place into a somewhat open spot in the grass. A shadow starts to loom over and as you look back up, you see the massive paw of a Pok\u00e9mon come down somewhat close to you. Following that paw back up, you see the cute face of your Pok\u00e9mon sniffing around the area where you are. You hope that maybe the vulpix notices you to keep you safe from danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vulpix sniffs where your sitting, it...</span></div></div>",

A real human, however, has their own thoughts and personality and has no idea of the wonders I can show them, thus allowing me to see the unique look on your face when I play my little size tricks on you,\" she says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you've brought me for companionship,\" you say with understanding. \"Yes, believe it or not you're the first visitor here who hasn't fled after my initial test tricks.

You should know that a Ninetales has hidden powers stored in its tails. I have gained the ability to make myself as big or as small as I want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Oak is even more amazed. \"You're capable of size changing?

The rock itself was now surrounded by a bunch of 'small' kids playing, they were of varying age, but were all enormous. Your rock was in a corner, marking some sort of boundary as barefoot they ran in their sectioned off the field. You weren't quite half an inch tall, but roughly every inch was 16 feet, so the shortest of the kids were probably around 700 feet tall and the taller ones landed at well clear of a thousand. A 6-foot tall teen would be around 1152 by your best math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKids weren't exactly known for behavior, especially teens, so you got down and hid under the Pichu's fur, a single strand was around your height, so it was easy to hide by laying down.

He stopped at the rock in the corner and started moving his paws through his fur in search of you.

Believing that these are your final moments, you see your whole life flash before your eyes. You hope death will be kind to you, no matter where you wind up going. You lose consciousness as you experience the spinning of the whirlpool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken somewhere in a cave. You either somehow survived, or you're in the land of the dead. As you come to, you suddenly see a huge silvery white and blue figure before you, towering over you. When your vision becomes fully clear it is easy to realize that the figure is none other than the legendary bird of the ocean itself, Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon come to the conclusion that you are, in fact, alive, and it's thanks to the wondrous creature that now stands before you. It must have rescued you after you became unconscious. It doesn't sound too farfetched, as many speculate that the reason Lugia keeps itself so secluded is that it was believed that the fluttering of its wings could destroy a house.

Now!\u201d you yell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven through all the pain he has endured, Squirtle still refuses to use Tsunami. Instead, he tries to hit Fearow with a Water Gun attack. Yet, again Fearow easily evades the Squirtle\u2019s desperate attack. Seizing another opportunity, Fearow dives in and hits another critical Drill Peck attack, send Squirtle spinning into the ground and smashing into another tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can no longer bear the pain and torture Squirtle is suffering. Abruptly, you scream out, \u201cSquirtle!!! You have to use Tsunami! It\u2019s our only chance!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fearow lands on the ground with you still tightly held in its grasp. It gazes upon the downed Squirtle and begins to laugh. You look up in fear as the Fearow turns its attention to you as its potential victim. Just as it looks like Fearow is going to do something, you notice that there is moisture floating in midair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLASH!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Fearow are instantaneously blinded by a gigantic surge of water. The sheer force and pressure of the water frees you from Fearow\u2019s grasp and knocks you away from him. As the water recedes, you marvel at the magnitude of that attack. You\u2019re dazed as you try to get back up to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what had just happened to you, that is until you regain your senses to see that\u2026</span></div></div>",

It seems the effects of Tsunami are repeatedly applied as you stand dumbstruck at another one tenth your size. You figure that you have to be a little more than a half an inch high! The shock and awe of your new situation begin to fade as you remember that the Fearow was also hit by the same attack. More out of curiosity, you run around in the grass searching for the Fearow to see if it had also been reduced to a tenth of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was lying stunned in grass. The Fearow that tried to make you his slave had indeed been shrunk from the attack. Still to you, he was eight times your size. The surprised Fearow, which was almost just a mere four inches high, stands in place gaping upward. You start to wonder exactly what Fearow was looking at\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground quakes beneath your feet. You can barely keep your footing. Realizing this, you jump to one of the grass stalks and hold on. The ground constantly rumbles as whatever it is gets closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>STOMP!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice out of the corner of your eye that Fearow tries to escape, however he is caught midflight by an enormous blue foot. Crashing to the ground, Fearow becomes pinned beneath the giant foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSQUIRTLE!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clasp your ears at the resounding roar of your Squirtle\u2019s voice. Gazing up, you are astonished by the sheer size of your Squirtle. He had to be at least 160 feet tall to you! That\u2019s about 33 times your own size! You can tell that Squirtle was irate with Fearow right now. Even though it would be interesting to see what Squirtle was going to do to Fearow, you boldly dash out and try to get Squirtle\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell as hard as you can, \u201cSquirtle, I\u2019m down here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s no good. You are way too small now that your voice isn\u2019t even audible to Squirtle. You look on at the Fearow as Squirtle goes down to snatch him from under his foot. Fearow tries to break from Squirtle\u2019s grasp, but just like you moments ago is unable to. Squirtle begins talking to the Fearow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run towards Squirtle\u2019s foot, and without thinking begin to pound on it. The huge flesh of the foot vibrates as you try to get your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSquirtle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou successfully get Squirtle\u2019s attention, but you notice that the look on his face is more of bewilderment than of one of recognition.</span></div></div>",

You had just returned there from your Pokemon journey, and you had just a few days ago defeated the Elite Four. After a night of partying, the next morning you decided to take a stroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had not captured a new Pokemon in months. You decided to bring a few PokeBalls, and a Pokemon, a Luxray, just in case you ran into any you'd like to capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you were walking through the forest, and no Pokemon were showing up, then you made it to a clearing. In it was a lake of shimmering water. You walk up to it and gaze into it. You see perfectly your own reflection, so clear its as if you're looking in a mirror. You were about to reach in for a drink when a big figure cast its shadow above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to see a Shellfish Pokemon, Blastoise. But it was no normal Blastoise. It was a Shiny Blastoise, having a black body and a blue shell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! It's a Blastoise! And a Shiny one too!\" you scream, and pull out a PokeBall. \"Go, Luxray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Luxray appears, and its black and blue fur crackles with electricity. \"Luxray, Thunder!\" you command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray's body surges again, but before it could unleash its powerful Thunder attack, the Shiny Blastoise ran away. Seeking shelter, it dove into the sparkling waters of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It got way!\" you yell in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry, you start to turn, but you hear the sound of splashing and some heavy footsteps. As you turn back around, you see the Blastoise, but bigger! Your face only comes to his stomach. Also, the turtle is covered with a sparkling white aura. You watch in terror as it starts to expand in size, and only seconds later your lower than its tail. You look forward, and your facing a pair of HUMONGOUS feet.</span></div></div>",

However, she does something you've never seen a psychic ever do before; she begins growing. When she's finished, she's about twice her original height, a little over 10 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know if it's some psychic wave of thought from the Gardevoir or just gut insctinct talking, but you get a warm feeling from her, somehow knowing that despite being about 2 times taller than before (And therefore about 2 times taller than you) that she won't harm you in the slightest. You do wonder how she could have done this at first, but then you remembered that Gardevoir have the ability to distort dimension to some degree. You think that perhaps she found a way to warp space in a certain manner that could cause her to change her own size willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gardevoir then sits down, leaning her body to the side a little. She seems to be motioning to you to sit in her lap. You oblige, and you sit in her lap without any difficulty. She then starts petting you, starting from your hair and going down your back.

But standing in the palm of this giantess, you knew what was going on was the furthest thing from that truth. You peered over one of the large digits of her hand and seen the drop if you fell. Ooh boy, you think. Thankfully the wild Embrace Pokemon was so friendly and protective. Knowing you were safe made you relax a bit. She sat back down continuing to look at you affectionately as you tried to make sense of this. Those red eyes seemed to shine with her own psychic power. Using a finger she patted your head like you were a pet. Did she think that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe she considered you as her trainer now? The entire evolution line could sense a human's feelings and would hide from those unworthy or hostile. Plus a pokemon that could do this would be impossible to beat in a battle or contest. Not wanting to offend Gardevoir, any change in her attitude could spell big trouble for you, left you hesitant to openly ask. You had to admit just being like this made you happy and she seemed just as cheerful being around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could act upon your thoughts, your stomach growled. All that walking made you famished. <br>\r\n\"Um\u2026\" you start but the psychic green giantess knew and shimmered in blue light again. You figured she would grow again, but she remained at her current height. Instead you heard in the distance a loud rumbling then a rip. Native flying pokemon fled from the disturbance. Turning around, one of the trees was floating toward you. This left you stunned, clearly seen by your wide eyes. Just how strong was this Gardevoir? You backed up, making sure not to fall off your high perch, as it hovered over her open hand. Numerous fruits and berries were on its branches. It suddenly shook like a Machamp was holding it. Soon there was enough on her hand to feed for days. The tree quietly floated back and sunk back into place roots and all, showing no indication it was uprooted at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few fruits and sat back down, facing her. That large face continued to smile back. It is still hard to believe that only moments ago you two were nearly the same size. Waiting patiently for you to finish, Gardevoir remained completely motionless. She really took every effort not to harm you. The blue light continued its glow around her. <br>\r\nWhen you finished your fifth fruit you couldn't take anymore. You soon found yourself light as air. The giant psychic moved you to her shoulder with her powers. Effortlessly, she tossed all the leftover food into her mouth. It dawned on you she thought ahead. Continuing to exert this much power, though you couldn't tell but by how collected the pokemon remained, must have made her famished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that hunger no longer had your thoughts. You wondered about her thoughts. More importantly did she see you as a trainer, pet or what?</span></div></div>",

You just cant quite put your finger on it... it doesn't feel like act as dominating to think of you as a pet, yet she doesnt act as submissive to think f you as a trainer... It's almost as if.... nah! Don't be silly!<br>\r\nBut if you're not her pet and you're not her trainer, what are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a moment of staring into her smile, she closes her eyes... grabs a fold of her dress and curtsies... and then in an instant, her hand grabs your tiny arm. Then she removes the hand under you and grabs your other arm with it! 'What is she up to?' you think to yourself despite the fact she can probably hear you! The answer comes into view when she pulls your tiny right arm straight and begins moving toward that direction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of steps, you feel the world around you spin as she quickly turns around and continues stepping to the right! Finally, she stops, then pulls your left arm straight and begins stepping to the left! Once again, after a couple of steps, she spins around once more, making you even more dizzy!<br>\r\nThe embrace pokemon continues smiling with glee as she releases one of your arms and twirls around for a few seconds, and vice versa! ...Is she dancing with you?! Well, you know this type of pokemon is known for dancing, but this type of dance feels strange to you... and judging by the blushing on her cheeks, it's more than a simple dance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't recall hearing anything about this on a Pokedex, however you do recall watching a Discovery Channel special on the behavioral habits of a Ralts' lifestyle about when a Gardevoir and Gallade express their true feelings toward one another through a type of dance that... signifies... that... the two... are... OH!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SSSTTTTOOOPPP!!!\" you shout off the top of the lungs! Sure enough, she stops in her tracks and looks down at you questionably. Lots of questions raced through your mind, but you couldn't slip any of them out of your mouth! All this time, could this... creature really have a thing for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...wait a sec!\" you stutter, \"Uh..uh... the... this dance...does that... uh..\" You couldn't manage the courage to say it out loud to Gardevoir's giant-yet-serene face, yet you were able to think out the words just fine! 'Does that mean you consider me as... a mate?!'<br>\r\nJudging by the way she tilts her head, closes her eyes, and smiles while blushing, that isn't a 'no'! Hoo boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but... I I I'm... a...\" again you cant muster the words out of your words, so you say it in thought! 'But I'm a human!!! And your'e a pokemon!!!' Unfortunately, she just stares blankly at you for a few seconds and blinks. This is probably her way of saying \"...So?\" <br>\r\nOh man... THIS changes things! Your colossal pokemon friend has a crush on you! In fact so big a crush, she'd do a little mating dance with you!! And if it wasn't shocking enough, she's around 50 feet tall!! That could kill you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do admit, she is very beautiful for a pokemon, but she is a POKEMON! That might not work out. But then again, Gardevoir is a very kind hearted and caring being. She treated you very comfortably and took very good care of her tiny friend. That kind of thing is exactly what you look for in a good woman (a good HUMAN woman!). Plus, you'd be lying if you said you didn't enjoy that kiss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides... rejecting someone or something 10 times your size is easier said than done! And being someone that specializes in Psychic powers, she could obliterate you by just thinking it! Just your luck, eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you gonna do?</span></div></div>",

Your humongous ex-love interest's frown couldn't be bigger as her eyes began to water. <br>\r\n*Sniff!* *SNIFF!* She sniffles a bit as she tries to keep a straight face... but more and more tears continue to run down her cheeks. You can hear little gasps coming out of her mouth... It's official. You have just broken Gardevoir's heart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...Please don't cry,\" you try to comfort her, \"It's... it's not you, it's me! I-I cant be with you... we are both far too uh.. different from each other. It wouldn't work out.\" No good. She turns her head away from you and begins sobbing. Gardevoir even covers her face with her arm and sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYikes... you knew it was tough, but you didn't think she would take it THAT badly! But then again, maybe you should've after all the two of you have been through! Human or pokemon, she thought of you as a close friend. Heck, close enough to be considered 'The One'!<br>\r\nAnd now your gigantic happy-go-lucky dancing friend is now brokenhearted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if you thought THAT was painful, being a psychic pokemon, Gardevoir has a difficult time keeping her state of mind in focus, because her emotions are getting the best of her! This causes her body to glow several colors at a constant rate! First blue, then red, then yellow, then blue again, then purple, then yellow again, then red, then-<br>\r\n*KKKKKRRRRIIIIIIPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the trees all over the forest rip right out of the ground and are sent flying all across the land! Each single tree rips out of the earth and soar through the sky and land in several directions all over the place! And judging by the bizarre auras flowing around them as they fly... it's caused by the sobbing giantess you are at the mercy of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can overhear the screams of terror from the poor innocent people and pokemon running for their lives. At this rate, it wont be long before the entire forest is accidentally obliterated by the unstable psychic energy. It's no longer safe for you here... you hate to think of it, but it looks like you'll have to break free of your new friend and try to escape this forest with your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you know the real reason why all this is happening! And you might know the one solution that will fix this mess and possibly put a smile back on Gardevoir's face... Question is, are you Oz-Matik enough to do it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was the appropriate time for an unrationalized outburst.<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" you whispered obscurities under your breath, \"Fuck fuck fuck fuck! How did THIS happen?!\" To you, this was practically the equivalent of getting a sex-change! You were still enjoying being a guy so far and you were still enjoying being a human being so far!! Thankfully, you got to keep your uh.. male traits. But still, your'e no longer a HUMAN male, but a pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would you ever explain this to your friends and family?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of friend, the moment you turned around, you saw a humongous pale face with green hair staring back at you with those red-eye of hers. Sure enough it was your friend Gardevoir kneeling down at you, but it still took you by surprise!<br>\r\n\"WAH!\" you jumped back. Gardevoir looked at you with an apologetic frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to startle you,\" she spoke... IN ENGLISH! Her voice sounded cute, lovely, and angelic at the same time. You never noticed how heavenly a voice she has until now. But still! SHE TALKED!<br>\r\n\"You... you... you can speak English?\" you asked her. Unfortunately, she shook her head, \"No. You're actually speaking Pokemon.\"<br>\r\nSo you're actually communicating with her in a pokemon's language. You're probably justing \"Luca! Luca....rio!\" but those are actually words coming out of your mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Ms. Gardevoir,\" you try to ask as politely as possible,\"Why... why am I... a pokemon?\" The Embracing pokemon answered you a rather soothing tone that kinda calmed you down a bit, \"Well, you were rather cautious when I tried to express my feelings toward you because of a trivial issue,\" then smiled a little, \"so I simply got rid of that trivial issue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if that's the case,\" you reply, \"why didn't you change me into something more uh... 'suitable'? Like a Gallade?\" Unfortunately, that question caused your giant pokemon 'mate' to stand up and turn her head away from you while frowning, \"My... my heart was broken far too many times by Gallades... every one that I've met claimed they loved me... but it's not too long before each one finds a much prettier Gardevoir and dumps me on the spot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you apologized. Poor girl. It seems that Gallades never keep the same mate for too long. Such is the way of 80% of the animal kingdom...<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Gardevoir looked back down at you, \"I um, read your mind. Lucarios are your favorite type of pokemon, are they not?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, second favorite if you know what I mean!\" you answered her with a sly grin on her face, hoping it might cheered her up. Judging by the way she blushed and giggled, mission accomplished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still...\" she sounded serious, \"perhaps it was a little rude of me to change you without asking. If you want, I can change you back...\"<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay,\" you try not to be rude, \"I mean, sure this might take some getting used to, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I understand,\" she interrupted you, \"if you don't want to be a pokemon, I wont make you.\"<br>\r\nWell... in a way, you feel flattered that she chose you to be a suitable mate for you. And of course, due to certain circumstances, it was understandable she turned you into a pokemon.<br>\r\nStill, yo'ure a human. All your friends and family wont even recognize you like this! <br>\r\nOn the other hand, maybe it wont be so bad being a Lucario. You would like to test what kinda special moves you got firsthand. Who knows? It might be fun being a pokemon!</span></div></div>",

Although at this point you can count your blessings that you're as strong as a Lucario, because if you were still a human, you'd be dead. But still, you just cannot stay mad at Gardevoir. She is just too... adorable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that... but you seem to think of her more beautiful than ever. Deeper than just finding her beautiful. You actually find her attractive! Her looks, her heavenly voice, her intoxicating scent, everything!! Could this be some sort of side-effect of being a pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Gardevoir looked up toward the starlit sky... \"It's getting late. Are you feeling tired?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah a little,\" you answer her. Once again, the embracing pokemon smiled at you, \"Goody. I have a little surprise for you!\"<br>\r\n\"Surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her hand as a strange aura started to glow around it. By the looks of the direction she's looking towards, she must be concentrating on that group of trees a ways away. But whatever for? Your answer comes quick as a big object comes flying out from those trees and gently lands right in front of you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a bed! A nice, warm, cozy, king-sized bed! Out of curiosity, you jump on it! It feels so great and snug... whatever type of material it's made out of is heavenly! Almost as heavenly as-<br>\r\n\"How is it?\" Gardevoir asked you.<br>\r\nYou lie down on the bed embracing the comfy feeling against your back. \"Oh, it's just great! Thanks a lot, Gardevoir! You're the best!\" Your humongous friend simply tilted her head and smiled at your response! Isn't that so thoughtful of her? You get to sleep in style! It's not everyday a giant pokemon actually offers you a nice luxurious bed to sleep in. But one big question came to mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd you get it?\" you ask her. That question actually snapped her out of her little blissful state! She went from happy to nervous in about a microsecond.<br>\r\n\"OH! Uh... um... well... while you were still out cold, I...\" her eyes were rolling all over the place as if she was hiding something, \"...I borrowed it-*YYAAAAWWWNN* Wow... it is getting late! How about we continue on down the road tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" you pay her 'borrowing' no mind. Although you kinda feel sorry for whoever she managed to steal it from. Oh well!<br>\r\nGardevoir carefully laid herself down on the ground trying to keep any tremors to a minimum and rested her head against the grass as the head of hers was staring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nighty night!\" she smiled once last time before she closed her red eyes and dozed off. \"Good night,\" you whispered back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, there's still something from earlier you cant shake off. Now that you're a Lucario, you seem to have whole other feelings inside you. Not just physically, but emotionally. Mainly, involving how much more... interested in Gardevoir. It's almost as if.... you're in love with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Nah! It cant be! You're probably just getting sick or something. Maybe you'll feel better after you sleep. Who knows? Maybe you'll even wake up from this weird dream!</span></div></div>",

You're a Lucario so you can understand any Pokemon's language. And only two species of Pokemon would be howling at this time of night, Houndour and Houndoom! <br>\r\nYou jump off the bed, ready to wake up Gardevoir, but you don't get the chance to. As soon as you touch the ground, several Houndour jump out of the brush! They growl at you, obviously annoyed that you're awake. All of a sudden, one leaps at you, its eyes blazing! Before you realize what you're doing you slam the Houndour back at the pack, with the spiked side of your paw! The Houndours have stopped growling out of total astonishment. After a moment of hesitation, the Houndours decide to make tracks. However, the one you slammed doesn't move, and you can smell the blood coming from the wound you caused. Your stomach growls all of a sudden, and a strange thought enters your mind. You try to ignore it but you just can't. The Lucario part of you wants to feed, and there's no stopping it.</span></div></div>",

Still, you were a human once... a part of you remains civilized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating raw flesh sounds a little barbaric. But you ARE hungry.... AH! Cook it! Maybe that might seem like the most civilized thing you can do. Too bad you don't have an oven for even a frying pan with you. Just a shame Gardevoir didn't steal one of those, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you'll have to rely on building a fire to cook your food. This is a forest, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem finding what you need. First, you're gonna need wood to make a campfire.<br>\r\nNo problem. There are trees all around, so feel free to make your selection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick idea comes to mind. There's a special attack you wanna use on a tree, but you're not exactly sure how to pull it off. Being a Lucario for the first time ever in life, you're not exactly experienced. So you just gotta guess! You clench your spiked fists tight and try to concentrate... concentrate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands are glowing! It looks like it's working! You slowly open your palms and continue your concentration. You can feel surges of energy flow through your hands... finally, the energy surges combine and form a ball in between your hands! No time like the present.<br>\r\n\"AURA SPHERE!\" you launch the ball in the direction of a tree!<br>\r\n*KA-BOOOOOOOOOM!!* The second it comes in contact, the ball explodes and bursts the tree into flames! The thundering sound echoed all throughout the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, it STILL didn't wake up Gardevoir! Oh well. While she continues to sleep, you take advantage of one of the little embers on the ground.<br>\r\nAfter you consider the dead Houndoom to be nicely cooked, you take a bite out of him...<br>\r\nHe actually doesn't taste that bad, but you cant help but feel a little sick. Not because of the taste, but because of what you've just done! You've killed another pokemon viciously and are actually EATING it! You're kinda thankful Gardevoir didn't see what you did, even though she probably wouldn't mind. If anything, she'd probably want you to share the Houndoom with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few bites, you stopped eaten. You're finally starting to feel a little fatigued. That little fight you had with the Hounds must've took something out of you. Now you can finally put that relaxing bed that your giant friend was so nice enough to give you to use!<br>\r\nYou lie back down on the big bed and relax. It feels so good. Drifting off to sleep wont be such a problem anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially with that nice warm blanket over you. ...Wait a minute. There was no blanket on the bed! Gardevoir only brought you the mattress! Then what is this big soft green thing over your body?<br>\r\n...Oh! It's Gardevoir's hand! Aww... she never was one to resist showing you affection. You turn your head to look at her big lovely serene face only more....</span></div></div>",

Not a damn thing! Just stand there in silent... and wait... Wait for what? Who knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...It looks like you waited long enough. You finally managed to make out something glowing in the darkness... two things, actually. A huge pair of white glowing eyes... staring your direction. Before you could ask yourself who's eyes those are, you manage to make out something else: A huge set of shining white razor-sharp jaws underneath those eyes, opening wide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd scream.... if you could.

Noticing your new surroundings, it looks like you're not in that darkened place anymore.

Everything around you seems to be whitish colored. Not only that, but very uncomfortable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seemed to be squeezed from both sides by big soft, uncomfortably cushiony white walls. If that wasn't bad enough, your legs are pinned between these walls and a big red soft protrusion just between your legs giving you added discomfort!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first act of instinct is to struggle. You toss and turn while trying to push these soft walls away from you.... but you immediately stop when you see who those 'walls' belong to!<br>\r\nYou look upwards to see a certain familiar head..... Gardevoir's head! Thankfully, she's still asleep, so she isn't noticing that small little guy... between her breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like you never noticed them before. After all, she's a humanoid female pokemon! But now, you're caught in the middle of them! Great... she must've rolled on top of you in her sleep and knocked you out after you woke from that dream about the mysterious voice! That would explain the pain you're feeling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you'd rather be in THIS pain than the pain you might be in if she finds out you're in her... 'personal space'! Perhaps now would be a good time to think of a way to sneak out before that happens...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOPE! Too late! Her head is moving.... her neck stretches it back as she opens her mouth to let out a loud yawn!<br>\r\n*YAAAAAAAWWWWWNNNN*<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of rubbing her eyes, they immediately glance downwards toward your direction.... and widen with shock! Judging by her dropped jaw and blushing cheeks, she can see you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified of how she'll react to your perverted situation, you take your hands off her 'walls' and start apologizing! \"Uh... I.. I'm sorry! I am so sorry! I did not to uh... I'm very sorry!\" You mentally prey to god she doesn't kill you.. regardless of the fact she can probably read your mind! Damn, why'd it have to be a psychic?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after almost an hour (or probably just a few seconds) of staring at you with her jaw dropped, Gardevoir's shocked expression finally changes to...</span></div></div>",

And if that's not enough, she's nearly ten times your size! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're starting to like being a Lucario... and the way you've always felt about Gardevoirs... not to mention the way your new feral side is getting turned on by full-body breast massage... <br>\r\nYou can tell she's hoping you're ready to take the next step.

She's a pokemon, you're a pokemon (NOW anyway!), and the best advantage to not being human is you don't need to have to put a ring on her gigantic finger first!<br>\r\nBut then there's the other hand: You are very very small. She is very very big. Even if you were up for up, there is not much you could possibly do to her. But there is plenty she could do to YOU!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the fact that it could kill you, you're still new at this kind of... relationship. Maybe it'd be best to slow things down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um...I...well....I....I...\" it was hard trying to get the words out while the sides of her soft and uncomfortably comfortable boobs were constantly pushing against your tiny body! Gardevoir even giggled at the look of speechlessness on your face! At least you HOPE it was because of your face, not because of the little 'kickstand' between your legs you're trying to keep down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L...listen..\" you take a deep breath and start, \"I'm... I'm just not ready yet!\"<br>\r\nHer grin changed to a look of concern as she tilted her head and asked, \"But... why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... uh...\" No use hiding it. If you didn't tell her, she'd just read your mind! \"..because.... I'm too small! I'm not... big enough... to.... you know!\"<br>\r\nHowever, after hearing those words, her smile returned, \"...Oh, is THAT all?\" Gardevoir's hands pull her breasts away from each other, causing you to fall out of her cleavage and land on your bed. Unfortunately, your 'taming' wasn't over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you landed on the bed, on your back coincidentally, your arms and legs were pinned to the bed by her fingers! By the time you wonder what Gardevoir is up to, she leaned down toward you with her gigantic head staring down at you from only inches above!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth slightly and began to run her big tongue across your little body! It doesn't feel slimey and gross, but actually smooth and dry. However, WAY too smooth for comfort! With every stroke, you fill up with multiple emotions. It tickles... but it feels kinda nice against your furry body! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could savor the tongue massage, the very tip slips into your mouth, as if she's trying to French kiss you! Thankfully, she didn't try to stick her WHOLE tongue in your mouth, otherwise, you'd choke to death!<br>\r\nOk... this is all pretty awkward! If you had to guess, she's probably trying to... 'convince' you to get in the mood. Judging by the rush you're feeling, it's working... but it's still common sense that's winning the battle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when the tip of her tongue comes out of your mouth, you scream \"W WAIT!! STOP!!! I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU... I...I...I cant!!! It'll kill me!\"<br>\r\nNo good. <br>\r\n\"Do not worry, love...\" her heavenly voice echoes in your head, \"I promise I will be gentle. Please just relax.\" Finally, she lifts her fingers off you, freeing you of her embrace... actually, no. 'Freeing' you of her embrace isn't the right term!<br>\r\nJust then, you felt a bright powerful aura flow through your body. An aura that kinda makes you all hot and tingly all over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, you could feel it flow all through your body! You could not deny the fact that it felt good. A little strong, though... Could be another of Gardevoir's little 'tricks'?<br>\r\nAs you're feeling these odd surges through your body, you notice your legs are starting to disappear under what you assume is a big white curtain. As usual, your assumption is wrong! That happens to be your impatient mate's dress!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands ain't touching you, so she must be pulling you under with her mind! ANOTHER benefit to being a psychic! You know exactly what's gonna happen when the rest of your body 'disappears' under her dress! And since she's so big, it's a little more scary than intriguing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gotta stop her! There's no telling what'll happen to you when... IT happens! You know she's not evil. A little odd perhaps, but not evil. She'll stop if she knows you're terrified. You have to tell her to stop.<br>\r\nBut then AGAIN, Gardevoir did say she will be gentle. And you also know she isnt the type to lie to you. Maybe it wont be so bad... plus, you gotta remember: You're a pokemon, too!</span></div></div>",

Though you moved very slowly because she still wanted to see you for as long as possible before you would disappear and do your side of the deal. Did she really love you that much? You still had absolutely no idea why she would go so far for you, turning herself into a giantess and turning you into your now second favorite pokemon. Why would she go so far for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you think about it, where did she even get the energy for all of this? While it would seem natural for a psychic type pokemon to have amazing abilities, this had to be outside of what\u2019s normally possible, right? I mean not every psychic pokemon is able to have such incredible powers, otherwise there would\u2019ve been many more gigantic pokemon roaming around the surface of the earth other than yours truly. So how far did she go for you? Is she tiring herself out in order stay so massive? Is she actually suffering so you could keep your new Lucario form? Is she?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all these questions were poisoning your mind, you suddenly felt a surge of pleasure go through you body, calming you down almost like a sleeping pill. The cause was of course Gardevoir who sensed your increasing anxiety for her safety and wanted to ease your worries. She brought you to her face and began to lick you like she did earlier, fully knowing how to tame her little Lucario. Soft growls escape your mouth as you felt her cooling tongue run all through your fur as you realized and gladly accept how powerless you were when she felt like pleasuring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly snapped back to reality when she had lifted her tongue of your body. Your fur felt cool and wet due to her massive tongue having run over you and you felt yourself already wanting more. But that thought got put to the side line when you looked up and were greeted with her heartwarming smile. She now had you in the palm of her hand, literally and figuratively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do this for longer if you want to. Please tell me now if that\u2019s what you want\u201d she said so gently yet so seductively that you felt your animal instincts take hold of you as you let out a load roar truly belonging to a Lucario. Both of you were fairly surprised as you quickly covered up your mouth not knowing what came over you. Gardevoir\u2019s seductive smile however came back wider and brighter than before. \u201cWell, well, look who leaned to be a true Lucario.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-i\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know what came over me\u201d you said beyond embarrassed. She gave you a gentle giggle. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s only natural,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to resist my tongue\u201d she said as seductively as possible as she moved her face closer. You began to feel exited again expecting another tongue bath. When you saw her tongue coming out of her mouth, you started panting faster and faster. You closed your eyes in anticipation made yourself ready for another session of pure pleasure. \u201cThis is really happening!\u201d You thought to yourself as your desires took hold of you. And then......?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhahahahah! Got You!\u201d Gardevoir laughed historically as you were left warm and cold until the Realization dawned on you. At least you could call it the best April fools prank you had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.......I didn\u2019t Know you could be so mean....\u201d you said sounding defeated. \u201cAh, don\u2019t worry my Lucario, of course i\u2019ll-\u201c Gardevoir said before being interrupted when you kissed her on her ginormous lips. You could of course only kiss her on her bottom lip, and yours were unmatched by hers, but it was enough to take her voice and leave her speechless. Both of you saw each other blushing crimson red when you broke the kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c......ah....ahahaha! G-got you! T-that\u2019s w-what you get for f-f-fooling me! Ahaha.....haha.......ha.......yeah...... i love you\u201d you said dropping the prankster act. Gardevoir meanwhile looked at you completely baffled. The lustful tention between you two kept quietly building up until it was able to break her silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c........sorry to ask, but...... you wouldn\u2019t mind a bigger tongue run over your body...... would you?...... I simply can\u2019t hold it in anymore\u201d Gardevoir said withholding her lust as much as you. As for your response, you were only able to give a nod of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.......thank you so much.\u201d She closed her eyes as she cuddled you against her cheek as you felt as if everything was shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue aura returned as she continued to grow larger and larger as soft moans could be heard. If felt so good to see her so happy. While you didn\u2019t understand why she cared so much about you, you would do everything in your power to make as happy as she had made you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the growth subsided not too long after. While she hadn\u2019t grown enough to make a speck in comparison, you couldn\u2019t call yourself as big as her hand anymore. After her moans subsided as well, her gaze became fixated at you.</span></div></div>",

Apparnetly this Gardevoir has taken this ability a step up, being able to change the size of things with her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to worry about what the Gardevoir could do to you now, you being much smaller than she is. You know that Gardevoir are generally docile, but in this case you have pushed her to the point of shrinking you by following her after she already ran away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she picks you up with her psychic powers and pulls you over to her face. You continue to float there while she seemingly thinks her actions over. You hope that the generally docile nature of her species will prevail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought, she brings you over to her shoulder and places you there. She dosen't see you as a threat anymore, apparnetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You were a little hungry so you used ember to roast it and took a bite, after you ate the whole thing you were tired and decided to try to take a nap. However as you lay down things seemed different, almost like they were smaller. And after a few minutes you could tell you were growing, the thought excited you as you had always wondered since you were a child what it would be like to be huge. It was a slow growth, after about 20 minutes you had grown to 15 feet tall. You easily scared off every other Pok\u00e9mon and some trainers with your size alone, 20 more minutes pass and you are pleased to see you\u2019re growing past the 20 feet mark. Panting happily you soon are tall enough to see the city off in the distance, slowly a massive grin forms on your face as you start heading out of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while before you exit the woods and you have grown another 5 feet, now at an intimidating 30 feet tall you walk along a highway into the city. Every time you step cars are crushed under or swerve and crash into your massive paws, each one bigger than the cars that provide a satisfying crunch as you lower your foot onto them. Loving the feeling that this gives you you make it a goal to step on as many as possible, reaching the city you are officially 50 feet tall and your growing doesn\u2019t stop there, as you look out at all the fun things to smash or step on you drool at the thought of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as one person spots you hundreds more start pointing and screaming, this gets you even more excited as you walk through a small residential area feeling people down below pop and cry out in fear which causes you to look below you. The feeling of crunching beneath your majestic paw pads and warm blood soaking your feet causes you to yip happily, all the while people try escaping the city but the overpass near the exit collapsed from you stepping on it while you entered the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they realize they are trapped they try to make it to the airport, however that is your target and already while the mayhem was going on you grew even more. Once reaching the airport you see a line up of cars trying desperately to get in, you growl stepping towards them and charging a large fireball aimed straight at the cars. No time to escape or even think to escape was given as the huge ball of flames destroyed every single car with an explosion of fire and death, your sinister smile telling the people below that more was in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back towards the airport you step through the terminal, as the building collapses you can feel the humans all popping below your humongous deadly paws. The feeling is intensified when you shift your paw back and forth grinding the humans underpaw, you then watch as a plane tries taking off. You walk through the rest of the airport building feeling it fall to your powerful paws, the screaming echoes and you can feel yourself getting hard as you become horny seeing the people fleeing from you. As the plane was starting to lift off the ground you were upon it showing your teeth to the humans, then opening your jaws wide you thrust your face towards the aircraft and bite down on your snack. Screaming from inside the cabin suddenly becomes muffled, then as the plane disappears down your throat the screaming ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoy the flavor of the people inside whimpering in pleasure as your cock comes out of the sheathe, enjoying the destruction and death around you, you sniff the air smelling fear everywhere. You look around at the destruction before you, panting as you feel incredible you\u2019ve not stopped your growth yet and are reaching 100 feet. The whole world was in your grasp, you felt like nothing could stop you as you trampled the other planes some with people inside. This feels amazing to you and you howl out shattering windows and people\u2019s eardrums, suddenly you walk down a road as cars crash and crumble under your feet. You want as many people to witness this as possible, your cock is rock hard knocking down streetlights as you feel the sensations and bark. You reach downtown looking around at the people around you, with your new audience you thrust into an office building all the unfortunate people inside screaming for any form of mercy. Your orange sweaty fur gleaming in the sun as every thrust lowers the structural integrity of the building, panting heavily and smiling sensually your massive 40 foot cock demolishes the building as cum pours from your member destroying the building neighboring it. Your new slaves look up to see the hopelessness of the situation, a maniacal laugh echoes as you look towards the rest of the city. This is fun time to...</span></div></div>",

The flying white Pok\u00e9mon looked at you, and moved closer than Celebi with its cute black eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you find him, Mew?\u201d Jirachi questioned with a male but seemingly innocent and cute voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just found him enter our hangout and I thought he would be nice to have around,\u201d Mew giggled again after finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi nodded and moved over for Victini, who stayed back at a distance, a considerably scared expression on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-he's not gonna hurt us, is he?\u201d Victini asked, in a similar but timid male voice similar to Jirachi.

It\u2019s just I'm not used to small things,\u201d Victini admitted, in a slightly calmer state. He moved out of the way for the last legendary, Shaymin who was in its sky form. Mew lowered you to the ground, no longer feeling the tingling from her aura as Shaymin ran up to your tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s so freaking cute!\u201d Shaymin said cheerfully, nuzzling you with his huge white furry cheek, \u201cI want one too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry,\u201d Mew reassured her friends, \u201cWe can all share him, but since I was the one to shrink him and everything, I want the first turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded in agreement.

You got a mouthful of dirt and sweat each time your tongue lapped at the huge sole, and you made sure that your tastebuds got all the saltiness flavour before you swallowed it happily.

She wiggled her toes, which caused you to blush, \u201cThen show your goddess how much you love their feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, goddess,\u201d you say obediently. You dig your hands into Mew\u2019s soft, dirty feet and start rubbing them. Above you, Mew sighs in pleasure as you continue to rub her two massive feet in front of you. After giving them a full and thorough massage, you begin to kiss them all over. You make sure to get everywhere on her foot. Every inch, every centimetre of her foot was kissed by your unworthy mouth, even in-between the toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, slave,\u201d Mew said relaxed, \u201cYou can worship god Victini's feet now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmpf! After that meagre display of affection, I doubt he likes our feet at all!\u201d he said stubbornly, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease master!\u201d you beg, \u201cLet me prove to you how much I love your feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini let out a disappointed grunt. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll give you a chance to prove whether or not you love my feet, but it better be good!\u201d he said, positioning his feet in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get down on your knees and begin speaking to his feet, \u201cOh wonderful gifts of the pok\u00e9gods, may this speck\u2019s pathetic attempt to worship you please you and may you grant me worthy of being your continued slave and worshipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooting on your knees, you position yourself right at Victini's monstrous sole. That\u2019s when you truly begin to appreciate the beauty of Victini's feet. They were the loveliest colour, and so soft. They even let out a pleasant, to you, but faint odour of sweat. Your body acts on its own and you soon find yourself running your tongue up the bottom of his foot. You continue to act on instinct and keep licking all over his alluring foot. Soon, you had completely licked almost every part of his foot, but it still wasn't enough. You realised that you were staring at the gaps between Victini's toes and get a great idea. You begin to lick in between his massive toes, soaking up all of the dirt and sweat. When you finished you fell back on the ground, a little too excited for your comfort. You look up to see Victini's giant face smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done well slave! You\u2019ve regained my favour!\u201d he said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

You look at his butthole taking in a few sniffs. You take in the disgusting yet arousing odour before sticking out your tongue to make contact with it, licking slowly at the entrance of his butthole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not good enough servant! I want that tongue to enter my lovely butt!\u201d demanded Shaymin, adding pressure to his butt making it harder to move around. And yet, despite all of this, the feeling was still just amazing. You soon press your tongue into his butthole, tasting his sweat and the inside of his butt. It tasted lovely as ever as it could be while you pleasure Shaymin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing, the sky warrior Pok\u00e9mon gets up and turns around, facing you while you laid down on the ground looking at him. \u201cYou have proven yourself to the other gods and goddesses!

What have you done that denies you the privilege of worshipping our glorious forms? The only thing you\u2019re not worthy of is being our equals in any way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi floated over to you and dropped down right in front of you.

You wanted to keep being a slave to these Pok\u00e9mon, letting them do whatever they wanted with you. There has to be a way to make them keep you like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up slave!\u201d Celebi shouted above you, \u201cIt\u2019s been almost two minutes and you haven\u2019t even finished a foot! Speed it up or else you\u2019re gonna get badly punished!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue the pace of your massage, getting more of her sweat onto your hands and intensifying faint scent of fresh flowers in your nostrils.

You\u2019ve only known them for about an hour but during that time spent together, they\u2019ve all shown incredible happiness with you. When the time\u2019s right, you\u2019ll ask them if you could stay like this forever. A few minutes pass during this time and you finish your massage and humbly bow to your mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was that?\u201d you ask timidly, like an actual slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt did feel good and I was pleased by that,\u201d Celebi began, \u201cBut it took far too long!

You'd let us stay at your house? That's really cool of you!\u201d Shaymin praised, jumping happily in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny objections?\u201d Mew asked, looking at everyone before giving you the thumbs up (or paws up for that matter).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I better tell you where it is,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew giggles, \u201cNo need! When I first saw you, I read your literal \u2018trail of thoughts\u2019 and followed it back to your home. I know where it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were kind of offended that Mew read your mind without your permission, but what could you do? There was still one itching question left that needed answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great and all but what will I do while you lead everyone to my house?\u201d you ask Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin chimes in, \u201cDon't worry. I\u2019ve got you covered. Set him down here Celebi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe indicates a spot with his paw which you were gently placed down in front of Shaymin\u2019s massive form. An evil smile was spread across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in for a real pleasant surprise,\u201d he said as he lifted his hindpaw above you. You watch in wonder and delight as his dirty and furry white paw crashes down on you and traps you under it. Shaymin\u2019s toes firmly wrap around your head and he grinds you into the ground, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be spending your whole trip home under my feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! Let's go then!\u201d Mew announced to the group as everyone started walking/floating to your house, but not before she left a psychic message for Keldeo, telling him where they had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you happily take in huge whiffs of Shaymin's wonderful feet as he starts moving, lifting his paw into the air with you attached to it, getting stomped down hard to the ground. All you could see was Shaymin's nice toes as he continued to step down on you. It was such an odd pleasurable feeling, but you wanted more. You started to lick the area between his toes, enjoying the amazingly salty taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat tickles!\u201d Shaymin giggled as you continued licking his toejam up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues walking, working up a sweat on his feet which began to create drops of sweat that rolled down in and between his toes. You let your mouth open widely, getting as much of the fresh toe sweat and mushy toejam into you. The strange disgusting mixture wasn't as bad as you expected. His toes tasted a lot like steamed vegetables\u2026 but with a lot of salt, sweat and bodily fluids poured onto it, which you greatly enjoyed. Halfway throughout the journey, you switched from licking his toes to kissing them which Shaymin continued to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip was a blur for you but you knew you made it when you were shaken off Shaymin's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, we're here!\u201d Shaymin exclaims, looking up at your modest house. You look up as well, but not as the house, or Shaymin, or his feet. You saw the sky filled with stormy clouds. It was going to rain any second now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap!

You frantically roll around inside of the paw, acting off of fear and adrenaline. In panic, you attempt biting the paw to make whatever was holding you let you go. To your delight, you were dropped onto a nearby table and freed from your captor. You could hear some cursing coming from the dark figure that had been holding you earlier and laughter from something else in the room. They both sounded like males. Suddenly, the room you were in was filled with light and you were momentarily blinded. You rub the spots out of your eyes, realising that you had been kidnapped by two of your Pok\u00e9mon! The one that grabbed you was Zoroark and your Lucario was currently laughing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for biting me,\u201d Zoroark said sarcastically, in his deep but raspy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive him a break,\u201d Lucario defended you in his deep voice, \u201cYou did just grab him in the middle of the night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho did he expect? He knows we always keep watch at night,\u201d Zoroark complained back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d you ask, tired and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZoroark wanted to tell you his concerns about our new guests,\u201d Lucario said, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh brother\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZoroark, why can't you just trust them? They\u2019ve been plenty kind to me and wouldn\u2019t dream of hurting anyone here,\u201d you defend them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Zoroark wasn\u2019t having any of it, \u201cThat can change at any moment! I hate visitors, they come in, mooch off of us and we never see them again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \u201cNot these guys. They\u2019re different than the others,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZoroark, just trust them! We all need to go to bed. Especially him,\u201d Lucario said gesturing towards you, \u201cWho knows what kind of day he\u2019ll have tomorrow, when Glaceon and Luxio get their paws on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. But consider yourselves warned,\u201d Zoroark said, leaving. You roll your eyes and talk to Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for defending them buddy!\u201d you say thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, anything for my trainer,\u201d your Lucario says with a dismissive wave of his paws, \u201cLet's get you back to bed. If Vulpix finds you missing, she might start crying again,\u201d he said grabbing you in his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

You said you were going to 'play' with me?\u201d Vulpix reminded while pulling off an adorable face. You instantly remembered that Vulpix wanted to play but never got it yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, so how do you want to play?\u201d you asked Vulpix. She instantly giggled and turned around, showing her huge furry rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can just skip all the role-playing and we will just get straight to it; I want you to lick my nice butthole clean,\u201d she says as she backs up, pressing your face into her lovely rear. You instantly gave her gorgeous rear a nice sniff. You loved the pleasant smell coming from it even though its putrid. After sniffing, you pressed your face onto her butt hole and pushed your tongue into her butt hole. She gave off a bit of a moan as you continued to lick every inch of her huge gorgeous rear. After you finished, you backed away from Vulpix as she turned back around and gave you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks! That was so nice,\u201d she said as she took you into the kitchen for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast with all these Pok\u00e9mon was interesting to say the least. Even though you were shrunken down to the size of a very small doll, it was relatively easy to finish eating your usual scrambled eggs. While you wait for everyone else to finish, you take note on what each Pok\u00e9mon ate and how they consume their meal. Surprisingly enough, most of the bipedal Pok\u00e9mon ate how a regular human would eat, and were eating regular food as well. Only Shaymin, your Eeveelutions and Shaymin were eating by dunking their heads in some food bowl. You and some of the others laughed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone finished their breakfast, everyone decided to go outside except Zoroark who came over to you, \u201cYou know I still don't trust them right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Zoroark, but how about I make it up to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d Zoroark asked, wanting to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

You walk over to his hindpaws and you start rubbing them. As you continued this menial task, you got a sniff of the smelly scent they gave off. Dear lord, it was wonderful. It was completely unlike any other smell you'd ever smelled before and you wanted more! After finishing massaging his toes, he lifts his other hindpaw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLick my soles clean and make it quick! Your rubbing took too long!\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to lay on your back as he puts his paw on your face. You got a stronger whiff of the smell perspiring from his feet. The smell was pretty strong for a small cute Pokemon like Luxio but you loved it. You begin to lick his huge dirty blue paws, lapping up all the sweat that stuck there from yesterday. You press your tongue between his toes licking all the little specks of dirt and crud you could find. After you did the same thing for the rest of his paws, you move to his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlave, I have enjoyed my feet rubbed and licked clean, but you were very slow and you deserve a punishment,\u201d he says sternly as he begins to sit on you. You were easily pinned by Luxio, his butthole just inches away from your face, \u201cSince you were very slow, you are going to get a stinky punishment!\u201d Luxio began to let out a fart. It smelled putrid in a way where you could not enjoy it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god, please let it make it up to you!\u201d you protest, trying your hardest to push Luxio off, not wanting to smell his awful farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's too late for that slave, this will be your punishment until I am done!\u201d Luxio said firmly before he let out a longer and stinkier fart, causing you to push twice as hard, but it was no use. After Luxio let out one last fart, he sighed as you continued to struggle under your dark and smelly prison. Luxio soon gets up and turns toward you, \u201cNow I'm going to find someone else for you to serve!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxio leaves, forcing you to wait for your next playmate.</span></div></div>",

It looks like my little trainer feels like being dominated by a sexy goddess. Well I think I can help you with that,\u201d she teases seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't noticed at your old size but now you definitely did. Your Glaceon was surprisingly attractive. Every part of her, especially her luscious paws and furry butt was arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you have me do my goddess?\u201d you ask, humbly bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll have you give me a nice good dose of old-fashioned worship,\u201d she says, settling in front of you, \u201cBow to your goddess and give me prayers of love and worship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly get down on your knees and start giving praise and love to her. This continues for several minutes until she suddenly pins you under one of her front paws, \u201cTell me how much you love my pretty paws,\u201d she says suggestively.<br>\r\n\u201cYour paws are the gifts from the gods and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were interrupted as her toes suddenly squeeze around your small body and you feel literal tonnes of pressure on your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep going. My gifts are just giving you a hug,\u201d Glaceon says above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue, \u201cAnd any bug crushed under your feet should give praise for that privilege. Any being tortured by your paws should be considered the luckiest beings alive,\u201d you say struggling from the tightness of your 'hug'. \u201cThe gods themselves are not worthy of even being in your paw's presence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is soon released from the hug and is pinned under Glaceon's toes instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow them your appreciation! Give them the full treatment!\u201d she demanded. Woah, she's really going all out to make you feel insignificant. Regardless, you start to rub her paw while kissing and licking in between her massive toes. You tried your best to lap up all the muck lodged inside with your tongue while you were getting covered in Glaceon's foot sweat. But hey, it was enjoyable nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finished, she had you start on the next paw. Then the next, then the next, each one dirtier and filthier than the last. When you finally finished all of her paws, they were sparkling clean with your saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job,\u201d Glaceon says happily, \u201cNow for the ultimate pleasure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around excitedly, she shows you her sexy rump and gives it a slight wiggle, \u201cEnjoy your time in there,\u201d Glaceon says as she sits on you, completely trapping your whole body in her butt, \u201cI'll let you out soon but only if you give my butt the full treatment too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to disappoint her, you begin to kiss and lick the inside of her beautiful butt. While you intensely lick the rancid smelling stains from deep inside her butt, she continues to fart on you. This went on for a few minutes and even though you loved the smell of cold Glaceon farts, you barely managed to survive your time in there. Thankfully, the time inside went by pretty fast and you were released before you could suffer anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job trainer!\u201d she cheered, breaking out of character, \u201cI'll go get someone else to give you some fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Glaceon leaves, you collapse on the ground, thinking very happy thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho comes in next?</span></div></div>",

Zoroark kills his illusion showing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I thought you weren't coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, anyway, we're here to play with our new servant after heavy consideration,\u201d Zoroark said looking at you with a devious look. You get up and look at your two new gods and bow before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am here to serve you and your every whim!\u201d you announce. Zoroark then give you devious grin as he and Lucario sit down with their feet facing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen come here my little slave, your gods want to give you a little present,\u201d Zoroark said as you come between Lucario's and Zoroark's feet while facing Lucario looking at his sexy toes and paw pads. Then, without warning, Lucario and Zoroark squished you between their feet with your face pressed between Lucario's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, be a good little pathetic slave and lick your Lucario god's toes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gladly accept as you begin to lick between Lucario's toes, tasting the dirt and sweat that laid between them. As the salty mushy liquid entered your mouth, your ears pick up the sounds of his vigorous, desperate moans, clearly enjoying the treatment you were giving him. All that walking around must have done a number on his feet and you basked in the furry smelly musk that radiated in his stompers. Even you were getting a little excited down there as you happily gulped down his toejam. Soon, you finish licking between Lucario's toes and your Pok\u00e9mon let you down as Lucario picks you up in his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good my little slave, now you get to lick my sexy tailhole,\u201d he winked. Lucario moved you over to where he was sitting, and lifted his huge rear as you got off of Lucario's paw, \u201cLay down with your face right under my nice sexy tailhole and then sniff and lick it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obey Lucario's command and wait for him to sit down right onto you, where his butthole was the only thing in your sight. You take in some heavy whiffs of Lucario's butt. It smelt worse than Glaceon's butt but you enjoyed the humiliation of forced butt sniffing. You soon begin to lick his tailhole, licking off the sweat, cleaning the inner walls inside of his blue, sexy, and comfortable butt. It was easy to tell that Lucario was enjoying this just as much as your foot worship, occasionally purring whenever you licked off a hard to reach spot. You finished quicker than you thought, and Lucario took you out from under his butt before placing you in front of Zoroark's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now Zoroark's turn to shine and already you were mesmerised. You just couldn't help yourself but stare at Zoroark's sweaty and dirty feet. He snaps you out of your trance, and starts to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlave, you have pleasured your god well, but now it is my turn for you to clean your ruler's feet! I want you to give them a nice long rub, when you finish that, I'll tell you what you're doing next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod while walking ever so closer to Zoroark's gigantic feet. You press your hands into one of his soles and begin rubbing as hard as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's good slave, keep it up!\u201d Zoroark said as he laid down, smiling. You begin to feel your hands getting covered from some of Zoroark's paw sweat as you switched feet and began to rub even harder. Occasionally, you took whiffs of his deeply captivating feet, but even that wasn't enough to make this task any less boring. Your Zoroark was feeling the same way and decided to step things up to the next level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's enough slave. Now, I want you to kiss my aching feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my god,\u201d you say timidly as you looked at Zoroark's feet and gave them a big kiss. Zoroark and Lucario both laughed at this as you rubbed his feet a little bit while taking extra time to give those feet the kisses they deserved. The taste you got from them was even better than just the smell that it was beyond imagination. You soon went over to his other foot and began to give it a nice long kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for the best part, lick both of my feet clean! If you miss a spot, there will be severe consequences! Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nod as you begin to lick from the bottom of his sole to the top of his toes, not missing a single spot as you enjoyed the tasty sweat. It was so undeniably sour but damn, it turned you on so much. After you finish the first foot, you move to his second, giving it the same treatment as before, while burying your face in the furry foot, soaking yourself in his amazing paw sweat. When you reached the toes, you began to go a bit slower licking every little inch of his toes, taking extra steps to ensure that even the crevices that laid between each of his toes were spotless. After you finish, you could see how well you cleaned those toes and Zoroark gets up and checks them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good my little slave, you have served your gods well,\u201d Lucario complimented. You give a bow to both of your Pok\u00e9mon as they both give off a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon broke out of character as Zoroark picked you up, \u201cWell, that was definitely fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Lucario added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever thought of staying this size? I'm just kinda wondering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly have, it's just a lot of fun being at this size,\u201d you admit a bit too happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lucario said, \u201cMew did tell all of us that she was the one to shrink you, she's sitting under a tree outside. Why don't you ask her while the time is right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a great idea Lucario!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen go! You have our blessing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon head outside heading towards Mew who was sitting outside with her feet facing out just enjoying the other Pok\u00e9mon. You run over to Mew until\u2026</span></div></div>",

Above you was the smiling face of Eevee, the newest addition to your Eeveelution family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Uncle!\u201d he greeted happily in his young innocent voice. You smiled; he was just too adorable for you to ignore him. You'd figured you could just entertain him for a second before you were on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Eevee,\u201d you replied warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we play a little?\u201d he asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry but I have to ask Miss Mew an important question now,\u201d you reply with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh. Well can we play after that?\u201d your Eevee asked, his eyes showing an expression of hopefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! And I'll make it extra-long,\u201d you assured him, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! But can you at least come say hi to my brothers and sisters? We didn't see you at all yesterday,\u201d he said, giving you his signature puppy dog face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concede, \u201cI guess I could but only if it's really fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Eevee squealed. \u201cYay! Hold on tight!\u201d he says, taking off with you still under his paw. After being slammed into the ground for quite some time, the two of you finally arrive at your destination. You drop down from Eevee's uplifted paw gasping for air after having it knocked out of you so many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverybody! Uncle's come by to say hi but it has to be quick! He has a question for Mew, I think he's gonna propose!\u201d Eevee shouted out to his siblings. You hear chuckling coming from everyone as they came to greet you and Eevee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that Eevee. I don't think that'll ever happen,\u201d your Umbreon said in his normal teenage voice, before he turned his attention to you, \u201cHey Uncle. Sorry I missed you yesterday but I was too tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else gave similar remarks as they all came over. Jolteon jumped up and down as he greeted you next with a little more energetic voice than Umbreon, \u201cSame here! We missed you sooooo much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two are so lame. He deserves better greetings than that!\u201d Espeon said, in her calm but seductive voice. She snuggled her cheek against you, \u201cHi Uncle, I missed you the most! I just want to cuddle with you all night long!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're such a butt kisser!\u201d Vaporeon answered back with an equally adorable voice, \u201cUncle appreciates just a simple 'hello'. Isn't that right?\u201d she asks, licking your whole face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you are wrong!\u201d Flareon interrupted in her warm, loving voice, \u201cUncle likes a wordless greeting with just a small sign of affection.\u201d she rubs her nose against your chest for a few seconds before she was tackled down by Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe a huge amount of affection!\u201d the pink fairy Eeveelution happily chimes in as he plants a huge kiss on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think it really matters,\u201d you say, not wanting to take a side in a pointless argument, \u201cI'm sorry about not spending time with you guys yesterday. I apologise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d they say all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just go ahead and ask Mew your question,\u201d Espeon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can all play later,\u201d Vaporeon reassures herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow go ask Mew that question!\u201d Jolteon encouraged, urging you forward with his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you make it to Mew without interruption?</span></div></div>",

You had to admit, that wasn't as fun as you thought it would've been, but you did help out a friend. You can deal with it. You hoped that your next master that played with you would be just as cruel as Glaceon. You'd hate to waste any possible fun time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should ask someone to 'eat' me. I've kind of wondered what it's like to be in someone's mouth,\u201d you think to yourself, \u201cBut right now, I've got to play with one of the Eeveelutions.

Still, it's still mainly the same as you remember it. Anyways...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just an average person living in a normal world. You didn't have any magical powers, or immense power, or a wanted poster with your name plastered on it. Instead, all you really had was just typical nerdy teenage boy stuff like Pok\u00e9mon plushies, football jerseys and piles of manga books stored on your small shelves of your bedroom. You've always been a huge fan of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, but you also had a secret fascination for their feet. Every time the show was on, you spent most of the time just staring at the paws of whatever Pok\u00e9mon was featured in the episode, barely paying attention to what Ash Ketchum and co. were currently doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how soon you would change your mind\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day you were strolling around in a nearby forest, when you came across a huge blue shimmering circle, about five metres in width and length. Curious, you touched it and it felt like water. For a second you thought about running home and telling somebody about it, but there was something alluring about this strange occurrence that urged you to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing your instincts, you tense yourself and walk right into the shimmering circle. Suddenly, you were swirling around in a big purple vortex! Twisting, falling, and falling\u2026 until moments later, you were spat out of the vortex and you hit the grassy ground with a soft plop in the forest. You waited for your blurry vision to stop shaking before you stood up and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in the world of Pok\u00e9mon. You could see poochyenas frolicking and taillows flying\u2026 but there was something wrong. You were watching them as if... as if you had shrunk! You looked around again, at the trees, and noticed that they were indeed much bigger than you were comfortable with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't even any time to take this realisation in as your ears picked up muffled stomps coming towards your position. You turned around slowly, and saw a giant Treecko and his green feet. His looming presence came closer with every step and with him unaware of your position, you were worried that you might get squished. But the Treecko just kept on walking and suddenly, the big, green foot was hovering above you. Paralysed, you said a quick prayer hoping for a quick death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, the Treecko sensed something \u2013 he stopped and stepped back. He looked around before his eyes locked onto your tiny self. The Treecko knelt down, his right foot just in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, little bug! Wanna get to know my feet?\u201d Treecko exclaimed. He shuffled his foot forward, his sweaty toes cushioning the whole of your body except your head, \u201cI've been waiting for ages for something to be squished under my soles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Treecko! Don't squish me!\u201d you pleaded, \u201cI'll be your friend! I'll\u2026 I'll even be your slave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held your breath, hoping this had worked.</span></div></div>",

Well it kept you alive for now but you were dreading the foot licking part. Treecko lifted his foot at a slight difference before pushing them together with you in-between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were mainly afraid you were going to fall as he stood up fully and began to walk to the cave he spoke of but now all that was running through your mind was the stench. With Treecko's toes pressing on you, you couldn't see, and what little air you can breathe was filled with sweat. You knew things were only just the beginning though since he said he was going to 'let' you lick his feet and you were beginning to lose fresh air as the grip of his toes was so tight. You felt like you were about to pass out, but soon you felt your back being pounded by the rocky ground and you were just wishing and hoping that the Treecko had arrived in the right cave before you lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released you from the grasp of his sweaty toes and now lifted his foot a bit, giving you the freedom to look around your surroundings. It was pretty dim but you could see that the cave was damp and at the same time rugged, nothing like what a grass type Pok\u00e9mon should live in but more of a rock or ground type. You tilted your head upwards and stared at him helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe responded to your look by sitting down and shoving his two dirty green feet on your face, \u201cGo on! Ya know they are not gonna lick themselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the sole of his foot and stared further; yes, they were extremely filthy. Still, a job had to be done and you didn't want to piss off a giant Pok\u00e9mon who could squish you in a second. You brought your tongue out from your mouth and slid it across a small portion of one of his toes as he wiggled the other two. You could taste the nastiness and sweat built up in his foot but it was unmistakable how much Treecko was enjoying the treatment. You let more of your tongue slide out and graze against his dirty sole and your stomach was churning but you knew you had to keep going since your life was dependent upon it. Meanwhile, the Treecko seemed to be in deep thought looking down at you as you licked and caressed his dirty feet. Eventually, he moved his foot away and looked at it; his foot was almost spotless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Treecko gave you a smile, \u201cYep, I think I'm going to keep you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at him and decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

You didn't want to get stomped into paste so you decided to accept your fate as Treecko's slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey little bug,\u201d Treecko broke the silence. He sat down and extended his three-toed feet towards you, \u201cIt's time to kiss my toes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched at his demand. It wasn't exactly a strange thing to do in context and you know how much you love Pok\u00e9mon feet but you were still reluctant to follow through. Treecko noticed this and inched his toes closer to your face, playfully trying to get you to make out with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be shy!\u201d Treecko quietly assured you, \u201cI know you want to kiss them really badly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel more relaxed by his words so you pucker up your lips and slowly lean towards Treecko's huge toes. The smell was horrible but also rather enjoyable to you. As your lips touch one of his toes you felt an urge to vomit but for some reason you became even more addicted to his feet. You could taste his slimy foot sweat but with it came the sparks of pleasure that shot through your body. His toes felt so incredibly soft, and slick with your own saliva and thick with sweat. Once finished, you looked up and saw Treecko's relaxed face, clearly enjoying every second you were devoting to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh bug, that was nice,\u201d Treecko complimented before standing up, \u201cI think I'll call for my big brother, he's gonna love you hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks deeper into the cave, what do you do?</span></div></div>",

It got your body shaking from excitement and honestly, you craved more of that sweaty smelly goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, Treecko came back quickly with someone else. You quickly noticed the slightly bigger silhouette next to the familiar sight of Treecko's own shadow as well as the echoing sounds of footsteps that were more intense than Treecko's. The figure came closer and soon you were able to recognise him as a Grovyle. The two Pok\u00e9mon stops in their tracks, mere inches from your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this the bug you told me about?\u201d the Grovyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d came the cheery reply from Treecko, \u201cWell, I'll let you two have some alone time together! Goodbye bug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTreecko walked out of the cave, presumedly to get in contact with another of his various Pok\u00e9mon friends, leaving you stuck with the Grovyle. Oh well, that just means a new set of feet to lick and worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, human,\u201d said the towering figure of Grovyle as he leans down to get a better look at you, \u201cI hear you're a foot person, is that true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yyes,\u201d you stuttered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't worry little bug, I'll be gentle hehehe,\u201d said the Grovyle before a sinister smirk formed on his face. He takes a seat on a nearby rock in front of you looking at your tiny form, thinking of ways to make your life miserable. He definitely wasn't going to be as nice as Treecko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, I know,\u201d Grovyle said as he extended his feet towards you, \u201cyou can rub my feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walked towards the massive feet while Grovyle encouraged you to engage in some foot action. He wiggled his giant toes, clearly in an attempt to lure you closer. So, you then\u2026</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walk towards his feet and start to massage them, stroking your hands slowly against the Grovyle's giant sole. His green soles were surprisingly soft and with each motion you took, you secretly took a big whiff of his smelly feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle bug,\u201d Grovyle moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Grovyle?\u201d you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you end up here?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d you admitted, \u201cI was walking down this forest when I saw some weird-looking portal. I was walked through it and found myself shrunk down and then Treecko just found me on the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you shouldn't worry about it now, just continue rubbing my massive feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue rubbing Grovyle's sweaty sole, but this time using your own head to rub up and down. Feeling brave, you open your mouth and licked a little bit of his foot sweat. Oh my god, his foot tasted better than Treecko's! You couldn't stop yourself smiling as you taste it, lapping up the salty liquid that was oozing from his green feet. You loved it, and it felt like your enjoyment was spiking heavily upwards..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must really like feet,\u201d Grovyle made an observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 especially Pok\u00e9mon feet,\u201d you say, hugging his massive smelly sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh that feels nice,\u201d he says laying down, \u201cTreecko was right about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou elicit a small chuckle, \u201cHehe yeah I guess he was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot massage went for a few minutes longer and you loved every second of it, rubbing and kneading as best as you could. You couldn't believe your luck; if you lived in a world where you were a foot slave to all the Hoenn Pok\u00e9mon, it's be like pure heaven. The experience you had with your face buried in Treecko and Grovyle feet was something you wouldn't trade with anything in the world. But you wanted more\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Grovyle,\u201d you ask, still rubbing his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I\u2026 may I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, little bug? Go on, spit it out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I kiss your toes?\u201d you request nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don't mind,\u201d says Grovyle as he lowers his feet so you can reach his toes. Without any hesitation you sniff his toes before you pucker your lips and start kissing his pointy toes. You found it so surprisingly delicious that you didn't even notice Treecko walk back into the cave to where the both of you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I see you guys had some fun hehe,\u201d said Treecko. You stopped kissing Grovyle's toes and turned around to your first master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you were right about this bug, he can't get enough feet!\u201d said Grovyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTreecko rested his hand on his chin, trying to think up of an idea, \u201cHmm, hey Grovyle, come over here. I have a plan.\u201d<br>\r\nGrovyle walks over to Treecko and they both start whispering to each other, sometimes chuckling and laughing to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, that's just cruel!\u201d Grovyle says which causes you to get worried at the thought of what they could possibly be planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if he loves feet this much then he'll love this!\u201d says Treecko. They both walk over to you with devious looks on their faces. What do they have in store for you?</span></div></div>",
