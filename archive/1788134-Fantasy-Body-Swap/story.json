This world you live in is filled with magic, monsters and crazy beings that don't exist in the, \"Real,\" world, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do today?<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>First Story</b>: You leave the confines of the city to make a delivery to another city, and get attacked by bandits and your cart is over turned. You discover one of the things you were transporting is a magical mirror that swaps the bodies of those who look into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Second Story</b>: As a student of magic, you find a tome in a magic shop with strange spells. To your dismay, reciting the spell inside kills you- but your soul from your body, allowing you to choose a new host. The only way to exit a body is to use the spell, and the victim's original soul is eradicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Third Story</b>: After you defeat a band of goblins, a cursed bracelet sticks to your wrist that transforms you into anyone or thing that you kill, from this point forward. It cannot be removed and you cannot shift at will, except by killing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fourth Story</b>: A warlock steals your soul. Someone defeats him and undoes his evil, but your soul is returned to the wrong body.</span></span></div></div>",

You crack the reins, and tell your horses to speed up, but it's no use. The men on the horses move in front of you, halting you in your tracks, and surrounding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have we here, peasant? What's in the wagon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food, Crops. I'm not a royal affiliate. I'm not carrying treasure or valuables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughs, and hops into the back of your wagon. \"Good, Good. I appreciate an honest man. There's no need to lie and make this unpleasant for everyone involved.\" He searches through the contents of your cart, with a surprising level of integrity. While he performs a thorough check, he's very careful not to mess anything up or wreck the things he's not interested in. Except, \"Found something,\" he shouts, bringing a brown package to the front, next to you. \"What's this?\" You look at the brown parcel, and admit that you are not sure what is inside. For some reason, you believe if you had told him it was nothing worthwhile, he would have believed you, but you don't test that theory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deepest apologies, then. I'll be opening this.\" The bandit removes the packaging and removed an old looking mirror. It's not made of gold or silver or any valuable sort of material. There's no embroidery of gemstones, and there's even a number of scratches on the glass faces. It's a small, circular shaped mirror, with two reflective surfaces, one on each side. \"It's worthless, he says, as he holds up the mirror and looks into it.</span></div></div>",

After a moment of blackout, you lost the feeling of wings on your back and your feet felt the ground again. You blinked a few times before looking around and at yourself. You smiled, relieved that you were back in the body that you are used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found the pixie, on the ground while rubbing her sore butt from a similar fall you experienced earlier. You also saw the mirror not far from her. Carefully picking up the mirror so that it didn't capture your reflection, you covered it with a rag and kept it in your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" You asked the pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, except my bottom is hurt...\" she whined. The pixie then flew back up and stared at you with a smile, \"Well, at least we are back to normal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It seems it really is caused by the mirror\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I don't know...

But still, the won't forgive me easily... I'd literally be enslaved to pay the loss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the mirror?\" the pixie asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just leave the mirror here... This is quite a dangerous magic artifact. I'm not saying there is no chance of me using this for my personal gain, but there will be evil people who might do worse things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, at least you are not lying about not going to use it again,\" said the pixie. She let out a sigh before continuing, \"I tell you what, my master is quite proficient with magic and the likes, so maybe we can meet him and discuss this?

Your carriage may be utterly destroyed, your horses scattered several hundred metres up the hillside, and the enchanted body-swapping mirror too heavy for you to carry (if it even works after the pixie dashed it to the ground). But you'll be damned if you let some mischievous pixie run off with your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally catch up to her, amazed at how big and frightening your old body looks from this angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><i>\"I won't let you get away!\"</i></span></span> You shriek in Selina's high-pitched, syrupy voice. <span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><i>\"Even if it takes all day!\"</i></span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina swipes her hand at you. You barely manage to flutter out of the way, feeling a gust of air send you sprawling. You brush green hair out of your eyes in time to evade another swat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a forest pixie like you going to do to me?\" Selina taunts, laughing as you ping into her shoulder and chest. \"I'm a strong man now. I am no longer limited to the wilderness; I can go wherever I desire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs you by your wings and holds you up in front of her face. You struggle and thrash but it's useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My magical powers... well, <i>your</i> powers now... only work within this forest.\" Selina explains. \"Also, since I'm no longer a pixie, my language isn't constrained in rhyme anymore. I must say, it feels liberating to speak in free verse.\" Seeing your confused expression, her eyes glint with malice. \"Go ahead, say something, pixie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff. <span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><i>\"I'm a moth and you're the flame, if you think I'll play your game!\"</i></span></span> You slap a delicate hand over your mouth. Selina giggles, her louder and deeper voice rumbling like an earthquake over your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><i>\"How can you think this is funny?\"</i></span></span> You sigh exasperated, <span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><i>\"Let's swap back, do you want money?\"</i></span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what you've given me is worth more than money!\" Selina laughs again, flicking you into a nearby pile of leaves. You brush them off and lie on your bum on the forest floor, breathing heavily after this ordeal. Selina's body may be magical, but it's also really weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><i>\"You know nothing of my life! My job... my home... my son... my wife!\"</i></span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true, but I'm sure a villager up yonder will recognise me and guide me home. After the bandits attacked you earlier, all I need to do is feign amnesia. I'll say that they roughed me up so badly that I forgot who I was; your family will never suspect that we swapped due to a now-broken enchanted mirror, lost within the confines of this forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that Selina could very well assume your life without anybody the wiser. In your many years as a courier, you've never transported any magical device that could swap bodies. Such a trinket was practically unheard of in the Mallow Kingdom; maybe in some faraway sultanate but certainly not here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina places her hands on her hips. \"Now I've grown tired of talking to you. Fare thee well, pixie! May our paths never cross again...\" She waves before bounding up the hillside out of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><i>\"Please don't leave me stuck like this!\"</i></span></span> You call out to her, unsure whether she can still hear you. <span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><i>\"A waif-like pixie in this abyss!\"</i></span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could chase after her, but after leaving this forest you'd be without her powers and unable to fly. So what's the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill lying on the forest floor, you gaze upward at the midday sun before thinking of everything you've lost. If only you stayed in bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wipe your eyes; a teardrop falls to the ground and a flower springs from the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining composure, you rise up and fly back to your overturned carriage. Most of these goods are perishable and will spoil out here in the forest; furthermore, the tools are much too large and heavy for you to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying over to the cracked mirror, you inspect the damage Selina wrought to it. The glass isn't shattered, but it's badly cracked and you doubt you have the strength or wherewithal to fix it here in the middle of the forest. You try lifting the handle, but it's like lifting a tree trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're content to feebly drag and push the mirror up against a rock. Exhaling, you gaze closer at your new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice is your smooth, olive-green skin. The woman in the reflection matches your movements as she looks down her dress and gently cups the two mounds distending the top of the backless dress. You have breasts! They feel much softer than you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now have tattoos covering every inch of exposed skin on your arms, legs, and back. Most of them are inscriptions and symbols in a language you don't recognise, perhaps the pixie's mother tongue. You have several bracelets, rings, piercings, and studs all over, most of them adorned with precious stones that might fetch a lot at the local market, the merchant in you guesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark green dress clings tightly to your new form and bottoms out at the thighs. Below that, you're wearing a pair of black fishnet stockings and heels that look more sexy than useful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to get a better view of the insectoid wings which meld into your upper back. It helps that the dress is backless, or else those wings would likely get tangled up. It also helps how tight the dress fits, constricting your chest and supporting your modestly heavy boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you lean in and examine your new face. Selina's emerald eyes shine brightly back at you; pixies are well known for their devious personalities and it's shown in their eyes. As a courier, you were protected from interference by these tiny creatures by using potions, charms, and generally staying out of their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chin is slender and without any facial hair. You now have high cheekbones, a cute little button nose, and pouty lips that are a darker shade of green than the rest of your skin. You run a hand through your hair: thick, luscious waves of jade that smell like a fresh meadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no disputing how beautiful and enchanting Selina the Forest Pixie appears now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only wish you weren't her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The battle axe of the blood knight caught your attention ,the sharp blade of the axe was painted red with blood. You grabbed hold of the handle with your right hand and then easily lifted the massive axe , this was a task your old body would be struggling with. You immediately began swinging the axe through the air causing blood to splatter from the axe everywhere. In the corner of your eye you noticed the magical mirror. You dropped the axe with a huge thud on the ground and picked the mirror up. You carefully studied the mirror and then looked at your reflection.

She got quite a lot of gold that day. Some came from flirting, some were directly taken without the owner knowing, more from a mix of both. For a thief of her caliber, nothing is too difficult as long as it involves drunk men in any taverns or inns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadya travelled far from town to town, from inn to inn, from one drunk guy to another, preferably those with lots of gold. She only came back to the same inn after weeks to avoid detection, just in case things went bad. Well, nobody would suspect that a pretty, flirtatious young woman such as herself has the guts and skill to openly pickpocket people inside a crowded inn or tavern, anyway. Especially not drunk or horny (or a mix of both) males. Nadya was also quite skillfull with knifes, for self defense or lock-picking. Nadya never hurt anyone that did not provoke her, and she even ocassionally shared some coins to beggars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadya was ready to steal another drunk man's coins from his pocket, just like any other day, not knowing that it will be the last day that a female thief named Nadya trully exist. Just as she extended her hand, she felt something invisible entered her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadya felt extremely cold that she could not move at all. Her extended hand, though, fell on her side, lifeless. She could not feel her legs and arms, and it spread to her chest. She stopped breathing, but she could feel her heart beat slowly. And then she lost all feeling from neck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this happened in less then 5 seconds, but to Nadya it felt almost like an eternity. For once in a very long time that she could not remember it, Nadya felt fear. If she could scream and cry, she would, but her body no longer obeyed her mind. She was only able to stare helplessly, waiting for the next horrible thing that would happen to her. She was hoping that all of this was just a bad dream, or at least an effect of a temporary paralysis poison or spell. But Nadya was aware that this was real, and she personally knew how paralysis felt and this was far worse than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she felt a ripping sensation inside her head, as if someone forcefully yanked out the content of her brain; her memories, thoughts, feelings, knowledges; the pain was unbearable. Nadya lost consciousness shortly after that, never waking up again.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">You woke up with a jolt while breathing heavily. You found yourself sitting on a bench, just beside a heavily drunk man. You immediately felt foreign sensation all over your body. Looking down, you see yourself dressed in a black dress, with a generous low cut top to show your breasts. Huh, that's new. Last time you remember, you were a male, and a male doesn't have gorgeous breasts like these. But now you have a pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the memory of reading a killer spell book which turned you into a ghost came back, and you also remembered that you seemed to enter a female thief's body, sucked in against your will, inside the inn. You put two and two together and concluded that you had possessed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least now you had a body again, but a new problem arised. You didn't know who this thief was. Who knows, maybe she had a really high bounty that can make a single mistake resulting in you lost another body. And then a new set of memories struck your mind like a war hammer. Actually, that was an understatement. The sensation was so overwhelming that you screeched at the pain while clutching your head with both hands, and then fell down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation disapeared only after 10 seconds, but it had given you a life-time memories of Nadya, the real owner of the body you were inhabiting. No longer you felt  foreign sensations or feeling uncomfortable in her body. Everything felt natural, as if you had been using that body all your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time people started noticing you who were kneeling on the floor, you already got back up on your feet. Looking at your hands, you shuddered. You as Nadya still remembered what she felt during the possession, especially at the last part. You felt somekind of identity crisis.

What can I do for you, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss, but if I am not mistaken, you are here together with a boy about your age, aren't you?\" The inn keeper said before beginning to describe your appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew where this conversation was going and eager to hear the rest. Gladys, however, was rather confused. After she confirmed it, she asked why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well miss, a townsfolk just came into the tavern a few minutes ago, asking whether anyone know the boy I just described to you. He was found dead in the plaza and now his body is at the church. I recognized the description and want to tell you, miss... Sorry for being the bearer of bad news...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...

Well, more like looking at your breasts. You angrily clicked your tongue while muttering, \"damn coinless pervert.\" Nadya's way of thinking '<i>you may be perverted or do perverse things to me only if you have lots of coins for me to take</i>' came naturally to you without you realizing. You focused back to the problem at hand when Gladys slamed the door shut, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, unless you and that idiot also recruit the inn keeper into a sick joke of someone being dead, I guess I would have to believe your story,\" Gladys said, looking furious and annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you belived me now?\" you asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, I have to see 'your' dead body at the church. You'll have to go with me,\" she said, grabbing her robe on the couch and put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly. I also want to see my body. Especially that book,\" you said, quickly following her out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Gladys locked the door, you two started to walk downstairs to see your body at the church.

It appeared that Gladys still didn't trust you, so she refrained from talking to you. The silence was appreciated though, as you need to think and prepare on whats about to come. Shortly after, the church was in front of you two, and Gladys entered without any hesitation. You followed suit. A priest was just finished tending a sickly man on the far right of the hall when he saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our church, name is Luke. How can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still young, probably only a few years older than you and Gladys. He wore a simple blue priest robe, possibly custom made since you never saw that design in other churches before. He was quite handsome with his messy short brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we heard that someone was found dead and was brought here?\" Gladys was the one who answered his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke's expression turned from kindness to gloom, \"ah yes... So he is your friend? I am terribly sorry for what happened. I heard some healers tried to bring him back when he was suddenly fell at the plaza, but they were unable to do so, just like us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so it is really true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh yes, I know this must be difficult for you to accept... Your friend suddenly die like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke missed the meaning of Gladys' question, but she paid no attention to him. Instead, Gladys stared at you with horrified look, combined with confusion and pity. It was actually quite painful for you to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, my father is trying to figure out his cause of death right now. One of the sisters here, Cecilia, is also helping him. We should see them at once\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke walked towards the back of the church with both of you following. You glanced at Gladys. It appeared that she was still shaken and was rather unable to accept the truth. You put a hand on her shoulder which made her jolt. She looked at you, and you looked back. She put on a sad face, but you returned it with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry... I'll find a way to fix this,\" you said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys sighed, and returned your smile albeit still with sad expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we will... For sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke entered a room where your old body was supposed to be. When he opened the door, though, he was in for a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Gladys followed him quickly. There, you saw your body on top of a stone altar or bed or whatever the priests here call it, but that wasn't all. An old man in priest get up was lying on the ground, which you assumed was Luke's father as he was kneeling beside him. Luke tried to shook him awake to no avail. Checking his breathing and his heart beat, Luke found that none was existant. Soon he realized that his father was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No father... What happened to you...\" Luke was now groveling beside his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-luke...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice startled the three of you. You didn't realized that a girl was sitting on the floor, her back's on the wall, in one of the dark corners of the room. She stood up, and walked towards the three of you. She was about Luke's age, wearing a nun clothes. She was cute, if you may say so, but you were still prettier than her. Umm... You mean Lydia was prettier than her, yeah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecil, what happened? Why is my father like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia or Cecil, like how Luke just called her, was fidgeting from nervousness and was unable to answer quickly, which tested Luke's patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please answer my question! Cecilia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am not Cecilia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What? What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh boy</i>...\" you thought, \"<i>don't tell me..</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke... I am your father\"</div></span></div></div>",

They all usually able to stay calm in most bizzare situations. Nevertheless, you explained to them about your condition which seemed to calm them down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Yes, it all began when I pick up that book. I felt something that compelled me to read it... And the next thing I know, I was floating in the air, and accidentally hit Cecilia when she rushed to help my unconscious body,\" Cecilia, or rather, Luke's father, said after he listened to your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean this book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after he finished saying that, Luke already started to read the tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it down, Luke!\" you cried in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke immediately stopped reading, \"oh, right... I can see what you mean by 'compelled me to read it' father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you understand Luke, but what should we do now? I am not familiar with such magic book, but we need to find a way to reverse this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we have to contact our teacher,\" Gladys suddenly said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is out of town...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but he is our only hope right now. I'll go back to our room, see if I can use some dimension magic to contact him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Gladys went out of the room without saying another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait, what about us? We can't just wait here! My father is dead and now his soul is inside Cecil! What should we tell other priests and people?\" Luke protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mused for a while. Lydia's bright mind helped you a lot, it was now easier for you to think of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell them nothing, at least for now,\" you said to Luke, \"hide my and your father's body and pretend your father is going out of the town to take care of some businesses... I believe your father will have no difficulty pretending to be Cecil since he has absorbed her memories, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke's father, now Cecil, just nodded her head to your question. You nodded back, grabbed your satchel, stuffed the magic book inside, and went out of the church, following Gladys. Luke could only stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I still can't believe this is really happening\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil just eyed him for a while, before started speaking, \"you can say that again... By the way, Luke...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what I told you about not having a romantic relationship with anyone as part of your priesthood training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Ah, here it is...\" Gladys seemed to find whatever she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommu-orbs (common way to spell \"communication orb\") were orbs that could enable people to converse from far away places. Low level ones had fixed destination, so they came in sets. High level ones need knowledge of mage craft to use, but the destination orb could be changed freely by the user. Gladys now attempted to do basically the same thing without the orb as the catalyst. Instead, using her notes, she started drawing a pentagram inside a circle on the floor using a chalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your help... I won't be able to do it myself, this need a lot of mana, more than we apprentices usually had...\" she said in the midst of drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look at me now... I am not a mage apprentice anymore, I am a thief... I don't think Lydia, who never practice magic before, has a lot of mana reserve...\" you said helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no choice, if we want this trouble cleared fast, this has to work...\" Gladys finally done finishing the pentagram with specific runes for the spell, \"besides mana, the person's belonging will help a lot. Go get something from teacher's room\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is locked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For god sake, will you ever stop complaining?! You said you are a thief now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia seldom picking locks to rob people, but she practiced it a lot in case she got locked up. It took no time to open the door to their teacher's room. However, right before you entered, Lydia's instinct kicked in, and you felt danger ahead. You stopped and inspected the rim of the door and the floor inside. There was a \"trigger rune\" on the doorstep and a \"trap rune\" on the floor, possibly for a strong paralysis. Unless the trigger was deactivated, you wouldn't be able to enter without being paralyzed. Luckily, you have learned about this type of trap before so it was not very difficult for you to disable it. Stepping safely inside, you grabbed one of your teacher's robe and returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... Now, try to channel your mana to me, I'll do the rest and hope we succeed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys sat cross-legged inside the pentagram with your teacher's robe in the middle. You sat behind her, outside the circle, with both of your hand extended toward her back. You had only done this \"mana channeling\" several times, so it was still a little difficult for you to do correctly. Moreover, now you had the body of someone who never use magic before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys started chanting and you felt energy swirling inside the magic circle. You concentrated and gave your best to share your mana. A minute passed, Gladys had stopped chanting, but there was no sign of communication just yet. Meanwhile, you felt like you already ran out of mana to give. Talking with Gladys would be foolish now, so you kept quiet. Fortunately, seconds later, you felt a difference in the energy flow inside the circle. You knew it worked and felt relieved. Gladys kept quiet, but it seemed like she was communicating with your teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, you depleted your mana reserve and forced to stop, otherwise it would endanger your life. Without your support, the flow of energy seemed to be disrupted and not long after that, the magic broke. Gladys was panting, clearly out of mana like you were. You just hoped she managed to tell your teacher the important things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so, did you do it?\" You asked finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was cut in the middle, but I think I was clear that there is an emergency right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... Let's hope teacher returned soon...\"</div></span></div></div>",

It was a brand new experience to you. You never saw a naked woman before, let alone BE the naked woman. Touching yourself in various regions, you managed to elicit strange sensation from your body. It made you took a very long time for a bath, even by female standard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill inside the bathroom on the dressing side, drying yourself with a towel, you were startled by the sound of the door opening. Gladys was at the door, holding a set of clothes and a towel, seemed ready to take a bath too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You spent too much time in here...\" she scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled sheepishly. Gladys just glared at you, glanced on your chest, and glared even more. You realized it was the look of jealously, as Nadya's breasts were comparably a lot bigger than Gladys. You snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you are thinking, Gladys,\" you said while grinning, purposefully lifting your left breast and let it fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys turned red from anger and embarrassment, \"Oh shut up, you perverted idiot! Hurry up and get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly put on Nadya's clothes and walked outside. You heard her grumbling angrily, but you paid her no mind. You then went to Nadya's room which she reserved at the inn before, and took her belongings. Then, locking the door, you walked to your and Gladys' room, laid Nadya's stuffs there, and went downstairs. The tavern was in its rush hour, full with people. Friendly chatters, people ordering food and drinks, drunken debates, all mixed into one. Noisy as hell. Nadya's instinct told you it was a perfect time for another pickpocket shenanigans, but you wouldn't listen to her instinct tonight. Instead, you walked toward the bar stool, and called the barkeeper, which was also the innkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is my key. I got a new accomodation,\" you said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were happy that you finally got a room for yourself instead of sharing it with Gladys, she told you to return it and got back to this room with her. When you asked the reason, she said it was because you must not be left alone, as there might be someting that happen as you slept. You couldn't say no to that reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeeper silently grabbed the key while eyeing your breast non stop. You remembered that this man did similar thing earlier that day. You were pissed, but decided to toy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed very interested in these...\" you said while smiling coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, the inkeeper was stuttering, \"oh, I uhh... I am sorry for my behaviour, miss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thats okay, I know most people can't resist them...\" You said while walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to your room, you opened up your satchel, took the magic tome, and laid it out on the table. Again, you felt the compulsive need to read it, but you resisted. Reading it once and dead was foolish, but reading it twice and dead again would make you the winner for the annual fool's award, if such thing existed. Instead, you inspected various books &amp; scrolls from Gladys' collection, and lots of scribblings she made. Gladys was more of the research type magician, while you fancy battle spells more. It was also one of the reason you two were under the same teacher right now. You were supposed to learn from each other to cover up your respective bad points, but so far you couldn't keep up with Gladys' extensive research, as much as she couldn't keep up with you in combat training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up a book, supposedly telling you how to carve the best defensive runes based on the title. You tried to read several pages. Runes were one of the 'static' kind of magic. You put it someplace, and when it triggers something would happen, much like the trap in your teacher's room. Rune was not your thing as you thought it lacked 'action,' so you read it with disinterest. To Nadya's mind, it was even more gibberish. As smart as she was, Nadya had close to zero knowledge about magic, so it was understandable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trying to read another book, this time about grimoire, when Gladys came inside. She looked at you and the book you were currently holding, then sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no mentioning of that tome in that book. Trust me, I read it twice when you took a bath\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were touched by Gladys' effort to help you. You were glad you had her as a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...thank you very much, Gladys,\" you said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys raised an eyebrow, \"for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For trying your best to help me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...there is no need to, I would gladly help you. I am sure you would too, if I am in your place, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just smiled at her. Gladys proceeded to sit on the bed for a while. She seemed to be thinking about something. You let her be and picked up another book about advanced defensive magic shield. This one piqued your interest and you were lost in reading that you almost didn't hear Gladys calling your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, did you say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that Gladys' face was red. You grimaced for a series of yells and name calling, like what she usually did to you as you made her angry, but it wasn't the case. Instead, she quietly talked to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, seeing your dead body today made me thinking... What if one of us die for real? I know we being magician means we will always be close to death, but seeing your lifeless body like that really scared me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were startled at her sudden confession. You always thought that Gladys was a brave girl, but it turned out she also had this side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Honestly, I want to say that I will protect you, so that I will sound cool and all. But technically I am dead already, and so if I can't protect myself, I won't be able to protect you,\" you said with a bitter smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys shook her head, \"that's not true, you are more than capable to protect me. Your battling skill are so good you are almost on par with our teacher. What you lack is only experice and mana\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Even if its true, that was my former self. If I can't go back to that body, then I am stuck with Nadya's body. Though her pickpocketing, thievery and seduction skills are unmatched, she was no fighter, let alone a magician... You could easily beat me right now, I am sorry but I can't be much help anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize... Anyway, beside fear of dying, there is another thing that crossed my mind earlier\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That if one of us die, I will not have a chance to tell you my feelings... towards you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what are you saying?\" You stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, is it safe to assume that you like me more than a friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just nodded as if you were hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Gladys's cheeks were as red as tomato right now, \"I know this may sound weird, because now you are in a body of a girl but... I want to let you know that I also feel the same towards you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dumbfounded at the sudden confession. It was obvious to Gladys that you loved her, as your method of showing interest were not the subtlest in the kingdom, but you still had not know whether she felt the same to you. The old you would have been jumping up and down and screaming from excitement, but you managed to just smile at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say something!\" Gladys said, flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of obeying the order, you walked up towards her. She stood up in anticipation of what you would do to her, but she seemed surprised as you suddenly embraced her in a warm and tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much for telling me that, Gladys. You have no idea how happy I am right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys just stayed silent before she returned the hug and started to sob a little.</div></span></div></div>",

Soon you heard the door lock clicking and the knob turning. The door slowly opened, and you felt another presence in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys was still sleeping. If you were your old self, you would be sleeping yourself, but now that you were in Nadya's body, things were different. Even small sounds might alert you now, thanks to Nadya's skill and exerience. However, you realized that this intruder had some skill in stealthy infiltratration, as he or she only made small noises even by Nadya's standard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was dark as the oil lamps were not lit, but peeking through the darkness, you could see somebody's outline, creeping around. As it turned its back on you, rummaging through Gladys's book and scrolls, you silently pulled down your blanket, drew your knife and crept behind him. You then swiftly grabbed his / her mouth with your left hand and placed your knife on the throat with pressure just enough to break skin. The intruder was too surprised to react properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move if you still value your life,\" you whispered, \"Gladys,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh? What?\" Gladys groggily woke up, scrambling to find her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn on the lamps, we have a visitor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys used fire magic to turn on several oil lamps around the room quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" Gladys looked shocked as she saw a young boy, several years younger than her and you were, being held on blade point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one here thinks he can just come in and steal our things. Well, not on my watch,\" you said, rather proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he wants to talk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard what Gladys said and moved your left hand toward his forehead, allowing him to speak but still restrained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*pant* *pant* N-nadya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow. He knew you, or more precisely Nadya, and you as Nadya recognized his voice. You reluctantly released him and for the first time you could see him directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rivo?!\" You said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew him?\" Gladys inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, he is...\" you said, but he cut you short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am sorry Nadya, if I knew this is your room, I wouldn't come in here to steal,\" was what the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to always know your surroundings before you act. Breaking in is dangerous without knowing your target, you know that, right?\" You found yourself automatically scolding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but last time I checked this room is supposed to be occupied by two magician apprentice, not you... Why are you here?\" Rivo tried to defend himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true...\" you said to him, \"but a lot has happened and... they are my friends now. And no, I meant real friends, not friend-before-I-took-their-gold friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry,\" Rivo said, bowing to you, before doing the same to Gladys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Okay, fine... Come here and give me a hug...\" you said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRivo literally rammed himself to you after you said that, before hugging you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss you, big sis...\" Rivo said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned the hug and said, \"I miss you too\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"He's Nadya's brother. They were separated a few years earlier by an accident involving town guard. Nadya has been looking for him, but I guess she gave up recently...\" you explained to Gladys after Rivo retreated back to his room, which you just paid for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what about that conversation you had with him earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it seemed very natural... As if you are really his sister\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM his sister... At least a part of me is... I forgot to tell you but, technically Nadya is dead now, and I am taking over her life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that's not something that you should have forget,\" Gladys staring daggers at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I am sorry... But I have Nadya's memories and emotions now, it just came naturally to love Rivo as if he is really my brother. And I don't have the guts to tell him I am not really his sister\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what then? If this is reversible, what would happen to Nadya and him? And what if it isn't? What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer and just starred on the floor. Gladys saw your hesitation and stop pursuing on the answer. Instead she extinguished the lamps and prepared to go back to sleep. You decided to follow suit.</div></span></div></div>",

I didn't know where teacher was. And he didn't tell me directly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it might take days before he arrived...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope not... I was sure to tell him that we are in trouble, so he should take shortcuts, at least...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRivo came in with a tray-full of food. The three of you wasted no time to devour them. During the meal, Rivo asked you how were you doing since the two of you got separated. You had no trouble 'remembering' Nadya's life, so you told him all, until the part where YOU took over Nadya's life. You hadn't come up with a lie yet, so you avoided saying that, including on how you became friends with Gladys, saying it was a long story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished the meal, you took Rivo to town while Gladys stayed at the inn. It was Rivo's turn to talked about his experiences. You listened with feigned interest. It seems that during the time he was separated from Nadya, Rivo joined a thief guild (Nadya wasn't in a guild). There Rivo honed his thievery skill, aspiring to become as good as his sister. However, while Nadya prefers deception, seduction and pickpocket, Rivo broke into people's residence and directly mugging them before fleeing the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you ventured to the forest nearby and did some running. You played tag, a serious tag game to train them. Nadya and Rivo used to do this often. One person were given 10 seconds window to run away or hide from the other, and the one who gave a chase could do whatever necessary to catch his/her prey in 10 minutes. Rivo used to lose all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave chase to Rivo. Rivo tried to ran away from you, but he wasn't fast enough to increase the distance. Despite this, you could see that Rivo improved a lot in a couple of years. Five minutes of running, and nobody gained an advantage yet. However, now you saw that Rivo's stamina was going to outlast yours. Nadya only occasionally exercise ever since they were separated, but it seemed Rivo did it rigorously. Your saw that your chance of winning was getting smaller each minute, until Rivo started to climb a big tree. You thought you had your chance, but Rivo climbed like a trained monkey. In 10 seconds, he was already between the top branches of the 10 meters tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to control your breath, you looked up at Rivo, shouting, \"you sure you joined a thief guild instead of a band of circus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could sense that Rivo was grinning madly up there. You wouldn't let him win just yet, so you started to climb. All the while, Rivo was silently watching you between the leaves. Nearing him, you heard a rustle between the branches. You knew he was getting restless. You were on the branches now. Rivo was almost within your grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, Rivo leaped down. He bent his legs, preparing for the hard impact, then immediately rolled forward once he landed. You half expected him to jump down. Rivo looked up, smiled, and continued his run. You groaned in frustration, then prepared to leap down yourself. However, as you readied yourself to jump down, the branch you were on broke. You fell prematurely, shrieking loudly as you fell. You fell loudly as you brought a branch with you. Rivo heard your scream and then the loud thud, so he ran back to where you were. He saw you laid motionless, sprawled on the ground next to a huge branch and its leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister!\" Rivo screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned, he strode towards and quickly knelt beside you. You didn't respond, but as he wanted to shook your body, you caught his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you,\" you softly said while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Ugh, that's not fair! And not funny! I was seriously worried!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I am sorry... But I guess I am not really okay, I think I broke my ankle or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRivo's anger returned to worry once more. He quickly inspected your leg and sure enough, your right ankle was swollen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this looks bad! Let's hurry up to the church to get you treated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go back to the inn? Gladys can help me there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The church is closer, I think... Anyway, let's get you out of here,\" Rivo said while trying to help you to stand.</div></span></div></div>",

There should be some healers that you could ask for help. Though it was closer than the inn, the church was nowhere near you, so you would have to endure the pain in your leg. You tried your best to held back from complaining out loud and instead cursing inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on sis, we are almost there,\" Rivo encourage you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly half an hour later, both of you finally arrived at the church. Once inside, Rivo sat you down on a stone bench then quickly went to find someone to heal you. You closed your eyes, trying to suppress the pain. A minute later, you heard someone coming towards you. You opened your eyes and looked up, then surprised to see your teacher standing in front of you. Before you could say anything though, he knelt and started to mend your leg. A soothing feeling washed over your feet and you sighed in relief. Looking around, you saw that there were Rivo, Gladys, Luke and also Cecillia nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she going to be okay?\" Rivo softly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will be fine, this is just a scratch,\" you teacher plainly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour teacher glared at your remark, so you quickly shut your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rivo, we want to talk about something private, can you please leave us alone for now?\" Gladys said to 'your brother'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rivo, please do as Gladys says. Don't worry, I'll be okay,\" you added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRivo hesitated, but finally he nodded and walked outside. Your teacher stood up. It wasn't fully healed, but your foot was only half as hurt now, as expected of your teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank y-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped mid sentence as you saw your teacher's face. You had made your teacher angry, it seemed. Cold sweat started to form on your body, you never liked it when your teacher was angry. You looked at Gladys and she gave you a pitied look. She was helpless to help you, for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, your teacher was...</div></span></div></div>",

His tall figure was always felt intimidating. He often beat you up when you screwed up, with his slim but well-built body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't even stare back at his clean shaved face anymore and instead looked sideways. You braced yourself for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have found one of long lost artifacts which our school has been looking for since forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wait, what?\" you said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up again and saw that your teacher was grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tome is tricky to find since if you are looking for it, it would hide itself. Nobody know how the book would reveal itself to people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo... You are not mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I? If you mean about your current predicament, you bring it to yourself and you took the consequences. I shouldn't be angry to you, that'd be unfair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour teacher's word sank your confidence even more. Him saying that meant this was not a light matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all that, you mustered up courage to ask, \"...is this reversible?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Like I said, it is a long lost artifact. And there is no way I'm going to read it here, I'll get affected by its allure magic,\" your hopes already sank so low, but then your teacher continued even further, \"also, even if it is reversible, your body will already be dead for too long that it will be impossible for you to use it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" you muttered softly, before asking loudly out of frustration, \"then are you saying I should just accept my fate?! Taking over Nadya's life?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so... That also applies to you, Father,\" Ravta said the last part at 'Cecilia', who looked almost as bad as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teacher, what do you suggest we do now?\" Gladys suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like your return to the academy will be premature. We need to look deeper into that tome, and surely your partner,\" Ravta said, glancing at you, \" wouldn't be able to continue his magus training, so we should head back now. I'm sorry you have to be caught up in this ordeal, Gladys. I'll be sure to train you privately later for your final exam\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is fine. Thank you for your consideration, teacher\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, the final exam. Now that you had Nadya's body, you could say goodbye about being a magician. Sure, you could learn again, but that'd mean you had to learn from scratch. There was no way you could endure it all over again. When you were sulking, suddenly 'Cecilia' approached you and took your hand onto hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang in there.

You knew it essentially admitting that you killed his sister, but if Rivo wanted to hate you or take revenge, then so be it. Death from his revenge didn't sound so bad, at least you could repent your sins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRivo suddenly took out his knife, you expected as much, then tackled you down. Losing balance, now you were lying down on the floor, starring at Rivo who were on top of you, raising the knife on his right hand high above. His face clearly showed his anger. You said nothing, just starring back at his eyes. Expecting the knife to fall down soon, you closed your eyes. But the pain never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't kill you, not when you look like my sister\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a prick on your neck. Rivo stabbed a needle coated with paralysis poison. You opened your eyes, but soon coldness overtook your senses and you couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll use that book to pay you back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, Rivo stood up and walked out. You wanted to scream at him to stop, but you couldn't even groan out in protest. You started to panic. Killing you was okay, you were prepared, but Rivo using that book would produce even more trouble than it already caused. You tried to calm down and focus. The more you tried to fight paralysis, the more it bind you down. The poison spread throughout your body, and you tried to counter it by relaxing your muscles and nerves. Nadya had trained this, it would shorten the duration of paralysis by half. 5 minutes later, you could feel the effect slowly dissipated, and you carefully tried to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first checked your teacher's room, but it was empty. You wobbly went downstairs, and immediately searched for Gladys and your teacher. You found them on a corner, eating on a table, and tried to approached them. In your haste, your focus wavered, the poison kicked back, and you crashed to the floor. Luckily your fall was loud enough for them to notice you. Ar-Ravta quickly came to your side and examined you.

I'll go after him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, teacher\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAr-Ravta bolted out of the inn while Gladys crouched down beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was... Eavesdropping on us... Then I told him the truth,\" you managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?!\" Gladys said, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't want to lie to him anymore... I'm sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys just looked at you with a sad face. She helped you to sit up, then walked to the counter to get you some water. You silently prayed that your teacher could stop Rivo on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, you felt it. You didn't know how, but you felt it. Maybe because you were once in that condition, but it didn't matter. What mattered was you could feel Rivo's presence. He managed to use the book, and now he was here. You couldn't see him, but you knew he was here with you... And Gladys. You feared the outcome of this ordeal.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

She still stood in front of the bar stool, waiting for the keeper to pour water to a glass. You tried to get up, your body still felt stiff, but you forced yourself. You started walking towards Gladys, hoping that Rivo felt hesitant enough not to try anything, so that you had time to warn Gladys. But then, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys turned back, glass of water in hand, and was surprised seeing you standing up. A second after that, she froze. You knew what happened, Rivo had started to take over Gladys. At the same time, despair took over you. You desperately dragged yourself closer to her. The glass fell to the floor as Gladys' hand went limp, spilling its contents everywhere. You got in front Gladys, grabbed her shoulders and shook it lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladys, hang in there! Fight him!\" you said, although you knew it was an impossible deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" you saw Gladys' lips moved, spelling your 'old' name, but no sound was produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs gave out, and Gladys fell to her knees, dragging you with her. Her eyes was full of fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladys,\" you hesitate, didn't know what to say, \"I'm sorry... I love you, don't leave me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys' eyes softened, but then they were shut. Seconds later, it opened again, but it was not Gladys anymore, you realized. They blinked several times before starring straight at you, but they were not focus and showed the confusion that their owner experienced right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladys?\" you fearfully asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no answer and she looked down on herself instead. When she finally looked back at you and about to say something, she winced in pain and held her head with both hands. You knew what it was, you experienced it yourself. You lost hope for Gladys. Sadness and guilt overwhelmed you and, in turn, anger rose. Once the person in front of you stopped wincing in pain, with both of your hands still on the shoulder, you shook Rivo hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... Do you realize what you have done?!\" you yelled right on Rivo's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRivo looked shocked and confused even more than before. He must be experiencing the identity crisis from suddenly having two sets of memories. But you didn't care. He just essentially killed Gladys. You knew you deserved this, but Gladys didn't have anything to do with your mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Rivo started to cry. The guilt must have overcome him. Your anger subsided for two reasons. One was you realized that at this point, nothing can be done and you had to accept it. Second was, you never saw Gladys cried before. You knew it was Rivo, but it still soften your heart nevertheless. You released Rivo's shoulder and slumped on the floor, on the verge of tears yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the inn keeper was wondering what was the big deal of Gladys spilling the water to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you were the one who's gonna mop it up,\" he thought.</div></span></div></div>",

You were sitting on the chair in front of the barstool, while Rivo's still sobbing on the floor. You glanced at Ar-Ravta with lukewarm eyes, and he figured out what had happened. Not saying anything, Ar-Ravta slowly laid Rivo's body on the floor and briskly walked upstairs. He seemed angry, but that could just be your imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened for minutes, before the innkeeper asked you, \"are your friends okay? She's been crying nonstop and that boy hasn't waken up yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He is dead, he won't wake up,' you almost blurted out, but you didn't find the energy to do so. As for the crying Rivo, you couldn't care less, at least not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you sensed disturbance in the air caused by magic. It was quite strong that even you in Nadya, who wasn't proficient in magic could tell. The innkeeper froze mid glass-wiping and Rivo stopped sobbing as they felt it too. It vaguely coming from upstairs, no doubt Ar-Ravta was the cause. You could only wonder in fear what high level magic did he do. You didn't have to wait too long to find out as seconds later, three figures walked down the stairs. One was Ar-Ravta, but you didn't recognize the other two since they wore long black robe with hood that also covered their faces. But then you saw the symbol of the academy on their robes, so you knew they must be your teacher's acquaintances. Before you could even ask a question, your teacher commanded in monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up and stand near Rivo's body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew your teacher was in a bad mood, and knowing your previous experience, it was in your best interest to do as you told immediately. Rivo, still shocked at the sudden intrusion of two strangers, just stayed on the floor, staring blankly at Ar-Ravta. Seeing the unresponsive former boy, Ar-Ravta grabbed his hand and forcefully yanked him up, then shoved him towards you. You caught him and held him still, as you somewhat knew what was coming. The three of them encircled you and started chanting. As you guessed before, it was a teleportation spell. Perhaps getting scared, Rivo tried to get away, but you grabbed him good. He's not going anywhere except to where this teleportation spell would take all of you. A moment later, the spell completed and a blinding flash erupted from the magic circle below your feet. In an instant, you, Rivo, his dead body, Ar-Ravta and the other two people disappeared from the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened his eyes, the innkeeper saw that nobody was there, and he was left alone. He was dumbfounded for a few moments before finally realized something and shouted in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They run away without paying for their meals!!\"</div></span></div></div>",

The legendary castle that floated in the sky, vast and massive like an ocean. It blocked the entire sun from it was placed, it's ginormous shadow covering the small city below. Your teacher, having recovered from the trip easily, was walking with the two hooded people towards the entrance of the castle. You pushed Rivo along the road, leading him to trip on the floor and being slightly scratched. You're still furious of what happened in the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww...\" He whimpered with the voice of the one you loved as he hit the platinum floors <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know what you have done.\" You snarl, causing him to flinch. He tries to bite back a reply but in turn can't reply at all. You grab his arm and dragged him quickly towards your teacher. When you catch up, you find  Ravta and the two hooded men preparing a ritual in the entrance hall. The ritual consisted of many mana stones and diamonds that it would make an entire city rich again. You are curious on the fact and your body instinctively tried to reach for a diamond but you were slapped away  by your teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot take any of these materials. They are vital to bring back Gladys.\" Ravta says, sternly. <br>\r\n\"You can bring back Gladys?\" You gasp, now filled with hope. <br>\r\n\"Just watch.\" He replies, not in the mood to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men looked like they completed the preparations. Rivo was forcefully laid onto the middle of the ritual, laying nearby his original body. The diamonds formed a complete pentagram around the two bodies, surrounding them. The two men began to chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heorm tokaro no frea.\" The two chanted in unison. <br>\r\n\"Heorm tokaro no frea.\" The two repeated  in unison<br>\r\nAs they continuously repeated their chant, the diamonds that surrounded Rivo and body started glowing, their light shine brilliantly. Each chant made the light grow stronger and stronger. Finally, after the tenth chant, the light receded from the diamonds and were absorbed into Rivo and his body. Both bodies suddenly convulsed and sporadically moved fast. The bodies stopped moving after what seemed like an hour, but in reality was only 5 minutes. During that time, no one spoke. Suddenly, a darkness rose from the body of Rivo and Gladys. The darkness formed a huge monstrosity, for what seemed like a fusion between a dragon, human, and tiger. It opened its mouth, bellowing a earth shattering roar that rebounded throughout the walls of the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is just a piece of what resides in that artifact.\" One of the hooded men says.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt terrified, and couldn't even move.<br>\r\nThe two hooded wizards immediately started to cast a spell, perfectly in unison. The dragon didn't like their motion, sensing that was signaled an omen that would either get it killed or severely injured. It quickly rushed towards the hooded wizards but were suddenly rebounded by a blast of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast fella. You aren't going to go near them.\" Ravta said while grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon snarls, and suddenly it's ruby red eyes gleamed. It quickly made a plan that will make it the victor. It's body convulsed, and wings came out from its back. The wings rapidly flapped, producing a extremely strong wind that knocked back everyone, including the ritual materials. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wizards stopped chanting their original spell and quickly changed to a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haoro no Threa.\" Both of the wizards chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything that was blown were stopped in motion, floating in the air. Everyone were set gently to the ground. The dragon was surprised. It opened its mouth, and started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually think you can stand a chance against me? The Great Ouroboron?\" The dragon laughed scornfully, seemingly not caring that his initial plan was foiled. He started to rest on the castle floor, now bored of the wizards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave now and I think I can keep a couple of you alive.\" The dragon said, amusingly<br>\r\nOne of the hooded wizards started to quiver in anger from the dragon's response. <br>\r\n\"You're so overconfident that you think you can 'keep' us? We could destroy you in a instant right now.\" The wizard said. You didn't realize this before, but the voice was more female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon started laughing loudly now, it's chuckle resounding throughout the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing is, you've already lost.\" The dragon said, now having fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pieces will come back together now that I am free. The world will be devoured by the darkness that you have unleashed. I don't need to win this battle to win the war.\" It explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are nothing but a piece of a curse on a artifact. You're nothing!\" The woman wizard yelled, and started preparing a spell, alone. The other hooded wizard stopped the woman though, pointed towards the dragon. The dragon was visibly disappearing into dust right in front of your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll come back. This is just the beginning of a fun trip you guys will be going on.\" The dragon laughed as it disappeared into the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally regained your normal behavior, sighing to relieve yourself from the experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teacher, I think you need to explain what just happened.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ravta was busy looking at the body of the Gladys and Rivo. Both bodies were stirring.Rivo was the first one to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" He said, surprised how part of the castle was now broken. After speaking, he realized that he was back inside his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back, but is she back?\" He said, a bit happy and sad at the same time.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou and Ravta rushed towards Gladys as she begun to wake up.

She had long black hair which flowed down to her sides, and she wore a black robe which shrouded her body. She didn't seem to spot you yet, which would probably allow you to escape.

You figure your only hope of survival is to turn the tables by rolling over so Selina will be on top, and in turn get shot by the arrow. Only, you have no clue when the arrow is going to be fired as you can't see the skeletons from your position. You'll have to time this just right. You count two seconds and quickly roll over which causes Selina tighten her grip. You wait a moment hoping an arrow will come flying only none do. NO!!! You had totally messed up the timing. Mentally you start calling yourself an idiot before realizing that a minute has passed and nothing has happened yet. After questioning your sanity you look Selina directly in the eyes and figure you need to get out of here as you feel very uneasy. You roll over once more which causes Selina to laugh as you try to get pull away from her in vain. Okay, maybe if I just use the ground to push myself up... You think as you push off of the grass, only for Selina to pull you towards her with more strength than you thought she was even capable of. You're starting to become a bit annoyed with this situation and put your hands on Selina herself and start pushing in an attempt to get her off of you. Or at least that's what you tried to do, only instead you accidentally managed to grope her breasts causing her to moan softly. You immediately stop what you're doing and apologize even though it's not exactly the appropriate situation to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm sorry.\" You nervously blurt out. But Selina ignores you and just pulls you in closer once more as you both begin rolling until Selina is once again on top. She places her head down on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to touch them it's fine.\" She says, which causes your face to immediately redden, both out of confusion and nervousness, \"After all, I've already decided to give myself to you in mind, body, and soul as well, if I had one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go back to trying to kill me? This is making me uncomfortable.\" You tell her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill you?

She looks at you and lets the flame disperse. \"Very well.\" Selina stands up and looks at her four skeletons. Waving her hand she quickly mends the bones of the skeleton you had broken before, healing it back to normal. You stand up as well at this and pick up your sword. \"Yeah, well if you'll excuse me I must be on my way to stop a goblin.\" You start walking away from the group rapidly, not really wanting to think about what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don't quite remember any romantic moments between you and her.

The locals accused you of being evil and performing necromancy without any hard evidence. So I stepped in to protect you, but in the end it turns out you were practicing necromancy, and then you tried to kill me shortly thereafter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hehe, I wasn't trying to kill you, I just wanted to stay with you for eternity. In that moment when you stood up for me, I fell in love. Besides, I don't see why those villagers were so upset anyways. It's not like their dead relatives were even using their bodies anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" For a second you paused, not sure how to respond to that. The only thing you could muster after a few seconds was the word. \"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the bushes in front of you stirred. Thinking it was the goblin Selina let go of you allowing you to move forward. You cautiously approached the bush, only for a goblin to sprint away in the opposite direction. He caught you by surprise, but he seemed slow enough that you could catch him. With vigor you chased after him, only to trip on a wire which triggered a trap. A needle came flying towards you, but to your luck the trap was built somewhat shoddily causing the needle to miss it's mark just barely. Whatever the case though, you'd have to be more careful in case there were any more traps ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.You got back up and took it easy, jogging lightly after the goblin, all the while cautiously scanning and evading more traps the goblin has set up. Only your suddenly stopped by the goblin who now stands on a large rock with a gun in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move, or I'll shoot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze in place. The goblin has you right where he wants you, and now there's nothing you can do but pray Selina shoots him first with a magic bolt or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too! Stand still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to the side to see Selina and her group of skeletons who are now all frozen in place, lest the goblin shoot one of you. From what you can tell this goblin is very smart, not only can he speak human language, but he even set up a few traps in a short amount of time. You weren't sure you'd be able to trick him that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now say your prayers.\" The goblin aims at you with lightning speed, there's no way you can get out of the way in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG! The sound of a gunshot rings through the forest, only the bullet seems to have missed its mark entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears ring for a moment at the loud sound. Your temporary deafness fades however, and before you realize it the goblin seems to be screaming as a sword has been planted in his leg from behind. Blood seeps to the ground from his heavy wound, and somehow gets sucked back up into the sword, almost as if it's enchanting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..., I need more power.\" Says a deep voice of a middle aged man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin falls over and out from behind a figure climbs out from behind the rock, chopping off the goblins head, as blood flows into the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...thanks.\" You call out to the figure. \"You really saved our skins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure doesn't respond, and instead finishes draining up the blood of the goblin. An act that makes you feel very uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure now faces its attention towards you and begins charging at full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize you have two choices now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can try to fight this enemy. With Selina on your side it should make things much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr optionally you can try to run away, and hopefully those traps the goblin set up might actually come in handy.</span></div></div>",

You analyse them, they are about half your size, their armour is made up of mostly wood and cloth, leaving their limbs completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoblin\u2019s were never known for their intelligence, or tailoring skills, but these seem to be a lower breed of goblins.  You could take on three of them at once, and probably come out unscathed, but there are six, that you can see, that\u2019s enough to put even your life on the line in a fight with them.  Still, it looks as if you have no choice and draw your sword, with intent to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cursed bracelet seems to glow.<br>\r\n\u201cForgot I had that for a minute.\u201d You think, hoping that it doesn\u2019t drain your strength or stamina during the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait until the goblins come to a few yards away from you before stomping your foot and yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis stops the goblins momentum for a second, but only for a second, as they look at each other and realize they outnumber you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one leaps at you, and you slice its head clean off.  You turn around and stab the taller goblin in the gut, it falls over holding the wound in its stomach.  Two of the goblins flee.   You chop off the right leg and right arm of one in a single stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last goblin jumps on your chest, and uses his legs to kick you onto your back.   Using his fists, he wails on you, as you drop the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following is a brutal fist fight between the two of you as you roll on the ground.  It finally ends when the goblin tries to bite your face, but you hold up your arm, and it accidently chomps down on the bracelet, breaking his fangs in the process.  As it whips its head back in pain, you surprise it by knocking its skull with a rock, and putting it out of its misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stupid cursed bracelet is glowing green, and an aura of light engulfs your body.  You feel a tingling sensation, as you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, and the sun is in a different part of the sky.  You feel exposed.  As you sit up, something doesn\u2019t feel right.  The world is much larger than it was this morning, it smells different too.  You turn your head to look around, but find that that is different too.  As you stand up, you see a green arm and jump back in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall back doesn\u2019t hurt.  You feel tougher than before.  Getting up again, you look at the hand.  Your fingers seem thicker than before.  You defiantly control it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a breeze blows, you feel a draft between your legs, and look down to see that you are not wearing pants.  Your armor has been replaced by some pieces of wood, held together by string.  As you stretch your legs apart, you see that your reproductive equipment is about to retract into your body.  \u201cNo wonder goblins don\u2019t feel the need for pants,\u201d you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun feels hot, so hot that you understand why goblins spend most their time underground.   You look at a ditch, still flooded from the heavy rain these lands faced just three days prior.  You instinctively drop into the stale water, and open your eyes when entering.  To your amazement, you can see fine under water.  You don\u2019t seem to have trouble breathing either.  Miniature gills in your neck open and you feel content to stay here until darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see some bugs swim by, and open your mouth to allow it to enter.   As this happens, you realize that goblins have just as much in common with frogs as they do with humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspired by this fact, you stand up from the water, and decide to try another experiment.  The simple act of talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am human.\u201d you try and say.<br>\r\n\u201cAyumeeeeee\u201d you squeak.<br>\r\nYou look at your hands, and move your fingers.  Those work fine, but something is screwing up between your thoughts and your speech.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d  \u201cAm\u2026\u201d  \u201cHu\u2026Man\u201d you say very slowly, and realize that speaking this way is hurting your throat, no wonder Goblins don\u2019t trade with humans much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look down in the pool, the ripples clear, and you see the goblin looking back at you.</span></div></div>",

The cursed bracelet on your arm had grown with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You turn back to the villagers.</span></div></div>",

They just felt relieved that their tyrant ruler got vanquished, only to see their hero turn into the exact same monster afterwards. You moved slowly, careful not to break anything else. Everyone seemed to afraid to say anything, until someone who looked like former chief of the town before the dragon took over went forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough visibly scared, there was still a shred of dignity in his voice, as expected of someone who used to lead his town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I...</b>\" you felt surprised at your own booming voice, but continued, \"<b>I am the one who killed that dragon. This cursed bracelet must have turned me into him</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief listened to your explanation, then said, \"then I and this town thank you, hero, for we have been saved from his tyranny. But now I must ask you, what are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell silent, unsure what to do yourself, when the chief continued, \"as much as we feel grateful of your help, you cannot stay here, as your presence will bring back bad memories from that dragon. I will have to ask you to leave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadness overcame you, as you realized they had abandoned you. But given your current condition, you knew you couldn't live among humans any longer. You nodded, and said you would leave immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>But before that, I need to know where that Dragon's body is</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said this because you didn't see an identical but dead dragon like you lying around. The chief, as if he knew you would ask this, waved his hand above his head. Two men came forward, bringing a cartwheel with them. On the cartwheel, something was covered with a large rag. The chief grabbed the rag, and you were shocked to see your body, all complete with your armor. The head was severed, much like how you killed the dragon earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you were turning into a dragon, his corpse turned into you,\" the chief said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't bear to look at it any longer, and, without saying anything else, flew upwards, sending gust of winds towards the surrounding townsfolks. You didn't know how to fly, but it seemed your new body remembered it. You flew towards the mountain, away from civilization.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">It had been a week since you turned into a dragon. You'd been living in a cave, quite high in the mountain, where you sure no one should wander around. You knew your days living with human was over, so you opted to live in seclusion. You never came down to villages to eat their lifestocks. You'd been feeding on forest dwellers such as deers and wolves, swallowing them whole in one gulp. You at first was worried that the bracelet would turn you into your prey, but  fortunately that didn't happen. You still hadn't figured out the extent of its power, or how it was actually work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost gave up and accepted living alone as a dragon for the rest of your life, until they came. A pair of hunters, much like what you used to be, wandered inside your territory (you unconsciously set one). You knew they were coming for you, so you came straight to them. Suddenly dropping in front of them out of nowhere seemed like a good greeting, so you did just that. The earth shook as you landed, and the two hunters fell backwards from the shockwave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-master Birg! There it is! A d-d-dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne young woman was still on the ground, frantically pointing at you. The other, a middle aged man, however, was already on his feet, brandishing his spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't falter, Catlyn! On your feet! Prepare yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes master!\" On his master's order, Catlyn rose to her feet and prepared her spear as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>You... Why have you two come here?</b>\" you boomed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So the beast can talk? I...\" Birg said, but you cut him short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I AM NOT A BEAST! I USED TO BE HUMAN MUCH LIKE YOU!</b>\" you spew hot smoke as you roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh? So the townsfolk's story were true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>What?</b>\" you were surprised at his remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They called us, told us to exterminate a dragon up in the mountain. They promised lots of gold to us. They also telling crazy story about a man turning into a dragon, but I didn't believe that... Until now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt silent. You had never bothered the town that you saved ever since you became a dragon. And yet they called hunters to slay you. You felt betrayed. Your one week living in seclusion felt useless. Why living here if in the end they still wanted to kill you? Your anger rose quickly, probably from dragon hormone or whatever, and you decided to take revenge. But before you could have your revenge, there were two obstacles in front of you.</div></span></div></div>",

And 2 people unfortunately were right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I'll make all of you pay!</b>\" you roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, you propelled backwards, using the strength of your legs and your wings, while spewing a stream of blazing hot fire right at Birg and Catlyn. The latter panic and dove to her left, kissing dirt in the process. Birg was more prepared. He jumped to his right, then gave chase. As you didn't jump back very far, he soon approached you. You attempted to gnaw at him, but he evade it swiftly, then thrust his spear right on your neck. You braced yourself for pain, but it never came. The thick scales on your neck deflected Birg's spear completely. He was surprised, but regained his composure, then quickly kept distance before you could strike back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you realized that thick, hard scales covered your whole body except your wings, nose and eyes. It was by pure luck and the dragon's arrogance when he attempted to eat you alive last week that you could kill him from inside, where his scales could not protect him. Surely, you wouldn't give Birg the same opportunity like what you had. You reminded yourself not to try to eat him, at least not alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirg also realized it was near impossible to kill you by himself (even with Catlyn's help) no matter how skilled he was. But he knew you wouldn't just let him and Catlyn go unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catlyn!\" he shouted, \"plan C\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Catlyn looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what plan C was, but you damn swear they would not succeed. You breath out more fire at Birg. He attempted another parry &amp; attack, this time aimed at your wing. But you were more prepared this time and you used one of your front legs to knock him off. Birg lost his spear as he flew from your hit. Before he could stand up and recover it, you jumped right on top of him, crushing his body with your right front leg. Birg screamed in agony, you must have broke some of his bones. Feeling satisfied for now, you looked around for your second prey, but Catlyn was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>An ambush?</b>\" you thought out loud, \"<b>no, she ran away. So I guess plan C was for you to sacrifice yourself so she can get away? How noble of you, </b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*cough* Please, don't hurt her... If you still have some humanity left,\" Birg was pleading at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I had them, before you came here. Now, Catlyn, wasn't it? I believe she would want to meet with her master one last time,</b>\" you said before taking off,  bringing Birg along with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, you spotted Catlyn while you were very high in the sky. You heard Birg's plea once more, but you didn't care about it and did what you wanted. You let Birg go, made him free-falling hundreds of meters, then fell hard about 10 meters in front of running Catlyn. She was very surprised from your 'gift' that she stumbled and fell as she tried to stop. Looking up from the ground, she finally realized it was her master who was falling in front of her, now dead as he obviously didn't survive the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Master...\" she was too shocked to properly react and still laid on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you landed not far behind her seconds later, Catlyn finally rolled over to see you, using her arm and elbow to propped herself up. She still laid on the ground, as if she didn't have the will to fight or run. You slowly inched closer towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monster...\" you heard her softly whispered at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I guess I am one now,</b>\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lifted your tail and, using its sharp end, stabbed Catlyn on her chest.</div></span></div></div>",

You readied yourself to fly, to unleash your wrath upon the traitorous town, when the bracelet on your arm started to shine again. You felt the burning sensation from before. You roared in pain, unintentionally breathed fire. Different than before, though, you felt yourself shrinking. Your claws retracted, scales disappearing, and your wings &amp; tail shrinking as you transformed back into humanoid form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you tried your best to stay conscious. You needed to know what really happened to you. You kept shrinking and shrinking until you were a human again. You had hoped that maybe you're turning back into your old self, but then you knew it was not the case. The body proportion was off, and last time you remember, your hair didn't reach your back. Clothes materialized out of nowhere, draping your new body snugly. The pain started to subsided, and you found yourself on all four, panting hard and sweating. After a while, you inspected your body. Hand, face, breast, stomach, breast again, groin, legs. You were not sure during the transformation, but now you knew for sure you had Catlyn's body. You couldn't believe you became a woman, but at least you were human again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw Catlyn's corpse, now turned into a dragon. It had a large wound on its chest. You then tried to stand up, feeling wobbly since you had been on four legs for the past week. You picked up Catlyn's spear and tried swinging it around. You never used a spear before, but just like when you knew how to fly as a dragon, it seemed Catlyn's body remember on how to use a spear. You tried to access her memories, but found you were unable to do so, just like with the dragon. This tells you a lot about the bracelet's power. But you didn't understand one thing. You thought the bracelet would swap you with whatever you kill, that's why you were worried you would turn into a deer or wolf when you ate them as a dragon. If that's the case, why didn't you turn into Birg and turned into Catlyn instead? You killed Birg first and nothing happened, but you turned into Catlyn after you killed her. You looked at the bloody mess that used to be Birg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it has something to do with the way I kill him...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou killed Birg indirectly by letting him plummeted to his death, while you killed Catlyn by stabbing her with your tail. So indirect killing would not activate the bracelet, only direct killing would. This explanation made sense, though it didn't explain the deer and wolf thing from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your anger had subsided considerably. One was because the transformation provided a lot of distraction. Two, maybe because the dragon hormones no longer affected you. You took another note on the possibility of mental changes based on the body you inhabit. Also, you just realized that you had take over Catlyn's life. And if you returned to the town, you should get a reward for slaying the dragon. Or you could stick to your old plan to have your revenge.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">You checked your... Well, Catlyn's belongings. Catlyn carried a small bag around. Inside there were several dried food, a water container, a roll of gauges and several small bottles with clear liquid inside. You doubted that those were water, so you opened one of the bottles and took a whiff. It was odorless, so you dipped the tip of your little finger into the liquid and licked it. It was somewhat bitter, and you immediately spat it out. From your experience, you knew that it was probably poison as some hunters relied on it. You closed back the bottle and put it back into your bag. Thinking for a moment, you took out the gauges and rolled it around your still snuggly fit cursed bracelet. It was a little too big of a cover, but it would still fool people if you said that you got wound there. Now that the bracelet wasn't visible anymore, you started your long walk back to the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, you finally arrived. Not much had changed since your last visit, but you could see that some buildings were being repaired. A townsfolk who saw you immediately ran towards you after telling someone else to give words to the elder. He leads you towards a house, must be where the elder lived. The front door was open, and you entered following the man. Inside, the elder was waiting for you with several other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are rather fast. Have you been able to slay the dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only answered the elder's question with a nod. The people around cheered, but the elder remained calm and made another inquiry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is your companion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe townsfolks went silent as they heard the question. With monotone voice and the saddest face and you could fake, you answered shortly, \"he died.\" Afterwards, you tried faking tears too, which was surprisingly easy. You wondered whether this was also from your current body's hormones or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder gestured the others to go out, and they obliged. After they had went out and closed the door, the elder started to talk to the still sobbing girl in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very sorry for your loss, miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped talking, as if waiting for your response. But you kept weeping to yourself. He stop waiting and rummaged through one of the shelf instead. Hidden behind it was a small leather pouch which gave clunking sound as he put it on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, 100 gold coins we promised. And as our token of sympathy, I'll personally add 25 gold coins for your loss. Would you accept it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n100 gold coins was enough for more than a year of comfortable life. Not extravagant, but comfortable for sure. If only you didn't have that cursed bracelets with you, you would be having a nice life right now, as the original slayer of the dragon (even though that was almost by pure luck). So now, even if as Catlyn, you had every right to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...thank you,\" you softly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. We also planned to have a party for you, actually, but that seems rather inappropriate now, isn't?\" You only nodded weakly at that, \"I thought as much... Looks like your arm is injured, I'll tell a healer to treat you soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou definitely didn't want that fake wound to be treated, \"no, it is alright... Elder, can I tell you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we went to the mountain, you told us that this dragon used to be human, right? We actually didn't believe you,\" you repeated what Birg told you, \"but when we met this dragon, he confirmed your story\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he did...\" the elder mused at your story, \"what else did he tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was angry that even though he never disturb your town after he turned into a dragon, you still sent us to hunt him. Is this true? That he never actually harmed your town?\" You knew the answer, but you asked anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes, he was telling the truth,\" the elder said after a long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why?\" you felt your anger rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were afraid... Knowing an identical dragon that were terrorizing our town was still around nearby. We know it was actually our saviour, but the townsfolks keep having this nightmares about the dragon. It made us restless, not knowing when another dragon would attack us once more. So after a town meeting, we decided that this was for the best\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best for you, not for the former saviour,\" your anger kept building as you listened to his reasoning <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best for my people, yes...\" there was no hesitation in his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost couldn't take it anymore. You could kill him right then and there. You had the body of a young hunter, clumsy at times but a hunter nonetheless, while he was just an aging, wrinkled old man. Even if he knew how to defend himself, you were positive that Catlyn could easily overpower him. And everyone else was waiting outside, as long as you acted fast, nobody will be able to help him. </div></span></div></div>",

After the pouch was in your bag, you walked around the table to get close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elder...

Suddenly, you lunged with your free hand and started to choke him. Surprised, he opened his mouth wide, where you easily shoved the poison on your other hand into it. The bottle was drained in a second, and you forced him to swallow it all. His horrified eyes met your furious ones. A moment after, he started to spasm. You held him still until he stopped moving completely before slowly lowered him down to the floor. After closing his mouth and empty eyes, you put the empty bottle back into the bag and then walked outside. Once you opened the door, you shouted to several people waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!

But honestly, you were at lost on what to do. You had a new identity without a memory, and to make it worse, it is a female one.

Another one was to cut your hand off together with the bracelet, but you couldn't bring yourself to do it. The third one was to find someone who was knowledgeable about these type of thing and asked him or her to remove it. But you didn't know anyone like that, so you would need help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypically, hunters such as you and Catlyn registered themselves to a local hunter guild.

Besides, who knows what else you had to kill to get there. It'd be a shame to become something else again after finally returned into a human, albeit a different gender. You decided to go to Catlyn's guild for help instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed the small road from the previous village. Remembering your days as the dragon, when you could fly high and see from the above, you tried to decide the direction of the nearest town. You never saw another town beside the one that tried to kill you, but you saw a highway. It must've lead to somewhere, so you decided to head that way. You walked for nearly an hour before you found it. Although called a highway, it was nothing fancy, just a dirt road wide enough for two carriages to pass by unhindered. You picked a direction and started walking. You were lucky, several minutes after, two horses was strutting along the road, pulling a cart filled with straws. A kind old man was holding the reins, and he offered a ride, which you gratefully took. Even luckier, the road you and the old man took headed towards the biggest town in the area, which was also the headquarter of Catlyn's guild. You sat peacefully, occasionally chatting with the old man, enjoying the company of another human after a long time of solitary as a dragon. Although most of the time it was only the old man who spoke to himself, you didn't mind and enjoyed his talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours fly by, and you arrived at the town. Saying your thanks and good byes to the old man, you asked a random person about the location of the hunter's guild, praying hard that he didn't recognize Catlyn. He didn't, and he pointed the direction of the guild. You strode along quickly towards it. Arriving in front of the building, it wasn't much to look at. At least not much bigger than your previous guild. Calming yourself down, you walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Catlyn! You're back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman behind a counter, seemingly a receptionist of this guild, immediately spoke toward you as you entered. Several heads of the people standing or sitting around the guild's hall turned to look at you, but they quickly lost interest and went back to their own business. You slowly approached the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, yeah...\" you quietly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, I was so worried when Birg insisted that he wanted to take this job with just the two of you. But I guess you two can handle it, eh?\" she said cheerfully, \"by the way, where is Birg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it was coming, so you just answered flatly, \"...he didn't make it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said it softly, but it was as if you shouted it out, as now every head in the room turned towards you, and they stayed that way. The woman looked especially shocked as she covered her wide open mouth with her hands. Awkward total silence filled the room for several seconds, all the while you made uneasy expression. You knew you should act sad, but you're not much of an actor so you decided against it lest it backfired. Beside, it was difficult to feel sad about the death of a stranger who wanted to kill you. You decided to break the ice before you lost the opportunity to demand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I speak to the guild master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, yes... Yes, of course. Please wait for a second,\" the woman quickly walked towards the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon various whispers were heard across the room, undoubtedly they were all about you and Birg. Several people started walking towards you. Without turning back, you fend them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, leave me alone for now,\" you said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was enough, all of them backed off. The whispers didn't die out, though. A couple of minutes later, the woman returned. She then urged you to meet the guild master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack is waiting for you, Cat...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked away without saying anything else, leaving the hall behind. Moments later, you knocked on the door to Zack's, the guild master's, room. You opened without waiting for a reply. A rigid faced man with goatee sat alone inside the well furbished room. Both you and him said nothing, but he gestured you to sit down on a chair in front of his desk. You obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about what happened to Birg from Diane. Is it true?\" he finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... You seemed awfully calm about this, Catlyn... Run out of tears to shed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing and looked down, hiding your face with your long bangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sorry for that. Mind telling me in details of what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you tell him the absolute truth, saying who you really were? Or lie, keep pretending as Catlyn?<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

You're handed a large bounty for the many jobs you'd done for the village, incliding the Goblin hunting, and your equipment; within a few hours of waking you're gone and marching onwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days of nothingless pass by as you walk. You pass small huts, passing travellers and even a war-band or two but nothing eventful happens and soon you're in the mountains. According to the villagers, going right through them was by far the fastest way to the city, albiet more dangerous yet that was no problem for veteran fighters and experianced warriors like you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moutains were cold, wind biting into you as you march down the path. Luckily for you, the local Ranger's Guild had spent years building a route through the moutains for travellers. It had been cut into the cliff-face with strong wood and stone bridges jumping over the gaps between the moutains, long ravines cascading down below. The area around you was gorgeous, lush forests and meadows all around you for as far as you can see. Yet these marvels had become the normal for hours of walking at this point and it was getting weary. You'd do anything for something to break up your day at least a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slow down, being sure to stay quieter as you turn a corner, peeking around. You see a carrage, surrounded by bodies and splattered with blood. By the looks of it, it had been ambushed but by who? Your question is answered when you see three orcs talking to each other. Two of them are males, one had a scar on its face and the other a large black mohawk. Both are clad in a mixture of plate, fur and leather armour, mismatched and pieced together. The woman, however, was differant. She was dressed in a darkened metal bikini that was accented by sliver fur and a silver metal lining. She had a large black bow on her back, a quiver of arrows with it and a silver and black blade on her hip. By the looks of it, it was a very well-made item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nslowly, you retreat back into cover and consider your three options; you could either try to sneak past them, lure them out and kill them one at a time or you could attack and use the element of surprise to your advantage. </span></div></div>",

If you can do this then you have gained my trust and can accompany me on adventures.\" said Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Roy talked for a bit more, with you bringing up some of what Bridgette had told you, and Roy mentioning what he might find most useful.  Eventually it came down to two things, you wanted to become a wizard, and Roy sought the idea of an archer.  \"While I am happy to say that an archer would prove most beneficial, as well as to see you try and follow what Bridgette wanted, in the end I believe it is truly up to you.\" You nodded. \"Do you wish to uphold what Bridgette had dreamed for herself as an archer, or become a wizard?\" Roy asked.  Determined to find a way to talk to Bridgette again, you proudly state your decision to become a wizard. \"Alright get your things, there is an old house near where I'm set up where I met just the man who can help.\" Roy told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-uhh\" You started to say, before Roy turned and noticed as you had not immediately followed. \"Hmm. Um, right then.  Well just follow me then and we'll sort out Bridgette's things later.\" Roy said motioning towards the door as you both exit.  You followed Roy for quite a bit until he stopped and pointed towards a nearby inn, \"Here is where I have held up.  I was originally just planning on passing through, but then I heard the tale of a young maiden in need of aid and decided to help out.\" Roy turned and pointed towards a house on a hill. \"And that's where we're going. Just a bit further now\" he said.  Roy led you to the house and up to the door, knocking on it before waiting a bit. \"You are back? And-?\" The man in the doorway began, before gasping, clearly taken aback from the sight of you. \"Is this the maiden from town that was cursed? Why, come in, come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Roy step into the house. Roy explains how he was able to defeat the warlock while presumably saving the maiden.  You finish by explaining to the man about Bridgette and how you wish to become a wizard to hopefully speak with Bridgette again.  \"Yes well, I suppose I do have <i>SOME</i> things I can teach Matt, if I were to take on an apprentice.  The wizard told Roy, before turning towards you.\"It wouldn't be much, but It'd get you on the way to where you could at least aid your friend <b>IF</b> something unexpected happened during his adventures.\" He explained to you.  \"Would you like to begin now or perhaps in the morning?\" he asked. \"I'd suggest waiting until morning, from what you have told me it sounded like you have been through a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although you're only a metaphysical soul trapped within a glass sphere, you can sense everything around you. The person who slayed the warlock and rescued you appears to be a knight. The sun glistens off his armour as he dismounts from his horse, carrying you in his chain-mail gloves, his steel boots crunching the grass and dirt in the hot summer day. He removes his helmet and wipes his brow, revealing the face of a man around the same age as you, flowing brown hair and chiseled jawline checking off all the boxes of 'traditional Arthurian hero' character. You know one or two of these chaps in your village and tried to avoid them... meathead jocks they seemed. Always winning their pick of the choicest young women around, completing inane quests and generally serving a do-gooder role in the communities wherever they drift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, had been a humble shopkeeper and tavern manager in your local village. Well respected, with a young wife and baby boy to take care of. Anger and fear rushes into your mind: What's going to happen to them? Your own life, reduced to this incorporeal form by that evil warlock, was of little importance compared to your family's well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of trumpets interrupts your thoughts. Fanfare, the hearkening of a hero returning triumphant: rose petals strewn in the knight's wake, townsfolk gathered at the entrance of a castle's magnificent keep. The stately drawbridge lowering itself allowing the knight to march inside the courtyard. Servants of the regional feudal Lord stand by, waiting to receive him. Robed in a silken white, with sashes bearing the Lord's name, the freshly kept servants guide the knight up to a tower on the north side of the castle. He holds you tightly while ascending the staircase, mentioning something about \"the young maiden's final return to her true form,\" giving you serious concern about what he intends to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staircase gives way to an elegant bedroom stocked with the latest in Elizabethan fashion. It is a bedroom obviously designed for a young woman, and in the large plush bed reposes the young woman herself. An older man, her father perhaps, stands above her with a face worn with grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Morpheus, I hath slain the Evil Warlock of Windhampton!\" Announces the knight. Beyond the open window in the bedroom, some Huzzahs! from the townsfolk can be heard. The knight continues, \"To complete my quest, I present to thee the bounty you seek. The soul of thine daughter, sweet Bridgette, encased in this magick sphere! Behold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifts you upward, the glass giving off its own sheen of light. Another set of Huzzahs! from the crowd outside the castle below. You want to scream, to inform the knight of the mistaken identity. You're not Bridgette. You witnessed her die, saw her soul literally be consumed by the now-deceased warlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lord, who had been clasping his daughter's hand tightly in his own, arose. Clearing his throat, he bowed humbly before the knight. \"Sir Alexander, words cannot express my gratitude at thine heroism. Not only dispatching that wicked menace, a terror of this region, to the depths of Hell where he belongs, but also delivering the soul of my precious daughter. The most treasured thing I know of in all the land, and the last living reminder of my dearly departed wife. O brave knight, I am a rich man but I am frustrated in thinking of an adequate reward for these acts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight, who apparently goes by Sir Alexander, replies, \"Lord Morpheus, I pray for thy wisdom as well as thine ears for a moment. Consider this: Instead of forfeiting thy well-deserved riches, wilt thee provide me thine blessing... for your daughter's hand in marriage? She is as pure as she is beautiful... an excellent prize for any man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze over at the young woman lying motionless in bed. Bridgette's body appears cold and still, like no soul has occupied it for a long time. Her lips, while gray, are full and luscious. Her golden blonde hair lacks the lustre of vitality but looks as if it could illuminate the whole room. Her bosom, while pert and sizeable, doesn't rise or fall as it should from the breathing of the young woman. There is no question she's the most gorgeous woman you've ever laid eyes upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Alexander, if you can restore my daughter to life, then she is yours for all time.\" Promises the Lord, backing away to let the knight get close to the young woman's inanimate form. How is he going to do it, exactly? Take your soul and put it inside her body??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou overhear the knight chanting something in an arcane language, not dissimilar to the chanting the warlock made when he trapped you inside this glass ball. A few moments later, everything goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, now staring up at the knight from a resting position in bed. The glass ball formerly housing your soul is dull. The knight sets it beside the bed and leans towards you, whispering, \"Welcome back, my love. I hath restored you to your original form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can protest and explain the serious error he committed, he kisses you on the lips! You can feel his breath on your cheek. In your old body, you could easily send him packing. But Bridgette's body is small and weak. Who knows how long her female form remained lifeless in bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls away, leaving you gasping for breath. No, wait... as you sit up, you realise you're short of breath for another reason. She... <b>you're</b> dressed in a corset and a sleeveless tartan dress. The corset pinches and constricts your slender torso while pushing up your C-cup breasts into a nice valley of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Sir Alexander! Allow Bridgette the time to recover from her slumber. She must be terribly confused and flustered at the moment.\" Declared the Lord, Bridgette's father. \"I shall send in some servants to attend to her needs. In the mean time, why don't we discuss matters of running my estate? Brandy and mead await us in my library, allow me to grant thee a tour of mine castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight clearly has other things on his mind, staring at you lecherously like a piece of meat. However, his better sense wins out and he humours his soon-to-be father in law by following him down the staircase. The townsfolk begin to clear out beneath them, with several ladies lingering to swoon after the stocky brave knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather your composure, coming to terms with the female body and life you now occupy. Wishing that you could have interrupted the two men, but alas, neither of them seem to have your interests in mind. The whole time talking like you weren't even there, which was a lot different than when you were a man and commanded others' attention. Then again, perhaps this is for the best. If you told them your true identity, how would they react? Treat you as insane, send you off to an asylum? Burn you at the stake, as is common for mages engaged in deceit or trickery?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, better to keep that truth untold. You're going to have to live Bridgette's life for now... at least until you can find a way out of this body! If a stupid no-name warlock could do it, then certainly someone else could too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo female handmaidens enter the room, beckoning you up and escorting you to the bathroom to get bathed and changed into yet another girly dress. You can't help but feel the bouncing of your new breasts, wiggling of your new womanly ass, and blonde hair occasionally getting in your new eyes. You try to play along with them and feign interest in their conversation, which seems limited to how handsome Sir Alexander is and how they wish they could meet someone half as hunky as him. Not even bothering to give you privacy with your new naked form, as they towel your hair dry and apply a range of cosmetics to your face, dolling you up nice and pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not Bridgette! And you're certainly not a young woman resigned to her fate of playing the good wife to some punk-ass knight. You're a man on the inside, dammit! And you've got to get back to your real family somehow and tell them what happened. They probably don't even know your body is dead yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny way you slice it, you've got to get back to your family. So what do you decide to do??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Option 1:</b></u> Dive head first into the role of dutiful wife of Sir Alexander. Pretend like you're the same girly girl Bridgette used to be. Then, once their guard is down, make a break for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Option 2:</b></u> Change the way Bridgette is perceived into more of a tomboy. Persuade them you can handle more tasks independently and they may give you more leeway... like traveling back to your own village on occasion to visit your true family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This practice is an old one and most warlocks have forgotten it. One however, discovered a tome that taught him the old ways. \"Shit\", you exclaim as you realize you've walked into a trap! You turn to run, but it was foolish to believe it would be so easy. Your feet seem frozen in place. \"Fool, your strength will do you no good against my magic\", you hear a high pitched voice say. You turn your head to see a rather small man not much older than you. He doesn't have the most pleasant of features. He notices you sizing him up and becomes infuriated. \"I may not seem like much to you, but I assure you my magic is mighty\", he states. For some reason you can't help but let out a chuckle. This only serves to infuriate him more. \"You will soon feel my wrath and you will know it was your arrogance that brought you down. So sure of your strength and your muscles. Running to the aid of a young maiden whom I'm sure you thought you would have your way with after rescuing her. She would have probably even let you with your dashing good looks\", he says. You interrupting him with, \"Are you threatening me, or coming onto me. You will be disappointed. My taste are for only young maidens and even though your form is similar I fear I have standards.\" It is the last thing you're able to say. He raises his wand and recites a spell. Suddenly you feel your soul ripped from your body. The sensation in disorienting and terrifying.

It's to be expected considering the circumstances\", you retort. The mirror is quiet for a minute and then exclaims, \"You're a man aren't you. It makes sense, Men always go for the boobs.\" Your ace goes red and you turn away from the mirror. You start walking away when the mirror asks, \"What happened to Rachael?\" You pause and without turning around answer, \"She was killed in battle with the dark wizard. By some twisted manner I was stuck into her body. I was the dark wizards first victim from what I was told. I understand nothing else of it. My knowledge of magic is lacking.\" The mirror responds more somber this time, \"She was worried going into battle yesterday.\" The mirror starts to cry. You sigh and turn back around. You may not be a man anymore, but the tears of a woman still affect you. \"There, there mirror\", you say. You then feel really stupid for trying to comfort a mirror. It however, perks up right away. \"I can be your companion now\", you shouts with glee! You've heard before that the emotional depth of magical mirrors could be shallow, but wow. \"That's ok, mirror. I don't need a friend at the moment\", you reply. \"Sure you do. I can help you with your shroud and can teach you about other magic to. I was always helping Rachael with new spells. I can even help you with being a woman. It must be shocking having been a man before and now being in the far superior body of a woman\", the mirror states.</span></div></div>",

However the one thing I'm sure of is that this body is not superior to my original male body\", you state rather sure of yourself. The mirror starts laughing and retorts with, \"You think men are superior to women?\" \"Of course, men are bigger, stronger, smarter, and not plagued with all the physical and emotional issues of women\", you answer. Your reflection in the mirror smiles and says, \"When there is a war who goes into to battle and gets killed, men. When there is work to do in the field who does it, men. When something heavy needs to be lifted who does it men. I could go on, but I'll finish with this. Behind all those thing you'll find a common thread, woman. Men fight wars over women, work the fields to provide for women, and do all manner of dangerous things, for women. Most die young allowing women to go find another. Women are smarter, more attractive, and sex is even better for women.\" You think about all this. You remember you're own father and all the things he did for your mother at a snap of her fingers. You remember all the things you did, some dangerous to include the event that brought you to where you are now was because of a woman. An illusion of one, but you didn't know that at the time. Your face goes red and you stammer, \"Well, sex is much better as a man.\" The mirror laughs and retorts with, \"As a man, what were you good for maybe two orgasms before you passed out. I've known Rachael to have six and could have had more if her lover hadn't been worn out.\" You stand with your jaw open there feeling very infuriated. This mirror has just destroyed a lifetime of beliefs you held very effectively and without leaving room for argument. You can't think of a response to any of it. \"Don't be mad.

The guild took you in when you was but a boy, living in the street, pickpocketing people for living. Now the guild was not particularly noble, the members were sellswords, mercenaries if you may say, that would do most job with proper payment. But that could be considered as honest work in this dangerous and cruel world, and they despised thieves despite being called a rogue guild. Long story short, the reason was that they had a bitter past with a certain thief guild. They took you in, taught you well, and now you were ready to become one of them. But you had to make a name for yourself and gained a lot of experience before you could take the guild's mostly-dangerous official missions. So they sent you out alone, to return when you had enough experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then went to the nearest town to find some work to do. That was when you met her. Crystal Wintermonth, the wandering priestess. Her mother was an ex-high priestess, once had a place in central church, famous for her skill in spearman-ship, until she was banished for committing adultery. Hence, she lived in seclusion, raising her daughter by herself, teaching her everything she knew. Since they rarely met other people, Crystal grew up to be a timid person. However, one day she found out that her mother was ill. She still could do day to day activities, but the sickness slowly was eating her health away. They barely had any valuables so they couldn't afford any healers or medicine. Crystal knew she had to make money if she wanted to stay with her mother longer, so with her mother's blessing (although she was reluctant at first), Crystal went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing timid, Crystal found that it was difficult to find a job since it required communicating with other people. Her mother also told her that it was better to have a companion, but she wasn't even able to properly order a drink at the inn, let alone finding a partner in arms. That was when you found her. Being a beautiful young girl, Crystal often got harassed by perverts, and that day at the inn was no different. Crystal could only helplessly fend them off unsuccessfully, surrounded by those beast when you entered the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the guild Scavenger was not particularly noble, but they did have several ethic codes to be obeyed by all members. One of them was to help any encountered damsel in distress (and if possible, to ask for something in return later). Following the code, you went to help her. No violence was involved. By merely pretending to be her close friend, you made the offenders hesitated when they saw the Scavenger insignia on a scarf, tied on your right arm. Being in a famous guild had its perks as they slowly left you two alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, in a very quiet voice you almost couldn't hear, Crystal thanked you. You asked what her business was in that village and then you two traded some stories. You were a little disappointed that you couldn't get anything from a poor priestess, but you welcomed Crystal to accompany you to find jobs. As your teacher always said, the more people in your group the better, especially if they were beautiful girls. Your teacher was a huge pervert and it somewhat rubbed off on you. Crystal was overjoyed by your invitation, but once again failed to properly thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a couple of weeks ago. </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">You groaned as you slowly regained consciousness. You couldn't believe you were that careless. To fell to such attack, your teacher would kill you if he found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That damn animal is going to pay,\" you silently promised inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you opened your eyes, you tried to sit up. You felt something were off but couldn't figured out what. Your head hurt as hell, so you reached out with your hand. Instead of your short shaggy hair, though, you felt silky smooth hair on your hand. Surprised, you retracted your hand quickly that some of the hair flung out into your vision. They were long, which was not how it supposed to be, and instead of black, it was blue-ish white. You looked blankly at your now slender hand. Then you looked down and saw them, a pair of breast pushing through a white blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to say, before snapping your mouth shut. You recognized the voice that went out of your mouth not as yours, but of your 2 weeks old companion. You looked around and finally saw another body lying down which looked like you. In fact, it was your body indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotta be kidding me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you ended up in Crystal's body. Well, the 'how' part was actually quite obvious. It must be that monster's vault. The real question was, what happened to Crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath, trying to calm yourself down. Then you got up and approached your body. It was you, alright, still in your black shirt and trousers. It appeared to have no injuries, as with Crystal's body. You then shook it, feeling a little relieved when it started to wake up. After it opened it's eyes, it quickly sat up and looked around. When it finally saw you, its face showed horror and disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal?\" you softly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response you got was a loud shriek and instant back jump, before crawling on all four. Several short shrieks followed after it turned back to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's her,\" you sighed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be only 2 weeks, but you got to spend a lot of time together so you knew most of her behaviour already. Your teacher taught you how to read a person's personality, anyway, which helped much. Crystal was still screaming, by the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal, please stop screaming with my voice, it sounds... Weird...\" 'Pathetic' was the word you wanted to say, but you decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon stopped. But it seemed that Crystal had just realized the condition she was in as she now looked down on her body, seeing your body instead of hers, and then continued her screams. Her screams made your headache worse, but you wouldn't even bother telling her to stop again. Eventually, Crystal calmed down somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-jack?\" she stammered, which you replied with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be that last attack... Probably it was its special power or something, and it made us swap bodies like this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... I don't want this!\" Crystal started to panic again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, we will find a way to reverse this... Maybe we can figure it out if we captured that beast... But it will be difficult...\" you pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You seem very calm about all this...\" Crystal said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Well, you could say, I have somewhat plenty experience about this kind of thing,\" you said while smiling bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour teacher had a close friend who was a wizard and whenever they met up, your teacher always tag you along. They often made you his guinea pig, trying out new potions and spells he made. Most of them were successful, unfortunately the effects were as ugly as intended. One time your nose grew very long, other time you grew a pair of goat horns, another time your skin turned into rainbow color, once you were transformed into a dog for a full day, etc. They never turned you into a girl like this, though, which was surprising since that wizard was as perverted as your teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBottom line was, there were many unpleasant things happened to you, but they were all reversible, so this one must be too. That's what you believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will try to capture that one, but I don't think it is going to return to the farm soon, so we will have to find it inside the forest,\" you told Crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, l-lets go...\" she said while standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it, it is way past noon. It will be dark in a few hours. We better start looking tomorrow. Besides, there is another important thing to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, do you know how to use a sword?\" you asked her, which prompted Crystal to shake her head, \"well, I also only know little about using a spear. My teacher used sword so I followed his style\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you we will have to stick to our old weapon, but we have different bodies right now. There will be differences in height, weight, strength and balance, so we have to get used to our bodies ASAP if we want a chance to capture that monster tomorrow,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I understand...\" Crystal said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now give me my sword\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traded weapons. First you tried to practice on your own. Crystal's body was only somewhat shorter than you, and the difference in weight was not that great either. The problem would be in strength as Crystal only focused her training on her arms to swing her spear, which made her leg not as strong. Meanwhile, you relied on your leg a lot to run, dodge and kick down opponents. You would have to change your fighting style. Also, with the extra weight on your chest which was nonexistent when you were a man, added with several other anatomical differences, your sense of balance was hugely overthrown. Crystal also seemed to have difficulties in getting used to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, you two tried mock battle. Your movements were so awkward that you were sure you would be killed quick if you faced a tough enemy. Crystal wasn't any better. You decided to stop about an hour before sun set and got back to the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the result of your training was...</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You felt ashamed after all that practice with Crystal. Sure you had still retained all your skill, but with this new body of yours you weren't able to pull off that many techniques. Your new body just didn't have the right muscles for the job. Couple that with your new height, weight, and sense of balance You sighed as you looked at Crystal who was in your body. She didn't do that well either. Her attacks were sloppy and awkward, but what really surprised you was that her spear had not lit up at all. The holy magic inside laid dormant the whole time as strange as it was. Normally it would shine a little as it became stronger with her own magic. You pondered your situation and tried to think of a way out of this mess. Your current level of skill would leave you dead to even the simplest bandits. If only there was some way you could get your body back. You bit your lip and thought hard, but you ultimately could not come up with any solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Crystal for a moment and felt a bit bad for her. You were used to these kinds of things given your prior experience with your mentor, but Crystal was not. You felt a little guilty as you were the one who had accepted this mission without telling Crystal beforehand, even though you knew she most likely would have agreed to it anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head slightly. Thoughts like these wouldn't help you get your bodies back. So there was no point in thinking like that. As time passed on you both decided to head towards bed. Maybe it was only temporary? Whatever the case a fresh mind might just help you overcome this problem. As you entered Crystal's room you realized that changing into pajamas was going to be a bit of a problem. You mulled your options over in your head before ultimately deciding to just sleep in your current clothes, minus the shoes and socks. Not only did this make it harder to sleep, but the new weight on your chest made you uncomfortable. Hours past and soon you fell asleep, only to awaken to the sound of a knock on the door a few hours later. You rubbed your eyes groggily and opened the door to see your body which was jumping up and down with excitement. \"What's got you so excited in the morning?\" You asked, surprised at her energetic enthusiasm she gave off. Most of the time she was mostly reserved and quiet, so this was a bit new to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...how do you go to the bathroom?\" Crystal asked uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped back a bit realizing that she wasn't jumping with excitement, but merely had to go pee. \"Uh...\" You thought for a second, wondering how to best answer the question. \"Just, you know, hold, aim, and fire.\" You told her in a somewhat awkward manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked frustrated with your answer, but ultimately accepted it as she ran off to use one of the various outhouses in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched her run off in your body you realized something...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">It was not going to work, you concluded. You thought it was the best course of action to stick with your own weapon, but now you realized it was a foolish idea. If you forced yourself to use your sword, it would take weeks or even months for you to get used using it with your current body. You couldn't afford to wait that long. You looked back inside at your sword. It was a birthday gift from your teacher a few years ago, and you had been using it since. It was well maintained, so it would still serve you for many years. But now you'd have to temporary part with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exited your room and walked toward Crystal's. It was unlocked so you went straight in. Her spear laid on the bed, and you took it, analysing it with both your eyes and arm. It felt heavier than your sword, but it strangely felt comfortable in your arm. As much as you would like to try it, swinging a spear inside would be dangerous somewhat, so you carried it to the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outdoor, you tried a few basic swing and thrust. Although you were mainly taught about using sword and melee fight, you were also taught on how to properly use a spear in case you lost your weapon or something. You were not very good with it, though. However, again this spear seemed easy to use, and none of your moves were awkward like when you tried to use your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is going better than expected...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided it would be best for you to use Crystal's spear. You knew how to use a spear, and Crystal's body seemed to remember how to use the spear. The same thing wouldn't easily be said about Crystal and your sword, though. She said she didn't know how to use a sword before. Besides, sword was not your only weapon as you also often used a lot of melee moves in a fight. She would have more trouble than you if you went with this kind of weapon choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so engrossed in practicing and thinking that you didn't realise Crystal was standing nearby. You stopped immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Crystal... Finished your businesses already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing with my spear?\" she paid no attention to your joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this? Well...\" you wanted to explain but Crystal cut you short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal rushed forward, trying to forcefully took her spear away from you. You instinctively moved back, making her unable to do what she wanted. This just pissed her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the first time in 2 weeks you see her being this... emotional. She always seemed reserved almost every time and about every thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, calm down Crystal,\" you somehow still stubbornly tried to keep the spear away from her as you two struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is my mother's spear! Give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, so that's why...\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relented, and gave her the spear. As soon as she got it, she held it tight while glaring at you. Feeling guilty, you apologized and explained at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said we should stick to our weapon yesterday,\" she said after she listened to your explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I am sorry but I was wrong. You knew how we were at the end of the day. We couldn't pull it off. So I guess this is time to reconsider the other option, which is trading our weapon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal went silent, seemed deep in thought. She looked doubtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but I don't know how to use a sword\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll teach you the basics. I have a feeling my body remembers how to wield it so it wouldn't be too difficult for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...do you know how to handle a spear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do. I learned how to use it during my training, which I mentioned to you yesterday\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but you don't know how to use the magic\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know Crystal was making excuses, so you went straight at what made her hesitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then teach me. Crystal, don't worry... I will take care of your mother's legacy,\" you said while smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked shocked at your words. A couple of seconds later her expression turned into anger again. Crystal suddenly thrust her spear right on your stomach. You felt the hit, and fell on your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother is still alive, you idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoudest shout you ever heard, both from her and your own voice since you never screamed like that. Good thing she was still sensible and used the back side of the spear when she hit you. You felt like you wanted to throw up, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you muttered while holding the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of silence later, you heard Crystal sighed above you. You looked up, still kneeling on the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand... I'll do as you say,\" she gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning was spent with both of you getting familiar with each other's weapon, as well as giving pointers on each other skills. As you expected, Crystal had more trouble than you did, and she was only a little better than yesterday when she used her spear. You yourself didn't have much problems, except you still couldn't tap into Crystal's magic 100%. Scratch that, you couldn't even reach half of it. The magic in the spear activated twice or thrice but failed to activate most of the time. And none of her healing magic was casted from your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling enough practice, however, you moved to another problem, \"looks like we couldn't get that monster by ourselves, not like this at least. That's why I have been thinking of getting another person to help us. Maybe an experienced hunter who lived around the area or mercenaries like us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't have any money to pay them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, that's why I plan to give all of our reward for this job, so it is actually like transferring the job,\" you explained, \"I think losing this job is better than stuck like this for a long time, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I suppose you are right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I am off to find help. You should keep practicing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Crystal stopped you by grabbing your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed you suspiciously, \"you... haven't taken a bath nor change clothes since yesterday, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... No? So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to wander around in my body like this?! Unacceptable! Go wash yourself! Or at least change your clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked at her again, you realised she had changed into another pair of your clothes. You just remembered that Crystal was a somewhat neat freak. Maybe she wanted to keep that reputation intact. Well, you wouldn't like a dirty woman yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay... I'll do it first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of your shoulder. But as soon as you turned around and walked a couple of steps, she did it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face went as red as tomato. Now that she had your face, you felt really uncomfortable looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do that... You will s-see my body,\" she whispered, but loud enough for you to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh, how do I supposed to do it without looking? Blindfold myself? Besides, you already see my... *cough* So there is no need to be shy about this anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there is!\" Crystal shouted softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, make up your mind, then! Should I stay dirty or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal went quiet. It looked like she wouldn't be able to decide so you would decide it by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wash myself now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked away, Crystal made no attempt to stop you. You went to her room and took a fresh set of clothes and went to the bathhouse. It was a little disappointing that the public bathhouse was empty. You thought back about Crystal's hesitation for letting you saw her body, but it disappeared as you undressed yourself in the bathhouse. You smiled at your own reflection and naked Crystal smiled back at you from the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first everything went well. You took it for granted to feel around in various places you didn't have as a male. However, as you applied soap all over your body, you realised something. On Crystal's back, there were several... No, many deep slash marks, which now remained as scars. It appeared to be quite old. The wounds were treated well, you could tell. What could possibly the cause of this? As you were wondering about those scars, you forgot any perverted thoughts and finished your bath quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently promising that you would ask her about those scars someday, you dried yourself, redressed, combed your long hair, and went to find some help.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take very long before you were finally able to recruit someone for your mission. At one of the local taverns you found two people who were willing to help you. One of them was a slim but muscular elf who was skilled with both knife and bow, and the other one was a very strong looking man wielding a mace and shield. They didn't seem to be the most skilled but they were pretty decent from the demonstrations they gave. Now all you had to do was locate Crystal so you could all work on the mission and hopefully swap back to your original bodies. As you neared the entrance of the inn you were staying at you turned back towards the two guys telling them to wait there until you got your partner, they nodded, waiting outside the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on Crystal's door you had to wait momentarily before the door unlocked and out stepped Crystal. She glanced to the side away from you, knowing you had seen her naked earlier. This served to make things quite awkward. \"I found two guys who can help us.\" You said, in an effort to lighten the mood a little. Crystal kept glancing away but nodded slightly as you both made your way out of the inn where you found both of the men again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, my name is Alfoz.\" Said the archer.<br>\r\n\"And mine is Jonol, it's a pleasure to meet you.\" Said the maceman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal eyed them and said back. \"N...nice to meet you as well.\" She gave a half smile before looking back towards you, a bit shy around the new members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled the air for a moment, but you quickly broke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uhm, about the mission. The creature in question we're looking for is a blue stag-like creature with horns that branch every which way, and it also has multiple tails. Last we saw it ran off into the forest.\" You told the two men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I saw that creature this morning. It was near one of the lesser dirt road, foraging for food most likely.\" Said Alfoz, crossing his arms triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Crystal perked up at this moment and were excited to at least have some idea of what was going on. \"Y...you saw it?\" You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I just said, right?\" Alfoz smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright lead the way then.\" You said as you all began walking towards the dirt road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along it for about an hour with weapons in hand you still failed to see the creature. You cursed your luck. Finding this creature wasn't going to be easy was it? Suddenly a bush started to shake and out popped the creature, its ears twitching. Without even thinking you all began to chase after it, but it began sprinting away. Alfoz fired a few arrows but all of them seemed to miss just barely due to the creature's extreme agility. Before long it was completely out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's split up into groups of two and catch it off guard.\" Said Jonol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all agreed with the plan and you found yourself paired up with Jonol. A couple of minutes were spent searching before Jonol stopped dead in his tracks. \"I'm going to try climbing this tree to search for the creature hold on a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure thing.\" You said as you clutched Crystal's spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonol despite being big gracefully climbed the tree with ease and looked out into the distance, looking at the surrounding open areas for the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonol stopped climbing and hopped out from the tree moving towards you, snickering ever so slightly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find the creature?\" You asked hoping for a good answer, only for Jonol to pull you into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell nice.\" He said in a rather creepy way as he smelled your hair deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed him back. \"W...what are you doing?\" You asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react he grabbed your shirt and started pulling at it trying to take if off of you. As he pulled on it you quickly knocked his hand away with the staff of the spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonol stopped as you did this shaking in anger. \"Y...you ungrateful BITCH!\" He lunged at you with his mace swinging it full force. You narrowly dodged it as the mace hit a tree splintering the bark, as small wood fragments began to scatter all around. He really wasn't messing around was he. \"Now do as I say or else you're going to die here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clutched your spear tightly, not sure if you would be able to beat him given your current predicament. You had practiced a little but was it enough? If only you had your own body, you could easily beat this fool, heck even Crystal could probably beat him as she was skilled as well, but in these new bodies your old talents didn't matter that much. Your only option was to fight, or run away, and you were having trouble making a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even try to use that spear on me.\" Jonol said smirking. \"Just leave it on the ground and do whatever I say. Then give the spear to me so I can sell it. I'm sure it's worth more than whatever payment you would receive from some deadbeat farmer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this you heard your body scream for help from far away. In fact you were having trouble making it out. \"Help, Alfoz is attacking me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now realize you've been had, they weren't after the money from the job at all, but rather for whatever valuables you had on yourself. You looked at Crystal's spear and the ornate designs on it. This weapon really would sell for a lot of money, but you weren't going to give it up either, least of all let some guy take advantage of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly coming to a decision you decided you had no choice but to...</span></div></div>",

There was no way you could go to where Crystal was without getting attacked from behind. At least you could see his attacks if you decided to fight, unlike when you ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonol brandished his weapon toward you, there was no time to hesitate. You readied yourself, taking a stance that you knew. Once you learned from your teacher that lances were not a very effective weapon against axes or maces such as his. But once again, you didn't have much choice. You stayed where you were, waiting for his attack since attacking him first was a reckless and dangerous move, given your situation right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you want to do this? I had no intention of hurting you, you know?\" Jonol tried to sweet talk you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell you would,\" you cussed, \"not after what you did to that tree bark\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith swift and quick movement unexpected of a man with a body-build like him, Jonol tried to attack you again. You kept dodging every attack, waiting for a chance to attack back. One wrong movement and you'd be knocked unconscious. Jonol started to get irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop dodging!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed silent, focusing your power to activate Crystal's magic inside you, which you kept failing to do so for the last couple of minutes. Jonol's attacks got more and more erratic, but there was still no chance for you to hit him back as his attacks were surprisingly very coordinated. Then, something unexpected happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ROAR*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud would be an understatement, you had never heard a beast's roar as loud as that. It source was somewhere near, and unfortunately from the same direction you heard Crystal's screams for help earlier. Whatever that was, it was possible that Crystal was in even more danger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WH-WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded like Alfoz. Seemed like they were really in danger. Jonol was surprised at the roar, and even more when he heard Alfoz. He stopped attacking you and just starred at the direction the commotion happened. Meanwhile you were quite distracted yourself, but quickly managed to regain your concentration and luckily able to summon and fuse the light magic into Crystal's spear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a perfect chance, Jonol was distracted and you would have a full powered strike to take him down with your magic lance. It wouldn't miss, Jonol practically gave his back to you. But should you do it? There was something very unusual that was threatening Crystal's (and Alfoz's) life right now, and you were not sure you could handle it well by yourself, even if Crystal help you later. Should you offer a peace treaty to Jonol and together help your respective comrades?</div></span></div></div>",

You immediately retracted the spear out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... b*tch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he dropped to the ground, clutching the hole on his chest. He would be dead soon if you didn't help him, but you didn't really care. He tried to kill (and possibly rape) you earlier, so your action was somewhat justifiable, at least to you. What important now was to go where Crystal was. You quickly ran towards where you thought she was, once again tried to channel magic into the spear. You were in luck as the spear soon glowed from magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uaaaaah!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Alfoz again. Seemed like he met his demise. It was both relieving and frustrating that you hadn't heard any voice from Crystal, which could mean she either already dead long ago or she managed to run to safety. Either way, you would be in real trouble soon. Jonol was a decent guy in terms of fighting, and you expected Alfoz to be about the same. If he could be taken down in less than 2 minutes, then you most likely would meet the same fate soon. You never feared death before as you always knew deep down, that no matter what kind of deadly training that your teacher set up for you, even if it would left you half dead, you wouldn't die, because he would be there at the last moment to save your life. But now you were alone, if you didn't count Crystal, your teacher wouldn't be there to save your ass. Heck, this was real, not a training, and death was a huge probability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped. All these thoughts scared you, for real. Running away crossed your mind as you contemplated. Not once or twice, but several times. Other thoughts said you should gave up, which basically the same thing. But one tiny voice said you should still go to try and save Crystal. Not only because you would be saving your own body, but also because you care about her. Yes, you actually care about her now, not only because that stupid code of conduct your guild set up when you first met her. You might fail, that tiny voice said, but you would regret it forever if you didn't try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly enough, that one tiny voice prevailed. You were not a coward in the first place, anyway. Toughening your determination once more, you started running again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you arrived at the source of the commotion, you saw Crystal sitting down under a tree, head hanged down, clutching her legs in a sitting fetal position. Several trees nearby were broken by something that appeared to be a huge paw or claw, the logs laying down on the forest floor. You saw a small pool of blood, which you though might be Alfoz's, but you saw him nowhere. You thought you might see at least... parts of him, but you saw nothing of sort. And most importantly, there was no sign of the thing that did all this. You quickly strode towards Crystal. Looking at her up close, she appeared to have no wounds, but was visibly shaking. You also heard faint sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal?\" you softly called her name while lightly put your hand on her shoulder. She jolted, but made no further reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal, what happened?\" you asked again, even softer this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal slowly lifted her head. Damn, your old face looked terrible with tears running down on it. You felt uncomfortable looking at it, but tried to hide your feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... He... Alfoz... Att-attack... And... And then... And then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use asking her now, she was too shocked. She would only produce unintelligible explanation. You made a gesture to make her quit trying and helped her up. She was very weak as she let almost her entire weight on you. Your old body was quite heavy, relative to your current strength, but you managed to drag Crystal down until you reached the village, and sequentially the inn. You let her entered her room, where she plopped down on her bed and resuming the fetal position, laying down sideways and covered in blanket this time. You quietly closed the door and went to the tavern downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down in front of the counter, you leaned Crystal's spear beside you. The tavern was empty save the barkeeper, since it was past lunch time already. When the barkeeper saw you, he looked startled, eyes darting between you and the spear. Looking down, you had just realized that some of Jonol's blood tainted your white dress red, and even more was still on the spear. His reaction was understandable. But you didn't care about that at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me something strong, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated, but quickly obliged to your request as you stared at him. You had never seen Crystal drunk any type of liquor before, except maybe ale, but you badly need it to calm yourself down. Otherwise you feel like you would break down and cry yourself out like Crystal upstairs. The barkeeper put down a small bottle of something and a smaller glass. You waste no time pouring down some of it and chugged it down your throat. The sensation felt very strong in your new body, but that was exactly what you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour plans had ended up in failures so far. First, your idea of using respective weapon didn't work, which made you had to try the alternative. It was also your idea to find help to catch the monster that did the swap, which ended terribly. Also, that wasn't your idea, but whatever attacked Crystal and Alvoz still haunted your mind. These couple of days had been nothing but bad luck. After a while, you noticed someone entered the tavern, but paid no attention to it, until that person walked up right beside you, and swung his weapon. You barely managed to grabbed your spear and jumped away before your skull was crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a surprise to see Jonol there, but even more surprising was the fact that his wound didn't appear to be treated at all. Fresh blood still smeared his chest, no doubt coming from the hole in it. His breath was erratic, expression stuck in wrath mode, with blank eyes starring straight at you. If you had to describe it shortly, he looked like a revengeful zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WILL KILL YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you couldn't be wrong on the revengeful part. But despite how he looked like, he seemed full of vigor, ready to act his revenge. Just another bad luck for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barkeeper could only watch helplessly as his tavern was slowly destroyed in a game of deadly tag, Jonol smashed anything that stood between you and him as you were trying to keep your distance. Soon you had no choice but to confront him, once again tried to channel your magic. As one of his attack missed, you thrust the magic imbued spear on his chest again, this time right on his heart. It was a bullseye, but something strange happened. First, there was a sizzling sound coming from his newly made wound, as if it was burned. That didn't happen with your previous attack in the forest. Secondly, even after his heart was pierced and you retracted the spear, he was still moving. And the last one was that he appeared to feel nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... You are really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour teacher ever taught you not to deal with the undead, because they were too difficult to be taken care of by normal fighters such as you and him. It would need magic to deal with them properly, preferably holy or fire element. His wizard friend ever showed you what happened when one use holy and fire magic to an undead: they burned easily. Crystal's magic was not something that she could be proud of, more less coming from the inexperienced you, but it was a holy magic nevertheless. That burning reaction that you produced meant that Jonol was no longer among the living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a voice as Jonol, whom were having the same expression this entire time, showed a pained face. He was grunting as some kind of black... energy ball, or whatever that was, slowly exiting his chest. Having no clue to what you just saw, you could only silently stared at the now static and lifeless Jonol lying on the floor, as the ball completely out of him. It hovered there for a moment, before flying toward the one who spoke earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have, if not almost inexistent, holy magic, I see... Quite interesting...\" the person said as the black ball swirling around it's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</div></span></div></div>",

Grinning she let the ball of energy dissipate and walked towards you slowly. You readied your weapon, preparing yourself for another fight when all of a sudden the woman disappeared from your vision. You nervously spun around expecting her to pop out from behind you only that wasn't the case at all. She was still completely out of your sight. You nervously turned back forward and were shocked to not see her there either. Wait..., you quickly glanced up at the ceiling, but still she seemed to be missing. Strange..., just where was sh-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo!\" Shouted the woman's voice from behind as she grabbed you. You squealed at her touch and dropped your weapon by mistake. You struggled to try and escape her grip, but the woman held on firmly if only barely. Eventually she let go, an action which almost made you clumsily fall on the floor. Catching your footing at the last moment you picked up your spear and turned around. \"Who are you, just what do you want?\" The lady looked at you for a moment, smirking to herself. \"How would you like to learn how to fully make use of your magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyed the woman for a moment. Could you really trust her? From what you saw it was true she seemed very capable in the magic arts, but why would she want to help you? What was her reasoning? Also Crystal herself was currently teaching you anyways. Why would you need another teacher at all? She doesn't even use the same magic type for crying out loud. And yet you found yourself intrigued, Maybe this woman really knew what she was talking about. Maybe she just felt like you, err Crystal, had more potential. You thought about all of this for a moment, thinking really hard about the situation.</span></div></div>",

But then again, you're kind of in a very bad condition right now, so a little help would be very appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman began to frown from your refusal, so you quickly added, \"...unless you tell me what's in it for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer frown once again changed into a smile, beamed it's beauty towards you. She looked older than you or crystal, but not that much. In normal circumstances, you would be, at the very least, interested to know such a beautiful woman better, if not outright fell in love with her. But you were in a condition that you sure  nobody would say normal; your body swapped with a girl and was attacked by a zombie controlled by this woman, among other things. Besides, it was just your gut feeling, but you feel bad things might happen to you if you follow this woman. But maybe that was because two guys just betray you earlier, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in it for me? Nothing! I just love to see another magic user like me around. I'm not saying we are rare, but I do rarely meet one these days,\" she said, still smiling, \"it will be a pleasure for me to have another proficient magic user around as a friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reasoning makes sense. Magic users rarely interact with each others, unless they were banded together in a mage guild. Most prefer to hide or secluded themselves, secretly doing unthinkable experiments or simply didn't like the attention. This is because common folks either fear or outright hate magicians. Except healers, folks love healer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't 100% mean she told the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't believe you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouted. Literally. And she looked cute as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? And here I thought I find a guy with great power but not quite grasp his power yet as my companion. I can help you easily tap this girl's power, you know... Teaching you would be my pleasure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore sweet talks from her... If she thought it would be easy to convince you, she was gravely mistaken. But before you could speak up your mind, you realized that she said something odd, and unconsciously muttered it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... 'A guy with great power'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I mean, you know the technique to steal this girl's body, so I believe you have talent for magic,\" she said, emphasizing on the word 'steal.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Steal' she said. It confused you a lot that it was shown on Crystal's face, which was mimicked by the woman. Both of you were in bewildered state until finally you get what she was taking about. This woman knew that you were not the rightful owner of Crystal's body and she assumed that you stole it from Crystal. Disregarding her mistake, it would mean that she was able to see through your body and looked into your soul, or whatever there was, and determine that you did not belong in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you started to say anything, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two can just leave me here alone to cry over my destroyed chairs and tables and possibly bury a dead body later, that'd be great...\" the inn keeper suddenly said, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seemed surprised at the inn keeper's remark, but then walked towards him. Smiling, she took something out of her black robe and put it on the counter. It was a small sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooorry for your trouble, here is something to make up for it,\" she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assumed the sack contained some gold, and you were right as you saw the inn keeper's eyes lit up as he opened it. Nevertheless, the woman backed away and returned her attention back towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman obviously knew at least a thing or two about souls. She might be able to help you and Crystal with your body swapping problem. But should you trust her? Obviously she had interest in you based on a false assumption. Would she still be friendly and cooperative once you tell her the truth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth, you finally decided to...</div></span></div></div>",

She followed you closely, casually humming to herself. Her voice was actually pretty beautiful you had to admit. Entering the room you closed the door and locked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably wondering why I brought you here, right?\" You ask, only surprisingly she steps even closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because you want my body right?\" She asks, placing a hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure you'll find you won't be able to.

You just wish that the swap was really reversible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you know?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on a smug face she answered, \"I know that the creature is very rare, almost like a mythical creature.

She looked like she wanted to retaliate, but stopped when she saw tears streaming down your face. Realizing this, you quickly wiped the tears with Crystal's sleeve. It had been ages since the last time you were crying. Maybe it was a girl thing or whatever, but you found that you were unable to stop crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, stop crying, damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed at yourself. You hate crying because it reminded you of your past, of your weak past, before the guild took you in.

It is okay to cry sometimes when you feel sad, it is nothing to be ashamed of,\" while softly stroking your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what happened, but you found yourself unable to hold your tears anymore and started to cry out loud. The woman stayed silent and listened to your wailing. A few minutes later, it turned into soft sobs, and the woman finally let go of you. When you wanted to wiped your tears (and mucus) with your sleeve again, she stopped you, reached into her robe, and took out a handkerchief. You gratefully took it from her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that I can't help much. I read about the creature on the same book I read about that body stealing spell, which apparently is based on that creature's power. That was a really quick read, and it was a book full of weird spells, so I can't remember much of it. I am very sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman said it with a guilty expression. You felt bad making this woman felt responsible for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it is okay... Sorry I yelled at you earlier, err...\" you just realized you hadn't known her name yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled at you, \"My name is Selina. I haven't know your name yet, either\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Jack... But this body belongs to my friend Crystal,\" you smiled back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is this Crystal still with you?\" Selina asked, seemed excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yeah, she is in another room. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I knew we didn't start our meeting in a proper manner, I attack you and whatnot, and I said I was looking for a fellow magician as a companion, but honestly, I feel very lonely. You don't seem like a bad guy, and I expect Crystal to be the same, so can I join you two? Besides, I am interested in this whole body swapping ordeal. I would like to see it is resolved\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment, \"you say I don't seem like a bad guy, but you are sure like one Selina, with your black magic and your clothing,\" you said, pointing at her dark robes and tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't be a classist! Dark magic doesn't automatically mean it is bad! It is how you use the magic! Even holy magic can be used for bad things! And don't you dare critique my clothing taste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her turn to snap at you. It looked like she was sensitive in this matter. Well, about the clothes, you like dark colors too, so you didn't have the right to speak on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I am sorry... I was just betrayed by two mercenaries today, one of whom you used to attack me, okay? So pardon my suspicion\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I see... So he was your comrade? I just saw you stabbed him and then ran away from afar by accident in the forest, so I wanted to play with you,\" she grinned mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Please refrain from doing such dangerous game in the future...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!

You knew you couldn't help it though, after all you had just met her and she did just set an undead brute on you. Even if she didn't actually want to kill you, it wasn't exactly a funny joke by any means, but nevertheless, now was not the time to think about that. Right now you needed to focus on finding that creature again. Just then your stomach growled, which caused Selina to giggle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry are we?\" She asked bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little...\" You sheepishly replied as your stomach continued to groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hehe, well then, why don't we go fix that huh?

A few moments later Crystal finally opened the door. She was shaking slightly and she seemed to force a smile at your presence. You figured she was just shaken up from all that had happened earlier. Losing her body and getting attacked must have stressed her out quite a bit. Perhaps some food and some time away from her room would help cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, want to go out and eat? I met a mage who knows about the creature that swapped us, well sort of...\" You tell her, hoping she'll join you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal thinks about it for a moment carefully and shakes her head. \"I don't really want too, I mean what if this mage tries to kill us like those last two guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just have to be cautious is all, and honestly she doesn't seem like a bad person, and so far she's the only lead we have, so why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal gazed to the side and didn't respond to your question. She seemed hesitant about the whole thing, and while you would like her to join you were reluctant to push the matter any further, as you didn't want to upset her. Still though, this was a great chance, maybe the Selina knew something, anything about the beast, or perhaps she knew someone who did, or perhaps a book on it or something.</span></div></div>",

It probably isn't a good idea to force her anymore than necessary right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Crystal staring directly into her own, err, your eyes. \"Alright, well I'll be back soon okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal nods at this, but from the way she's acting she seems almost distant. It's actually pretty sad to see her this way, but there's not really much you can do to cheer her up, other than hopefully getting some more information on the creature that swapped you and how to reverse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back down the hallway towards Selina she smiles at you. \"So, where's this Crystal girl then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't want to come unfortunately.\" You told her, whilst shrugging your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina frowned a bit, but quickly regained her composure of happiness and told you to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her, for what felt like at least half an hour, as you passed by both the nobles district and slums. Eventually you both arrived at a restaurant building which seemed to be average in pretty much every way. From the interior, to the exterior, and even the choices on the menu. Flipping through the various dishes you finally settled on some beef stew. It wasn't the cheapest item on the menu, but it wasn't the most expensive either. Selina on the other hand decided to get a mini pork roast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a while before the food would be ready, so this gave both you and Selina some time to discuss things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is there anyone who would know about this creature, or do you know where the book you read about the creature is?\" You asked her, filled with hope that she may know something you don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked to the side for a moment, and placing her index finger on her cheek thought for a second. She then glanced back over to you and winked. \"I don't know anyone else who would know about the creature, but I do know where the book is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smile at this piece of information. Grinning widely you slammed your hands down on the table and leaning forward raising your voice a little. \"Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ehehe, while you're a girl you shouldn't lean forward to much, otherwise those guys over there...\" She pointed behind her towards a few guys who seemed to be staring at your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly sat back down but couldn't help try to pressure more information out of her. \"So, is it near or far, or?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina winked at you. \"It will take about a month to travel there by caravan. So it's far, but not that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sunk a little at this, but really in the grand scheme of things a month wasn't so bad right? \"So is it located in a city then, or?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked around for a moment cautiously, her eyes scanning the room before leaning in slightly and whispering to you. \"It's located at...\"</span></div></div>",

I just said that it is a month by caravan, do you think Mallow kingdom is that big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that's true\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it is one of the biggest Kingdom in the land, it would probably only take a couple of weeks by caravan to go from one side of the border to the other. You've never been outside the Kingdom, as you heard there were many dangers outside the border where no one governs the land. Besides, you just started your adventure less than a month ago. But there was another thing on your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, going out of the border is one thing, but if I heard right, that place is ruled by elves? A particular race of elf who shunned human? How can we get in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, I am permitted to enter. They allow magicians such as me to enter,\" Selina said while puffing her chest in a proud gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you, but what about me and Crystal? We are not magician... Are you allowed to bring non-magician visitors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization hit her, and Selina smiled sheepishly at you. You sighed at her constant ditzy-ness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, it is almost too much of a problem to get there...\" you leaned back on your chair, then started muttering to yourself, \"maybe I need to go back to initial idea, catching that creature...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were musing by yourself, the food arrived. It looked like Selina weren't going to wait to devour her pork roast, so you grabbed a spoon and started eating yourself. The stew taste much better than you expected. You wonder if this place was Selina's favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been in this town several times, and I always come here each time,\" Selina said, as if she could read your mind, \"it was pure luck that I found this restaurant on my first visit to the town. I wonder why this restaurant isn't very popular\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what Selina meant. Despite the average but comfy &amp; spacious room this restaurant had, only several people were inside. And it was already time for lunch too, so it should have been packed with guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because it is too deep inside the town? I mean, I might get lost if I try to find my way out of here to the inn by myself...\" you said in between your chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably...\" Selina said without looking at you. She was devouring her meal real fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry, aren't you?\" you asked while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry is an understatement, I'm starving. I've just arrived in town, you know, when I followed you back from the forest. I haven't eaten anything since yesterday,\" she said, while waving to the waiter, \"I want to order a second, do you want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't need one... I want a cold drink instead\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Selina finished ordering another pork roast and two glasses of ice tea, you asked her again, \"by the way, you haven't tell me why you come in this town now. Just passing through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh actually, I'm in a mission to try and subdue a beast that supposedly live around the forest near this town. I saw it once, from afar and while hiding so it didn't see me. I was afraid, you know. It looked menacing. But when I told my guild about this, they told me to get it by myself for THEM! Those merciless ancient hags...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in a guild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't really call it a guild actually... More like a coven. We worked separately, despite being in the same faction\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, if I agreed to your proposal to become your friend back when you asked me in the inn before I told you my predicament, would you bring me along to hunt this beast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to your question, Selina smiled sinisterly, a smile you never saw her made before. It sent chills to your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" she said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, what about now? Are you still asking for my cooperation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you know about it, I will ask you to help me willingly. I wasn't going to ask you, because in your current state you wouldn't be able to help much anyway, am I right? But if you are willing to help me, I'll try to find any way to get that book I mentioned for you. What do you say?\" Selina said, still with the smile from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I just know there is no way you would help us for free. I hate to say this, but you are our only visible hope right now, so I will help you. But I will have to ask Crystal first. She and I just recovered from our first episode of betrayal, after all. You might betray us too, as far as I know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grew wide at her flat remark. Selina then laughed and said it was a joke, but you couldn't get her cunning smile out of your mind for the rest of your meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after you finished your stew, a waitress who brought another pork roast and ice tea came to your table. Suddenly, your thought drifted into Crystal back at the inn and you remembered two things at once. The first one was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, can we take out an order?\" you asked the waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you want these to be wrapped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no... I want to order chicken soup for take out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, it will be ready when you finished,\" the waitress smiled at you before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still hungry?\" Selina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's for Crystal...\" then you went on to the second thing you remembered, \"by the way, did you hear the loud roar when you saw me back at the forest this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Yes? I heard something, but it wasn't really clear. When I head to the direction it came from, I saw you and that guy you stabbed. What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, I don't know either... By the time I get there, it was gone and only Crystal remained. I think she saw something horrible. That's why she is in quite unstable condition right now. I'm starting to think, she saw the one you seek\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that might be possible! I will just have to ask her later,\" Selina said with gleaming eyes before she started devouring her second serving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly sipped at your ice tea. Things were getting more complicated now. You doubt Crystal would willingly cooperate with Selina, not today. Besides, you yourself still felt something wasn't right about Selina, like she still hid something from you. But there was no use worrying about that now. You finished your tea just before Selina finished her meal and drink. Selina paid for her and your meal as she promised, but you insisted to pay for the soup. Then both of you started to walk back to the inn.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">You knocked at Crystal's room. There was no answer, so you knocked harder. You heard some mumbles from inside. A moment after, the door opened and Crystal emerged. Looked like you just woke her up from her sleep. She looked better than last time, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sorry I disturb your sleep. Feeling better already?\" you asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay... I'm better somewhat, I guess,\" she answered with a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear... Say, are you hungry?\" as Crystal nodded, you added, \"well then, come downstairs. I bought soup for you. I asked the inn keeper to heat it up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Will the person you mentioned earlier be there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...Yes... She want to talk to you in person\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I guess it can't be helped... Let's go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Selina was waiting on a table. There was a bowl of soup in front of her, and she was watching it intently that she didn't realized you were back. Approaching the table, you decided to tease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you already ate two servings earlier\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? N-no, I don't want that... I just, uhh... Guarding it from flies, yeah...\" Selina said while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Crystal finally saw Selina for the first time. You could tell that Crystal was suspicious of her, but Selina's reaction to your tease should ease it up a bit. You just hope from the bottom of your heart that Selina was not a bad person and would not betray the two of you. Because if she did, then not only Crystal, but also you would become untrustful to people afterward, if you survive the betrayal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina finally acknowledged Crystal and smiled at her, \"hello, you must be Crystal. My name is Selina\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Nice to meet you,\" Crystal said very softly, almost as a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost forgot that Crystal was very timid around new people. You gestured for her to sit down. Crystal sat down, and you brought the bowl of soup closer to her. The nice aroma made Crystal's mouth wet, and she quickly started to eat. You just leaned on your chair waiting for her to finish. Glancing on Selina, she was watching Crystal. But it looked like her mind was not on the soup this time. As you were wondering what she was thinking about, Selina spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Jack? You never mentioned that you are this handsome,\" she said while smiling playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen and Crystal froze mid-chewing from the remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you saying so suddenly?\" you said, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, sorry if I surprised you. But it is true, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal resumed her eating as you mumbled to yourself. But Selina wasn't finish just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, Crystal is also beautiful. You two make a great couple\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you almost didn't have time to react since Crystal was choking on her food. You quickly got up and asked for water from the keeper. You gave the glass to Crystal who quickly gulped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not a couple...\" you finally said to Selina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? I thought you are for sure...\" she grinned at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to think this is payback for your tease earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, sorry if this bring back bad memory, but here is the deal,\" you started to explain to Crstal.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After you finished explaining things to Crystal, everything became quiet. Crystal looked off to the side a bit shyly, mulling it all over. \"I think...\" She paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should go through with it. Catching the creature hasn't gone all that well, and I think this is probably our best chance to get back to normal. Though, uh, if we see the beast along the way I still think we should chase it. Is that alright with you, Selma?\" Crystal asked, not really knowing what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Selina, and sure that's fine, though I'd still like you both to accompany me on the original task if you do swap back though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry...\" Crystal said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I have trouble with names too now and again.\" Selina said, chuckling to herself. \"Anyways, we don't have to go on this mission right away. Let's leave tomorrow afternoon or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all agreed to her plans, and decided to prepare for the next day ahead by visiting the store. Crystal decided to come along with you this time, but Selina went off to who knows where. It was a bit suspicious, but you didn't really think much of it. She probably needed some other materials or items seeing as she was a dark mage. Whatever the case, you didn't let it concern you very much. It wasn't really your business at what she decided to buy. After a few hours of gathering up both food, backpacks, rope, bedrolls, and two tents you were now almost out of money. As you were leaving the shopping district, Crystal grabbed your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a channeling gem on sale.You should buy it and socket it onto my spear so you can channel magic better. These usually don't come cheap. You really should consider it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over towards the stand to better look at the gem. It was a deep shade of blue, and while parts of the surface were scratched, it was still in decent condition. You then glanced up towards the price to find out you wouldn't even have enough money for another night at the inn if you bought it. You'd probably have to camp outside, or room with Selina, wherever she was staying at least. You considered the thought for a moment, before grabbing your spear and letting some of your magic flow into the weapon. The spear started to glow slightly before fizzling out. You definitely needed more practice, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does this gem work exactly?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just helps you draw out your magic, simple as that. However, after a while the gem won't be needed, and even using it will just hold your power back. You'll need to get a stronger one once you become skilled enough, or you could just train normally. Either way though, it does help bring out your potential a little bit.\" Crystal explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mulled it over for a second before finally deciding to...</span></div></div>",

If this gem could help you, even if it meant became penniless, so be it. Crystal instructed you on how to properly socket the gem to her spear. Once done, you tried channeling your power into the spear. It worked, the gem forcefully brought out the mana kept hidden inside you. The spear shined, ready to strike. You noted that you couldn't increase or decrease the amount of mana you channel to it, you could only stop it. It must be the gem's power. The stronger the gem, the more mana it absorbed per second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, is that too strong for you?\" Crystal asked 3 minutes after you started activating the gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you were not feeling tired at all, you assumed you still had a lot of mana left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think this is just right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well... Just remember not to activate it all the time during battles. Otherwise, you would run out of mana and stamina fast. I think you should keep channeling for now, to see your limit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it... Umm, Crystal, we have a problem. I, uhh, spent the rest of our money on this gem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that... But that is a sacrifice I'm willing to take, that's why I ask you to consider buying it. Let's find a place to set up a camp,\" Crystal started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we wait for Selina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal stopped and turned back, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can ask to stay with her?\" you don't know why, but you suddenly regret saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay... You can do that... I'll set up a camp myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask her too? I'm sure she won't mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably... But I don't want to be in too much debt to her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you don't need to worry about such thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina showed up between you out of thin air while saying that. You and Crystal both screamed at her sudden appearance, drawing the market's attention to the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are welcomed to stay with me anytime!\" she seemed unfazed by your and Crystal's scream, she must had get used to people being surprised at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-since when are you...\" you asked, though not quite finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Crystal asked you to buy that channeling gem,\" she answered nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your offer, but I don't need it. I will camp outside for tonight,\" crystal still stubbornly refuse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Are you sure?\" Selina said while smiling at Crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. See you tomorrow. If you want, you can invite Jack,\" Crystal said while starting to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, see you!\" Selina waved at her, \"So, wanna come Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt conflicted. On one side, you felt bad if you left Crystal sleeping outside by herself. On the other side, refusing Selina's offer might hurt her feeling, which in turn might worsen your partnership.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hesitated for a moment before realizing it was probably a better idea to pitch a tent and sleep with crystal outside for the night rather than staying with Selina. It wasn't exactly that you didn't trust Selina, but something seemed a bit off about her. Not that that was necessarily something negative, but you figured she might just ask you about things you weren't comfortable with telling a stranger. Not only that, but it probably would be a good idea to keep a close eye on Crystal since she was in your body. The last thing you needed was for something bad to happen to your own body that could have been avoided if you were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned towards Crystal and shouted \"Hold on just a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Selina and frowned a bit. \"Sorry, but I need to keep an eye on my body in case something happens, I hope you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina just smiled happily at you in response. \"Oh I understand, it's no problem at all. Though if you change your mind or need something, don't hesitate to come find me.\" Selina says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I'll keep that in mind.\" You smile at her briefly before running back towards Crystal. \"Alright I'm ready then, let's go camp by the edge of the town or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal nodded. \"That's not to bad of an idea, let's go then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both headed off to the edge of the town near the forest and while you set up the tent Crystal was out picking up some wood for a small campfire. It wasn't long before night rolled around. Both you and Crystal had helped set up the campfire and had idly chatted about your current situation, as well as discussing plans and tactics on how to best confront the creature that swapped you should one of you find it again. After talking to each other and eating some modest rations you had managed to procure from a local shop. They were actually pretty bland, but given your current money situation it was better than nothing. As sleep time rolled around both you and Crystal entered the tent and hopped in your sleeping bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleeping on the hard ground was tough enough, but as a girl it seemed almost hopeless. You glanced over to the side to see if Crystal was having just as much trouble as you or not. To your surprise she was sound asleep, so rather than say anything to her you tried to go to sleep one more time. A few minutes into trying to fall asleep you felt something press up against you. Opening your eyes you saw your own body had rolled over next to you along with the whole sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't trust her. Selina is no good.\" Your body muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze in place for a moment taking this all in as you started to question Selina's intentions and whether Crystal was right or not. A few hours later of careful debate you finally fell asleep from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up in the morning you felt kind of tired as if you had not nearly obtained enough rest. Which honestly seemed about right considering everything that had happened last night. You sat up and rubbed your groggy eyes to see that Crystal was still asleep. You figured it was best not to wake her up for now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning everyone!\" You heard a cheerful voice from outside, one that could only belong to Selina. \"I brought breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal woke up due to the racket and sighed. \"She's very persistent, can't she take a hint? How'd she even find us out here anyways? I swear she must be stalking us or something.\" Crystal said as she slowly got out of bed, a look of annoyance on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stood up and groggily walked over to the exit of the tent as the smell of fresh eggs and meat wafted into your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could step outside though, Crystal grabbed your arm. \"Are you really going to eat her food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the thinking you had done last night you felt that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">Gently grasping Crystal's hand, you smiled a little at her, saying, \"it's alright, Crystal... We should trust her more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked hesitate, so you added, \"I am not entirely trusting her either, but if she truly doesn't mean harm to us, she would be saddened by the way we have been treating her, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal finally relented and released her hand from your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I'm not eating with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... If anything happens to me after I eat her food, I'll be counting on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no intention of forcing her to eat Selina's food. After all, she could be right, and the food might be spiked with something. You're not sure that Crystal could do anything on her own against Selina, but it's better to have an insurance. With another glance at her, you walked out of your tent and approached Selina, still busy holding a pan over the campfire. The closer you got, the more your nose attacked by a delicious aroma. Noticing you, Selina raised her head and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning! Have a seat, it'll be ready in a minute\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells really nice,\" you complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're overreacting, it's just fried egg and some slices of deer meat. It's not like I make an elaborate meal, not that I can't make one...\" Selina grinned, \"by the way, where is Crystal? Still asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no... Uhh, she said she has stomachache, so she'll eat later,\" you lied, not wanting to hurt Selina's feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is she okay?\" Selina looked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's fine. Don't worry, she'll get better soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you say so... I guess it is done... Here you go... Careful, it is still hot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the plate that Selina held, once again, a strong smell made its way towards your nostrils. You couldn't hold yourself any longer and immediately stab a fork to your meal and put it in your mouth. It tasted a little different, but not in a bad way. Was it true then, that Selina put something weird in the food? Despite thinking like that, your stomach was growling, so you wolved down your breakfast. Your tongue was a little burned from the hot food and as if knowing that, Selina handed a glass of cold water to you once you finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you said after sipping some of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her plate and realized that she had only finished half of her meal, but at least she was eating too, so there might not be a poison in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different... Did you put something in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some spices and herbs. Being a wanderer helps discovering best spices and herbs around\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did? Didn't see anything like that...\" you said, tilting your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I grinded them up... Do you like it, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it taste better than just plain fried\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! You should taste my soup later, I'm very proud of it!\" Selina said with a smug face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, looking forward to that,\" you said with a smile, \"by the way, when should we start out search?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Yesterday, I said it'd be fine if we start in the afternoon, but I prefer if we start as soon as possible... But Crystal is not feeling well, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am fine, don't worry about me,\" Crystal suddenly popped out of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, morning! How's your stomach?\" Selina beamed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay now... We should start our search soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like some breakfast? Or, if you prefer, we can buy something for you in town\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal looked at you as if asking for advice, but you just gave \"it's up to you\" look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'd love to eat the porridge from yesterday, thank you,\" she finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'll go buy it, you two can go clean yourselves,\" Selina rose from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I want to go with you... So I know the place to buy it,\" Crystal quickly added as Selina raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew the real reason of why Crystal wanted to tag along, but you kept quiet. As the two of them went to town, you went to a nearby river to wash your body and several of your and Crystal's dirty clothes. You were hanging the wet clothes near the campfire when Crystal and Selina were back. They then decided to go to the river too as you started to pack and clean up the tent and the campsite. The fire helped drying the clothes real fast, it was almost completely dry when you finished packing. Crystal and Selina were back soon after, the former apologized for not helping you to pack up. Half an hour later, the three of you walked to the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, somewhere in the middle of the forest, a giant beast was walking towards a huge tree. This beast, which was more than twice as tall as a man, looked like a hybrid of a wolf and a bear that's capable on moving on either two or four limbs. It's paws were adorned with sharp claws as big as daggers, it's long tail as strong as a whip with a spear tip. Sharp teeth with jaws strong enough to chew metal and eyes that intimidate anything that sees them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis beast, however, appeared calm as it slowly approached the tree in front of it. It stopped right underneath it and then laid down. Not long after, the tree trunk glowed a little, as a ghostly apparition flew out of it. Slowly regaining shape and form, it turned into a beautiful girl with flowing green hair, dressed in white robes that covers very little of her body. She flew towards the beast and sat on its back. She slowly patted and rubbed the beast's neck, and the beast seemed to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the three adventurers, the three of you finally arrived at the edge of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Selina... Do you have a plan on how to find this monster you are looking for?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... This is going to resurface bad memories, but I think we should go to where Crystal met it yesterday. There I can search for residual energy using my magic, and then we can follow the trail... Is that okay, Crystal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal looked tense for a moment, but finally nodded. The three of you finally started your search.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour had passed as the three of you continued on towards the spot where Crystal first met the beast. Only problem was, you didn't quite remember being this far out. \"Are you sure this is the right place Crystal, I could have sworn we should have turned left around fifteen minutes ago. Weren't we closer to the edge of the woods?\" You asked, concerned for your wellbeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm certain we were supposed to turn right instead,\" said Crystal, though from the tone in her voice she didn't sound too confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I mean I don't want to get lost out here.\" You said somewhat worried about the situation. Getting lost in the woods wasn\u2019t exactly ideal in any way, and the last thing you wanted to do was starve to death in Crystal\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack has a point. I mean if you don't know where we are we should probably turn back instead for now and try to approach this from a different angle.\" Selina chimed in as she agreed with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's voice only seemed to cause Crystal to become more irritated though, as she pressed onwards at an even quicker pace. \"I'm sure!\" She muttered through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina frowned and shook her head lightly. \"If you say so, then I trust you.\" Selina replied, though it was obvious that she wasn't happy with how Crystal was acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen more minutes had passed and you still had no idea where you were. Crystal seemed determined to find the spot where she had first encountered the beast, though it was apparent she didn\u2019t exactly know where she was going. The fact that both you and Selina were silent about the whole thing wasn't really helping either. Still though, you had never actually seen Crystal act like this at all, and while you wanted to break the silence, you felt frightened to say anything. Part of you wondered if this was just a new side effect from the magic swap that occurred, or maybe hormones or something. Did Crystal always feel like this? You looked back at the few earlier adventures you had embarked on with her. She always was kind of quiet, and in fact you distinctly remember having to talk to the quest givers alone as Crystal always seemed too shy to really converse with them. Not that you minded or anything, but it was a bit strange. A bead of sweat started to roll down your face. Were you really going to end up completely like Crystal, first physically and then mentally? You nervously glanced over at Selina who stared at you for a moment before smiling calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much, something like that won\u2019t cause any changes.\u201d Selina said in an attempt to console you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back at her. Was she reading my mind? And wow, when she\u2019s not acting all ditzy and is actually serious, she\u2019s a lot more composed and mature than I take her granted for. She really is a kind helpful person, and honestly you didn\u2019t quite understand why Crystal held a grudge against her. She\u2019s been nice to the both of you the entire time, and there\u2019s no reason for anyone to think she\u2019s evil, other than the necromancer thing, which frankly wasn\u2019t so bad. I mean you\u2019re part of a rogues\u2019 guild, which might not be considered the most noble. It would be kind of hypocritical to call her out on being evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, I needed that.\u201d You responded as you felt yourself calm down at her words, as your troubles seemed to lessen slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Though, is my cooking really so bad that you think it\u2019d cause you digestion problems? Because I worked really hard to become a better chef for the one I love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that you weren\u2019t sure what to think anymore. Selina really was kind of crazy, though you couldn\u2019t help but get a little chuckle out of it anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t laugh. My cooking is not all that funny.\u201d Selina said as she pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m not laughing at your cooking. I\u2019m laughing at something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what is it then? Spit it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t quite sure how to say \u2018I\u2019m laughing at you\u2019 without hurting her feelings, so you instead opted to shift the topic. \u201cUh, Nevermind about that, I didn\u2019t know there was a guy you liked Selina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of this Selina put both of her hands to her cheeks and embarrassedly shifted around in a cute manner. \u201cWell let\u2019s just say there\u2019s this special someone I like. From the very first time I laid eyes on him I knew he was my fated partner to be. A few years ago I was in a small town surrounded by an angry mob who wanted to kill me. Heavily outnumbered I was bound to die, but like some hero the man of my dreams appeared before the crowd and stopped them from harming me. He risked his life and allowed me to escape by telling them all that I wasn\u2019t responsible for anything, and that there was no concrete evidence. Because of this, he has won my heart, body, and soul, and I will always love him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a moment before clapping. \u201cWow, he sounds like a really brave guy to stand up to a mob like that. Though if I may ask, why were the townspeople angry at you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked down for a moment before placing her left hand over her breast. \u201cWell basically they accused me of stealing corpses from the local cemetery to create undead minions and practice necromancy. That was one hundred percent true, but I really don\u2019t see what they were so angry about. Dead people don\u2019t really use their bodies after all.\u201d Selina said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a moment, struggling to find the right words to say, but the only thing that would escape your lips was a single word. \u201cWow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina smiled enthusiastically. \u201cI know, it really is romant-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAHHHHHH!\u201d Suddenly you heard your body scream from up ahead. Both you and Selina ran ahead to find your body shaking. Crystal then pointed to what appeared to be a human skull sitting at the base of a large tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouched down and stared at the skull for a moment before realizing it was likely very old and not fresh at all. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t look like this skull is fresh or anything. We should be f-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nROARRRRRR! The booming sound of an animal could be heard from not too far off. All three of you stood silent for a moment before you began to feel the ground rumble as something seemed to be making its way over to you. You quickly pulled out your weapon, only for the rumbling to increase with each moment the beast drew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it really a smart idea to try and fight it? You didn't even know what you were fighting. Maybe it would be better to temporarily retreat for now. In a split second you made a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">\"Come! Let's hide!\" You said, grabbing Crystal's hand and forcefully dragged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, there was a thick, wide bush nearby, so you circled around and laid flat on the ground behind it. Crystal followed you and laid on your left while Selina, a bit fallen behind, jumped over the bush and took position on your right. She was about to complain about dirtying her dress when you hushed her as the monster was getting closer. It finally arrived at the clearing and it was more terrifying to you than what you imagined based on Selina's description. The thing growled, slowly inching closer with its four strong legs. It didn't seem to see you, so you felt rather relieved. Looking on your left, Crystal looked terrified while on your right Selina marvelled at the sight of the monster. Seeing a polar opposite between you made you smiled wryly. Soon, however, your attention went back to the monster as it stood on two legs and sniffed the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't tell me it could smell us?!</i> you frantically thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to do if it turned out the monster could find where you were through smell, but then you heard a soft whisper of a chant from beside you. Selina was casting a spell quietly, and when she was done, a soft barrier like spell was placed upon the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will keep our smell hidden,\" Selina whispered, winking at you, \"not that I smell or anything, though... Do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved to find out that Selina could be reliable when you need her the most. The beast sniffed some more before letting out a low growl, seemingly giving up. It lowered itself onto four legs and slowly strode toward the big tree, the one which had the skull from earlier. It then laid down on the ground and closed its eyes. You were contemplating about quietly sneaking away as it sleep, but something peculiar happened. Something flew out from the tree, something transparent, before it gained mass and materialized into a woman. Her finely shaped body was only covered by a thin white robe, making you a bit 'nervous' even from a distance. She has green long hair that flowed gently as she hovered towards the monster. She sat on top of the monster's back. It seemed to acknowledged the woman's presence, but did nothing about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at this strange phenomenon in front of you, you couldn't help but to look at your sides to see their opinion. Crystal still showed fear, but now curiosity was mixed in on her expression. Meanwhile, Selina looked even more ecstatic than before. Before you could speak anything to either of them, though, the woman spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three, you can come out now. Don't worry, I'll make sure he won't attack you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost jumped from suprise. Well, if you thought about it, the woman who spoke should already be around (inside the tree) since the start, so it was no wonder she would know that you're there. The scared and happy people on either of your sides were looking at you, waiting for an instruction. Running away would just provoke the beast, so you gave them both a face of resignation before standing up, revealing yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, we surrendered. Please don't attack us,\" you raised your hands, although it still held Crystal's spear so it wasn't a very convincing surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal and Selina followed you and stood up. The beast now acknowledged the three of you and growled, but the woman put her hand on its head, and it calmed down. With the monster out of the way, the woman motioned you to come closer, which you obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said surrender,\" the woman started to speak again, \"but I think you are gravely mistaken as I don't have any intention to attack you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much,\" you replied, still nervous being this near to the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it wasn't attacking, the beast still eyed all of you with piercing glare. Crystal looked like she would wet herself anytime (which you earnesly hope she wouldn't) while Selina didn't seemed affected by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a forest spirit?\" Selina cheerfully asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just a ghost of a dead person. I believe you have seen my remains,\" she said while pointing at the skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is obvious you are not mere ghost! You almost feel divine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled inwardly. A necromancer like Selina would sure know how the opposite of her look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... If you say so...\" the woman smiled wryly at Selina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human that has transcended into a spirit, cool!\" Selina became ecstatic again as she clasped her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her, you started to speak, \"excuse our rudeness. My name is Jack... Uhh, I mean, Crystal. He is Jack and this happy one is Selina\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, forgive me as well. My name is Khaira and this one is called Fang,\" she patted the monster's back before continuing, \"it's rare seeing people coming this far. Usually they would be frightened out by this child\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Child?</b> And many people are not just frightened by him, they also got killed,\" you blurted out, but then you felt regret and apologized for your rudeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay... I suppose I can no longer call him a child, huh? A long time has passed since then, after all... Also, I don't think there are that many people that Fang would attack. He knows how to differentiate between good and bad person, you know, he would not attack the good ones, just scare them away. And he is telling me you are not bad, that's why you can still stand right now. If you are evil, not even me can stop Fang from attacking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm not sure I should be relieved or not after hearing that, but I guess that's why Fang didn't attack you, right Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nudged at Crystal. She looked suprised at first, but then her frightened face slowly tuned down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should say thanks for being rescued yesterday,\" you urged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh? Fang told me about you. It is nice to know you are okay,\" Khaira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Thank you, Fang,\" she was hesitating but finally said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang answered with a huff of his breath. After that, Crystal looked relieved and most of her fear was gone. You felt relieved for her, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are you three here in the middle of the forest?\" Khaira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew this question was coming. </div></span></div></div>",

Extending her arms and legs as if to shield him she floats in the air and screams. \"No you can't! He's my friend and he wouldn't hurt anyone who wasn't a bad person. I may be a ghost, but I still have some magical power left in me if you want to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the thing, it's obvious that Fang isn't an evil killing machine, so with that settled we'll be on our way. Sorry for the trouble.\" You attempt to leave with Crystal and Selina in tow, but as you do so you feel something tug on your sleeve. You turn around to see Selina who now has a look of conviction on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Fang wouldn't hurt anyone then, right?\" Selina asked Khaira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...of course he wouldn't, not unless they were bad people of course. Fang is my best friend, and I know him better than anyone.\" Khaira said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Selina asked as she began to smirk. \"Then explain why a little girl was said to have been devoured by Fang! Not only that, but there have been other children as well. There are quite a few rumors of missing children being devoured by a monster in this very forest. Could this little girl have been evil as well? What about all the other children? Were they evil too?\" Selina said as she crossed her arms defiantly, as if to say, 'I win'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...that.\" Khaira paused for a moment as she looked down at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you admit that Fang could have been the killer then?\" Selina asked slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little girl that died, was actually me\u2026\u201d Khaira\u2019s words trailed off as she paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's triumphant smile suddenly turned into a frown. \"Wait so Fang killed you then? If that's the case why are you so eager to defend him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Fang didn't actually kill me. It was a man from one of the nearby towns instead. He kidnapped me, and while Fang tried to save me and did manage to injure him, he still managed to get away.\" Khaira stopped floating and knelt down on the ground putting her hands over her face. White streaks of ghostly goo flowed down her face mimicking tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so scared as I lay there dying on the forest floor. Fang comforted me however, and it was only later that I woke up like this, as a ghost.\u201d Khaira said before continuing to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina sighed for a moment as she looked downcast. \"I'm sorry for the way I acted, and I was wrong.\u201d Selina said as she walked over towards Khaira and sat down next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang is a good friend isn't he?\" Selina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhaira looked up slowly as she started to calm down. \"Uhn, he's the best friend I have. And the only one I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina said as she smiled down at her. \u201cWell if you want you can be friends with all three of us as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhaira smiled lightly at her words and wiped her eyes. \u201cI would like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled. We're all friends then.\" Selina said happily. \"With that being said though, what did your killer look like? Can you describe him? Maybe we can stop him from killing anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhaira was shocked by the question, but immediately began to describe her killer. \"Well he had short brown hair, wild eyes and he was kind of muscular with a tattoo on his neck resembling a spider, though he usually keeps it hidden. He also seemed to be rather important where I lived, carries a large sword and...\" Khaira stopped for a moment as she hesitated to continue. \"and...\" Khaira repeated uneasily. \"and...\" Khaira shook her head. \"I'm sorry I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the whole thing was rather traumatic for her, and you didn't exactly want to push her to relive those events in her life. Unfortunately her description wasn't exactly the greatest, so finding him would be very hard, if not impossible. Not to mention you didn't really want to stay as Crystal for that long, and you were sure Crystal felt the same way. This would just delay your quest further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you wanted to help Khaira out, and ultimately decided that the best option would be to...</span></div></div>",

For example, since Khaira practically lived in this forest, she might know something about the monster that swapped your and Cyrstal's body. But before you could say anything, Selina said something else first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiyaaa... Come to think of it, what should I say to the old hags now? They're going to kick me out for this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem? I told you, Fang won't attack people without a reason!\" Khaira tried to convince her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but they don't care about that. They want me to kill Fang so I could resurrect him as my thrall. That way we can use him however we wish\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? That's horrible!\" Khaira seemed both shocked and scared. When you looked at Crystal, she seemed to show the same reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may say so, but that's the everyday life of a necromancer such as I... We look for corpses and use them as our thrall\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, you are really...\" Crystal muttered softly, baring her teeth. It seemed only you could hear what she just said, though. She was ready to attack Selina at that moment, but Selina's next words stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But knowing that Fang is not a mindless beast, I can't bring myself to attack him. After all, using already available unused corpses and personally kill someone to have a corpse available are two different thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Khaira and Crystal's tense expression relaxed slowly after hearing that. You sighed, thankful that no fight happened among yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, even if I want to attack him... As expected, I will die, won't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was talking while looking at Fang fearfully. The creature in question just looked at her with lukewarm eyes, seemingly disinterested. He blew a puff of air out of his nose and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yup, I will die. Positive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer remark made you and Khaira laughed a bit. You decided this was a good time to ask for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Khaira, actually, there is something that I want to ask you... It's one of the other reasons of why we are in this forest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then explained how you and Crystal swapped bodies after meeting the blue elk-like creature a few days earlier. Khaira listened attentively, and was deep in thought when you described the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how it is... Do you know anything about it?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... That's very interesting... I know about the creature that you mentioned, though I didn't know it has such a power...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's great! Do you know where it live? I mean, does it have a nest or something?\" Crystal seemed eager to be back in her old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where it usually walk around, but yesterday... I think it will be better if I show you, it is not far from here, still a distance I can travel to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhaira floated away, gesturing to all of you to follow her. Fang stayed still and let you go. No use staying there, so the three of you followed her. A few moments later, Selina spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Khaira, you said something about a distance you could travel to. This is just a guess, but... You're bound to that tree, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes,\" Khaira answered without stopping or looked back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bound? What do you mean?\" you asked Selina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a ghost, right? Not every human will become a ghost when they die. Only some who are special, either from their power or how they die. I will have to guess it's the later for Khaira. She died under that tree, that makes her bound to that tree as a ghost. The term we, witches, use is <i>earthbound spirit</i>. Even though we called it spirit, in reality most of them are not spirits, just mere ghost. But Khaira was lucky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean lucky?! She's trapped as a ghost there for eternity!\" Crystal angrily shouted at Selina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, but that's not what I meant! That tree is also special, I can feel strange but pure energy emenating from it. Khaira who is bound to that tree unintentionally get constantly exposed to its power. That's why I said she's a ghost who have trancended into a spirit. Besides, she still has Fang who accompanied her, that's called lucky in my book. Do you have any idea how many <i>earthbound spirit</i> became crazy and evil from loneliness and regrets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, you two...\" you whispered to Selina and Crystal, \"Khaira can hear you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were practically shouting, it's no wonder if Khaira could hear them or not. However, she just kept silent. Selina and Crystal realized their mistake, and shut their mouth. Awkward silence followed for a while before Selina muttered an apology, followed by Crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay. What you both said are true. I am bound to that tree and couldn't move very far away from it. I am cursed as a spirit for eternity. But that tree gives me power, and Fang stays with me. So yeah, I am lucky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of you could see Khaira's face from there, so you didn't know what kind of expression she made. All three of you decided to keep silent. A few minutes of slow walk after, Khaira stopped and turned back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it. Please take a look for yourself,\" she said, pointing to a direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she said it made you uneasy, but moving forward was the only way of knowing what's ahead. There, in a small clearing, you saw the same creature you and Crystal was chasing after. The only difference was that it was already dead now.</div></span></div></div>",

Sometimes these two factions worked together suppose an emergency situation arose, but they usually worked separately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Claire Rayleigh, a 25 years old knight registered as the captain of the 9th division of the Mallow Kingdom's Guard, \"The Valkyrie.\" As your name suggested, you came from one of the noble houses in Mallow Kingdom, Rayleigh, who were famously known for their contribution to Mallow Kingdom's military power through generations, whether as a soldier, guard, or strategy advisor. You were also a friend of Mallow Kingdom's princess, though you rarely meet her after you became a guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your and your subordinate's job to prevent and solve crimes that happened in various cities and villages of Mallow Kingdom, especially those related to women and children. The members of Valkyrie were top ranked females that graduated from Mallow Kingdom's Military School. You yourself graduated from the school as #1 student 3 years ago before applied to the 9th Division. You exceeded not only at knowledge and logical thinking wise, but also at swordsmanship. Through hard work and your good attitude &amp; charming personality, in such a short time compared to the others, just a few months ago you were appointed as the new captain of the Valkyrie, becoming the youngest person ever appointed to become a division's captain in Mallow Kingdom's history after the previous 9th division's captain was badly injured in a skirmish against bandits and was forced to retire early from her position and as a knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople might think that the members of the Valkyrie would not just easily accept that one of their newest members was appointed as their captain, especially those who had been in the division for more than a dozen years. The relationship between you and the princess strengthen the argument that you got the position from \"connection\". However, your subordinates personally saw what you had been doing during your short membership of the division and what you were capable of doing. Jealous, maybe, but deep down they all realized that you'd make a good captain. That's why there were no objections at all when you were promoted. You even got blessing from the previous captain.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">It was late at night, and you were patrolling in the dark alleys of Falion city. This city, which was located at the edge of Mallow Kingdom's border, was recently terrorized from anonymous killing in the middle of the night. The victims were mostly young ladies and children. The local guards couldn\u2019t solve the murders while the number of victims had accumulated to more than a dozen, so they requested assistance to the central. The 9th division was instructed to investigate the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalion became the trading point of various merchants from all over Mallow Kingdom and its neighboring countries. Although it was located on the edge of Mallow Kingdom, it is the third largest and richest city in the entire kingdom, fallen short just below Mor (a city built near a rich gold mine) and the capital city. But this condition also brought problems. A lot of people from other cities and villages migrated to find jobs, but most failed to do so and ended up being beggars and homeless. Others from the outside of Mallow Kingdom, who sometimes succeeded in illegally crossing the border, also ended up to be trouble makers, petty thieves, and more beggars. This created the city\u2019s slum, a place where most of these immigrants resided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis slum was also where those murders happened. Most uptown residents didn\u2019t really care that those people were murdered, though they still felt afraid to go outside at night. But, seeing the gravity of the situation and a possibility that this murder was an attempt from outsiders to shake the peace of Mallow Kingdom, you decided to go there yourself along with a dozen members of the 9th division. That day was your 3rd night patrolling around the slum. It was difficult to stay on guard all night long, even for trained knights such as yourselves, so you took turns with local guards to increase the effectiveness of your patrol. Moreover, because the slum was quite huge, since the first night, you volunteered to patrol on your own while your subordinates were paired, not knowing something bad would happen to you that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of your patrol...</div></span></div></div>",

All you had to do was to circle your designated area once more and you'll be relieved from your duty. It had been a peaceful but stressful night. The last murder happened 4 nights ago, just before you arrived to Falion. According to local guard, the murder usually happen every 4 or 5 days, which means tonight had been a likely night for another murder to happen. You had been extra careful, and it was quite exhausting. In fact, it was the first time you felt really exhausted during a mission. You were rarely had chance or will to sleep in the last 3 days. Even when you were not on duty, you couldn't sleep at night, thinking your subordinates would need help. And during the day, you were busy asking for information from the residents of the slum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou usually planned everything carefully so it would not put a heavy burden on your body, but you couldn't take this mission as easy as the others that you had taken before. Serial killing was rare, if not non-existant at all at Mallow Kingdom. Most killings were done by bandits and thiefs, by some paid assassins from a rival merchant, or occasionally as a result of heated up drunken brawls. But those killings had one purpose: money (except the drunken brawls). This murders at Falion city were unlike you had seen or heard before. The victims were random saved from young ladies and children as the \"favorable\" victims. Those victims were also known to be poor, so very few or no gold could be gotten from killing them. Each of the victims also had the same cause of death, which was from loss of blood. Their throat were cut just enough that a lot of blood would flow and they couldn't scream (unless they want to choke on their own blood) but not large enough to kill them quickly. Several healers that were instructed to inspect the victims stated that it would took several minutes before the victims really die. This more likely to be intended than accidental, so the murderer was most likely doing this for pleasure. Although killing for peasure was actually not very rare, people usually direct their desire toward animals by torturing them before finally killing them. This would only get warnings from guards if seen, but when this happened to fellow citizen, that became one \"unique\" kind of a murder case. And that case had drained you physically and mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after you turned left on a small T junction in the middle of the dark slum area, you stopped in your track. You thought you just heard something, so you turned around and listened. You were right, there were some voices that could be heard, and it didn't sound like a friendly chatting. You started to run quickly but stealthily, as fast and as quiet as your white light-armor with gold lines, uniquely designed to be worn by every members of Valkyrie, allowed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou skidded to halt as you saw a man's back in front of you, facing another way. He seemed struggling to hold something with both of his hand. It was something big. Something the size of a human child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man heard you, and he immediately turned around, so you finally saw, as much as what the moon light could show you since there was no other source of light in there, a silhouette of a little girl, probably around 10 years old. You couldn't clearly see both the man and the girl's face for it was very dark, but you were sure the man held the girl against her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there, what are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked sternly, trying to sound a little intimidating, but the man answered lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it is not one of those lady knight. Fancy seeing you here, mi'lady. I suspect you and your friends are here to find the one who did the murders around here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl whimpered. She actually tried to scream, but the man's right hand covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I presume it is correct to say that you are the one who held responsible?\" You asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, I suppose there is no use in hiding it, seeing you caught me red handed with this lovely little girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you could not see it, you could swear that he was smiling. Your right hand reached the hilt of your sword, neatly tucked on your left waist, when he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw all of you came here 'bout 2 days ago, asking people around 'bout anything related to the murders. I gotta say, most of you were such fine ladies. Why would you waste your life in this kind of job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his question, you asked back, \"if you knew we came here to find you, why would you still try to do your foul act tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, he answered, \"Well, sure... I am 'fraid of you and the guillotine that I'd surely met if you caught me. But I just can't resist the urge to do it. You should see when my victims writhed in agony after I slit their throaths. Their reaction was so satisfying that I was feeling ecstasy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This man is mad and he don't need mercy,' you concluded before you drew your sword and said, \"let her go, and I will bring you unharmed to your trial. Try anything reckless and you will meet your end tonight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed again. He then said, \"what if I let this girl go, and in return you also let me go peacefully?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I cannot do that. Your crime is grave, and you will just repeat it if I let you go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a man can always hope, can't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then shoved the girl hard to the ground before turning around and ran away. The girl moaned from the fall, and you rushed to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" You asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. She seemed to be a bit shaken and scared, but otherwise had no injury except some scratches. While you were tending the girl, the man kept gaining some distances.</div></span></div></div>",

Your armor, albeit light, weighed you down and pile of empty boxes and crates hinders your movement. However, the same boxes didn't slow the man down and he swiftly went passed them as if he knew exactly where each box were located. Soon, after one of the many turns you had made, you lost him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped at the junction. You knew he made a right turn, but after you made the same turn, he was nowhere to be seen. It was possible that he already out ran you, but there was also a chance that he was hiding near, waiting for a chance to ambush you. After catching your breath from the short run, you then started to walk slowly while being very cautious to your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne step, two step and three, the tension in your blood and mind increased with each step you took. Swerving your head left and right, you searched for any danger. Although you were sure you could win in a fair fight, there would be no fight at all of he attacked you without giving you any chance to retaliate. Your mind was racing with every possible method of ambush that you might get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you had taken about a hundred steps without any surprise attack. Two hundred steps and still no ambush. You stopped walking after three hundred. You let out a heavy breath. It seemed that you had really lost him. How disappointing it was, after you had been so close to actually catch the murderer and solve the case. You just hope that, after all this futile attempt, the girl you left behind earlier was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how do I get out of this slum?\" you muttered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething stung your neck soon after you said that. Your right hand quickly reached for it out of reflex. Something was stuck there so you pulled it out. It was a small, needle-like darts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poison that was coating the dart worked quickly and you immediately felt dizzy. You tried your best to fight it but less than a minute later you fell unconscious .</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">When you came to, you were tied down with a beatdown rope, your hands on your back. You still felt a little dizzy, but tried your best to shake it off. A quick observation told you that you were inside a quite spacious empty room, probably in a basement too, since you could not see any windows. Four wooden pillars supported the roof, and you were tied on one of them. But those were not the first things that you observe. Not far from the wooden pillar you were tied on, you saw both the man you were chasing after earlier and the same girl you left behind. They were laying on a makeshift bed which was made of a pile of hay covered with a thin sheet. What shocking was that the man was repeatedly thrusting his penis into the little girl's vagina. You could hear the man was grunting and the girl was<br>\r\nmoaning with each thrust, the latter was clearly in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified with the view, you almost shouted and screamed, but stopped right before you opened your mouth. The man had not realized that you had awaken, it was a golden opportunity to freed yourself. You always kept a hidden knife in your arm guard, and your tied up position was possible to reach and use it to cut the rope. Reaching for the knife, you hoped he still would not realized that you had awaken before you finished cutting the rope.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">It was not there. As if you didn't believe that, you still tried to search for it. You were getting restless, and finally the other people in the room noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you are finally awake? I was starting to afraid that I gave too many poison on that needle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man said without slowing down his thrusts. The little girl seemed to pay no attention to you and kept moaning. Clicking your tongue, you shouted at the man, full with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop raping her and release me, you bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa lady, watch your tongue. We have a child in the room with us. We don't want her to pick up the bad words, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth, you felt really angry while feeling helpless, just sitting there watching the indecent conduct in front of you. The man climaxed, the girl screamed, and you turned your head away.  The man didn't bother to pull out his rod out of the girl's pussy, which was now full with his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooo, that was great...\" the man casually commented after he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you, who were glaring daggers at him, he just grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, lady. It is not as bad as it's look\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou badly wanted to beat this man to a pulp, and you started to struggle to get loose. The man just chuckled at your futile effort. Reaching for his pocket, he then swung a shinny metalic object in front of his face. It was your hidden knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you need this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shouted not only because you want to be released, but also because that knife was a gift from a good friend. You kept it in your gauntlet as both hidden weapon and good luck charm. And now that man had dirtied it with his filthy hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said calm down. There is no need to shout. Nobody is going to hear them anyway, so it will just irritate my ears\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, he bent over and gently placed the knife on the girl's belly. The girl, somewhat recovering from the sex, grabbed the knife while still laying down and inspected it. The man talked to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you what, lady... I'll let this one release you by using that knife. I won't interfere, I promise. Go ahead, girl. Help that lady knight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not believe what he just said. It must be a sick trap to torture both of you. You saw the girl sitting up while still holding the knife. You hoped that the girl was smart enough not to follow his instruction. The girl looked at your eyes. Before you could tell her not to do it, you saw her grinning at you and said words that you didn't expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide. Surely she didn't follow what the man said as you wished, but her words shocked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't help me when I was alone at the slum before, so why should I help her now?\" the girl continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, your mouth gaped at her reasoning. But before you could say anything, she continued her speech while staring directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you did help me, though, I'd be the one who drugged you and tied you up, anyway. I really don't see any reason of why I should help you now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she finished, she laughed evilly. The man followed with soft chuckles. You were confused for a moment, then sudden realization hit you like a brick thrown to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You work for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, lady, I work WITH him. See the difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl touched her dripping pussy, seemingly paid no attention to your stunned mind, and said to her partner in crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was hurt, Daniel. A lot. But I haven't felt this good in a long time. This is a nice body we got here, although she maybe a little bit too young for sex\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it, Jack. So do you think I should be the one to change now? I don't really like this guy, anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think it should be you. We rarely got two girls at the same time, so this should be a good experience. Moreover, we got ourself a lady knight this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough confused, you tried to ingest their confersation. Now you know that the man's name was 'Daniel', but he called the little girl 'Jack', which was a very unusual name for a girl. You were sure she was a girl, she had a vagina and all. Besides, you didn't understand on what they said about getting good bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving you in your state of confusion, they confused you even more when they walked to the other pillar in the room, and the girl proceeded to tie the man up, just like you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strong enough?\" asked the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tighter, I still can get loose if I try hard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This body is not very strong, you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you asked, getting nervous. You hated when you didn't know anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out soon enough,\" the girl casually answered while inspecting your knife, \"I'll just use this as the catalyst\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill naked, she went behind you and whispered, \"stay still and this will only hurt a little\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut your finger. Not slicing it off, just scratching it. You cringed a little as some blood started to leak from the wound. The girl then smeared your blood on the side of the knife. Standing up, she went to the man and did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the final step\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that, she positioned herself between you and the man. Crouching, she searched for something on the ground. She smiled when she found it, a marking drawn with blood on the floor that was made of dirt. Preparing herself, she lifted the knife high, arching her spine to the back, and thrust the knife as hard as she could at the marking. The knife dug a few cm into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, she is weak, alright,\" the girl said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then started to chant some verses or spells that you  could not understand and never heard before. With each word she uttered, previously invisible pentagram with weird symbols located directly below you and the man, started to glow brighter and brighter in reddish light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic?!\" You finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried your best to break free, but like before, it was useless. The longer the girl enchanted her spell, the more you began to lose consciousness. And when she finished, both the pentagrams emitted a blast of light for a split second, everything went black and senseless for you, and everthing became quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you regained your consciousness. You didn't know how long were you having blackout (again), but you could feel that you were still tied up in a position like before. However, a lot of things felt weird and your own body felt foreign to you. Slowly, you opened your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you saw legs that were not yours, clothed in a pair of trousers that was not yours either. Confused, you lifted your head. You saw the little girl that were crouching behind... you. You saw your own body across the room, being released from the ropes. You saw it lifting its head and looked straight at you, then smiled deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth of the situation sinked into your mind, and fell down to your new stomach. You felt sick, and you felt the contents of your stomach rising. Trying to lean to your left as far as possible to avoid hitting your legs, you poured half digested food and gastric juice to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, he made a mess of himself. How disgusting,\" your body said with your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he even pissed himself,\" added the girl with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to shouted back at them, but you felt really weak. Even glaring at them felt exhausting. The mental stress you felt was too great as you realized they had taken your body and swapped it with the man's body...</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">\"Hmmm... This is such a nice body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gleefully tried to walk and stretch in your new body. You had been inside several women's body before, but what you had learned from experience was that every body was different, and it need some time to get used to it. Unless of course, you did the special trick that you learned along with the body swapping magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what we have here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything else though, a little exploration was a must. You unclasped the lock on your breast plate and let it fell to the floor. A pair of large mounds were immediately on your sight, covered by a thin white blouse that barely lessen their lewdness. You groped at them slowly, feeling the soft but firm breasts with your new slender and feminine hands. Moans escaped your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... I can't wait to see whats underneath this shirt,\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let me feel them too,\" Jack said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous owner of your body shouted when he saw what you were doing with his former body. You and Jack just laughed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? This is my body now. I can do whatever I want with it,\" you playfully grabbed your breast again, just to irritate him some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! That is my body! Give it back, you bastards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, we will use your body for our fun now, so you can just keep dreaming on getting it back,\" Jack said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, from now on, I will be the lady knight, and you will be the man who is responsible for all the murders,\" you said before laughing evilly, followed by Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! There is no way you can impersonate me! One of my colleagues will see through you and figured out something was wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so sure... There is no way they can tell the difference once I do the other ritual,\" you told him in between your laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do we do it here? Now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Let's give former lady knight a show. Who knows, later he maybe interested to join,\" you answered Jack's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then... Please let me help you,\" she said with a naughty grin unfitting for a young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly unclasped the bottom part of the armor, the metallic skirt, but left the black fabric skirt underneath it on. You then ripped open the buttons on your blouse, exposing the magnificent breasts that were yours. It was one of the best you have ever seen (or have).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, we wouldn't have known that you have such magnificent breasts if you kept it hidden under the armor, lady,\" you said while massaging them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out!\" he was beginning to get frantic and tried to struggle loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Jack said. She was holding the small blade from earlier. You smiled, understood what he wanted, and lifted your skirt, showing a pair of white panties to the world. Jack inched closer to you, knife in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the question, Jack brought her face close and buried her nose on your panties-covered vagina. She then  proceeded to do several long sniff at your panties, making you whimpered at the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah, what an addicting smell... Too bad I have to do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was satisfied, Jack put the knife to use. With one swift cut on its side, the panties drop to the floor, exposing your vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now we can begin,\" Jack said while grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, let me sit down first,\" you said, before sitting down on an old barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you two want to do with my body, stop right now or I will make you pay ten times worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you ignored the warning and proceeded to do the next ritual. After the ritual to swap two people was successful, there was another ritual that could be done to gain the body's memories, knowledge and skill so that the swap was not visible to other people. And that ritual was your and Jack's favorite, because in order to do it, you would only have to cum once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focused on rubbing, massaging, twisting, pinching, groping and sucking your gorgeous breasts and its nipples. Meanwhile, Jack proceeded to sniff and lick your pussy and clit. In no time at all, you were already extremely wet while moaning nonstop. The shouts of disapproval and curses felt like background music in your ear. Jack began to use her hand to pleasure you, and soon you came. You squirted a long trail of cum for a woman, which amused Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, we got a squirter here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were basking in the afterglow, you felt new memories flooded into your head. Those are the memories of your new body, starting from her childhood up to the most recent one, nothing was left out. If she remembered it, you would now. Your bodies felt more and more familiar to you, and it didn't feel foreign anymore. In less than 30 seconds, you had completely become Claire Rayleigh, the captain of 9th division of Mallow Kingdom's guard. You smiled from satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now that you bastards have defiled my body thoroughly, give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old Claire, obviously, didn't realize that his life was just completely been stolen by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, former Claire Rayleigh, this is just the beginning,\" you said to her while smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... Do you know my name?\" he looked stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only your name, I now know everything about you, Claire. For in<br>\r\nexample, I know that despite your wonderful achievements, your father despise you for being an illegitimate child born from your mother's affair with a servant. Funny, you have been calling us 'bastard' a few times now while you were actually one yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, really?! Now that is funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jack both laughed out loud while former Claire looked shocked beyond help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Claire?\" you started to say after you had laughed enough, while walking toward him, \"it is not only your body. Now, your memories, knowledge, reputation and status...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing him to look at you, you said, stressing at each word, while smiling, \"<b>are all mine</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes showed horror and he quickly averted his gaze. It seemed that he finally felt despair. That just gave you, the new Claire, more satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we have taken care of everything else, what are we going to do to him?\" Jack asked you while toying with the small knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any doubt, you quickly answered her, \"now we have to...\"</div></span></div></div>",

Opening your eyes you looked up in shock to see that the entrance door had been destroyed. Out jumped a figure shrouded by a green hooded robe, rapidly dashing towards Jack in the little girls body. Jack turned around, turning his attention towards the figure as it drew a sword from its side, the hilt barely visible, as it was partially shrouded by the robe. You didn't know who this was exactly, but you were thankful that someone did show up to save you, whoever it was. Jack tried to get away from the hooded figure, but the little girls body was much to slow. Your savior slashed at Jack in a downward motion only for your old body to tackle Jack pushing him out of harms way narrowly. A risky move that had paid off. Wasting no time the figure took his sword cutting you free from the ropes with just a swing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" It asked in a distorted ethereal voice you couldn't really understand. Was this a male or a female who helped you, or was it something else entirely?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...they stole my body.\" You said pointing towards Daniel who had landed directly on top of Jack. \"Please, help me get it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Try to be more careful next time with the landing.\" Said Jack as Daniel pushed himself off of him. \"Yeah well I saved your life, and besides with this new body of mine I can't lose to this chump at all.\" And with that he began rushing towards your own sword. The hooded figure moved to intercept him but was unfortunately to late as you watched your own body pick up the sword and wield it. But, he wasn't just wielding the sword, no, he was wielding it with your exact same stance. This, this couldn't be happening. You looked towards the hooded figure, sure this person seemed strong, but your skill with a sword was incredible, and as much as you hated to admit it, you didn't think this person would be of any use. Tears started to well up in your eyes as you faced what was most likely a harsh truth. You would not be able to get your body back. Everything you had worked for, gone, stolen. And even with anger driving you, you felt too weak, to powerless to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning before you could tell the hooded figure to forget about it, that the whole thing was pointless, it had sprinted off towards your body as your own body did the same. Both swords clashed as a raging battle ensued. You were actually impressed though, the hooded figure was actually putting some pressure on your own body, so much so that it was practically an even battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to watch the battle from afar you could see Daniel was starting to get a little winded as he was breathing heavily, the hooded figure on the other hand seemed to have just as much energy as when the battle first commenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty strong.\" Said Daniel as he took a deeper breath. \"My friend Jack over there is going to love wearing that body of yours once I beat you up, if you even manage to stay alive that is.\" And with that Daniel started to hold his sword differently, as the green robed figure looked down at the blade eyeing it closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nN...no he wasn't actually going to try out your signature move was he? This is bad. \"Run out of the way, his next attack is too powerful.\" You yelled out. But it was too late. In a split second to hard for your newly adjusted eyes to follow and keep up with you watched as your sword pierced through the robe and into the body of the person inside it multiple times. You slumped to the ground defeated, there was no way anyone could have surviv-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distinct 'clack' sound was heard, one of someone jumping onto the floor with shoes. Behind your panting body was your savior, who had managed to slip entirely out of the robe and barely dodge the attack. The intensity of resolve they had on their face, was actually quite scary to behold. Not only were you happy that they had survived, but also a little bit frightened. No one should be capable of being that strong, just who the hell was this person? The figure's face lit up with a smile before charging back towards your body sword in hand. With the robe not obscuring them anymore you realized that the whole time they were a...</span></div></div>",

She had medium length white hair, the color of snow, her face was delicate, kind of ironic considering how strong she was. Again their swords clashed, only for a shimmering blue aura to appear around your savior's sword. In an instant your own sword was cut in half leaving Daniel in a state of panic as he didn't know what to do. He tried to run away only for the other girl to fire a beam of some type which quickly wrapped around him causing Daniel to fall down. He was completely trapped in an arcane energy of some sort. The girl motioned for you to go over to her which you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at your body as he looked away from you. \"Give me back my body.\" You said, rather pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, as if I'd give this up.\" He said, only for the other girl to place a hand on your old bodies head and emit a type of white light causing Daniel great pain until he eventually passed out. The girl then placed a palm on your head emitting the same light. You expected to feel pain, only instead you felt a type of soothing energy overtake you as you quickly fell asleep. You later woke back up in your own body on the floor. You quickly hugged yourself thankful to be back in your own body and looked up to see the white haired girl staring at the man who was now tied up like he rightfully should be. The pig!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly picked up various clothing he had strewn about on the floor earlier when he used the second ritual to gain your memories, personality, and talents and began putting them on walking over towards the man. The man looked at you looking rather nervous. \"Hey you're not mad are you?\" He asked, as you smiled before launching the most furious punch you had ever thrown in your life hitting him square in the chest a loud snap was heard, and you were almost certain you had broke this man's ribs.. \"I'll kill you.\" You said as you grabbed the broken blade of your sword prepared to kill him only for the girl to stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to ask this man some questions first, if you don't mind.\" You sighed dropping the broken blade on the ground. \"Very well, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman began to interrogate the man over something you couldn't hear before immediately killing him with a magic blast from her hand fired straight at his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman walked over towards you slowly. \"So, you don't suppose you know where the other guy is do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, realizing you were too busy focused on watching the battle to notice his escape. \"No, but if I could get my hands on him I'd kill him. Speaking of killing, what you did was amazing out there, where'd you learn to do that?\" Curiosity had gotten the better of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there a third person here earlier as well?\" Said the girl, ignoring your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Third person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired girl sighed. \"This isn't good, if I don't get my body back then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, your body was stolen too?\" you asked, shocked that such a thing had come to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, for starters I'm actually a guy, and I've been trying to hunt them down for about three days now just trying to get my body back with no luck whatsoever. That little fight right there was mere child's play compared to what I can do in my own body. This body barely even knows how to use magic after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer at the body he was inhabiting you did notice the hair was a little ragged and the clothes he was wearing was a little torn and smelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, help me regain my body again, the world is in peril otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Alright, I guess it can't be helped, and you did save my body so, we have a deal then. Oh and by the way my name is Claire Rayleigh. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is...\" A look of embarrassment creeped up on his face as he looked around nervously. \"Alex Lokn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the embarassment? I think that's a fine name.\" You told him truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Alex can be a girls name and...\" He blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but giggle at the femininity he was giving off. \"It can also be a boys name you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it's embarrassing to me, I mean everything about this body, it's just. Ugh, let's change the subject. Help me go after my body please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at him and responded with:</span></div></div>",

You both scan your surroundings and eventually see a figure, that of a little girl who appears to be running away. You both figure it's probably Jack and take off after him. While you both are considerably faster than him, he does have a head start which will make things tricky. You chase for a little while almost losing him as he takes off down different roads and alleyways, but eventually you get close enough to him that there's no way you can lose sight of him. If only you were a little faster. Jack continues to sprint away from you and enters a building screaming out \"They killed Daniel. They killed Daniel boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the building after Jack only to come face to face with a handsome man wearing lavish clothes, and you figure it must be Alex's original body. Jack hides behind his boss a little shaken, while the boss looks you both up and down. \"And what do I owe the pleasure of meeting you two pretty ladies?\" He smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the chit chat and give me back my body.\" Says Alex who seems incredibly annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you again? I'm surprised you made it this far in that girls body, she's not exactly the strongest you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic does wonders doesn't in?\" Alex says back. The tension in the air right now could be sliced with a knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Says the villain as he raises an eyebrow, turns around and picks up a sword, handing it to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take out the knight will you? I'll handle the other one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B...but boss. I don't know how to use a sword.\" Says Jack as he stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just swing it.\" He says as he pats Jack on the head a few times messing up his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back towards Alex the boss tells him his real name is William and that he intends to keep this new body, but will spare both of them if they leave right this instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's not going to happen.\" Says Alex, even more annoyed than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose if you want to do things the hard way I can't stop you, but remember I gave you a choice, and all things considered it's a pretty good deal. Believe me I know, the things I've felt in that body are amazin-\" Before he can finish his sentence Alex dashes at an insane speed boosted by his magic and punches William in the face, catching him off guard and sending him flying. William grits his teeth and looks back up as he flies backwards prepared to counter attack Alex only to see Alex is right above him. Alex fires a bolt of energy at William directly hitting him in the face, slamming him into the ground, and landing on top of him he proceeds to punch him with a barrage of energy coated fists hitting him all over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings seem to be going your way and you decide to help as you grip your sword and dash towards William yourself. Jack tries to stop you by swinging his sword only for you to deftly parry it and kick him out of the way with ease knocking him to the ground. Just as you're about to reach William though you hear a footstep coming from behind you, and spinning around you block a sword strike just in time from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? You could have sworn you had knocked him down, and there's no way he should have been able to reach you that quickly. Wait, looking into his eyes you see that they're alive and filled with energy. Jack begins swinging in a flurry and you begin parrying each and every one of the strikes as Jack only continues to increase his tempo. One stray attack actually manages to get through your defenses and shallowly cuts into your side, the only thing saving you was actually your armor. H...how can this be? When did Jack get so strong? Suddenly the image of William patting Jack's head comes to mind. Enhancement magic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this is all going on you hear a loud scream. \"ENOUGH!!!\" Yells William as Alex is knocked off of him. Alex lands on his feet elegantly but sees that William is not only pissed off, but also isn't as injured as he thought he'd be. \"You're not even that hurt.\" Asks Alex, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam's arm starts glowing as he fires off a barrage of powerful fire blasts at Alex. Alex tries dodging them but each attack still seems to graze him, before he finally gets hit directly and falls to the ground as the fire dissipates. William walks up to him and conjures a beam of energy which slowly cuts into Alex causing him immense pain, drawing blood. Alex starts screaming in agony as the sadistic William keeps torturing him. \"I can't be beaten. With this body I'm invincible.\" Laughs William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex.\" You yell out, as you lose focus on your own fight. Due to this you only partially block one of Jack's sword swings which cuts into you. You swing your own sword at Jack only for him to jump backwards and rush you once more swinging even more wildly. His swings are so unorganized it's hard for you to tell where he's going to strike next. This isn't how a real swordsman should fight at all, and you refused to lose knowing this. You parry one of his attacks deftly leaving him off balance for a moment. \"Let me show you how a real swordsman fights.\" You tell him as you slash at Jack cutting off one of his arms. He falls to the ground bleeding out. William sees this and instead of killing Alex right then and there instead he grabs Jack, pushing you back with a gust of wind and hops out through one of the windows leaving you in shock. You turn towards Alex and remembering his wounded rush to his aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be fine. I'm not going to let you die.\" You tell him as you rip off some of your clothes and tie it around his wound stopping him from bleeding out.</span></div></div>",

Opening your eyes you look around to find yourself in an unfamiliar room. You slowly sit upright and try to figure out where you are, only nothing comes to mind. Before you can get out of bed you hear someone fiddling with the door knob, before it ultimately bursts open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cl...Claire?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake are you? Lunch is just about ready, how are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your head a little before replying \"I'm alright, and how are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm just fine, now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go and get lunch. You stay here and I'll be back shortly.\" And with that Claire left you all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you were all alone you examined yourself and were shocked to see you really weren't in that bad of a condition. No, no, no, this isn't good at all. You should be much more injured than this. Sweat started to form and drip off of your body as you knew this could only mean one thing. You started playing back all the recent fights in your mind. All that magic you had used was starting to take its toll on this body. If you didn't use your magic sparingly for  a while your soul would slow the production of mana in an attempt to purify your body, this could last a few hours, to a few days or even permanently. You curse at yourself silently at how reckless you had been with your mana usage, but at the same time you knew you could not really have held back anything during those battles. To do so would most likely be death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this realization starts to hit in Claire arrives with two bowls of soup. She hands one to you and smiles. \"I hope you like this soup, it should make you feel a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force a smile and take the bowl of soup, eating a spoonful, all the while trying to calm yourself down so you don't alarm Claire. After you eat a bit more you decide to try to get your mind off of your condition and ask Claire about your location. She responds telling you you're actually at her house. Well not exactly her house, more a temporary home as she was just visiting this location for a while before heading back towards the main city to have a meeting with the princess with the other captains and higher ranking troops. You sighed realizing that Claire might actually leave you alone, and without any help you probably wouldn't find your body again. Wait a second. You stared at Claire intently as she ate her bowl of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire noticed your staring and looked up at you. \"Is something wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this even the real Claire? I blanked out after the battle, so maybe Jack took over her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle with your thoughts for a minute before ultimately deciding...</span></div></div>",

You will be safe there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sister knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou joined hands with Jack and went out of the building, leaving old Claire behind to be dealt with later.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****<br>\r\n(Claire's P.O.V.)</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">You still couldn't believe that all of this was real... Your life was stolen, and you were powerless to stop it. It was difficult to get away from this rope that bind you up, let alone taking your body back. You were always optimistic, always tried to find a way out of every trouble. But now you were not you. You were a man that you didn't even know the name (since it was clear to you that this might not be Daniel's real body), bound in an underground room, waiting your death sentence, while someone stole your life and got away with it. Unless somekind of a miracle happened, you are doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, that 'somekind of a miracle' happened. Not long after your captors left, someone entered the room. You heard the sounds of footsteps and lifted your head to see a woman in rather tattered clothes slowly walked towards you. You kept silent, cautiously assessed the situation. The woman seemed to mean no harm, as she looked at you with emphatic eyes. She then proceeded to release you from the rope. You stood up and starred at the woman. She was young and beautiful, and never stopped seeing you in grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...thank you for saving me,\" you finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept quiet and just nodded at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know I was here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed silent and only shook her head. She then pointed at her neck. Then, you finally saw a big scar on her throat and realized that she couldn't speak. In spite of that, you understood when she gestured for you to follow her. You nodded and together, you exited the basement.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****<br>\r\n(Daniel's P.O.V.)</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"Remember, this man is either very cunning and clever or plain crazy. He was good with words that I was almost fooled so I warned you to pay no heed to whatever he might say to you. Also, he seemed able to somewhat read your minds to know about you so once again, put a deaf ear to his words. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood in front of 4 members of Valkyrie who were not patroling. You told them before about what had happened, that you found the culprit of many murders in the city, that you saved a little girl from almost became another victim, and that you managed to tie him up in an abandoned building to go back here and find help. Jack was there in the room with you, sitting on a chair, seeming amused at your performance in front of Claire's (now your) subordinates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sera, I want you to stay here with the girl to keep her safe and to tell other members that might returned about what happened\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSera jolted when she heard her name being mentioned. From what you could gathered from Claire's memories, Sera was the newest and youngest member of the Valkyrie. She was freshly graduated from the military school last month with exceptional results, said to be comparable to Claire's. Their personality, however, was very different. Sera was too shy and timid to be a leader figure. But that's exactly why, Sera admired Claire as someone whom she could look up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, captain Claire!\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her. Sera was cute and innocent looking, not to mention very smart. Your mind was thinking of how useful Sera would be, if Jack was inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lets go. Just pray I still remember the way,\" you said while mounting your horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was you came there countless time, but it was Claire's second time so you would need to fool them and take one or two wrong turns later. One of your subordinate rode another horse while the other two rode a cart pulled by two horses. In haste, you left to retrieve your former body, leaving Sera alone with Jack.</div></span></div></div>",

He successfully persuaded her to accompany him by saying he didn't want to be alone. Sera obliged and, after taking off her armor, laid on the small bed meant for one person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the others? I didn't see them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were out patrolling in the city. Maybe all of them will not be back until sun rise,\" Sera said while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was timid around adults, Sera felt comfortable around children. She had little sisters who she had been taken care off for years since their parent's death back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Why don't you go patrolling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have just returned when you came here... In fact, I was close to fell asleep on my bed *chuckle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you must be tired. Why don't you go to sleep? But here with me, of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, close your eyes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay... There, I close them...\" Sera said while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSera felt something sharp pricked her neck, directly on her vein. She only had time to reach out with her hand and look sideways to see Jack who was smiling, before losing consciousness. Jack's smile turned into a grin, then a full-blown laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that was too easy...\" he said after enough laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack used the same sleeping poison that Daniel used for Claire before. It was a special poison, very potent, but didn't last long. Sera would have waken up in less than 30 minutes or even less. Most would consider it as a not very good sleeping poison for its short duration time, but it was very useful for their, Jack&amp;Daniel's identity theft agenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sat up and brought out Claire's hidden blade which he had been hiding this whole time. Grabbing Sera's left hand, he lightly jabbed her palm, just enough to draw blood. He then did the same to his right palm. Sera kept sleeping, unaware of everything. Jack then proceeded to put the knife on a table beside the bed and pulled out another needle. This one was coated with sleeping poison which was opposite of the other, a slow-acting but long-lasting sleeping poison. He then used it on himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the preparation was finished, Jack laid down again. Interlocking his right hand with Sera's left hand, Jack attempted the other version of body swapping spell, by using direct blood exchange. Jack started chanting as he felt the sleeping poison started to kick in. He finished chanting in time, their joined hand glowed for a couple of seconds, as Jack lost to the poison effect.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"Captain, are you sure this is the right building?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were back with your subordinates in that basement, but your prize was nowhere to be seen. You had purposefully \"got lost\" before, so your subordinates' uncertainty on your memory right now was understandable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive... Look, there is the rope that I used to tie him up,\" you said, pointing at the old rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked towards and inspected it, \"it is not broken... Someone must have released him after I left\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who did it, Captain?\" another one of them asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne person came into your mind. But Claire wasn't supposed to know her, so you kept it to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no, I should have checked more thoroughly whether he had an accomplice around or not\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now, captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought that Jack needed more time to do his job, so you need to waste some more time here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spread out and check nearby buildings. Maybe we can at least get somekind of clue of their whereabouts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, captain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your subordinates left, you looked at the rope in your hand. If you were right about who saved her, you knew exactly where old Claire might be. You would have to visit them without your subordinates later. You just hope that at least Jack succeeded.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">Sera slowly opened her eyes. Blinking a few times, she then sat up on the bed. Looking on her left, she saw the little girl sleeping peacefully, still holding her hand. Sera smiled and carefully untangled their hands. She slowly got off the bed and walked toward a nearby mirror. She smiled at her own reflection. However, Sera's usual innocent smile was not apparent, but there was a naughty smile instead as Jack had successfully acquired Sera's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is trully a jackpot...\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to make sure, Jack checked the base. No one was back yet, so he proceeded to step two, which was the real identity theft process. Jack quickly undressed himself. At 20, Sera's body was at the peak of it's developing phase. Her breasts were significantly smaller than Claire's but they were still soft and more firm to touch. Her cute innocent face, which was twisted into devious smile only aroused Jack even more. He then wasted no time to pleasure himself.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">Sera's memories flowed into Jack's mind naturally as with her mannerism and preferences. Her timidness could be overpowered by Jack's will easily, but it would be easy to fake it too. Jack had essentially became Sera now, just like Daniel who became Claire. While looking at the mirror, Jack slowly dressed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, for the grand finale,\" he said with Sera's soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walkes back toward's the sleeping now-little-girl Sera. A very uncharacteristically sadistic smile appeared on Sera's face. Grabbing a pillow, Jack held Sera down by pressing his left hand on her chest. Then, he pressed the pillow onto Sera's face. Soon, Sera woke up from trouble breathing and started trashing about, but her efforts were futile. Her now small figure didn't stand a chance against her old body's strength. In less then a minute, the trashing gradually ceased and finally stopped completely. Jack removed the pillow, exposing the fear and hurt stricken face underneath, with both eyes and mouth opened widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... I really wanted to slit your throat, but they would be suspicious of me that way...\" Jack lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed Sera's eyes and mouth, positioned her arms and legs to normal, and put a blanket up to her neck. Unless someone paid attention enough, that she was not breathing at all, it would appear that she was sleeping peacefully. Jack smiled again and then kissed her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice dream, little girl,\" he whispered.</div></span></div></div>",

Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were back in the morning with no result, Claire and the other 3 were soon greeted by Sera who were grovelling on the floor repeatedly apologizing to her captain. The other members, who were also just returned from night patrol before Claire, could only  give a sympathetic look at her. Claire was silent as first, letting Sera calmed down first. When there was no indication of her going to stop apologizing soon, she finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is enough, Sera... Stand up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSera stopped when her captain spoke her name and slowly stood up. Her face was a mess and tears were running down her cheek. Claire gave no apparent reaction to that, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I presume something happened to the girl?\" she softly asked instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\" Sera stammered, \"I put her to bed after you went away last night. After that, I accompanied her until she fell asleep and then I go back to the lobby to guard. B-but... When I checked on her this morning, she wasn't breathing! I am very sorry, captain! This is my fault for not looking after her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire gestured with her hand to make Sera stop before she start kneeling again. With unfazed expression fitting for a though leader, Claire gave her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The murderer that I thought was already in our hands managed to escape. For this, I apologize to all of you. We might have to extend our stay here, but I will discuss this matter with the others in the headquarter, and also all of you here. But for now, I want all of you to have breakfast and some sleep. Be ready by noon. We will then try to find that murderer based on my memory of his face. Luna, you will help me make a sketch of it later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman mentioned just nodded her head. Claire nodded back in return before continued her order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, we will try to find someone who know the girl. If no one was found, we buried her by sunset. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes captain!\" everyone said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. That is all. Dismissed. Sera, come to my room. I need to have a talk with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eek... I-I mean, yes captain,\" Sera shrieked before correcting herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was once again unfazed by that and retreated to her private quarter, a privilege for her only that her subordinates insisted to have in their temporary base. Several members patted Sera's shoulder in sympathy before went away to have some food. Sera slowly walked to Claire's room. Knocking her door, she opened it and quickly closed it after entering, then proceeded to lock it. Inside, Claire was removing her armor. She then gestured Sera to come closer. Sera obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sera was close enough, Claire moved towards her and gave Sera a hug. Claire then quickly kissed her, which made Sera surprised at first, but quickly returned it. Parting their lips, they smiled at each other. Claire traced the tear stains on Sera's cheek with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did quite some impressive fake apology back there...\" Claire said while licking the tears off her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you... It is not difficult once I immersed myself in her mannerism. I am such a crybaby,\" Sera said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you are a brilliant and cute crybaby, so I don't mind,\" Claire said before kissing Sera's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Thank you, captain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I wish I was as successful as you did. Claire got away, but I don't think she did it by herself. I think our last victim helped her,\" Daniel complained to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you tell the other members?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did tell them someone might help her, but didn't mention who. That would raise suspicion. I believe we have to visit 'that house' again this afternoon, just the two of us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now go get my breakfast,\" Daniel said while smiling at his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack frowned at first, but finally relented, \"*sigh* Yes, captain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went out of the room and shortly back with two plates, full with freshly baked bread, several slabs of roasted meat, and a cup of hot milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might as well eat here,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel just smiled at him. Together they gobbled down their meal.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">Claire suddenly woke up from her sleep. She just had a very bad nightmare, that someone had stolen her life. But then she looked down on herself and realized that it wasn't a nightmare, that it was real. Her life was stolen and she would be on her way to death sentence if her saviour didn't come last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire recalled her conversation with her last night. It was quite difficult since she had to write everything down to communicate with Claire. It turned out that she was actually a he, another victim of those duo body-swapping murderers. In fact, the body that Claire was wearing right now used to be his body, the body that he was wearing now used to be his wife's, and the little girl's used to be his daughter's. Jack &amp; Daniel stole his family's body, played 'house' with him for a couple of days by acting completely normal, then toyed with him by telling him the harsh truth, before Daniel in his wife's body swapped with him and Jack slitted his throat. Fortunately, a healer happened to pass by after Jack &amp; Daniel left him to die and managed to make him survive. He lost his voice (or what used to be her wife's voice), but he was at least alive, the first victim that Claire knew wasn't dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe healer kindly treated him for a few days without asking for anything in return. When he returned to his house, he met Jack &amp; Daniel living his and his daughter's life like nothing happened. They were surprised and furious of him at first, but then laughed and only verbally abused him when they figured out he couldn't speak anymore. After that, they even let him stay in the house with them. Having nowhere else to go, he did just that. But everyday was mental torture for him. Jack &amp; Daniel pretended like they were really the man and daughter of the household, and he was the woman. Daniel asked for sex every night, violently raping him for the first couple times, but he didn't care anymore on the third and so on, letting Daniel did as he pleased. From these sexual intercourse, he acquired his wife's memory, so Claire figured out that the memory acquisition procedure would also be effective for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire realized that she hadn't know his name yet in the middle of his explanation, so she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew,\" he quickly wrote, \"my wife's was Anna and my daughter's was Vio\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor someone who lived in the slum, Anna was smart as only few people knew how to read and write in there. Matthew himself wasn't able to read, so if he didn't acquire Anna's memory, he would be completely unable to communicate with people. That healer who helped him before Matthew got her wife's memory also unable to understand him, making the fact that he was a living victim unknown to public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew endured the torture for days until Jack and Daniel announced to him that they would like to find new bodies since they were bored with his family's life. A spark of hope lit up in his heart as Matthew asked them what would they do with their old body. The hope was blown away quickly. Laughing, they said it would be dead along with their new victim, and that Matthew would be all alone, still being his mute wife. Matthew cried, not for his miserable condition, but because he would be unable to stop them. Nobody would believe him even if he told everyone the truth, and his wife's body was weak and powerless to prevent anything. He vowed inside that he would at least try to save their victims from death, like his life whom were saved by that healer, for the sake of his deceased wife and daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shed a tear reading Matthew's writing. If everything that he wrote was true, then Matthew was a very strong willed and kind hearted person. She hugged him for minutes, and they cried together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew let Claire spent the rest of the night in his house, but suggested she left in the morning, as those two might come there to look for her. Claire agreed and proceeded to go to sleep. Now it was morning, so she got off the bed and walked towards the living room. There, she found a piece of hard bread, a cup of water, and a note on the top of a table. Claire picked up the note and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat this and be on your way. I am out looking for work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bread was too hard to chew, so Claire dipped it into the water before biting on it. Such was not an uncommon food for the people in the slum. A lot of people couldn't eat anything for days, even. Though it was very far from delicious and very different with the food that she was used to eat, Claire understood the condition and was extremely grateful for the food.</div></span></div></div>",

She saw her captain writing something while sitting in front of her desk, which directly facing the door. Luna came closer and placed a piece of paper on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this good enough, Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked up and see the finished sketch of the murderer. Claire had given Luna the description before while she drew a rough sketch, and now it was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid work... This is absolutely sufficient... Copy it and prepare to spread it in the city...\" Claire said, smiling at her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Captain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I wish you stop calling me 'Captain' all the time and get back to call my name like you used to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna Solaris was Claire's best friend in military school. She was a few years older than most student on her class and came from a low class noble family, so nobody really befriended her, except Claire who paid no attention to their differences. Soon they became best friend and when Luna finally graduated a couple of years after the fast graduating Claire, she enrolled to Valkyrie, following Claire. A year later, when Claire became a captain, she appointed Luna as her secretary, essentially second vice-captain, third highest rank in the entire division. Luna was not very good with weapon, but she was a brilliant thinker, a great artist, and a calm &amp; dignified adult  woman, so she fit well to her new position.  The vice-captain didn't like her much though, since it was the first time in 9th division that they had 2 vice-captains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are on duty, Claire... You are my captain, and I'll call and treat you as such,\" Luna flatly said while fixing her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do as you wish, then... What about the other thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all agree to leave the decision to you...\" Luna answered, regarding whether the 13 members of Valkyrie should stay longer or not in this city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... We already got the face sketch of the murderer, so I think local guards can handle the rest now... Tell them we will leave as scheduled, two days from now. We should still help searching until then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand... Are you writing a report, Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I should report my failure to her...\" Claire said, referring to her vice-captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame yourself or you would end up like Sera this morning. Speaking of her, I haven't seen Sera for a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave her a task as a punishment. She forced me to give one to her,\" Claire said without looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Well, that is all, Captain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... Copy the sketch and spread it with the others. Do not wait for me. I have to deal with another problem by myself. Sera will come help me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Captain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dismissed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna walked out of the room and closed the door. As soon as she was out, Claire stopped writing her report and smirked. She put down her pen and laid back on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, 'Sera'... Finish your 'task' already,\" Daniel said, his smirk got wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Luna had moved next to or behind Claire just now, she would realize that Claire didn't wear any piece of clothing down there. No skirt, no underwear. And she would be shocked to see Sera who was kneeling under the desk, licking on Claire's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Captain, but I am savoring the taste...\" Jack looked up at Daniel with apologetic eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quick, we need to deal with that woman soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack got serious, and Daniel moaned and whimpered from pleasure. Soon he squirted Claire's juices all over Jack's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the meal,\" Jack said, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let us go to that house now, after I finished this bloody report\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, before we go there, I have an idea...\" Jack said while smiling.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">Staying in the city was suicide, Claire concluded. The bastard who stole her body would give her new identity out to the other Valkyrie and the local guards. Soon they would be all over her if she stuck around. There must be someone out there who could help her, so for now she had to escape. That's why Claire had been trying to get out of the city since morning. However, every way out was heavily guarded. It seemed like they wanted to keep everyone in the city. Claire saw several crowds in different exits angrily shouting at the guards for holding them in. If she wanted to get out, she would have to use some illegal methods. And nobody knows illegal methods better than people of the slums, who mostly came illegally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire wandered back to the slum. It was actually stupid when she thought it would be easy to ask people for illegal way out. Nobody would answer that kind of question willingly, unless there was something in it for them. But Claire had nothing right now, so it would be quite an impossible task. When Claire was wandering aimlessly in the slum, though,  a hand suddenly grabbed her collar and pulled her into a narrow and dark alley. Before Claire could protest, she felt a cold, metallic object pressed on her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a surprising thing to ask to someone who you had just grabbed and threatened, so Claire could only stared dumbfounded. The hooded figure grew impatient, pressing the sword a little harder, and repeated the question. Claire figured out that it was a female from her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name...\" Claire decided to answer, \"...is Matthew\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Matthew is your current body, am I right? My question is, who is the inhabitant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... How do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer me first!\" Anymore pressure and Claire's throat would be bleeding for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am... Claire, Claire Rayleigh. Captain of Valkyrie, 9th division of Mallow Kingdom guard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you in this man's body?\" she demanded more answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A murderer I was looking for in this city stole my body, and I was left with this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence followed. The pressure on Claire's neck didn't lessen one bit. She started praying to the gods that this woman believed her. Several seconds later, she let Claire go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You believed me?\" Claire said while caressing her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you speak the truth,\" the woman answered while sheathing her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know I didn't lie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you lied, I would know,\" she said as if it was a fact, a fact which Claire wasn't eager to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Alex Lokn. You could say I am in the same position as you are right now. My body was stolen by someone and now I am looking for it before it causes a lot of destruction and chaos\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex removed her green hood and revealed a young woman with bright golden eyes. Her hair was as white as the snow, and looked very smooth to touch. Claire was actually taken a back by how beautiful she was, feeling a little jealous... And horny from all those male testosterone in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex is damn lucky to have that kind of 'leftover' body,\" Claire thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know the name of the one who stole your body?\" Alex seemed to be oblivious to Claire's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uhh... He called himself Daniel and he has a friend called Jack. Do you know them?\" Claire said after she snapped back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No, must have been a different person. But they might lead me to my objective, so let's go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go? Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To your old body, of course. You must help me if you want your old life back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean you can reverse it?!\" Claire got excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but only if I at least know where my body is. So come on, we help each other\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mind helping you, but going to my real body right now would lead to my, and possibly your death. They must be looking after me, the whole guards of this city, for murders that I didn't do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Do you have any suggestion then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is this person, Matthew, who helped me. He was the real owner of this body. He might know more about them if you asked him. We can come up with a plan after that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Alright, then... Show me the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Claire walked back towards Matthew's house, hoping he had returned home already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jack &amp; Daniel...</div></span></div></div>",

Daniel nodded at Jack and the latter walked away toward the base's dungeon underground, used mainly for prison. Daniel followed the guard until they reach a hall. The guard turned back on him, gesturing for Daniel to wait, before walking even deeper into the base. A minute later, he came back, saluted at Daniel, and returned to his post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel didn't have to wait long for the captain of the local guards, leader of this base, to show up. A thin man appeared in casual clothes, blue shirt and black trousers, in contrast to Daniel's (actually Claire's) white-gold armor. He saluted at Daniel while smiling, and Daniel replied it with straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As serious as ever, Claire...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are as goofy as always, Keith\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith, the captain of the 4th division guard \"Hellhounds,\" chuckled at Daniel's retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't live seriously in this joke of a city... This is my way of maintaining my sanity\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4th division guard was in charge of maintaining the peace of Falion city, which was famous for its slum, hence the nickname was born. Since the serial murders began, the other crimes were somewhat decreased in number, but usually there were countless occurrences everyday. It was, doubtlessly, a heavy burden to be in charge of Falion city, where crimes ran rampant and \"high class citizens\" sent their complaints daily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to your 'serious'...\" Keith stressed on that word, \"...effort, though, we got a sketch of that murderer, Claire. Your subordinate just came by earlier to give us that. Goofy old me couldn't do it myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I failed to capture him. I am ashamed of myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, you have done well... Well... Why are you here again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am here for a completely unrelated matter. I have a private request. Shall you refuse, would you promise to never speak of it to anyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come to my workroom, then. We will have more privacy there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith lead Daniel to his room. Once the door was locked, Keith gestured Claire to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you have two criminals named Bud and Mary, locked up in your prison?\" Daniel started to show his intention for coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that spineless slave trader guy and mediocre assassin woman we managed to capture and throw to jail? Yeah, we still have them rotting down there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would their punishment be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death sentence. The judge already sent the papers to the Mayor, and he agreed to it, seeing the man kidnapped his daughter and the woman tried to murder him. So in a few days, they would be dead. But it will be done in secret. We don't need public hanging in this miserable city, unlike in the capital... Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Have a personal grudge with them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is against the law, but... I would like to deal with them myself, my way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... That's doesn't sound like you at all... What did they do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't tell you... Not now, at least...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Why don't you ask for this when you first came to this city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only just received this information a few days ago. Besides, I was on a mission. And I am ashamed to say this but, I was thinking that I deserve a reward after I catch the murderer, and they are the reward\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't caught the murderer, though, you only gave us his sketch,\" Keith teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, which make it more embarrassing to ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith was deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...suppose I agree to this, and I helped you get away with it, what would happen to them? Also, whats in it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would be dead, just like their sentence. But in our hands, not yours. And... Consider this as a personal favor and I owe you one. You could ask me for anything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Well, Claire, you know the one thing I always wanted to do with you, but you always refused with the same reason over and over again...\" Keith was smirking at Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel knew what he wanted from Claire's memory. That pervert wanted to be with Claire, to have some sexy time with her since a long time ago. But as he said, Claire always strongly refused with the same reason. Keith was a handsome guy, and if you put the perverted part out of him, he was a good and kind-hearted man. Claire would not mind to be with him if only that one reason didn't exist. But now it was not Claire that was inside, and Daniel didn't mind that one reason too much. Daniel smiled in secret, but put on a dejected face at Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. I will do as you say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith looked shocked. He was actually half-joking when he said that, so he couldn't believe Claire agreed to it. His shocked face soon changed to a cheerful expression, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Whoa, those two must have done something really bad... Alright, I will help you. I will say that they died early by being tortured by my men. The mayor would be upset that he couldn't see them dead, but I believe in the end he would be happy to know they died miserably rather than swift death at an execution\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I really appreciate your help. My colleague is already down there at the dungeon, escorting them out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, you were so sure I would help you... Well, it doesn't matter... Just remember your promise, that they would be dead and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel cut him short, \"I know, I will keep my promise. Thank you again and good day to you... Brother\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith Rayleigh, the first child of Rayleigh family, Claire's half brother, smiled as Daniel exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day to you too, sister\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"I'm sorry that I couldn't help much\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex read Matthew's writing before smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay... You have given me much info...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is still unknown whether they have connection with the one that stole your body or not, huh?\" Claire piped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... But we can figure it out when we got them later. Do you have any idea?\" Alex asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe, the best way is when he, my old body, is alone. But there is always people at the base, and we are supposed to get back to the capital in a few days, so we don't have much time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What do you suggest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we do exactly the same way they managed to got me. That is, when I was out patrolling in the city. That of course, if they resumed their patrolling in the night and I was alone again like before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan, I like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew quickly wrote on the paper as if he just remembered something. He then gave it to Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'They have spread your picture all over the city, be careful not to be seen'... Well damn, I knew this is coming\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, you'll need this more than I do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex threw his green robe at Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you even wear it in the first place?\" Claire asked while putting it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I am a male! Well, 'was' a male... I still feel uncomfortable being a woman like this, so I don't want to be seen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are lucky you ended up in a young and beautiful woman body, unlike me... No offense, Matthew\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew just nodded while Alex blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those kind of compliments are the reason I wear that robe...\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't stay here... Take care of yourself, Matthew,\" Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex approached him and gave him a small pouch of gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Matthew. You will need this more than I do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew silently thanked them both as Claire and Alex walked away.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"So she was not lying, then? When this girl told us that she was actually Jack and you were Daniel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud asked the captain of Valkyrie in front of him, with a disbelieved look on his face. He, Marry, and the two knights were inside a safe house belonged to Bud in case something went wrong. Well, it was actually just an unused building in the middle of the slum and Bud never got the chance to use it before he got caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we need to do to make you believe us?\" Daniel asked him while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...show me your body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Bud? That's all you could think of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you are really Daniel, you should know that's the ONLY thing that I think about, all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sighed, and proceeded to open his armor. With one swift movement, he pulled off his clothes, making his breast out for everyone around to see. Next he lifted his skirt, showing the uncovered pussy since he didn't wear any panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy?\" Daniel asked in monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uwoooh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud shouted in delight. His hand reached forward to touch Daniel, but Daniel slapped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing is free, touching is not,\" he said while smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud looked dejected but seemed believed him now. His eyed gleamed in excitement. Daniel always knew he had one track mind, but didn't realise he was this bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do to us?\" the silent Mary suddenly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the first thing that you asked? Not how we could be like this?\" Jack asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not my concern right now, but my well being is. We were about to get executed, so I hope you have better plan for us,\" she calmly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes we do... We do have better plans than letting you die...\"<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

He is practically our boss now,\" Jack answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel continued, \"there are three ways to do it, but William only taught us two of them as he said only an expert in magic can do the third method. We will teach you two, and then we can go with the plan I mentioned, giving you two new life to start over. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll do it. If your plan work, I'll be the happiest man in this city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... What about you, Mary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at my face and you should know my answer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't talking about facial expression. Right half of Mary's face was covered in burn wound and there was a huge scar on her left. Her once beautiful face was no more. Also, if one opened her clothes, you could see countless whip scars all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have been wanting to ask that... What happened? We only heard you two got captured last week,\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary stayed silent, so Bud answered, \"That'd be me. Mary was caught 3 weeks ago. I kidnapped mayor's daughter, asking for ransom. I thought everything went well, but they almost got me during the exchange. Mary showed up and tried to murder the mayor in the middle of chaos, making me able to escape, but she failed and got captured instead. I thought Mary rat me out, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never rat you out...\" Mary suddenly hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud stopped talking, looked at Mary with apologetic eyes, and said, \"I know that when I saw you in the prison. It turned out to be one of my men. I am sorry I ever doubted you, Mary. And I owe you, big time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I did that for you. I just hate that stinky rich mayor, that's all... What's done is done...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mary... I know you must be wanting to have a revenge on everyone who did this to you, but we can't continue with our plan if you want to do that. If you want us to help you get a new life, you will have to forget about revenge...\" Daniel told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I guess I can live without revenge. As long as I am not staying or going in this city anymore,\" Mary said, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! It is time to practice, then... So Bud, it is time to stop playing with my boobs,\" Daniel said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat!\" Claire cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were strolling in the city, trying not to draw any attention, when someone stopped them from behind. The street was empty though, as they were deep in mostly unused part of the slum, so Claire wondered who could have stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen this man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Claire whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna handed a piece of paper to Alex, a sketch of Matthew's face on it. Alex looked at it, played it cool, and handed it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once or twice, I guess...\" he calmly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where and when did you see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around the slum, walking on the street. Can't remember exactly where or when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Please tell one of the guards when you see him again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Alex turned around and walked away. Claire was relieved that she managed to escape, but it was short lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were tempted to just run for it, but they have no save place to run to, so they stopped and turned back instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else we can help you with?\" Alex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, open your hood\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire hesitated, so Luna repeated her order in even more stern voice while reaching for the hilt of her sword. Claire had no option but to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it!\" Luna said, drawing her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex wanted to draw his sword too, but Claire stopped him, saying, \"Luna, you need to hear me out first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked baffled, asking, \"how do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire proceeded to tell her the truth. Every single one. But Luna, her smart best friend, seemed skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you expect me to believe all this?\" she said, sword still rose high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can proof it to you! I can tell you the things only you and I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna drew a deep breath and exhaled slowly. Then, staring sharply at Claire, she told Claire, \"too bad for you, Claire has told us all about your ability to read minds. You would just read my mind to know all of these thing. I'm taking you to our headquarter, one way or another... 'Claire'\" a mocking tone on the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Luna... You have to believe me...\" Claire looked heart broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Alex mumbled something. Once he finished, his right arm threw a spell right at Luna's face. The latter rose her left hand to defend, but she was too late. The spell hit her squarely on Luna's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! What did you do to my friend?!\" Claire shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Claire, it is just sleeping spell. She is not hurt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Luna, unable to fight the spell, fell to the ground. In her last moment, Luna saw the murderer approached her with a saddened expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Luna\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all Luna could hear before she lost her consciousness.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"Ugh... My head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna finally woke up about an hour after she drifted to sleep. She was not on the same place she lost consciousness, though. She was inside a house, laying down on a battered sofa. Luna checked herself, confirming everything was in place. Looking around, it appeared that no one was inside. Not tied to anything or such, Luna cautiously walked out of the house. Once she was sure she was safe, Luna ran towards the headquarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA member of Valkyrie was standing outside as she saw Luna ran from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, where have you been, Luna? Captain is looking for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for breath, Luna asked, \"Where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In her room. She said she has someone for you to meet. She came in with someone in a green robe. I couldn't see his or her face, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mentioning of green robe stung Luna's heart, remembering her encounter with the murderer who was dressed in green robe. She quickly dashed in toward Claire's room. She almost bursted in, but stopped at the last moment, and knocked on the door instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Luna heard Claire's voice, telling her to come in. Luna quickly opened the door and saw Claire, Sera and someone in green robe inside. Instantly she felt relieved, as the robe was different than the one the murderer wore earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna, what happened? You are drenched in sweat...\" Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, I have met him. I saw him in the city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The murderer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Sera looked shocked and starred at each other. Luna saw Claire nodded at Sera before saying, \"sit down and explain yourself. Sera, get a glass of water for Luna\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luna sat down in front of Claire, Sera went out of the room. She began to explain her encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he said he and I swapped bodies?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and he said he could proof it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By telling things that only you and I know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna heard the click on the door, it was locked by Sera who was just back with a glass of water. Sera offered the water to Luna and she drained it in one shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? Do you believe him?\" Claire asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luna put down the glass, she answered, \"no, you told us he could read our minds. I would not buy his lies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... That's a good move, what happened then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had an accomplice. She threw a spell on me and I fell unconscious. I woke up in an abandoned house. When I woke up, they were nowhere to be seen, so I came back here as fast as I could. Captain, I have a question... Why do you think they let me go unscathed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...There is one simple explanation to that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Daniel softly said, \"because Claire didn't want to hurt her best friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luna started to say that, Jack put his right arm around her neck from behind, lightly strangling her, while his left hand covered Luna's mouth. Luna immediately tried to struggle lose, but suddenly she felt very weak and sleepy, as the water she just drank was spiked with sleeping poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way Claire would hurt you. I know because I have her memories and mannerism, now,\" Daniel told Luna while smiling deviously, \"well, I won't hesitate to hurt you, though. But not after my friend here have stolen your life. Then we will dispose of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna started to lose consciousness. In her last moment, she regretted her decision not to trust Claire back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is not as beautiful as I used to be, but I guess she will do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary commented as she inspected Luna closely. Jack already laid down the unconscious Luna on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her strength is in her mind, not in beauty. She is brilliant, and I guess that would go well with you,\" Daniel told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, alright... How long should we wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For about 10 minutes... Then we will inject you with the poison as you started the process...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let me rehearse the spell as we wait...\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">The deed was done, and it would only take minutes for Luna's body to wake up. Jack and Daniel waited nervously, as they didn't know whether Mary did the spell correctly or not. There was a bright flash as usual, but that wasn't a very good indicator, as William once said. Suddenly, Luna started to wake up. She sat up, and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me your name,\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's body answered...</div></span></div></div>",

Claire and Sera brought out a litter with a woman on it, her face covered with a piece of cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move out, she need to see a healer!\" Claire shouted to any knight who saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside they put the woman on a carriage, and Sera took away. Claire went back inside, approached by her subordinates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She suddenly collapsed. I don't know what happened...\" Claire explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First the little girl, now that woman...\" someone mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this place is cursed,\" whispered another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if one of us is next?\" said the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Claire half-shouted at them.

Either way, we are out of here in two days, so bear with it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire said before walking inside her room. As she went in, the whispers continued, which made Claire smiled as she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is cursed, they said... How hilarious...\" Daniel said to Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it would distract them... So, what about Bud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like we discussed in the safe house, we will give Bud his new life tonight. But not until I finished some business first. You can just stay here and get used to your new life... Luna\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will do just that, Claire...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel went back outside, being starred at by his subordinates, rode on his horse, and took off to see Matthew.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"Come on now, we both know it was you who helped her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was interrogating Matthew on sword point, the latter seemed scared for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Speak! Where is she?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew just stayed silent. Not because he was being secretive or stubborn or brave, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh right, you can't speak. My bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel lowered his sword, smacked his forehead, and let Matthew scrambled to find paper and pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'I did help her,' well now being honest is not bad, is it? 'But I don't know where she is now,' damn now you are being useless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel lifted his sword once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you help her? You didn't know her, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew wrote, \"to ruin your plans\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, very revengeful, I see... Well, it doesn't matter, I will still prevail in the end... One more question, you don't happen to know magic spells now, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures... Well Matthew, I won't kill you since as we agreed on, you'll live. But I still need to punish you for daring to go against me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two quick accurate slashes, Daniel cut Matthew's legs on specific area. Matthew fell to the floor. The wounds would make her unable to walk. It wouldn't be permanent but it would still take time to heal properly. Satisfied, he went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just who was her accomplice now?\" Daniel muttered to himself as he mounted his horse, referring to the one who made Luna unconscious earlier.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"It was a young woman. Damn, she is beautiful... I wish I got her body instead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them were back at Claire's room. Mary was digging through Luna's memories about her meeting with Claire and her mysterious friend, as Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus, Mary... We need to know who she is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Daniel... Hmm... She has fair skin and medium length white hair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"White hair? You sure it is not an old woman?\" Jack asked snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, not that kind of white... They looked so... Exotic. Like I said, I hope I got her body instead... It would worth the trouble...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the magic spell?\" Daniel inquired further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She appeared to be mumbling something, then bam, she extended her hand and something hit me... Well, hit Luna in the face. I didn't remember pain, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it must be a sleeping spell...\" Daniel mused, \"...it could be the woman that boss, William, said we need to be wary of\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would make sense... Boss said she was able to use magic, right? And why would she help Claire if not for getting to us?\" Jack added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be bad... I better inform William about this...\" Daniel proceeded to write a letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he now?\" Mary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a small village, not very far from here. He practically made the entire village his, controlling every residents. And it was not through beating the shit out of them, but merely controlling their minds. You should see how amazed and terrified me and Daniel were when boss showed us his power,\" Jack informed her, \"for old time sake, he said, he would share some of his power to us, as long as we promised to follow his orders... Me and Daniel didn't have much choice, really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel finished writing. He then proceeded to summon a bird familiar using magic. He tied the letter to the bird and sent it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat. What else can you conjure?\" Mary looked impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only that... And that needs months of practice...\" Daniel smiled bitterly, \"we need to continue. Let's pick Bud up, Jack. You can just stay here and command the girls to do patrol as usual, Mary\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Captain,\" Jack and Mary said in unison, smiling.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"There they are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Alex just started scouting Valkyrie's base after sunset, as they didn't want the risk of being seen. They were just there for a few minutes when they saw who appeared to be Claire and Sera got on a carriage and prepared to take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is with Sera...\" Claire muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's eyes glowed bright gold for a moment, before returning to its normal color, \"I'm sorry to say this Claire, but she is not your friend anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not Sera too...\" Claire wept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What should we do? I'm not 100% sure I can defeat both of them at once, though I sure could try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...let's just follow them for now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do.

It was still breathing, very much alive. Meaning Luna, the one who was inside it, was alive as well, albeit unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? What happened to our previous plan to dispose of her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Jack just smiled sheepishly at Daniel's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked him. You know that I always loved Mary, right? But she never seemed to response to my advances, you know... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, Bud? That's not Mary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'll just pretend that this is Mary. I don't care if her face is burned or what, I still love her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say you are obsessed, Bud, not love,\" Jack chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a loser...\" Daniel sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what you want, just... Don't tell Mary, alright? She would kill me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever... Come, let's stick to the plan now...\" Daniel said while shaking his head.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"They are moving again,\" Alex informed Claire in the middle of their jog, \"it seems they are heading back to uptown\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still recognize the place where they stopped?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should head there first, let's see where they went\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"Stay here and wait for my signal,\" Daniel told Bud on an alley near Mayor's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Daniel walked cautiously towards their destination. Despite being the mayor of third biggest city in the kingdom, his house wasn't that big. It was quite spacey, of course, but not enormously huge, and it was only two storeys. Except the two guards that were just outside the house, the whole area seemed deserted. People were scared to go out at night ever since the serial murder happened. This would smoothen their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men! I need your assistance!\" Daniel said to the guards as he approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh! Yes, Captain!\" they immediately replied when they saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow my colleague here, I'll replace your duty for a while. Sera, I'm counting on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best, Captain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack led the guards towards the alley where Bud waited, \"there, the murder suspect seemed to be lurking in that alley. See if you can help me capture him alive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards was a little weird out by the order, but obeyed nonetheless. The alley was too dark to recognize faces, but they could see a silhouette of a person, which was Bud's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right there!\" one of the guards yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiii!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving little to no discussion about the plan prior to this event, Bud could only cowered in fear as two guards pointed their weapon at him. He was too scared to run away. As one of the guard tried to tie Bud up, Jack sneaked up behind the other and swiftly slitted his throat with a knife. He fell down without any noise. His body hit the ground hard, though, alarming the other. As the remaining guard stood up, Jack already unsheathed his sword and quickly stabbed him on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack realized that he was used as a bait, starting to get angry. But then he also realized it was too quiet of a murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...did you attack them on their throats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Jack calmly answered as he put his sword away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, what's with you and people's necks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I always had a thing for them...\" Jack said while inspecting the bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, to slice them open...\" Bud rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit your yap... There, I find the key, let's go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Bud walked towards the waiting Daniel. Daniel received the key from Jack and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they think it is a good idea for the guards to have the key to the house? How stupid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlocking the door quietly, Daniel whispered, \"now remember the old days, you two... Keep it clean by keeping it quiet... Except we are after their lives instead of valuables now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the house was dark, presumably the residents started to sleep early. Daniel made a gesture for Bud to wait at the door. Then he and Jack started exploring the house, doing their plan...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"I am sorry, Claire. I didn't believe you earlier\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was sobbing on Claire's shoulder. When Claire and Alex arrived at the safe house, Luna had just started to wake up. Seeing her current condition broke her. Claire never saw Luna acted like this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is okay, Luna... I wouldn't believe myself either... Let's be grateful since at least we are still alive...\" Claire tried to calm her friend, which she failed miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I... We can't stay like this! They will use our body to do bad things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear their plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of... I am not sure since I was half unconscious... It is something about the mayor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! We need to warn him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late for that,\" Alex calmly said, \"if they stopped where I think they were, which is the mayor's house, then they have done whatever they wanted to do since they are moving back to the base right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat! Now what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we stick to our original plan... Going to mayor's house would be useless and dangerous by now since we don't know what they have done there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point, Alex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What plan are you talking about? And what about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked at confused Luna then looked at Alex, asking for opinion. Alex just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I guess you should stay here... It is not safe if you follow us for our plan... On a second thought, let's go to Matthew's place, you'll be safer there...\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\"Don't mind this, I knew this would be coming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew wrote as Alex tried to heal his legs. Matthew told them what happened when they were away earlier that afternoon. Claire and Alex felt they were responsible for the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet I told you you shouldn't stay here, but you keep coming back... That I mind, not for my own sake but for your own safety,\" Matthew wrote again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no choice, this is the only place that we know will be somewhat safe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew only shook his head on Claire's answer. Alex finished mending Matthew's feet and sat down on a chair, looking out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" the now calm Luna was the first who realized Alex's condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine... It's just, I have used a lot of my mana today, I'll need to rest if we want to be successful in our plan tonight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I usually start my patrol around midnight, so we still have some time to rest... Unless 'I' told all of us to stop patrolling?\" the last part of Claire's sentence was for Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time I heard, 'you' told us to help searching for the murderer as usual until we withdraw from this city, which should mean we do patrol as planned... Unless 'you' tell us otherwise after they get rid of me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also,\" Luna added, \"remember that we would be out of town in two days, which means tonight is our only chance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...thanks for the grim reminder, Luna\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna just smiled at frustrated Claire, saying, \"you are welcome, Captain\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" Mary asked Daniel and Jack when they were back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flawless, Bud got his new life...\" Daniel said, plopping down on Claire's work chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I believe he got something to settle with the mayor's daughter and can't wait for that,\" Jack added with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... It means I don't have to see him anymore since we would be out of town soon,\" Mary said while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, where are the others? I only see a few\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them are resting, I told them to. They would need it if they want to patrol as you said we should, Captain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, good work 'Luna'... Well 'Sera,' do you want to patrol tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer not to and stay here, Captain, if you allow me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel snickered, \"those two must have prepared something for us when we go out to patrol tonight. I say we should stay here, let them miss their chance as we would be back to capital tomorrow evening... Or so I hope, but I will be required to go out tonight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Mary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A news will be coming from mayor's house soon, we wouldn't need to patrol tonight since we would be busy there. As your captain, I have no choice but to show my face around. We just have to make sure to be around other members later so that those two won't have a chance to pull any tricks,\" Daniel smiled deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

People were trying to put it out, but it seemed like they were having difficulties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I have no idea... The mayor and his daughter survived, but he didn't know what happened either. The girl is still unconscious, though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any other witnesses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely no. The mayor had to run around screaming before people realized his house is on fire. The streets got deserted in the night ever since the murders happen, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think someone did this purposely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a high probability of that, follow me\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><br>\r\nKeith lead his sister towards a narrow and dark alley nearby. Several of Keith's men were inside, each one holding a torch. Keith gestured at them to leave, and they obliged. One of them gave his torch to Keith. Keith took it, crouched down and hover the light over the two bodies on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These two are my men, they are supposed to guard the mayor's house tonight... Look at their wounds\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...neck slashes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so this could be the work of that serial murderer or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...or someone who tried to put the blame on him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly... Say, I can be 100% sure that this is not THEIR doing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean those two? No, I dealt with them already. Why? You need proof?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no... Just checking... Anyway, I would appreciate it if you could help me calm the mayor down... And share the blame for two?

Mayor's house is burning, and many of the Valkyries and local guards are there, including those whom we are after. Too many people there to do our plan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad,\" Luna joined, \"I don't think they will do much patrol tonight. The other members might be ordered to patrol, but as the captain 'Claire' would probably stay around mayor, to take the blame, protect him or such\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat... What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me, I have an idea, though this is quite a risky gamble...

Bud in mayor's body was sitting on the bedside, with mayor's daughter laying down on it, seemingly still sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you tell Keith?\" Daniel asked him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told him to find out who did this as soon as possible. Man, you should see his face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith was summoned earlier into this room, supposedly the mayor was ready to be questioned. But instead he got lashed out by the angry mayor. And now it was supposed to be Claire's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you managed to get his memory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, with a little help here,\" Bud said while softly stroking mayor's daughter cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old is she? She looks underage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vina will be 14 next month. But who cares, the girls in my slave trading business starts way earlier, and don't tell me you don't find her attractive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say I'm sure, Bud,\" Daniel decided to kept quiet about him fucking Jack in a little girl's body several times not long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever... So, she will stay like this? Sleeping forever?\" Bud said while brushing Vina's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you still have her soul, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,\" Bud whisked out a small sealed glass bottle which contained a small faintly-glowing white orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A body without soul will shut down like that, never waking up... But don't worry, when William arrive, present him that soul and he would gladly help you have your way with her. A pure soul like that have quite a high value for him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud chuckled, \"I didn't know the body swapping spell can also be used for soul trapping purposes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need special containers. It was actually my first time to do it, never had a chance to use that jar... Oh well, I think we have enough discussion... Enjoy the rest of your night, Mayor Algred\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, captain Claire. Please make sure Captain Keith does NOT do his job properly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I sure will...\"</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">Alex, Claire and Luna arrived in front of Valkyrie's base. Since most of the members were dispatched outside, the place was practically deserted. Alex told the other two to stay while she walked up to the one guarding the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to speak with the one in charge about the murder case\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight looked at Alex for a moment, before saying, \"Captain is out right now, but you can speak with her Vice. Wait here, I'll call her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex waved her hand in front of the guard's face, working on her magic. Soon the hypnosis worked, and the guard fell into dormant state. Alex gestured to Claire and Luna to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three, including vice-captain,\" the answer came in monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to stay here, and forget I ever come, until I say otherwise,\" Alex gave her an order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go. Luna, stay around here, tell us if anyone coming\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Claire directed Alex to go to the sleeping quarters while she went further back to the kitchen. Alex found two sleeping knights and put a spell on them, making it more difficult for them to be awaken. Claire found no one, and she rejoined Alex in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no one back there... Only my room left,\" Claire told Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get Luna\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex went to the closed room while Claire went to call Luna. Knocking on the door, using her magic once more, Alex altered her voice into the guard's voice outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" a reply came from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone come and says they have an info about the murders. They are waiting for you outside\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. But then there was a sound of the door unlocking. Alex charged her energy towards her right hand, preparing for a new spell. The door swung open, the one on the other side could only stare in shock as Alex shot paralysis spell dead on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tie her up, my spell won't last long,\" Alex told the just arrived Claire and Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them were inside the room now. Mary in Luna was securely tied up and her lips shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, you told me you can reverse this,\" Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did told you that. But right now my mana is too low to do it, it would be dangerous. There is another way though. Luna will have to do it herself, I'll teach her how to do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, really? Now?\" Luna said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no choice, either learn quickly and do it or trapped in that body forever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertainly, Luna nodded. Alex gave her the pointers and taught her the spell. Alex then prepared the ritual, using the blood exchange to swap the souls, and she cut both Mary and Luna's hands. Claire tied Luna up in a way that she still could hold Mary's hand. After all the preparation was done and Luna memorized the spell, making sure she said it right, Alex told her to do it. The spell worked, Alex saw with his eyes as their soul exchange places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's done\u2026\" Alex announced to Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now we can interrogate her,\" Claire said as she untied Luna, \"who are you working for?\" and asked that to Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary just stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know a man named William?\" this time Alex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer us before we start torturing you,\" Claire threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary responded to that, \"look at my face, I didn't betray my comrades then, and I will not now,\" implying torture wouldn't work to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well, then you are useless,\" Alex said while raising his blade to attack Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could do it, however, Luna stopped him. Surprised, Claire and Alex looked at her in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you stopping Alex, Luna?\" Claire asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I saw a new set of memories... I believe it is hers... And, I don't think she is such a bad person, now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the exchange is reversed, sometimes memory mix can happen, but it will wear out soon,\" Alex explained to puzzled Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw her difficulties living in this city, how she managed to get friends, among other bad things... I think I understand her feelings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that! You don't understand me!\" Mary bellowed suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she does,\" Alex said, \"she has your memories, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary went silent again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Luna, are you sure she is not a bad person?\" Claire spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She indeed had done bad things, but she didn't do them for fun or without remorse\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... I forgot to ask you, do you know what happened to Sera? I believe she should be in a little girl's body right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... Oh no... The little girl was found dead this morning... So that was Sera? Poor her...\" Luna's face fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire bit her lips, \"I thought as much... Hey, what's your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mary,\" she softly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, you said torture won't work on you, right? Well, how about a bribe? If we let you have Sera's life, will you betray your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them was shocked when they heard Claire's proposal, Claire included. Claire couldn't believe she actually said that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, are you serious?\" Luna asked, still shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Claire hesitated, \"I'm not sure either... But if you really think she is not a bad person, it will be better to let her have Sera's life rather than let everyone knows that Sera is dead\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire has a point,\" Alex joined, \"a body without a soul is the same as dead. If your friend's soul is gone, her body will need a replacement for it. A good one, that is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them looked at Mary, whom hadn't said anything yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying...\" Mary started to say, \"...that if I betray my friends, you'll not only spare me, but give me a new life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Claire said confidently, \"but you'll need to privide us with useful information. So, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

Fortunately, the door was locked so it remained closed. Next, there were several knocks on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma... Umm, Luna, open the door please...\" came a voice from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex glanced at Mary. The latter didn't seem to have an intention of calling out to her friend. But to be sure, Alex gestured at Claire to seal Mary's lips while whispered at Luna to answer the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Wait a minute...\" Luna finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry, I got a good news for us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of Luna, Alex walked up towards the door. Charging yet another paralysis spell, Alex prepared for an ambush. He then quickly swung the door open, revealing Jack-in-Sera who didn't even have time to be surprised before Alex hit her. Jack soon got the same treatment Mary got earlier, tied up and interrogated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is the good news you were saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I'm gonna tell you!\" Jack spat back at Claire's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... So will you be cooperative or not?\" Alex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! All of you can just go fffff... Mmmmfh!\" Jack's speech was cut as Claire shut her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex crouched and opened Mary's mouth seal, saying, \"your turn, Mary. What about our proposal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary seemed to ponder for a while, but then nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... As a token of our good will, we will let you trade body with Sera now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the muffled protest from Jack, Alex and Claire helped Mary prepared for another body switch. Flawlessly done, since Mary already know the process and spell. Alex immediately helped Mary to gain Sera's memories, as well as Jack's during his time in Sera, by placing her hand on Mary's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What is it? What is the 'good news' ?\" Claire impatiently asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary just lifted her head, staring directly at Claire, and said, \"William has arrived in this town\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><b>Minutes earlier...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daniel exited the house after talking with Bud, he saw people still trying to put down the fire at Mayor's house. Daniel smiled secretly, satisfied with his handwork. He looked around for any sign of Jack's presence, but he couldn't see him anywhere. That's when he heard a low growl from behind. He spun around and met a small, cat like creature staring at him. Daniel instantly recognized it as his master's summoned familiar. As the creature slowly strode away, Daniel followed. It led him toward a dark alley, much like the other one where Jack killed two guards earlier. Two figures were present inside, one of them crouching. Before Daniel's eyes could adjust to the darkness, a ball of light emerged, briefly blinding him. Daniel saw William, his smirk illuminated by the ball that hovered just above his head, and Jack who was on all four. The latter seemed busy pleasuring the former using his mouth. <br>\r\nNearing it's master, the familiar let out another growl, before dissipated into mist. Walking closer himself, Daniel crouched before his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to this city, master William,\" he said in Claire's utmost dignified voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, nice manner you got there, Daniel. Your vessel's personality really rubbed on to you, I suppose?\" William answered while snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you'd prefer this kind of treatment from us, your slaves, from now on, master\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you are just trying too hard to flatter me, Daniel... I never mentioned you two as my slave, have I? You are my subordinates, remember that... Though I do prefer you act like this, than being a carefree, rough-talking hoodlums... You should learn from Daniel, Jack\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmnh... Yes, master William...\" Jack replied in between his service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can we do for you, master?\" Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment...\" William grunted as he blew his load into Jack's mouth, \"whew, you got better, Jack... I would like to meet those other two, Bud and Mary. It has been a long time since I met them last...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish... Bud is nearby, if you didn't know already, and he has a present for you. Jack, go back and tell Mary to get here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gulp* Alright\"</div></span></div></div>",

They entered without knocking, catching Bud red handed kissing Vina while groping her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayor, you shouldn't treat your daughter like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud shrieked from Daniel's remark, quickly moving from one emotion to another: flustered and scared,  then get angry when he realized it was Daniel, then shocked to see William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-will...\" Bud said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Master William for you,\" Daniel hissed, attempting to correct Bud, but William stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Daniel. Bud's my dearest friend, aren't we Bud?\" William made a gesture to hug him, so Bud got up from the bed and did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been well, my friend?\" William asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My days were better when we were together, Will... I miss you,\" Bud replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you again. I see you have tasted a fraction of power that I now have, thanks to Daniel and Jack,\" William said after they broke their hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and for that, I thank you. I was told that you might be interested in this? Please accept this as my token of gratitude,\" Bud gave him Vina's soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh? Is this... This girl's soul? Excellent. I thank you. But Bud, I know you... I know you want something in return, yes?\" William grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes... If it is not much trouble, I want you to make this girl wake up and obey me?\" Bud said while pointing at Vina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... That shouldn't be a problem. Her soul will give me a lot more power than what I need to do that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam opened the glass jar. The soul inside appeared to try to run away, but William caught it with invisible strings from his left hand. Hovering the soul on his palm, he then began to suck it inside him. Slowly, strings of light escaped from the soul and entered William, making it smaller each second. 10 seconds later, the soul was gone completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\" William sighed, satisfied, \"pure soul is the best. And now, for your request\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam now lifted his right hand in front of him. A black ball slowly formed on his palm. Once it was the same size with the soul ball, William casted it towards Vina's souless body. The black ball slowly entered her chest, then disappeared completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made an artificial soul based on that girl's real soul. She should act almost the same like the original, but now your words are law to her. She will willingly serve and please you anyway you want. Basically, you have a perfect slave now,\" William said to Bud while smiling sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you very much, Will... Wow, you managed to create an obidient slave in less than 5 minutes, while I need years to create one. And they are not perfect,\" Bud was honestly impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for my friend. Now, since you are the mayor of this city, I expect that we can have a great new friendship ahead of us, by profiting each other, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you too, friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel just looked at them silently. He rembered that back when all of them were still together, Bud and William were best friend. He still didn't know whether William's act just now towards Bud was sincere or not, though. Daniel shrugged, it didn't matter as long as all of them get along well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVina started to awake just as a knock was heard on the door. Without waiting for a response, the door opened, and Keith entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, my men told me you made them wait outside as you brought in a suspicious individual into Mayor's room. May I ask who you are?\" his last question was directed at William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud almost panicked, but Daniel and William remained calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suspicious individual, they say?\" Daniel said, \"Keith, you should teach your men not to have prejudice towards everyone. This man here is a healer that I know very well. He happened to be in this city so I asked his help to check on Mayor's daughter because he was concerned of her condition\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father? Where am I?\" suddenly Vina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud looked surprised at first, but quickly assumed his new identity, \"you are in a friend's house. Our house is burned down. But don't worry Vina, you are safe now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh father, I'm glad that you are okay,\" Vina said while hugging Bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, he managed to wake her up,\" Daniel added, \"I think you owe him an apology\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes... I'm sorry for my and my men's rudeness, mr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"William,\" he continued, extending his right hand to shake Keith's, \"and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keith Rayleigh, captain of the guards here at Falion city. Also Claire's brother, if you haven't known already,\" Keith accepted William's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as their hands met, Keith felt weak. He dropped to his knees. He felt something flowed from him towards the man in front of him. He knew that if didn't release his hand, something bad was going to happen to him, but he wasn't able to do so. Keith was powerless as William slowly absorbed his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain of the guards, eh? Once we have you on our side, with Bud as mayor, this city is ours,\" William said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Keith was no more, just his empty body remained. William released his hand, flicked his fingers, and a new artificial soul emerged. He quickly threw it inside Keith's body. Once the soul was inside, Keith quickly stood up with a blank look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a simple blank soul, I don't need more trouble. Daniel, you take care of the rest,\" Daniel suddenly laughed, which made William raised his eyebrows, \"is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I just remembered that to get Bud and Mary out of prison, I made a deal to sleep with him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Isn't he your vessel's brother?\" William seemed amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half brother,\" Daniel corrected him, \"it appeared Keith already fell in love with Claire since they were kids\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo... Interesting... What are you going to do with the deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll honor our deal, we owe him that much. But I don't think he will be around to enjoy it,\" Daniel chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel spun around and saw that Bud already started to make out with Vina. Her dress was torn apart, exposing her breasts. Daniel could only shook his head on the view. William saw it too. However, his mind was on something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it master?\" Daniel realized something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a shift, I can sense it...\" William seemed to look far beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean someone is using the shifting power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering Daniel, William chanted an incantation and summoned his familiar. The cat like creature from before appeared out of thin air after a short black light flash. William didn't need to command anything at it, the will and purpose of the familiar was formed as William chanted the incantation earlier. Looking at its master for a second, it leapt towards the window. It passed through the glass like a ghost, then ran very fast towards the source of the shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what my familiar will find there...\" William said while grinning.</div></span></div></div>",

You discover one of the things you were transporting is a magical mirror that swaps the bodies of those who look into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Second Story</b>: As a student of magic, you find a tome in a magic shop with strange spells. To your dismay, reciting the spell inside kills you- but your soul from your body, allowing you to choose a new host. The only way to exit a body is to use the spell, and the victim's original soul is eradicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Third Story</b>: After you defeat a band of goblins, a cursed bracelet sticks to your wrist that transforms you into anyone or thing that you kill, from this point forward. It cannot be removed and you cannot shift at will, except by killing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fourth Story</b>: A warlock steals your soul. Someone defeats him and undoes his evil, but your soul is returned to the wrong body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Feel Free to Add More Stories</b>, just always leave an open branch. If you add a story idea, try and add at least one chapter to that branch to get the ball rolling.</td>",
