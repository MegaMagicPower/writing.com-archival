Aunt Maggie was Tobey and Annie's aunt and she had a special gift; she could swallow just about anything whole as long as it wasn't poison and didn't hurt her stomach.   Tobey and Annie had made a game out of feeding their aunt all kinds of food.  It was five months ago when Maggie had came to babysit her niece and nephew and they played their favorite game; feeding Aunt Maggie.  Maggie was a big eater, preferring to eat  huge meals and large portions of food. As luck would have it, the house had been relatively empty of food--by Maggie's standards--so she had eaten her niece and nephew along with their two friends, Terry and Debbey. <br>\r\n                  Instead of being digested, the four children remained alive and well in Maggie's tummy.  It seemed when Maggie ate normal food, it would digest but when she ate anything living it would not digest.  It seemed that Maggie's stomach knew what to digest  and what not to.       Not even Maggie knew where her swallowing talents came from; she had simply been born with that unique ability or so it seemed.   Of course Susan, Maggie's sister, knew all about her unique swallowing talents.  She--Susan--had been understandably shocked when she came home and saw her sleeping sister with a <i>gigantic</i> belly.   Susan was relieved when she found that all four children had survived the trip down Maggie's  gullet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      Now it was Christmas time and Susan was having a Christmas party over at her house.  Of course Susan had invited her sister over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        The party consisted of: Susan, Annie, Tobey, Debbey and Terry and some of their friends from  school plus some of the neighborhood children.   Maggie was currently late to the party.   (a/n: I'm assuming there are other people at the party, but I'll let other authors decide that) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                   Terry--the first one to be swallowed by Maggie--eagerly awaited for Maggie to come.  The other children were busy playing video games.   Terry was awaiting his turn at Street Fighter II on the couch in the living room.   Annie and Tobey were talking about their aunt and how cool she was; especially her swallowing talents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Just you wait until she gets here\" said Tobey.  \"it's amazing just how much she can eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Swallowing food whole?\" scoffed Gregory, one of the teenagers at the party.   \"As if\"<br>\r\n                   <br>\r\n                 \"She once swallowed an entire watermelon\" said Annie.   \"She's gonna get fat tonight\" here, she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 </span></div></div>",

She's been trying every single fad diet and special trick in the book, and none of them have been working! She still has the same plump body, the same round belly, and worst of all, the same, insatiable hunger. In her misery, she has locked herself inside her house, exiling herself from society until she conquers her gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could lead a woman like Maggie to diet? She had always scoffed at the idea. She was the kind of woman who enjoyed stuffing herself with delicious food, and even enjoyed the weight gain. Before, she had considered her appetite harmless. But as it turns out, right under her nose, her gluttony had been growing stronger than she could have ever imagined...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boiling point came on one fateful day months ago, when she volunteered to watch over her nephew, niece and their two friends. There was no food in the house, so, well, one thing led to another, and her gluttony overcame her. She ended up swallowing them all, one by one! Sure, they did voluntarily slide down her throat... but she should've been responsible and stopped them! Instead, she just happily let them jump into her stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she simply took a nap, completely disregarding their safety and only thinking about how full she felt. Luckily, she woke up only a half hour or so later, before digestion or anything could set in. In fact, as it turns out, they were completely unharmed, and actually had the time of their lives in there! They almost seemed disappointed when Maggie spat them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was absolutely mortified by what had happened that day! She loved Tobey and Annie with all her heart, but when she got hungry, she only saw them as scrumptious food! It scared her just how readily she was willing to swallow them down. So, since then, she's been trying every technique imagineable to keep her gluttony in check, so as to not risk eating anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUgh! This isn't working!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been lying around on the couch, sadly watching TV, when she finally made that proclomation. She had been dieting for weeks, and she hadn't shed a single pound! Her fat was clinging to her body with unnatural stubbornness, and that may be because of her complete lack of excercize. Lounging around the house feeling miserable apparently wasn't very healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settled it! She had to go out somewhere, anywhere! Just to get a little walking in. A bit of sunlight would be good for her, after being cooped up inside for so long. The only thing keeping her inside was her hunger. Her stomach was constantly growling, and she couldn't stop thinking about how scrumptious people looked, which scared her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she donned a big, loose blouse, and walked down to the local park to get some fresh air. She didn't have a gym membership, so the park would have to do for excercize. The only problem with the park is, there were kids everywhere! Every time she glanced at one, she was reminded of that fateful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie tried to just focus on excercizing and mind her own business... but unfortunately, she noticed kids pointing at her as she walked by. It seems her reputation precedes her. Her nephew and niece and their friends had gone around bragging about what you had done, and while their parents thought they were just telling tall tales, some of the other kids in town actually believed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed some of them staring at her, and her belly growls as she's hit with another burst of hunger. All this excercize was only making her even hungrier, and her starving mind couldn't help but make her think about how scrumptious the little ones around her must be. Surely, there'd be no harm in just stuffing one in her belly for a few minutes, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, trying to shake those thoughts from her head. She can't eat anybody, no matter how hungry she gets! Eventually, though, her hunger wears down on her energy, and she collapses onto a nearby bench, panting in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she chugs from a plastic water bottle, she notices someone approaching her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey, lady!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie immediately turned her head to the sound of some boy calling to her. She feels her heart sink in her chest as she lays eyes on an entire troupe of kids, all looking up at her expectantly. There were three boys and two girls, and one of the boys seemed to be standing at the front of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were gonna play knights, and we were wondering... could you pleeease be the dragon?\u201d The boy begged her. The others all seemed fascinated and nervous around her, staring at Maggie's plump form whenever she wasn't looking. \u201cI mean, you're big enough to gobble us up an' everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes pale. Were they really asking her to... eat them? She supposed she should've expected this, given her newfound reputation. That wasn't the concerning part, though; the concerning part was that she was actually tempted! <b>\u201cI'm... afraid I can't do that...\u201d</b> She stutters, trying to resist the urge to just swallow him on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sure ya can!\u201d The boy said, looking a little confused. \u201cI mean, Tobey and Annie said so.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of them seemed smug, whispering little 'I told she so's to eachother when she sheepishly admitted she couldn't eat anybody. For some reason, this angered she. <b>\u201c... alright. I'll be the dragon,\u201d</b> she nodded, <b>\u201cbut I'm not going to actually be gobbling anybody up, understand? This is just for pretend.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all seemed visibly disappointed when she said she weren't going to eat them. \u201cAww... well, alright, if you say so...\u201d The boy frowned, but quickly got over it. They marched over to a nearby glade, and she reluctantly followed. \u201cOkay, so Lori's gonna be the princess, and the rest of us are gonna be the knights. So the whole point of the game is to rescue the princess from the dragon's belly...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cShe's not going in my belly, though,\u201d</b> Maggie immediately asserted, interrupting him. He paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so, Lori will just sit here in this little hole, and we'll pretend it's your tummy. Okay?\u201d He said, pointing to a little hole in the ground. She nodded, deciding that all sounds satisfying enough. All this talk about sher belly was making she hungry, though, and the five of them seemed fascinated by just how loudly sher stomach was constantly growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe helped a bit as all the little ones prepared for the game. Lori just took a seat in the hole, relaxing while the knights picked up little sticks to use as swords, and all donned grey hoodies as 'armor'. Eventually, they pretended to ride invisible horses over to where she were guarding the hole. \u201cLet her go, foul dragon! The princess is not your food!\u201d The boy said, pointing his stick at she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe get into character immediately, her brain consumed by predatory urges. <b>\u201cOh, but she is! She was absolutely scrumptious!\u201d</b> She said in a deep, 'intimidating' voice, as she leaned back and patted her round gut.<b> \u201cAnd you know what? You knights look scrumptious, too!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the game was on! The little 'knights' ran around, giggling loudly while she chased them, trying to keep them from rescuing the princess. Whenever she captured one of them, she picked them up and placed them into the hole too, where they had to sit out the rest of the round. Eventually, all five of them had been captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmitting defeat, the knights climbed out of the hole and reset, preparing for the next round. Over the next half hour, she played their pretend game. Sometimes they were able to rescue the princess, but for the most part she managed to capture them all with ease. Like a real dragon, she was must larger, stronger and faster than the knights, so they stood no chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a great workout, and a lot of fun, but eventually, they got annoyed by how easily Maggie was winning. \u201cHey, this isn't fair!\u201d One of them eventually pouted, crossing their arms. \u201cYou should have to actually put people in your belly instead of just putting them in some hole in the ground! Then they'll be really heavy, and you'll run slower!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was distressed at the statement. She glanced at their little leader for guidance, but he just shrugged. \u201cIt's true,\u201d he said, simply. Maggie felt conflicted. She knew she shouldn't eat people, but all this exercise she's been doing has made her really, really hungry. Besides, they were practically begging to get gobbled up!</span></div></div>",

Eventually, she reasoned to herself; what's the harm? This glade was in a tucked-away part of the park, where nobody would be looking. <b>\u201cHmm... well, alright. If you really want me to,\u201d</b> she finally relents after some consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all smile at eachother, excited. They had been intensly curious as to whether Maggie could actually eat somebody, and if she could, what it would be like to be eaten. <b>\u201cBut swallowing things your size can be difficult! I can't go gulping you down willy nilly. I'd prefer to take my time, you know?\u201d</b> She noted. They all nodded, understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated for a while, wondering whether she was actually going to do this, before shrugging. It was too late to back out now. Her stomach growled loudly as she looked down at Lori, who looked like a delicious steak to Maggie's hungry eyes. <b>\u201cI suppose I'll start with the princess, then! Take your shoes off, dear, and have a seat,\u201d</b> she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori seemed ecstatic that she got to go first! She immediately took her nasty shoes and socks off, tossing them to the side, before sitting down on a nearby park bench. Maggie approaches her, as the 'knights' all crowd around the two of them, eager to see whether Maggie can actually swallow the girl whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, just hold still, okay? You can wriggle all you want in my belly, but please try not to wriggle too much going down, okay?\u201d She instructed, and Lori nodded. With that, Maggie sat on her knees in front of the 'princess', and Lori raised her feet up in front of her face, eagerly waiting to be gobbled up by the big, plump 'dragon'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group all giggled when Maggie slid Lori's feet into her mouth. \u201cOh! It tickles!\u201d She said, involuntarily wriggling a bit at the sensation of the woman's lips wrapping around her feet. Maggie let out a pleasant coo as her mouth was filled with Lori's taste. She had forgotten just how delicious people tasted! With an eager swallow, Maggie pulled the girl's feet into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, it's... really, really warm!\u201d The girl gasped, surprised by the sensation of Maggie's incredibly warm, tight, wet throat squeezing around her feet. Maggie gently grabbed her by the legs and started pulling the 'princess' deeper and deeper into her throat, enjoying the incredible flavor. There was really no food in the world that could compare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others watched in fascination as Maggie's lips slowly travelled up Lori's legs, soon reaching her knees. With the sheer ease with which she was swallowing the girl, it seemed like it was really true; Maggie really could eat people? \u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d They asked, burning with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori had a difficult time explaining it. To be honest, it was like nothing else she'd ever experienced. \u201cUmm... stick your finger under your tongue. You feel how soft it is?\u201d She said. \u201cWell, it's like that, but, uh, all around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group tried it, poking the incredibly soft skin on the underside of their tongues. Imagining being surrounded by that on all sides was amazing! They were all immediately jealous of Lori. \u201cThat's so cool!\u201d One of the knights smiled. As they watched Lori get pulled the rest of the way into Maggie's belly, they seemed to be itching to go next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith incredible ease, Maggie worked her way up to Lori's waist, then her midsection, then her chest, before finally, her lips were wrapped around her shoulders. All the while, Lori seemed to enjoy the relaxing sensation. The way Maggie's throat squeezed down rhythmically around her was like a super relaxing massage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went deeper, she was about to reach the part they were most curious about. \u201cWhat's her stomach like? Can you feel it yet?\u201d One of the knights asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori shrugged. \u201cI... don't know. I guess I'm gonna find out...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Maggie took a few more swallows, and before she knew it, only the girl's face was still sticking out from between Maggie's lips. \u201cHehe! Goodbye, Lori!\u201d The knights all giggled and waved as the last of Lori disappeared completely, vanishing into Maggie's dark throat. Maggie finally clamped her lips shut, letting out a satisfied sigh as she felt the girl slip into her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled herself up onto the bench, sitting down and patting her big, round belly as she feels the girl curl up inside. She leaned back, relaxing as the 'knights' all crowded around and curiously poked and rubbed at her belly. They couldn't hear Lori through the thick belly skin, but they could definitely feel her move. \u201cWhoa! She's really moving around in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, nobody but the 'knights' seemed to have noticed what Maggie had done. Anybody who passes by now would just assume that Maggie was heavily pregnant. <b>\u201cMmmm! She... was... scrumptious!\u201d</b> Maggie announced, finally. She had completely missed that delicious taste, and that stuffed feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she looked down at the other knights, who were all curiously inspecting her big belly. She couldn't help but want more! She wanted to have them all in her belly, asap! <b>\u201cSo... how about that game?\u201d</b> She said. The knights chuckled. They had been so caught up in watching Lori get eaten, they completely forgot about the game they were supposed to be playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... yeah! Uh...\u201d The leader of the little group said. \u201cYeah, so... the game's still the same. We've got to rescue Lori from the dragon's, uh, belly, and... well, if she catches us, we get gobbled down too. If the dragon eats us all, she wins...\u201d Maggie nodded exictedly at the rules, and others nodded along with her. This was going to be fun!</span></div></div>",
