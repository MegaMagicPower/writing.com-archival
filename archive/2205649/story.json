We know I'd get to be the first to be targeted again right?\" were the first words uttered by Daphne before anyone got the chance to start say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't leave things be Daphne, who knows what will happen if we leave the mystery be? And don't worry I'll protect you, always.\" was the immediate reply given from Fred, as he tried to sneak in some flirting with Daphne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows maybe this time you won't be the 'danger-prone Daphne' we know?\" spite Velma, as jealousy reared its ugly head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne disregarding both of them, actually came up a brilliant idea in her mind. Remembering how the mysteries were solved and who the key player, or players involved knew Fred's word might be a tad bit unreliable. Turning away from both Fred and Velma, Daphne faced both Shaggy and Scooby who were both pumped up from their earlier Scooby Snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we must then I want to choose who I'm teaming up with. And I'd like to be teamed up with both Shaggy and Scooby, and that's final. If that's alright with you guys?\" as Daphne nods towards both Shaggy and Scooby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to Daphne, the rest of the gang reflexively shouted in surprise, \"Huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred being the first to come out of his shock starts to coax Daphne, \"But Daphne, we usually go together?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, FINAL!\" the only response given by Daphne<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Velma was silent as she blushes at the opportunity given to be alone together with Fred, while both Shaggy and Scooby just remained confused and now slightly hungry and therefore could only nod in agreement to Daphne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, the others are fine with it!\" Daphne triumphantly exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated Fred could only agree, \"Alright then, that would be how we'll split up. If that's all, Iet's split-up gang.\"</span></div></div>",
