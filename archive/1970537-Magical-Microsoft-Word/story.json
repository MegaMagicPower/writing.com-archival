You know, you look one of those guys that when they walk down the street, everybody says: \"Wow, look at that guy. I bet his name is Calvin\". Probably you're the best Calvin that ever Calvin'd, whatever that means.<br>\r\nAll the time passed wondering all those silly thoughts gave enough time to your computer to boot, so you insert the USB you got at the flea market and run the setup.exe .<br>\r\nSeveral things seemed wrong with that: the setup didn't ask for an activation key, the Office packet contained only Word, the USB drive was unbranded and usually Office didn't came on USBs, at least not on crocodile shaped ones. I hope it's not a cracked copy, you mumble, your imagination already producing a faint sound of distant sirens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe installation terminated smoothly, and the program started.<br>\r\nYou were surprised tough when on the screen a toony paperclip appeared.<br>\r\n\"Clippy?!\" You uttered \" What are you doing on this version? You are a removed feature. \"<br>\r\nJust as it heard you, a speech balloon popped up, saying \"Seems like you're confused by my presence. I'm here to show you the functionality of this special copy of Word. A special truth-check option is enabled, if you write something false, the program will make that true instead.<br>\r\nYou can change the behaviour so that it simply corrects the sentence instead. But that would not be much interesting, would it?\"<br>\r\nAs son as you finished reading it, Clippy winked at you. \"What the heck?\" You shouted, almost falling from the chair.<br>\r\nCould it be true? There was only one way to find out, so after being stumped on what to write for a solid three minutes you think \"Ah, screw it\" and to test it you wrote something untrue about...</span></div></div>",

It's me, Sofia. Time for you to give back what you took from me\" she coldly states, not even turning around.<br>\r\nYou bet that he would have cried if he had been able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia keeps typing:<br>\r\nMiles body isn't what it seems, in reality Miles is only a bodysuit worn by Sofia, his ex-girlfriend. Unfortunately for him, he is no longer able to control the bodies on which he is worn, but if his head is worn like a mask the wearer can let him speak. It also works if put on a mannequin's head. He can never tell his story to anybody, or ask for help. Conveniently, on this room's bed suddenly appear a head mount with a mannequin head and clothes for Sofia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, everything that she wrote happened, after which she makes your body turn around. In front of you stands a usual man with normal clothes that smiles and says \"time to shed this skin\"<br>\r\nAs she wrote, he is really just a body suit that her brand new body can't wait to take off. Underneath lies the petite body of a cute girl, neither a bomb shell nor a train wrbed, before.\"Like what you see? Oh, right! You can't talk right now. Don't worry, you'll get your body back soon\"<br>\r\nShe dresses with her new clothes that are on the bed, after which she decides her next move</span></div></div>",

Yeah that must be it\u201d you leave your room and notice that there are no wooden floors there are only polished marble floors both in light and dark colors. You go to the bathroom to get some water to splash in your face to wake up. To your amazement the bathroom has 4 columns in each corner with elegantly carved designs. The bathtub and shower are both separate from each other now and have designs of diamond gems on the sides of the stone they are in. You rush over to the sink to splash water on yourself and telling yourself it\u2019s not real it\u2019s just a dream but when you look it\u2019s still there. You hear a unfamiliar voice calling you from the hall running before rushing into the washroom. \u201cMonsieur Calvin the hospital called. They need you to perform a emergency brain surgeon.\u201d You cant stop thinking \u201cyou must be joking right? Please tell me your right.\u201d She looks at you confused and says \u201cno Monsieur Calvin even most of the time I would like your jokes the president doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201d You couldn\u2019t believe what you heard but before you can ask anymore questions you feel you being pushed out the door into the ambulance. You arrive at the hospital and are dragged into a operating room with a tray of tools next to you. After a few minutes did you manage to do it?</span></div></div>",

He's got a fishnet shirt on with some extremely short shorts and a pair of extremely tough-looking boots. Something about this guy really speaks to you. His body is almost completely exposed and his face is chiseled and handsome. You can see he's got painted fingernails and he even seems to be wearing a little bit of makeup. This is almost certainly the hottest punk you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide you want to start fresh with him. You remove all your extra parts and your new extra head and stuff them all back in the bag, carrying it with you as you approach him. He stops bopping to the beat to look you over, and his friends all do the same. They all have their own crazy hairstyles, but they all seem to be dressed equally as skimpy with some minor variations in the specifics of their wardrobes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys,\" you say to everyone but the purple-spiked punk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something we can help you with, man?\" one of the punks with indigo hair asks. You don't sense any hostility in his voice, just curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in the bag, dude?\" the yellow-haired punk with large gages in his ears asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a bunch of spare body parts in here and they can all be yours if you trade me your packages and let me have some alone time with your purple-haired friend, there,\" you offer. The group of punks, obviously, have no choice but to accept, thanks to your magic still holding strong. All four of the punks drop their pants and shorts of varying lengths and expose their various lengths for you as you go down the line and pop them off one-by-one with their corresponding balls, leaving them all null and smooth between their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is wild!\" the white-haired punk says, \"it's like it was never there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, man, I can still feel mine!\" says Indigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" Yellow chimes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, guys, we should just go pantsless from now on!\" the red-haired on in the back pipes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw yeah!\" they all say in unison as they fist bump and get rid of their pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys, don't forget these,\" you say as you dump the parts you've accumulated all over their table and booth. The punks all start rifling through the pile and customizing their bodies with the various female parts and limbs you gave them in the trade, enjoying themselves immensely. You stuff the punks' cocks into your recently-emptied bag and walk back over to the purple haired punk you were interested in to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems like an awful lot of effort to get me alone, dude,\" he says, his voice deep and a little bit raspy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, it wasn't all to get to you, I just happened to have all those parts on hand when I saw you,\" you reply, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you got some new parts from my buddies,\" he says, nodding toward the bag of dicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, yeah, it's just that, uh...\" you trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no worries,\" the punk says, trying to reassure you, \"they seem happy enough without them anyway.\" You both look over to the group of punks sitting at the table, trading and arguing over not just the female body parts (and the bouncer's dick) but each others' pieces too. \"Hell, by tomorrow, I probably won't recognize any of them,\" he says, laughing a bit. \"As long as they're happy with themselves, though, it's all cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but notice how nonchalant he is about everything happening. It may just be the magic, but you have a suspicion there's something more to it than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jesse, by the way,\" he says, extending a fist. You bump it and get a little shiver down your spine as you tell him your name in return. He chuckles a little and shoots you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wanna get out of here?\" Jesse says, pointing over his shoulder to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, alright,\" you say, trying to keep your cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the club, the two of you stop by a hole-in-the-wall coffee shop and take a table in the far back. The light above the table isn't working, but you can still see his deep green eyes reflecting the light of the neon sign in the front window of the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, spill, what's up with my friends just handing over their dicks like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I should tell you, I don't want you to think I'm crazy,\" you say, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I fuckin' saw what happened in that club with my own eyes, there's a lot I'm inclined to believe at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and begin to fill Jesse in on your new powers and how you got them. His eyes grow wider in shock and amusement with each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you just... what, ask for a body part and the son of a bitch <i>has</i> to hand it over? That's fuckin' metal, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so, Jesse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah, you're, like, fighting the power of REALITY, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you show me how it works?\" Jesse says, leaning over the table in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"Sure, on who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse scans the room, searching for a potential mark. His eyes rest on a man and woman couple near the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them,\" he says as he points them out, \"I wanna see you switch their heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy. Come on, watch this,\" you brag as you both get up and walk over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sir and ma'am,\" you say, interrupting their conversation, \"my friend here would like me to remove your heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man and woman look at each other and shrug, then turn back to you. \"Sure,\" the guy says. As the couple reach up to remove their heads, Jesse's eyes go wide again and you're honestly a little worried he might outright faint. The man and woman both tug hard on their heads until they pop off with a satisfyingly loud sound as they hand them to the both of you. Jesse looks over the woman's head with absolute awe as she smiles, enjoying being inspected in this manner. Their bodies then resume having a conversation entirely in pantomime as if they still had heads atop their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you're done checking her out, I can put them back,\" you say, snapping Jesse out of it. He hands you her head as you place it on her significant other's body, and vice versa with the man's head. They both look down at their newly exchanged bodies and shrug once more, before resuming their conversation for real. You and Jesse return to your table in the back, Jesse still staring at the couple who don't see a single thing wrong with their new permanent states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they just... like... they're just cool with that now? Being on each other's bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I can tell, anything I detach or swap around sort of alters reality in some weird way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you done anything to me?\" Jesse asks, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, like, I mean...\" you stammer, \"I didn't mean it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you mean it then, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm trying to say is I don't want to trick you like that. You're like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you, alright, Jesse? You're hot and you seem like a cool, understanding guy, and I want to get to know you instead of just fucking with your body like the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse blushes and looks away, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you say?\" you ask, your voice shaking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, like...\" Jesse begins, looking back up at you and meeting your eyes, \"yeah. Fuck yeah, dude. Let's try this out.\" He extends his hand across the table and offers it to you. Instead of taking it, you simply... take it, holding it gingerly without removing it from his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few weeks are fantastic. You spend them traveling around the city and doing all sorts of fun activities together and messing with more than your share of people's bodies along the way. It turns out Jesse is a bit of an artist and he's very excited to help you make the people of the city your canvas. You still haven't altered his body, though. You love it too much to mess with and you wouldn't want to mess something up and change reality or alter his mind for the worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Jesse makes a hell of a request from you: he wants you to give him powers of his own. You happily accept, of course. His powers allow him to disassemble and reassemble himself, but only himself. He was clear about that stipulation when he made the request to you. You obliged, of course, complimenting him on his responsibility, but adding in another bit allowing him to take you apart as well and swap pieces with you. Everything was going perfect. You even met up with his group of friends and their completely mismatched and strangely customized bodies a few times! Every time you saw them they had some kind fo different configuration. You and Jesse are sure they don't even know what part belongs to who anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, about a week into him having his powers, you get a text from Jesse saying...</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re part of me, so you probably have the same abilities I do.\u201d<br>\r\nShe nods, the two of you walking over to the group. Consisting of three girls and two guys, you had a lot of options. But the one that catches both of your eyes instantly is a cute redhead girl. Then there\u2019s a mohawked rocker guy with purple-dyed spikes, clearly the redhead\u2019s boyfriend. Next is a blonde girl, who aside from her large chest is otherwise unremarkable, then another guy, good looking with brown hair, but again, no less ordinary than most people. Finally, a cute Asian girl, clearly of the athletic type.<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take you two long to decide just what parts to take.<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d you greet them, the magic taking hold. \u201cMy friend and I couldn\u2019t help admire you guys\u2019 parts. Don\u2019t mind if we take a few then, starting with your head, hips, and legs,\u201d you say, starting with the redhead and going in order, \u201cyour body sans face, ears, and cock, your breasts, your cock and mouth, and your limbs and cunny.\u201d<br>\r\nThe group looks amongst themselves, shrugging, and removing the requested parts. The redhead is reduced to just her upper body, the rocker to just a bodiless face, ears, and surprisingly small cock, the blonde being left flat chested, the brown haired guy mouthless and null, and the Asian a limbless, smooth crotched torso.<br>\r\n\u201cTake care of us man,\u201d the rocker shouts, sticking his tongue out in classic rocker fashion. You bet if he still had his body that he\u2019d be doing rocker hands.<br>\r\nYou order his body to pick up the parts, carrying them back to your table. As you leave them you watch what\u2019s left of them resume life as if nothing happened. The mouthless male picking up the limbless Asian and rubbing his face against hers for a kiss, and the reduced redhead\u2019s body picking up the rockers face, twirling it around his cock and sticking it between her breasts.<br>\r\nSetting many of the parts in your bag, you debate your next move. There are still a few targets here, or you can go elsewhere. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Instead of penises, men have vaginas, with the only difference between males and females being the breasts. Reproduction is done orally, with both genders having sperm in their saliva.<br>\r\nAs a result of this lack of gender differences, in many cases it\u2019s as acceptable to go bottomless as it is for woman to wear skirts, with fully nude males and bottomless females is not an uncommon sight in warmer months when modestly is not required. Things like restrooms are unigender, and gender inequality is near nonexistent.<br>\r\nIntersexual relationships are the norm, to the point where the terms \u2018boyfriend,\u2019 \u2018girlfriend,\u2019 \u2018husband,\u2019 and \u2018wife\u2019 have been completely replaced by the single neutral term \u2018mate.\u2019 The and with even males being fertile, polygamous relationships, while still seen as being wrong and sinful by some religions, are overall not uncommon.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hit enter, gasping as you feel your cock retract into your body. Your pants vanish, the hot day essentially negating your need for them, but you did like the top you were wearing so apparently you kept that. You take a peak down at your crotch, spotting the normally feminine slit, although now it\u2019s more of a universal feature.<br>\r\nYou decide to see just how common it is to walk around nude, going on Google Street View to look at the warmer climates, such as cities like Rio and Sydney, noting the large number of nude bodies.<br>\r\nNow, you think you could have some fun in this form, so do you go outside and explore a bit, call your mate, or make some more changes</span></div></div>",

Her brunette hair tied up in a bun, has very smooth skin and wears a cute set of glasses on her face. Her body is also very well toned with a thin stomach complemented with a pair of what look to be either d or dd cup breasts and a shapely ass. She is currently dressed up in her uniform for work, which is basically a grey pantsuit, a skirt, and a white shirt, which is still partially unbuttoned exposing a good amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the part of her body that you're focusing on right now is the parts she's missing. She is sitting on the couch with no arms or legs. She also has a stack of papers in front of her and a pen in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright sweetie?\" She must've noticed your shock, she says after dropping her pen into her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um. I was just wondering...\" you quickly think of something to distract her. \"That's a lot of paperwork you got, do you need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, this? No need to worry, this is about my usual load. I'm almost done in fact.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to sign several documents with just her mouth? you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to help, you can just pack all of it into my bag.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure\" You grab all her papers and stuff them into her satchel, both out of guilt from turning your mother into a helpless woman and also lack of cognitive function as you are still having trouble processing this. As soon as you pack her things, you ask her another question. \"Um, do you need help carrying this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calvin, surely you know how I've been using that thing by now right?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I can never remember to be honest, can you tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs, \"Alright, I suppose I'll tell you again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain? you wonder. She instructs you on her satchel's special straps, which you definitely don't remember, which can wrap around her neck and be tightened around her body. From what you can see, it's arranged in a way that allows her to take it off anytime she wants and pull out the satchel's contents with her mouth whenever she wants. But still concerned and curious about your mother's new life, you ask another question. \"So do you have a ride to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do.\" You give her a confused look. \"Your father, silly. Same as always. You sure are forgetful today, aren't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right sorry\" Well, it seems like your mother is fine with missing all her limbs, and seems well acquainted to life without them, as if she never had them. You're at least relieved that she is okay, but you still feel the need to explore the world further. You did type that all the women in the world would lose a random amount of limbs right? Was your mother just extremely unlucky? If so, what do all the other women in your life look like now? To find out, you decide too...</span></div></div>",

While the eruption managed to wipe out 90% of the human race, nearly causing it to go extinct, it\u2019s globe encircling plume carried the comets dust, depositing it in at least small concentrations all over the globe. Within that dust was an alien virus that, by sheer chance, could only affect mammals and avians. The virus caused the humans to mutate, their heads vanishing into their body, giving them rudimentary sight and hearing, but no smell, speech, and an inability to eat solid foods. They instinctively reached for their animal companions, domesticated wolves at the time, for comfort. The animal\u2019s heads came off easily, their body sitting obediently. Upon placing the canine\u2019s head on their own, the humans had full sight, could hear like a dog, and more importantly, could eat solid foods. The animal\u2019s jaw structure reshaped, allowing human speech, its head resizing to fit on a human neck. From that point on, humans required an animal companion to survive. It would be found through trial and error that the animal\u2019s body was needed, with its head allowing the same effect on it, and that the death of the body would mean the death of the head, and in many cases, the linked human. Over a few generations, bonds forned between a hunan and an animal, with bonded animals lifespans being equal to that of a human. Mating involved a four partner relationship rather than two. The history of Earth, was forever changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, keeping in mind that canines aren\u2019t the only animals humans bonded with, with felines, equines, bovines, and other domesticated animals being popular, do you wish to continue this story track?</span></div></div>",

Consciousness could be transferred between the body or the head, leaving either to become the \u201cmind\u201d of what ever parts are attached to it, or were attached last.<br>\r\nHistory wise, things are pretty much the same, with the ability largely going unused for a few centuries due to religious and political pressures, although a black market of parts did spring up. Now, with the pressures suppressing the abilities lessening up, that black market has become more public, with a few part shops popping up every so often.<br>\r\nNow it\u2019s not unusual to see people with mismatched parts, extra or less parts, or even those of animals. While some regulations have come into place, it\u2019s less of a taboo now than before.\u201d<br>\r\nHitting send, you feel the rush as a wave of magic pulses around the planet.

Where the city is shared with humans, they have their own neighborhoods all to themselves. They have their own countries: Canis in the region of western China and Central Asia, Angamanain and Nacumera &amp; Kashmir in South Asia, Anubis in Africa and Lycaon in Europe. Canis has a history of monarchy and empire, but is now a republic that was once under the influence of the Soviet Union and associated Communist government for 40 years. It is currently under fledging democratic government. Angamanain and Nacumera is an island kingdom in the Bay of Bengal, where the Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be. Angamanain is the larger northern island in this island chain; Nacumera is the smaller southern island. Kashmir, in the area of Northern India and Northeast Pakistan, has had a canine ruling dynasty for thousands years, with a brief alignment with Britain between 1846-1948. Anubis is a small republic located in the region of Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan. It is named after the canine-headed Egyptian god of the dead. Lycaon is located in the area of North Serbia and South Hungary. Like Canis, it used to be a Communist republic, and before that, a kingdom and even earlier a principality. The capital city of Canis is located in the area of the city of Kashgar. The capital of Angamanain and Nacumera, where the country\u2019s king resides with his mother, is in the area of Port Blair. The capital of Kashmir lies between Srinagar and Jammu. The capital of Anubis is in the Halaib area. The capital of Lycaon is in the area of Novi Sad. All these countries are part of the United Nations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to Cassie. \u201cOne of my friends, Cassie, is a canine, specifically a dog. Her father works in the police, her mother works in the civil service, she has 4 siblings - an identical twin sister, Jenny, an older brother, Kevin, a older sister, Suzanne, and a younger brother, Lucas. They live in the house next door to mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the United States and certain other nations, canines have many of the same rights as humans, able to vote in elections, hold jobs, interact with humans, form groups and move freely. It is possible for a human to adopt a canine as long as it is a dog. In fact, Australia has a state controlled by dingoes, where the Northern Territory would be. In all areas, romance is possible between humans and canines, but they produce infertile offspring in all cases.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you\u2019re done, you turn to look at Cassie. While one of her heads is still there, her body is now that of a human female like something out of <i>Mars Attacks!</i>, and she wears a blue t-shirt, navy trousers and red running shoes. Beside her is a similar woman who has a similar head and is wearing a similar outfit. You correctly assume this is Jenny, the twin you created, and that she formed from Cassie\u2019s second head.</span></div></div>",

The virus thrives by acquiring DNA from humans and then implanting it in other Animals. Scientists are still not sure why this virus need to do all this back and forth, but everyone is surprised by the results. All the infected Animals in the span of a couple of weeks assume definite anthropomorphic characteristics, like opposable thumbs, bipedal stance, more humanised face features and chest breasts in the females. This latter characteristic is especially weird in non- mammal species like snakes, that come to resemble the mythical creature known as a naga. Some of the worst cases encountered yet caused a variation of the subjects' diet towards a more omnivorous one or the subject to developing, lenghtening and/or chance of color of hair on the head. The virus doesn't affect the animal's size. No known affected specimen developed speech or any increase of intelligence yet, even though they seem to have an eerie increased comprehension of the local human language. The connection to the human source's known languages is yet to demonstrate. What is certain is that they can't or don't want to get around any kind of restraint humans apply to them. Affected dogs, for example, even if now are in posses of perfectly working hands of dexterity comparable to humans, never once tried to get rid of their leashes, collars or any other kind of bind to their freedom. Other experiments carried on affected lab rats, cows and even lizards have shown the inability of them to utilize tools, like before the infection occurred. Strangely though, the affected specimens seem to be interested to dress up, even though they do not seem to be driven by embarrassment or shame. They will put on any clothing article that both fits them and their gender. If they believe the clothes in question belongs to somebody, they tend to hang around the area where they found them, waiting for the supposed owner's approval before going away. They will take off without any problem every clothes they are asked to, if the request comes from the clothes' owner, from the animal's owner or one of the members of the owner's 'pack', from a caretaker or if they feel like it. They will however not hand back the clothes to somebody that's not the owner or caretaker of either the animal or the clothes.<br>\r\nLastly, flying animals and sea creatures seem to be immune to the virus, and thus haven't been affected in any way.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nYou put the date of a couple of months back  at the end of the paper and save the document.<br>\r\nAfter a couple of seconds, you hear a big whoosh around you and your room seems to spin.<br>\r\nWondering if it worked you get to the kitchen, just in time for the news. One of the leading titles is about the new researches that scientists are doing on birds to find the immunity factor, how the virus managed to affect existing anatomy, if there was a way to control the virus to be able to affect existing anathomy to archieve, say, true genetic gender change or drastic variations in anathomy, like multiple heads, limbs regrowth and all the like, and to make sure that the virus wasn't going to mutate humans too.<br>\r\nAt the end of the article, somebody joins you in the kitchen.

You decide you want to add them to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you must specify what your world\u2019s newest inhabitants are. Before typing anything, you go online and find a Reddit post on cynocephali in a fantasy setting (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/7nq7zj/cynocephali_the_dog_headed_people/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/c...</a>). You see a man with a Airedale Terrier\u2019s head In what you believe to be 1910\u2019s or 1920\u2019s get-up, a woman with a Labrador\u2019s head in Victorian or Edwardian dress, a North African man with a Jackal\u2019s head, an Australian Aboriginal man with a dingo\u2019s head, a Inuit/Eskimo woman with a wolf\u2019s head and a Native American woman with a coyote\u2019s head. You copy the details written on the creatures on a piece of paper, since this will be the last time you see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to Word, you start writing your alternations to the world. \u201cThe cynocephali are an intelligent species which are native to Earth, sharing it with humans,\u201d you type, \u201cThey are essentially humans with dog heads, although they vary from place to place. A cynocephalus may have the head of any member belonging to the genus<i>Canis</i>, and the body of any human race. Cynocephali are classified under their own genus, <i>Cynocephalus</i>, and are divided into several species: <i>Cynocephalus lupus</i>, the Eurasian cynocephali (also collectively known as \u2018werewolves\u2019, \u2018wolfmen\u2019, wolf cynocephali or lupocephali), who have the heads of any member of the wolf species <i>Canis lupus</i>; <i>Cynocephalus coyote</i>, the American cynocephali, (also known as the coyote cynocephali), who have the heads of any member of the coyote species <i>Canis latrans</i>; <i>Cynocephalus chacal</i>, the African cynocephali (also known as the jackal cynocephali), three genetic related subspecies who have the heads of the various jackal species, the golden jackal (<i>Canis aureus</i>), the black-backed jackal (<i>Canis mesomelas</i>) and the side-striped jackal (<i>Canis adustus</i>); <i>Cynocephalus dingo</i>, the Australian cynocephali (also known as the dingo cynocephali), who have the heads of the dingo species, <i>Canis dingo</i>, and are one of only two cynocephalus species without racial variety concerning human bodies as they all boast the bodies of Australian Aboriginals; <i>Cynocephalus simensis</i>, the Ethiopian cynocephali who have the heads of Ethiopian wolves (<i>Canis simensis</i>) and the other cynocephalus species without racial variety regarding human bodies as they have the bodies of native Ethiopians; <i>Cynocephalus anubis</i>,  the Anubi (also known as the Egyptian cynocephali), which have the heads of African golden wolves (<i>Canis anthus</i>); and <i>Cynocephalus canis</i>, the youngest species, the true cynocephali. By some unknown means, the true cynocephali have developed a biological mechanism that causes their heads to mimic that of any breed of domestic dogs, explaining their other name of \u2018dog cynocephali\u2019. The natural ranges of the Eurasian cynocephali, the American cynocephali, the African cynocephali, the Australian cynocephali, the Ethiopian cynocephali and the Anubis are closely similar to that of the <i>Canis</i> species that their heads resembles (despite their name, the Eurasian cynocephali are also present in North America, where their heads resemble red wolves, eastern wolves and other American varieties of wolf, as well as Europe and Asia). The true cynocephali first appeared in Asia thousands of years thanks to a mutation in the local Eurasian cynocephali population. Overall, the cynocephali evolved from different species of canine that are now extinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll cynocephali have 62 chromosomes - halfway between the number for humans and the number for dogs. The number includes 30 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and two sex chromosomes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe social behaviour of cynocephali is like that of wolves, coyotes, dingoes or jackals - they operate in packs, although \u2018lone wolf\u2019 cynocephali are not unheard of. They are territorial and often tribal, and act aggressively if threatened or intimidated. Their gestation periods last for five months, and litters are not uncommon. They are good at communicating with canines, and can understand human language. Some have even learnt to speak human language. They are resourceful with tools, and can wear clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYears ago, cynocephali were treated by some humans as barbarians, associated with cannibalism. Others revered them - for example, in Egypt, the Anubi were treated as the emissaries of the god of the dead in Egyptian mythology, who they believed was an Anubis. Today, they have a presence in some cities and towns in many countries, although they typically do not live among humans - understandable, since humans and cynocephali cannot interbreed. There are some cities and towns where they are the only inhabitants. They have their own countries: Canis in the region of western China and Central Asia, Angamanain and Nacumera &amp; Kashmir in South Asia, Anubis in Africa and Lycaon in Europe. Canis has a history of monarchy and empire, but is now a republic that was once under the influence of the Soviet Union and associated Communist government for 40 years. It is currently under fledging democratic government. Angamanain and Nacumera is an island kingdom in the Bay of Bengal, where the Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be. Angamanain is the larger northern island in this island chain; Nacumera is the smaller southern island. Kashmir, in the area of Northern India and Northeast Pakistan, has had a cynocephali ruling dynasty for thousands years, with a brief alignment with Britain between 1846-1948. Anubis is a small republic located in the region of Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan. It is named after the Anubi who rule the area. Lycaon is located in the area of North Serbia and South Hungary. Like Canis, it used to be a Communist republic, and before that, a kingdom and even earlier a principality. The capital city of Canis is located in the area of the city of Kashgar. The capital of Angamanain and Nacumera, where the country\u2019s king resides with his mother, is in the area of Port Blair. The capital of Kashmir lies between Srinagar and Jammu. The capital of Anubis is in the Halaib area. The capital of Lycaon is in the area of Novi Sad. The area that would be Australia\u2019s Northern Territory is controlled by Australian cynocephali, who run an autonomous state under Australian influence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now that you\u2019ve fleshed out your new world, what do you do?</span></div></div>",
