I'm your best friend, Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>I'm</i> Max, his brother!\" The shorter one, Max, proudly stated like he was the president or something. I looked up at the two, my eyes darting from one to the other. My thoughts are all jumbled now, but I began to remember things as they explained them to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, rubbing the back of my neck. I spread my legs out in front of me, sitting in the palm of my best friend's hand like a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed how worried I was, and he brought his hand up to his face so he was eye level with me,\"Hey, don't be like that, Jake. We'll find a way to get you back to normal. In the meantime, though, you should probably stay here with us. If your parents find out, or even the government, they'll probably take you and do some kind of tests on you in a lab. We have to make sure you aren't found. Lucky our parents are on a business trip in Texas,\" He looked beside him at Max, who was in awe at my size,\"Max, I bet he's hungry. You should get him something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed my stomach. Now that he mentioned it, I was <i>starving</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and what would you recommend I make for your three inch tall friend?\" He smirked, his backtalk typical for a thirteen year old. I cringed at his words, feeling slightly offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex gave him a little shove with his other hand,\"Don't talk about him like that, he's a person just like you. And at his size, he could probably eat a small piece of pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPizza? Pizza! He triggered a memory from before, because I had pepperoni pizza just before I began walking to his house! I couldn't remember beyond that, but at least it was a start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, A-Alex?\" I stuttered, nervousness creeping into my smile. He turned his attention towards me, his size intimidating, and I began to slightly sweat. I had to be careful about what I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I stared straight into his huge blue eyes <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's gaze slowly shifted away from mine, and his eyes filled with uncertainty. It gave me the chills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Jake, but I sure hope you'll grow back,\" He looked back at me and gave me a small smile,\"I don't care how small you are, we'll always be friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, he managed to reassure me, even when I knew it was highly unlikely I'd grow back anytime soon. Max walked back over and sat down next to Alex at the table. My huge friend lowered his hand to the table, where I gladly got off. I felt a bit nervous in his hand, mostly because of how far down the drop was. Oh yeah, I'm afraid of heights by the way, so I was panicked more than usual in his unstable hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, even at your tiny height, you seem to be taking this in fast,\" Max handed me a piece of pizza on a little square of paper towel. The small piece to them wasn't even a bite, but it was like two slices of pizza to me. I guess being three inches tall does have it's perks. He leaned in closer to where I was standing, placing his right arm at the edge of the table,\"I mean, you're literally three inches tall. How have you not broken down yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex glared at him and said sternly, warning his little brother,\"Max, shut up. He's been through enough-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, it's alright,\" I interrupted the giant, giving him a grin. He closed his mouth, his smile returning. I walked over to Max, looking up at him more every step of the way,\"I haven't broken down because I hate seeing other people suffer from my actions. I don't want anyone else to feel guilty because of what's happened to me, this is my problem. Everything happens for a reason, there must be a reason behind this. Sure, it's a pretty weird thing, but I'll get used to it eventually. I'm just happy I wasn't any smaller than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were looking at me, speechless. Alex had a hint of sympathy in his eyes, and Max smiled warmly at me. The little guy always looked up to me, and now he had no choice but to look down on me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Max's eyes tear up, and he looked like he was going to cry. It was hard for him to watch what I was going through, and he couldn't imagine what it felt like to be this small. I walked over to his arm and rubbed it, attempting to calm him down,\"Listen bud, I should be the one crying, not you. Everything's gonna be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, how can you be so sure?\" He lowered his face, his chin resting on the table. He looked hurt and afraid, Alex rubbing his back with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" I approached his face, resting my forehead on the tip of his nose,\"Everything has a bright side, you just have to look hard enough to see it,\" I felt a tear streak down my cheek, my breathing beginning to slow. I closed my eyes, letting Max calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hate seeing you like this. It's hard to look down at you and not fall apart,\" Max breathed onto me, his warm breath stirring in every direction. This was hard for him to swallow, especially since he was so much younger than me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lifted my head from it's position, causing Max to open his eyes. Alex stared at me with worry. I was about an inch away from Max's face, searching for the right thing to say. Luckily, I found it just in time,\"Max, stop worrying. I'm not hurt or anything, so stop looking at me like I am. Just because I'm small doesn't mean I can't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? What can you do at three inches tall?\" Max asked, obviously not thinking. He was always a bit too quick to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought for a moment, then looked up at Alex with a smirk,\"Hide and seek, swimming in orange juice, lots of stuff. I can still watch T.V. and talk to you guys,\" I stared up at Max again, happy to see he finally smiled. He began to see the bright side of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex broke back in,\"What should we do first, then? Might as well make the best out of this,\" He looked back at me with his usual cheery grin. It always made me smile when I saw him like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think we should...\"                      </span></div></div>",

The sixty inch TV looked like a movie screen while standing too close.  Alex turned on the TV, and the volume shook me.  It raddled through my entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lower the volume,\" I say with my hands over my ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, sorry.\"  Alex turns to volume down to 2, it is still loud but I can live with it. The family room is loaded with pictures, I am assuming of their parents, there is a few of me and Alex and a few of Matt. The room is quite large with two big, black leather  couches and a black \"Lazy Boy\".  Alex jumps on the lazy boy and Matt lets me down on the coffee table and leaves.   The table is large, by my standards, and has a huge flower vase in the middle.  The flowers are wilting and petals are on the table, I move some sit with my back against the vase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the screen is cheesy music videos that Alex seems to enjoy. Watching him sing along is entertaining for me as I watch him with a smile. Matt returns from the kitchen with a slice of pizza and a glass of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, want some more pizza?\" he asks and continues on, \"it is different from the pepperoni you had in the kitchen. This is Canadian Bacon with Jalapenos. Mmmmmm, it's a good burn. I brought some water too.\"  He sits on the couch closes to Alex and puts his water on the table I am on.  It sends of a clang that is felt through my tiny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at Matt a memory floods my head of me walking. I am on the sidewalk, my walk is brisk, I am in a hurry. The sun is still out, but it feels dark. I am in a hurry I need to get somewhere, fast. I keep walking, I do not know where I am going, just keep walking.  Am I coming here?  A chill runs up my spine as I sit here remembering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lets out an incredible burp and it brings me back to reality. I am sweating and my breathing has sped up. What is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great, I love jalapenos.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you not breath on me? Your breath stinks.\" complains Alex while wiping the air in front of him.  I start wiping too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA curt knock on the door interrupts are wiping.  The knock is repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My hands are full.\" screams Mary. <br>\r\nContinuing on, Max opens the door.  Mary holding four grocery bags, her purse and laptop hurries in. Alex and Max rush to her aide and end up in the kitchen.  The whole time Max has an anxious look on his face waiting to explode.  I can only hear bits and pieces but she is telling them that their father forgot milk and eggs and will be right back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the calm evening is replaced with the sound of a soft rain.  My mind races back, I am in a fast walk knowing that I am in trouble. I am not going to the trouble, it already found me. Why? Again, my spine is chilled as I recall someone yelling, screaming, at me to get out. The face that is the screaming is familiar, mom? Someone else is also there, I do not see him or her clearly.   My arm is yanked by a powerful grip and I am pushed, thrown outside.  I am lightheaded and stumble over some bushes and realize how I tore my shirt. Was I home? <br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Jake!!\" She says, but it feels as if shouted in my ear as I vibrate and almost fall down. <br>\r\n\"Are you hurt? Have you called your mother?

Fear flooded his face as his eyes widened and he gasped,\"Oh my god. Max, get over here, <i>now</i>,\" Alex ordered his brother, panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you-\" Max started, looking into Alex's hand and straight at me. He froze in horror, the same look of terror forming onto his smaller face,\"Is he-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he is. Get the ruler,\" He walked into the living room with Max, his hand seeming a bit larger than before. My stomach twisted, fear eventually creeping onto my face as well. Was- was I shrinking? I was already three inches tall, how much more did I shrink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex brought his index finger of his other hand beside me. I helped myself up using his finger as support, noticing how big it was. I swallowed hard, fearing how big I actually was now. Max placed the ruler behind me, measuring my height,\"H-half an inch tall,\" He stammered, stunned at how much smaller I had gotten. Max had always looked up to me, like I was his second brother. It was hard for him to look down at my pitiful size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere I just stood in Alex's hand, looking up at the two giants for answers. It didn't look like I was getting any. I sighed, mindlessly leaning back into his index finger. I heaved myself up, sitting on it like it was a bench. Alex smiled at my action. It was probably really funny for him to see me sit on his finger like that. Honestly, I didn't care. I was hungry and tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax finally remembered about the pizza, handing me the tiny piece in a small ripped patch of paper towel. I grinned up at him, even bigger than before,\"Thanks, bud,\" I said a little louder, knowing at my size it'd be hard for him to even hear me. Thankfully he did, and he picked up the towering ruler without breaking a sweat. The full height of the ruler was roughly the size of a house, and watching Max lift it made me feel even smaller and weaker than I actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, just in case mom and dad come back from their trip early, we should probably let you sleep in our rooms,\" Alex started, elbowing Max when he caught his attention wandering somewhere else,\"Who're you gonna stay with tonight? I don't mind who you pick- I just think you should have a say in what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlaying his head on Alex's shoulder, Max annoyed his older brother,\"I just wanna go to sleep soon,\" He complained, Alex shoving him off with an angry glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know who to choose; Alex would be careful with me, but I hated when people acted way to friendly to me. He was treating me like I was a toddler. On the other hand, Max was a bit impulsive, but at least he would treat me like I was seventeen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or it would have been normal- if everything weren't so <i>big</i>. Alex was leading to the bedrooms, where Max and them said their goodnights. Jake still had half of the pizza left over, the slice easily maybe half his body's height in pizza. Alex's door opened with a short screech, the hinges ruined from all of boy's slamming into the door after one stupid game after another. Jake laughed, realizing it was probably the time Max had hit it with his entire back that done it in, an amazing feat considering he was running backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" asks Alex, his voice easily disrupting Jake's thoughts when his voice is as loud as a sports caster. Jake begins to cover his ears, and Alex drops his voice down to a whisper, facing his small friend. \"Oh shit, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Jake says. He climbs onto his two feet and faces Alex's ear, ready to shout. \"Where should I sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want to sleep?\" Alex asks back, letting Jake take in the view of the room.

The bed was off to the side, surrounded by sports posters and the odd cult classic (Repo: The Genetic Opera, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and then something funny: Trolls 2), not that Alex would ever admit to having those in his room. His laptop laid on his bed too, taking up space beside the pillows and blankets. His desk was off somewhere near the window, not exactly crazy messy but all his work was bunched together in a pile that seemed to be as tall as the empire state to Jake. There were also some magazines Jake knew were hidden underneath those papers, and of course some pencils and erasers littering the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah,' Jake realized. 'Alex asked me something.' \"Uh, we can just bundle up some blankets, my man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Alex was trying to get used to Jake, who was holding onto his neck for support and generally way closer to his face than normally. It was an effort, hearing someone breath next to your ear, even if it was someone as small as Jake was now. \"You want me to let you down somewhere?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded, \"Maybe...\"</span></div></div>",

Being this small offered challenges I had never had before and I was eager to test myself against them. I walked to the edge of the table with the idea of jumping off and looked down. Well, notjump, lower myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex reached out to pick me up and I warned him off with a look that said I'll do this myself! I turned around and lowered myself over the edge of the table. The chair below came with a ready made cushion and I let myself drop. The cushion had give and I bent my legs coming to my knees<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and moved to the next level; getting down from the chair. I found a leg and lowered myself as before using the leg as a fireman's pole. I slid to the floor and moved across to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex opened it as I approached while Max went off to do his thing with the Web. The backdraft caused me to sway but I forged ahead moving out the door into the afternoon light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crossed the doorway to the concrete and walked off down the driveway. Alex waited a few seconds and closed the door behind him. One stride put him in front of me and I circled around that foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driveway stretched out in front of me. I got to the end of it circling Alex's feet and turned toward my driveway. Here Alex stopped which allowed me to get a little ahead of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI came to the first crack and discovered that there was a fine wire that would have gone unnoticed had I been bigger. I traced it back the way it came and found that it went underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped and waited. One step and Alex was next to me. I moved over and invited him to bend over. He came down, no muss, no fuss; he was graceful for such a big guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed out the wire and the place where it went underground and he moved to unearth it. \"Don't touch it! And don't cross it either! I did and look at me, now! How do you test a wire for current? I need to know if there's a field here.</span></div></div>",

The ground trembled every time his foot came down; couldn't he be more considerate of my predicament?<br>\r\n\"I can go check my dad's tools,\" Alex said with a look of desperation. \"He has a meter in there, but I'm not sure how to use it...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it's worth a shot. We might be able to find the instructions online.\"<br>\r\nAlex seems to mull this over for a bit, then says, \"Yeah, all right. It's only been a few minutes, but maybe Max found something by now. Let me carry you back; I don't want to step on you, and you already found something suspicious.\"<br>\r\nI had to swallow my pride before I let the giant who called himself my best friend pick me up again. I gave him a nod, then a thumbs up, as he didn't seem to see my head move. Being tiny in such a massive world is difficult. And spooky; I saw an ant roaming through the grass, and it looked like a small dog. An angry small dog, at that.<br>\r\nThe world rushed past me as Alex dragged me up towards his chest. If I never got back to my old self, whoever that might be, I figured I could get used to free rides everywhere.<br>\r\nWe made it back to the door in a few gigantic strides. Once we were inside, Alex shouted, \"Max, we found a clue! Did you find anything on the internet?\"<br>\r\nThere were a few moments of relative silence as Alex made his way towards the stairs leading down to the basement. <br>\r\n\"Well, there's a superhero that can shrink himself and keep all his strength,\" Max said from the computer room down the hall. \"Can Jake hurt you with a punch? or smash an airplane?\"<br>\r\n\"How would being tiny let him crush a plane? Ugh, nevermind. We don't have time for your antics!\"<br>\r\nAlex stomped down the stairs, jostling me around so much that I yelped. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"My little brother just gets me so mad sometimes!\"<br>\r\nI couldn't remember if I had any siblings, but I was too shaken up to ask. When we finally made it to the basement, Alex had to fumble around in the darkness for the light switch. \"I don't come down here very often,\" he said as the cold, grey room lit up. <br>\r\nThere wasn't much to see; grey, concrete walls, washer and dryer, and a little work bench. Alex walked over to the work bench and put me down on it. The basement felt freezing, and I had to jog on the spot to keep warm. Alex seemed to be wary of going through his dad's stuff. I wondered if he had gotten in trouble for it before. He started pulling open drawers and cabinets, muttering to himself all the while.<br>\r\nI decided to snoop around myself. It was easy for me to sneak into little openings and cracks, so it only made sense that I would find the meter first. It was huge! Even if I had been my normal size, it would have seemed big. The big black plastic clamp on top of it looked like it could crush me.<br>\r\n\"I found it!\" I shouted from the little cupboard I had crawled into.<br>\r\nAlex walked over to me, opened the cabinet, then cocked his head. \"I guess dad got a new meter,\" he said, confusion written all over his face.<br>\r\nA quick search of the room failed to turn up any instructions for it, but the big buttons on it seemed clear enough. Science classes came back to me as I remembered that current was measured in Amps. I used to like science class. <br>\r\nAlex grabbed the meter then scooped me up in his other hand. It wasn't until we were back upstairs that I realised he had left the light on in the basement. I didn't want to waste any more time, so I kept my mouth shut as Alex jogged back to the front door.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think I found something,\" Max shouted, just as Alex grabbed the doorknob. \"For real, this time!\"</span></div></div>",

I didn't want your pity, and you know I was getting enough of that since that was the year my parents were getting divorced. So, I started getting into... weird shit. I started listening to rap. I started... talking to people online, that you didn't know about.

It turns out he had been using like five-hundred accounts to trick people into meeting up with him, all before he was finally IP banned.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was over... the thing didn't work, and it was all done. Except, the next day... Different parts of my body were smaller, larger, you get it? My left foot was the size of a pinkie. That kind of shit happened for like... five minutes, usually. And then it'd go away. It... Before now, it hadn't happened for five years. I thought it was done, but now look at me. And it's all his fault! OTC, or... his real name, <b>Hayden Hoskin Troy</b>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked at Alex, his feelings indiscernible. Max, on the other hand, seemed to be taking this in strides. \"Do you think it's possible he travelled up to Canada <i>and </i>Sibera? If he really was ten years old like you say he is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nods, \"He met up with <i>me</i>, and he lives over in Delaware.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless he was lying about that too, like how he lied about everything.\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turns to face Alex, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying, he lied about his age, his powers, his whole reason for getting you to know him are- are lies, dude. Are you sure you're not giving him more credit than he deserves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why I am so small right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shrugged, \"I'm not saying you're wrong, but... it could be genetics, like those articles said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax had been listening intently. Jake was sure it was OTC, whereas Alex thought it could be genetics. Max... was 50/50. And it seemed like he would be the deciding point. All articles pointed towards latent homeopathic survival skills, something backed up by scientists and particularly radical therapists alike, many who have noted one human's inane skill of planting his head in the ground like an ostrich as proof that human beings have hidden survival tactics never before seen.... Like shrinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Max knew Jake. And no scientist had heard of OTC or his medallion. It could be the medallion all along, and if they met up with the other infected shrinkers they might have a lead. If any of the other shrinked people have ever heard of OTC, or someone like him... that could be all it would take to prove it was some weird ancient artifact changing them... Maybe laced with special ancient medicine meant to induce shrinking of the cells?</span></div></div>",

The ground is uncomfortably far away from where I am, while the hand of the giant wavers much closer then I'd prefer. He's asking me to trust him, but my heart's beating so loud I can't think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a deep breath though, I realize that if these large creatures wanted to hurt me, they could have flattened me within seconds.  Nonetheless, I don't like the way they are observing me, as if I'm the strange one.  I square my shoulders and cross my arms, trying to appear brave.  \"Look,\" I say, and find myself yelling so that they can hear me from all the way down here, \"I don't know why you people are so large or even where I am. All I know is that something is seriously messed up and if you know what's going on I'd appreciate the help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't understand why they continue peering at me so quizzically. Slowly, I inch away just to be on the safe side. Then, the younger one speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know just as much as you know, Jake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to figure out if he is telling the truth or not.  I don't know Jake at all, so that means we are each pretty clueless.  I eye the taller giant, hoping he knows something, but a look of confusion flashes across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just too weird,\" he mumbles, \"We need to like, look for some clues or something.  You know, like people always do when their friends end up shrunk in stories.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or call mom and dad,\" suggests the younger one, reaching in his pocket and taking out a cell phone of some sort. I thought the Samsung Galaxy Note was big, but this phone blows that one out of the water and into outer space.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not feeling very reassured by either of these guy's shaky planning, but I nod as if I think they sound very intelligent. As they begin to argue I start pacing from one end of this surface to the other.  My mind probes my own mind trying to find any useful information in its emptiness.  Although I discover only specks of memories floating like dust in my mind, I <i>do</i> discover something that practically screams CLUE.  As I near the edge of this platform, an enormous square of paper catches my eye.  It seems to glow white against the blue tile floor.  I hesitate pointing it out to my new, abnormally sized acquaintances, but realize again there's no way I can get down from here without ending up in the hospital. Not that I won't end up in the hospital for some other reason being around such large people.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clear my throat and each giant turns to face me.  \"Umm, there's a note down there,\" I say and the older guy leans over to see.  He seems pleased to have found a \"clue,\" but then then younger giant reaches out and grabs his arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should call Mom and Dad now, Alex.\"          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But that wasn't what the hummingbird had in mind.

I couldn't help but SEE the GIANT change in you - <i>oops</i>! Sorry, I didn't mean to use that particular word - just know - <i>something happened to you a little while ago</i>, and I thought to zoom around and make myself available in case some blue jay or starling tries to commit bloody murder against you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!

You got your bestie here with that pain in the neck lil brother along for the thrill! I can even see that ....<i>that</i>....whatchamacallit there - a \"space ship\", yes? It looks pretty plain and simple from the outside looking in, if I may say so.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked around as Max began to look at him quizzically, then peered around the bushes, the trees, along the entire length of the driveway itself. Max began thinking that Jake was beginning to <i><b>lost it too!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, 'HUMMER'! Is it okay if I call you that? Look...uhh....Hummer, I got a problem, as you already can tell. My bud Alex already has a plan with entering that <i>spaceship</i> over there - (Jake points to the plain silver/chrome finish of a saucer) - and he and Max now are taking me over to greet whomev- I mean <i>WHATEVER</i> this THANG is that changed me into the world's first Uber Midget!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thang?!

Well...I can do som much MORE than your drone, even though I admit to some jealousy here! Hold tight, Jake - I'll be right back...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now <i>BOTH Alex and Max</i> were openly wondering what the devil was Jake DOING, talking to himself? Both brothers searched high and low for the source of Jake's very apparent interest ... nothing doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake. JAKE! Hey man!\", said Max, completely now worried beyond words as to just <i>did Jake go from making perfect sense to ...well....perfrect NON-sense, so to speak.

Only....there were NO FANS out here in the diriveway, that much tye could tell themselves! It was in that instant that all three stood shocked out of their minds, for it was HUMMER alright, HUMMER with the classic green emerald feathers and that strong bright red ruby necklace that filled out his neck...only now it shimmered in the light, and it each one of these guys it was like something that they could never had guessed as to what it was that suddenly came upon them all too quickly ! Oh my gawd said Max over and over, too scared to move..... it <i>was</i> too good to be true. In the split minute that  Hummer had flown off to the spaceship to hover over and around it he had reutrned, now in a sense of the word HUGE....GIANT-SIZED ... was this bird who usually was no more than three or so inches in length and or width. AM I TOTALLY LOSING MY MIND, thought all three boys, sllently at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then it hit them like a ton of proverbial bricks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was in that chrome-bright ship just off the driveway certainly could do whatever it pleased with any citizens of this earth it encountered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they made their point quite convincingly too. Just ask Jake, who once was almost six feet tall ... now shrunk to a \"robust\" 3 inches tall? And Hummer, himself one moment ago was just that - 3 inches all told - now <i>back from the space ship</i> - and without question, hovering just above the boy's line of sight and directly in the sunshine for all .... himself the world's <i>first six foot high hummingbird?!?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake of course was not taking all of this in just at that moment. After all, the three of them had gone into the spaceship so very briefly... in fact....now that they had time to reflect on it, neither of them could exactly recall <i>what they had seen that time they DID go inside of the ship itself....!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on them that not only did a sudden kind of amnesia occur to them within the last five or so minutes, but furthermore, they had seen another miraculous development right before their eyes the exact moment they WERE discussing the visual banks of equipment onboard and such. The arrival of Hummer, who by now had scared away at least ten cats, two dogs, along with a huge flock of crows that let loose with a racket of cawing they usually reserve for when they've spotted a hawk or owl raiding one of their nests....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time a miracle happened within/around them, they would lose their memories of what they had seen, heard, smelled, touched and/or tasted within that ship. It was one solid fact that certainly held them to a very limited series of choices they faced whereby the boys truly wanted to get Jake back in the same shape he had left them previously. Good ol Jake....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Perhaps you need to consider the fact that by changing me into a six foot hummingbird could very well mean that they are sending you a very clear message ... I mean... its practically in front of your very own eyes as we speak!\"</i>, said Hummer, who now had mounted a low-level telephone wire that went directly into the garage of the house. It was clear that Hummer was going to need camouflaging too, if the world honestly needed to be kept away from THE MOST amazing discovery since Roswell, New Mexico in 1948.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the humming bird speak English send Max and Alex running as hard as they could for the front door, but Jake squeaked just loud enough for them to hear before pushing in the door - hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment guys!,\" Jake squeaked with all his might. \"Hummer is right! We have to <i>reflect on all that has happened. It will do us no good to up and run away from our problem as we speak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Alex and Max walked back to where Jake had fixed himself a makeshift chair out of redwood chips and a green maple leaf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys got over the sincere fright that Hummer had provided them so precipitously, it was Hummer who suggested that if these aliens could shrink and/or enlarge any living thing....why, could them make three people into <i>two</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould they recombine two humans into one? Three into two?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought process started to truly make their heads spin, that is until they realized to their greater shock that two people were standing nearby, right around the corner within the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary had overheard what she could not believe her ears had relayed to her: her two sons speaking of huge hummingbirds and space ships and such: Max of course was getting past the point whereby <i>flying saucers</i> were deemed way too insincere for a kid to believe in - not unlike Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny or other creatures of this world. She had put her paper down and had cracked open the garage door, only this time to witness something she simply could not  make hide nor hair over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her two sons speaking to a three inch tall human being of the exact likeness of their bestest friend - Jake!!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning to get her husband, Philip, she arrived to see him standing by the window, staring mutely and utterly transfixed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There on the telephone wire sat perched a six foot tall hummingbird, in all of its glorious emerald green and red-sashed necklace.</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip's pipe had struck the floor, the contents of which were still lit, creating a small circular fire in Mary's extremely expensive persian rug. Mary immediately noticed, as she retrieved the pipe and stamped out the burning contents on the rug itself , that Philip never even acknowledged her the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, mouth agape and finger pointing, she now approached him from the side. Immediately he drew her to his side, and she followed his unbending arm and pointed digit which clearly marked the most amazing bird ever to fly the skies of North America...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding her head ever-so-slowly, she now crooked a finger at him silently, beckoning him to come and witness what it was she had seen and heard just outside the garage moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving moments later, they both peered out to see the figures of both boys disappearing into the woods, going <i>exactly where</i> no one could possibly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither parent knew it just yet, but it would be awhile before they'd see their sons again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A long, long while....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i></i></i></span></div></div>",

He wasn't even as tall as the pocket he now occupied...\"what the heck had happened to him?\" He wondered reaching for the top. It was just out of his reach, and no matter how much he tried to stretch himself it was just that much to high.<br>\r\nHe tried shouting to Alex, but his voice was to soft was muffled by the material in the pocket.<br>\r\nHow could he communicate with Alex and Mat if they couldn't hear him.<br>\r\nThe answer he realized was in his pants pocket..His cell phone....which had shrunk with him. <br>\r\nHe dialed Alex's number....it went straight to voice mail...and Alex's voice boomed like a cannon...knocking him off his feet. Ordinary noises were to loud for his now tiny ears.  He had to find a way soften the decibels.  He gathered as much lint and dust in the palm of his hand as he could, wet it with spit, and flattened it into a patty and placed it over the phones speaker. He dialed Mat's number. Mat picked up after two rings...Jake buddy...how are ya....We got your back bro, we're going to figure this out and get you back to your old self. Muting the speaker had worked and Jake could listen without his ears being blown out....still slightly loud, but manageable. just as Jake was about to respond  He heard Alex calling Mat excitedly in the background...Mat get over here quick....I think I found something. Mat hadn't turned off his cell and Jake could hear their conversation as clear as a bell....they had obviously found something significant, but what? suddenly Alex's voice boomed in the phone... Jake you won't believe what we found...Its the strangest thing I've ever seen....I'm pretty sure its the source of your problem. I'm going to bring you out so you can take a look at it and see if it helps you remember anything....We aren't touching it though just in case it shrinks us as well. If that happens we're really in trouble...Alex reached into his shirt pocket, and gently lifted Alex out..The bright sun stung his eyes a bit but it felt good to finally be out of Alex's lint filled pocket....\".Show me what you guys found\" he whispered into the phone...... Hoping it was the key he needed.</span></div></div>",

This is so weird and seems so familiar but I can't place my finger on it.  It's right there, on the tip of my tongue.<br>\r\n\"It seems too strange to ignore.  Let me down\" I whisper into my phone.  I'm lowered and with a small leap, I land softly onto the gravel.  I lean in and take a sniff.  Smells like a cupcake.  I poke at the side.  It feels like a cupcake.

Perfect in every way.  I feel it pass through my digestive system and actually get a bit nauseous.  I realized I'm starving.  It all passes pretty quick and I get a wave of pleasure emanating from my center.  Pulsing like a heartbeat pushing the bliss in straight lines away from my heart.
