There is a powerfull emotion in them, as they look scornfully at the horizon in anticipation, in preparation.<br>\r\nShe spreads her wings and looked up to the moons of Alexandria that were still visible to her, yes, she\u2019d need him, but would he need her, after all this time, after all these long years, after twenty one bitter cold and lonely years of dragon tear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew most of Men here looked at the rising suns, reflecting its red off the snowy plains which turns some of the numerous clouds a pink color, but she knew other than that, she knew that beyond this mask of beauty, the suns were grieving, grieving for countless lost in this futile, damn unequal war.<br>\r\nHe was lost to her, the only dragon she ever would love enough without having to look into black or green eyes. No, she\u2019d not submit herself to the fate of unlovingness from another, she\u2019d kill them as soon\u2019d she see them, for they would be undeserving of her, they would only destroy her.<br>\r\nYet... As she looks over the plateau and rears herself for her song, before she broke the silence with her agonizing, self-destructive scream, she could see him again, but only for a while, his blue eyes, glad to see her again, his wings beating furiously to get to her, his words whispering in silence that she\u2019d not need do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, she called to the sky, her song were broken words, the grief of twenty one long years, the words of the countless that had sacrificed themselves in greed, for love. He told her that she should stay behind, because he loved her too much to let her participate in something that Men would lose, to get involved in something that may kill hundreds of thousands of dragons, where betrayal seemed inevitable, where death is surely waiting poised.<br>\r\nYes, he told her to stay.<br>\r\nThey should have died together, they should have wept under each other\u2019s embrace before the darkness layed claim to them in their last words, their last song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh Death!</i> She started. <i>Oh Death! Thee merciless farmer, thoust with haste and thy bitter taste. I spat at thee, thee who has taken my love forever, thee has layed claim to his rainbow heart!</i><br>\r\nHer red eyes, started to shimmer with her tears, her head raised to the sky once more as the wind takes her undying words.<br>\r\n<i>Death, how can I reason, bring back his life? Death, how can you tear all this away from me, there is none other like he! Death, I beg of ye, be merciful, bring him back to me... <br>\r\nI ask of you this...<br>\r\nOut of sorrow.<br>\r\nOut of bitterness, for I can\u2019t find him, I can\u2019t find him in the shadows...</i> She wept, wings open, head to the ground, eyes blood red. Please... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis song, this song repeated so many times that day, was carried windward to every planet\u2019s range and in the winds they\u2019d stay. Yes, she cried, she sang out her soul to the wind, she was dying, breaking apart with a sad heart, a lost heart.<br>\r\nHer white body shimmered so beautifully that day, scorn, worn.<br>\r\nHer agony was not unheard, those who listened to the wind grew fond of this, weeping in silence, weeping their own bitter way, if they could change this, they would have brought them together.<br>\r\nWould have brought them together forever.<br>\r\nAlas, they couldn\u2019t. For it was not for them to decide.<br>\r\nHer words were carried through the edges of timeless space, echoing and sad, repeated with the suns of ages past. He\u2019s death would be known, he made a sacrifice to save her from his fate,<br>\r\nbut what is she without her life-mate?<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the suns began to set and the red sky once more returned, she could only look up with burnt eyes, dried tears smeared her dragonface, her wings sunk low to the ground, around her the snow gave way to fresh flowerbed, she wanted to give this world something for its kindness onto her, where she is to fall, her blood would fertile the ground, and she would sing for one last time, to the sky, to him... For him. <br>\r\n<i>Der Drakes... Oh, Der Drakes...</i> She wept, looking downward, prepared to tear open her chest and tear out her already lost heart to sing once more, her undying song of undying loyalty.<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, a familiar scent filled her world, made her head spin, her heart race.<br>\r\nCould it be, is this some kind of cruel dream?<br>\r\nShe looked at the horizon, a silhouette of a franctically flying dragon was there, one with a familiar voice, one that called to her, one with promise never to lose her again, not like he had... Then she heard his voice, a touch of ageless love bound in it.<br>\r\n<i>As I look down at the plateau...</i> He said, <i>I see you were loyal to me, your sound and your eyes once more my life, my world. Oh, Th\u00e9ros Ag`dron... My love, my life...</i> He landed beside her, she looked at him, crying once more, and he nuzzled her...<br>\r\n<i>I will not leave you again...<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve returned, is it really you?<br>\r\nYes, it is...</i><br>\r\nShe licked his face, tenderly.<br>\r\n<i>I thought you were lost to me...<br>\r\nI got a second chance... I got a second life, because of you, my love...</i> His voice comforted her. <i>I won\u2019t leave you again, I promise. With the end to this wretched war, we can rest at night, in peace...</i><br>\r\nHer eyes swirled with colors...<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Der Drakes... I mourned your passing.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s over now, I\u2019ve returned.</i> He comforted.<br>\r\nShe got up with his support, as she was weak from the singing, weak from the loss she nearly had, weak in ways she could never understand... He comforted her with reassuring clicks and thoughts, telling her it will be alright, that this was not a crazy dream, that this is real, that he has really returned to her, without a doubt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were red, they both looked at the suns set in the west, yes, it was glorious, yes there was peace at last. But so many were lost, Men and dragon both suffered great and staggering losses.<br>\r\nBroken and half completed dragon songs echoed in the wind. Her\u2019s was the most audible, as part of her soul was lost there, too.<br>\r\n<i>They gave me another chance, they gave you me...</i> She told him, as her red eyes looked at him. <i>But I still feel empty within, something I\u2019ve never felt before in my life...</i> His eyes, still red in mourning; she could sense his confusion also. How can one be truly alive, here, and not in a dream when you were dead not so long ago?<br>\r\nShe looked at him, her head over his shoulder at the back of his neck, on his folded wings.<br>\r\n<i>I love you, in ways we\u2019d both never understand.</i>He looked at her.<br>\r\n<i>I know you do, I know you do...</i> He giggled to her, and licked her reassuringly, tempted to follow her emotions, as both of them were suddenly overwhelmed with a soaring passion that forced them to open their wings. Her eyes became blue, so bright blue that he could see his children in her eyes, the ones that would fulfill her life, and his... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spread their wings wide and jumped together, beating furiously with the beating of the setting suns, with the wind\u2019s sorrowful sounds behind them almost rhythmical, almost mystical.<br>\r\nBoth eyes were so blue now, so blue that one would think they were stars, and still they flew higher, higher they soared, into the clouds, over the clouds.<br>\r\n<i>I love you.<br>\r\nI love you too.</i> She replied, as both of them clasped their hind talons together, as both their nostrils touched in a kiss, as both their tails entwined, and they aimed for the ground, but they knew that they trusted each other. They loved each other dearly.<br>\r\nWings folded close to their bodies, they dropped.<br>\r\nBody upon body, circling, spiraling...<br>\r\nThe wind in their eyes, as he penetrated her, she relished it, she comforted in it.<br>\r\nFaster, faster they flew downward, spiraling, they both opened their wings in an instant, and bolted upwards, seperating and coming together again, out of breath, landing on one of the peaks and roaring a victorious roar, hearts beating furiously, pulsing the love between them, creating a delighted atmosphere, he looked down, jaws open, looking at her, she, doing the same, so out of breath, so full of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both felt filled by this, she huddled close to her mate, he, once more, gave her a reassuring and tender lick over the side of her head. She giggled in whisper to him, as he did the same, trying to control as much of him as possible, as they both felt joyful, completed at last, after twenty one years she had her life-mate return to her from the ashes like a phoenix and he had a future now with a love for her that had the undying fires of undying passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
