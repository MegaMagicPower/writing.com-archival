You and Rosekit are 4 moons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You roll up a ball of moss and say to Rosekit, \"Hey Rosekit, wanna play Mossball?\" \"Ok, how about we do it outside,\" She replied. You nod and you and Rosekit walk outside. Rosekit made you jump, \"I go first!\" You pass the ball to her and she bats it over your head. It lands in front of Clawtail and he bats it back to Rosekit. Then you hear a screech from outside of camp. Rosekit squealed and ran to Sparrowfeather. Clawtail pricked his ears and ran in the direction of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, he returns with a black tom with white paws. Blood was dripping from his neck all the way down to his right back leg. He was wounded very badly. That cat was Nightstar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",
