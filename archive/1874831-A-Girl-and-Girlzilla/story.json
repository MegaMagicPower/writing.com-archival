You could say that she is somewhat goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality:Vivian is a very grim girl who likes creepy stuff like the grim reaper and horror films. She is a positive person, but not a happy go lucky type meaning she does smile. She occasionally has a sadistic side in her since she watch too much horror flicks, novels and other stuff related to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Vivian is a goth girl that is not really goth since she is somewhat cheerful, but not straight on. She is often bullied by her peers for being too creepy and how Vivian always scare people around her. Until she met her monster self, she lived a decent live with a caring family. Just terrible classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster<br>\r\nName: Grim(Name given by Vivian)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: Can alter in size, but when she wants to be very big, she is often about 175ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothes: Similar to Vivian, but more sinister and look more like a ragged dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: She has the power over darkness and can manipulate shadows. She could also steal souls of any kind which she rarely does unless she needs to in order to protect Vivian or her owner says so. Vivian can either torture the souls or talk to them. Occasionally the souls would dissolve inside of Grim for a while and more on to the afterlife. Victims won't be dead unless Grim uses her ability to destroy the body or after staying inside of Grim for long periods of time. For the record, Grim often releases the souls about a minute or so later unless they are truly evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Unlike Vivian, Grim is more of a cute cuddly shadow girl that has to live with Vivian in order to survive. She is more of a happy go lucky person, but if you make her angry, she becomes more sinister that evil Vivian is afraid of her. However Grim is very friendly if you let her be and not mess with her. She also deeply cares for her owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther info: Due to her origin and how she came upon mortal world, there are giant shadow creatures that followed will attack and Grim and Vivian will have to face them. Also Grim could giggles in a growling way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: The military were testing something beyond the mortal world and as a result created a shadow like creature that escapes killing some solders in the process. The creature could not live in the sunlight without a host and that's when she met Vivian. She disguised herself as her shadow and revealed herself when the girl was alone. And so Grim stays with Vivian as her shadow and would grow about 175ft if a giant threat appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She tried to hide from the public and disguises herself as other shadows. It was daylight so she needs a host to stay alive. When suddenly she was caught by Vivian, the girl who is the main protagonist of this story, in an alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at the Shadow Kaiju move and the girl showed no fear except some excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, are you like a shadow monster? I never met a monster in real life.\", asked Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow nodded and seem to like her a bit more. She then shrunk down to Vivian size and act as her shadow, The shadow then looked at Vivian with some interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need a host. Well you can live with me if you want since your pretty friendly and cool. Also my name is Vivian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow was happy to hear this, but suddenly a boy appeared and pushed Vivian. He was pretty big and all. Vivian stumbled back and gazed at the bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking to purple?\", asked the bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to harass the young girl until the shadow had enough. The shadow grew at tall height or as tall as a regular Kaiju girl. The shadow formed a beast like form and roared. The whole place got dark and the bully decided to run. The shadow grabbed him and ate him whole. She then spits him out as he flew out of the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alley then turned from a hellish darkness place to a regular alley. The Shadow then shrunk down and in the shape of Vivian again. The girl was amazed at that and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow your so amazing. Where were you in my life?\", asked Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow gave a gesture of modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a name?\", asked the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow shock her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I name you Grim based on what you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow nodded with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrim followed Vivian like most shadows do and then went to a home that has bight colors. Apparently it really contrast with Vivian's dark shade of clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to you new home Grim.\", said Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow looked at the bright furniture which made it flinch a bit. The girl notice this and then guided the shadow to her room which is the exact opposite of what the house it. Vivian's room is filled with horror based things such as action figures, DVD sets, posters, books, and all kinds of weird stuff. The shadow seems to like this more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like my room. Sorry if you don't like the rest of my house. My parents has this taste for bright colors.\", said Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far her parents aren't home and she has homework which she finishes first as fast as she could while trying to entertain Shadow a bit. She let Grim play with her action figures and tries to make sure that they don't break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that's done, she then found a note on the refrigerator that says that her parents are out for the night and dinner is in the fridge. She thought about watching a horror flick on T.V. and eat popcorn instead of leftovers. She could do this with a friend for once since Grim wasn't afraid of her like most people. Then suddenly a thought strikes through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could use Grim's powers to get back at the kids in school. They always have bullied her about her interest and how she is a witch. She might take sometime to plan her revenge. So Vivian thought about...</span></div></div>",

Besides, getting revenge would make her be just as bad as those people in school. She prepares the popcorn and got Grim with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns on the television showing Grim her favorite movie, \"The Monster Mist\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my favorite movie because everyone turns into a monster because of mist. Man I wish I can be a monster. I don't care how inconvenient it is.\", said Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrim should some gestures and growls on how she should appreciate on how she looks since Grim like looking like Vivian. The girl had some hard time listening to her and then the girl passed the popcorn. Grim grabbed a handful and at some and like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it. Have some more.\", said Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow Kaiju grabbed more popcorn and proceeded in watching the movie. So far it features a girl turning into a beast and being attacked by people who are also slowly turning into monsters. This made Grim worried about Vivian based on how her friends treat her. Grim hoped that she could keep her new friend safe since she offered herself to be her host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie, Vivian was happy while Grim hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Grim, its not real. Its just a horror flick.\", said Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrim held on to the girl and then got up from the couch and went to bed. Grim slept next to her host in bed and the lights went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Vivian heard something like a screaming. It sounds as if there was some suffering. It was a dream of course since Vivian knows that she is sleeping. She saw many lost souls crying and moaning and then the girl woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to hear the screaming, but its faint. She got closer to her shadow friend and found out that it was all in there. She shook Grim and asked her about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grim, is it true that you steal people's souls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrim growl with some regret in her voice and showing Vivian on how sorry she is and how she is trying to defend herself.

Could you suck my soul out for a bit and put me back in my body?\", said Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrim shock her head with disappointment, and pointed out that its really dangerous and scary. She even pointed out through gestures that it could really damage her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Grim, thanks for caring for me at least.\", said Vivian, \"I just like creepy stuff like the things in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrim only gave her a thumbs up and then...</span></div></div>",

She had some friends at her school, but she always seemed odd. She does fine at school, but never really stands out. However, one day, she really stood out, when a giant monster came to the city, and came to her school one day. She was frightened at first, but then the monster girl came to her, and it looked just like her.

She did gave the city a huge scare at the time, but the moment she meant Sonia, they became close as sisters. She might be her big sister, but also she is young at the same time, with her inexperiences, but Sonia sure helps her. She also is old like her in the mind because of how much she protects her, and how she means to her in her life now.

She enjoys exploiting her abilities and hates those who prove her wrong making everyone dislike or become scared of her. A mall rat what can't stand any setting that's not a city, she can't stand the fact that she was made to go on a camping trip. But that changed  when she learns about Trish and her ability to partially control her. Since learning that, she envisions herself as an empress with Trish serving as her enforcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster Girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName or Monster Name: Trish aka \"Artemis\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 13<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair style and color: long, silky, dark auburn hair kept up behind her in a high ponytail<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye color: Silver<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkin: olive<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreast size: C<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 500 feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothes: a pale green sleevless vest somewhat similar to a flak jacket with a silvery parka over it, camouflage-patterned pants, and hunting boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: Antimatter Manipulation- able to generate and manipulate antimatter, (comes off her as a violet-glowing energy/aura.), Umbrakinesis-the ability to mentally generate and manipulate darkness, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Links to powers:  <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Antimatter_Manipulation\" target=\"_blank\">http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Antim...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Darkness_Manipulation\" target=\"_blank\">http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Darkn...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality deviations: Since she's a giantess, she's developed a very conservative attitude about things, and (fortunately) a very outdoor-type of personality, she tries to be as pacifistic as possible, given how easy it is for her to hurt others. Rather focused with a much greater understanding of things. She's largely independent and doesn't like being told what to do, since it makes her feel that she's viewed as a means to an end for others to exploit rather than a person. She loves hunting and is highly sympathetic, and weighs individuals by their actions and choices as opposed to their potential. But she can have a rather beastial savagery, coolness, and pitlessness when she's provoked into it. Her powers (specifically her antimatter powers) make her worried for just that reason, since she understand that it is important to note that when matter and antimatter collide, they will both annihilate each other, making this a very dangerous power to both user and target. Because of this, it takes extreme force of will on the part of the user to stop this from happening, and essentially stabilize antimatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther info: Weakness of Lunacy power regulation- her powers increase and decrease accordingly with the moon phases. When there is full moon her powers are at peak capacity. That, added onto her outdoor-type appearance and personality, earned her the nickname \"Artemis\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: A thirteen-year-old girl with a love the outdoors. When she was made a giantess, she found that to serve her best to avoid trouble for \"Normal people\". She'd been trying to gain mastery over her powers since then. Trish tries to avoid normal people when they go camping, but when she learns about Leila, she's horrified to learn that she can upsurt control of her body. </span></div></div>",

The monster was wearing some sort of pale green seleevless somewhat similiar to a flak jacket with a slivery parka over it, campouflafe-patterened pants, and hunting boots. This monster, was none other than Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish was currently hunting for food to keep her from starving to death. She was walking in the direction that they were running, (birds, bears, etc) and soon they reach and opened field, and then that is where the trap was spranged. Somehow there was a big net underneeth the animals and now Trish pulled the trap (don't get me started on dynamics here). The animals were now trapped, and Trish was now ready to start cooking and start eating. However, things were about to get out of hand soon... real soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",
