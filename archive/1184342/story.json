This overpass was pretty high up, so I must be soo tall.  Anyways, the people inside must have shit seeing giant blue eyes peeping at them.  Next thing ya know I see the passengers make a run for it.  I stared onto the roadway; kinda scanning all the cars and watching people flee like ants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBETH:  Go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTARA:  So I put my hands on the roadway and rest my chin on top.  It was the cutest thing just resting there as people ran in complete insanity right below my nose.  Well, then I felt my bikini top start to slip and naturally, instinctively, I dropped my right hand toward my boobs, when my fingers caught on two cars sending them careening into the air, then landing on two SUVs.  The crunch was deafening.  God, people were really upset.  So\u2026this is the best part\u2026I\u2019m totally laughing as I see two people give me the finger.  [Laughing] Holy shit, so I wink at them and ask them in a deep sexy voice\u2026HOW WOULD YOU PEOPLE LIKE IT IF I TIPPED THIS OVERPASS?  That really got people\u2019s attention, since they started running more quickly and anyone left in their useless cars starting getting out.  People were tripping over each other, running on roofs of cars.  WHAT, YOU PEOPLE NEVER SAW A GIANT WOMAN IN YOUR LIFE? WHAT ABOUT THAT CHICK BETH? I asked.  Naturally, no response so I punched a hole in the roadway with my fingers before stomping off.  I could hear the road buckle, so hopefully the damn thing didn\u2019t collapse [Laugh].<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBETH:  Freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTARA:  Is that all you have to say for yourself? Come on, you\u2019re a giant woman.  I know you had fun with those remote control vehicles, so let\u2019s turn up the volume.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBETH:  I did have fun, but I don\u2019t want to hurt too many people.  Ya know, we\u2019re people too! \u2026\u2026Well\u2026..I guess I could do a few more funky things. But nothing that\u2019ll get people killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTARA: [Winking] I gotcha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant Tara Reid had found her way downtown and onto the dark blue raft that so majestically carried the stunning Beth.  They both floated as though not a care in the world, no concern for the collapsed bridge that Beth caused, the panic inflicted by neither Beth\u2019s remote helicopter nor the mayhem Tara had inflicted on Highway 565, resulting in over 50 crushed and overturned cars, two decimated helicopters, five dead people and patches of impassable roadway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, within a one mile radius of the towering duo, the air filled with the arousing scent of cocoa nut sun lotion, female body spray and the hint of feminine sweat. Police cars dotted both sides of the river and police boats watched over the passenger ferries that were the unwitting participants in a perilous waterway partnership.<br>\r\nThe ladies\u2019 blue raft was no ordinary pool variety.  The city, obviously fearful of reprisals by a less than pampered giant, was sure to make the thing as luxurious as possible, fit for a princess.  Think, \u201cPimp My Raft\u201d:  200 feet long by 150 feet wide, two headrests (I suppose they were anticipating the arrival of another giant?), center arms rests that included a built-in sun lotion dispenser, satellite television with over 500 channels and a water jet system to cool the ladies down, perhaps after a hard day of scaring people. At the feet of the lovely giants was a large refrigerated compartment that contained four 50-gallon barrels of fresh water as well as fruit and fresh fish.  Within the headrests was a stereo system replete with ear buds so the women could rock out in privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTARA:  Just look at this view.  The city is just packed with people.  They\u2019re not going anywhere.  Cars are just backed up.  [Scanning the water before them]  Beth, look all the little boats over there.  I think some people are trying to sail off from us giants, but I think the river is also jammed with traffic too.  That bridge over there [Port River Bridge is just 200 yards from them.  It is a newly constructed bridge that sits just 50 feet above the water with two lanes of traffic in each direction.  Some 100 cars sit in traffic as the ladies watch.]  Thos cars seem so small, like toys or something.  Makes me feel like just going over there and playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBETH:  [Mischievous smile on]. Soooo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at that moment when Tara began lifting her silky legs off of the raft, two helicopters and a heavily armed Coast Guard gun boat approached the intimidating beauties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTARA:  Hey Beth, how \u2018bout you blow them out of the sky?  Or throw something at them.  They\u2019re cramping my style.  And since I\u2019m a famous actress I can\u2019t have people crowding my space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBETH:  Easy does big girl.  Let\u2019s give the little people a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth sat back in the raft, carefully scanning both the sky and the water.  The Coast Guard boat found a resting position in the river on Tara\u2019s side of the raft, some twenty feet from the blonde goddess.  The choppers floated fifty feet above them.  Tara followed Beth\u2019s lead, exercising restraint, assessing the situation carefully as the two reclined fully as their heads floated on the headrests and their bodies lay in a complete horizontal position.  Tara\u2019s diamond studs glistened, sometimes blinding the pilots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the mayor,\u201d a voice thundered down from one of the chopper\u2019s PA systems.  \u201cYou can call me Jack, though.  The citizens of Port Town want to make you ladies as comfortable as possible\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara turned to Beth with a sarcastic smirk.  The ladies laughed at the situation as they both positioned themselves higher, resting their elbows and forearms on the raft, kicking up small waves that shake all the boats in the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in unison, the girls wave with a sexy HI, MR. MAYOR.  THANKS FOR THE RAFT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor continued\u2026\u201dMe and the police are willing to work with you to get you to safer ground.  I am concerned that you ladies will get hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and Tara looked at each other in disbelief when Beth countered sarcastically, BUT MR. MAYOR ME AND TARA HERE ARE THE ONES CAUSING ALL THE MAYHEM.  WE MUST HAVE STEPPED ON HOW MANY CARS?  INJURED HOW MANY PEOPLE?  \u201cThat was awesome, girl,\u201d Tara whispered in Beth\u2019s soft ear. Tara squinted as she too began to address the mayor.  I CAN\u2019T THANK YOU PEOPLE ENOUGH FOR THIS LUXURIOS RAFT. GOD, IT\u2019S GOT EVERYTHING TO MAKE A GIRL HAPPY.  BUT I\u2019M AFRAID ALL THIS PAMPERING ISN\u2019T GOING TO INFLUENCE US ONE BIT.  WE\u2019RE STAYING PUT.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned by the women\u2019s bravado, silence fell over the scene like a bad dream when the Chief of Police in the other chopper chimed in angrily, \u201cLadies, we are giving you until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nudged Beth with her elbow to get her attention.  The Chief continued, \u201c\u2026 2 PM to remove yourselves from the river and be escorted\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara and Beth resumed their full reclining position, blatantly ignoring all the people in attendance as the Chief bantered on.  Then, like something out of a really campy horror movie, striking like a freight train and embarrassing all but the giant ladies, KURFPLURP!!! Tara farted.  The thunder was amplified as the sound waves reverberated against the rubber raft, its greasy surface a sounding board for the giants\u2019 antics.  The sound cut off the police chief mid sentence and the sonic boom it created shook the choppers and created large ripples in the water that rocked the scurrying passenger ferries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked toward Tara in shock.  \u201cWhat?\u201d Tara responded in laughter. \u201cThat was totally a car that made that noise.\u201d  Beth wiggled her nose to get a whiff.  \u201cEww, that\u2019s pretty strong.  Wonder how the little people\u2019ll handle it?\u201d Beth asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn\u2019t have to wait long as the smell traveled like a cumulonimbus cloud over to the City Highway that hugged the river\u2019s edge.  There, it seemed to hang like a blimp.  The girly gas stopped traffic on a dime as people rushed to cover their noses.  Beth and Tara sat up to watch the commotion as cars began colliding, crashing and crunching as though a thick fog had impaired their visibility.  Beth and Tara were awe-struck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTARA: [shrugging her shoulders as she turned to Beth].  What can I say?  Sometimes a girl\u2019s gotta do what girl\u2019s gotta do.  I swear I never fart in public.  But god, that was pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choppers that floated above them made a quick exit, but the Coast Guard boat that lay precariously close to Tara wasn\u2019t so lucky.  Amid all the chaos and unnoticed by the five crew members, the boat had drifted to within 10 feet of the enormous raft.  Tara just happened to look down to her left, eyeing the boat.  YOU POOR LITTLE PEOPLE. Tara then slowly lowered her left hand onto the boat, where her long fingers found a resting position amid the passengers, lightly flicking them as they stumbled about.  \u201cHey, Beth.  I found something.\u201d  Tara then menacingly grabbed a man off the boat, wrapped firmly in her fingers, as she brought him up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese little people as soo cute,\u201d Beth oozed as she examined the screaming man wrapped in Tara\u2019s soft fingers.  \u201cLet\u2019s keep him as our pet,\u201d Beth continued as she took the man in her left hand and placed him on her stomach.  Gun shots could be heard from the boat below, as the remaining four passengers fired up at the giants.  Tara simply leaned over the raft\u2019s edge and sighed.  PUNY PEOPLE, YOU\u2019VE GOT TO LEARN TO RESPECT US GIANT GIRLS.  With her left hand she sent the boat bubbling beneath the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Beth, don\u2019t you have giant woman business to take care of over at that bridge?,\u201d Tara inquired in a lazy sexy tone.  \u201cI guess I could formally introduce us,\u201d Beth replied in a serious tone.  \u201cHave fun doing it though.  Be sexy, girly, not stiff.  You\u2019re the giant woman, they\u2019re the puny people.  And give me that remote control thingy too,\u201d Tara quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThis is KCBV Radio reporting from Port Town, a city under siege.  Celebrity party girl Tara Reid and a Ms. Bethany Patters, a prominent young safety researcher, have quite literally taken over this city of five million residents.  The scene downtown would put any sci-fi movie to shame.  From Port River to I-565, a trail of giant footprints dot the landscape, in some cases crushed cars and debris pulverized in their wake. Eerily, twenty foot long stands of female hair can be found along streets and sidewalks, at times tangling people as they flee.  Toppled power lines, caved in streets and over turned cars make it appear a war has broken out.  No war, but we can assure you two very large women have made themselves quite comfortable in the middle of the Port River and have refused to cooperate with law enforcement and other authorities.  The two women as we have previously reported are roughly 150 feet tall with bravado to match, showing no modesty in their skimpy bikinis, taunting the population.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThese two women have killed roughly ten people and blocked passage of thousands of commuters to safer ground,\u201d the Mayor said at a news conference earlier.  The Chief of Police was equally as sober; \u201cI want to make it very clear that we are preparing to use whatever force necessary to prevent these two destructive people from harming anyone else.  They appear to be resting on their raft and do not pose a threat currently.  We will continue to monitor the situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth climbed off the raft as it gyrated and moaned from silky skin sliding against it, gentle waves stirring.  Helicopters continued to buzz high above, cars could be heard honking, bumping and grinding their way ever so slowly along the Port River Bridge and City Highway.  \u201cOooh, this water feels to warm and luxurious,\u201d Beth said as she lowered herself up to her shoulders in the 40 foot deep Port River.  \u201cJust enjoy this experience.  I bet you haven\u2019t taken a vacation in ages.\u201d Tara asked in an effort to get to know one of her new fans.  \u201cI\u2019m a safety researcher at the Port Institute of Technology. I put in long hours and its lot of stress trying to come up with ways to engineer safer cars for people.  It\u2019s a lot mind-numbing math and science. So, even just a few hours of sunbathing does this girl wonders\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t we the brainy one?\u201d Tara teased as she stuck out her tongue from high on the raft.  \u201cLet\u2019s put that pretty brain of yours to work messing with  all these people.\u201d  Adjusting her hair and neck on the headrest, crossing her legs, Tara sighed with, \u201cOne thing I have over that Paris and even Britney is this giant thing.  If nothing else, I\u2019ll easily be on the cover of People next month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth scanned the cityscape as she soaked in the river, sun beaming down on increasingly darker olive skin, her big brown eyes treating themselves to views of lines of traffic, scores of people scurrying about, ears taking the sounds of car horns, ambulances and police sirens and helicopters above.  With eyes now fixated on the expansive and traffic laden Port River Bridge, Beth lowered herself beneath the surface of the water, arms and hands finding the bottom as she frolicked and refreshed herself from the intense sun.  Still beneath the surface, the giant Beth brought her body to a horizontal position and propelled herself in the direction of the bridge.  Having been under water for some three minutes, people watching the duo\u2019s antics from land were beginning to get nervous.  Those on the bridge stuck in their cars got out to examine the river\u2019s surface to see if they could spot any air bubbles approaching.  \u201cHoly shit! She\u2019s coming!\u201d a woman on the bridge exclaimed at spotting a trail of ripples.  \u201cGet off the bridge! Get off the bridge! The giant woman is approaching!\u201d another helpless driver proclaimed.  Some 150 people started exiting their vehicles, running on foot, pushing and shoving, while others refused to leave the comfortable confines of their cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bridges surface rumbled as from an earthquake as the giant Beth had made contact with the structure\u2019s underwater supports.  Beth placed her feet on the river\u2019s floor, crouching in place as she listened to the muffled commotion above, just savoring the moment before she acted a scene she imagined if she were Godzilla.  Then like the monster she imagined herself playing, Beth jettisoned her pretty body above the surface, a rush of pressure vacuuming all the air out the immediate vicinity as motorists watched stunned as long black hair gave way to big brown eyes, gorgeous olive-toned face, glossy pink lips.  Beth continued to rise like a moutain from the deep, as people watched as her breasts, wrapped in a sensuous shiny copper colored halter bikini, rose above their heads, giving way to a flat wash board stomach and finally the largest, yet cutest belly button in the world. Beth had risen to her full height as hundreds of gallons of water cascaded down like the Niagara off of her hair, shoulders and down her vast and silky body, many gallons pouring on the bridge, drenching some thirty motorists and flipping three cars.  The water\u2019s surface lay some twenty feet below her bikini bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople screamed while others stood in silence, staring in awe up at the goddess\u2019 face which stood some 60 feet above them.  Others were afraid to make eye contact and looked straight ahead, that is straight into to Beth\u2019s belly button that hung level with the bridge\u2019s surface, just over the guardrails; the sexy naval simultaneously menacing as well as mocking the hapless citizens.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth pulled her long wet dark hair back along her neck and shoulders, adjusting her bikini and monitoring all the activity below her.  The roadway now nothing more than a toy set.  OK PEOPLE, ABOUT TIME I FORMALLY INTRODUCED MYSELF TO YOU.  Most of the crowd stood at attention, listening intently so as to avoid a conflict with the giant, such as a misplaced hand picking them up or a pretty finger flicking them across the roadway.  However, Beth tracked a group of some ten people running just below her, heading the direction out of town as well a car pushing up against another vehicle in a hasty retreat.  HEY YOU, PEOPLE. STOP RUNNING.  AND WILL THE DRIVER OF THAT CAR STOP FUCKING AROUND.  I WANT EVERY ONE OF YOU PEOPLE TO LISTEN UP.  ANYONE I CATCH RUNNING AWAY AGAIN IS GONNA RUIN IT FOR EVERYONE ELSE. Beth pauses, sighs as she places a finger on her sultry lips. Then smiles. THAT IS, I\u2019M LEAVING OPEN THE OPTION OF EATING ANY ONE CAUGHT RUNNING AGAIN.  Beth lowered a finger and crushed the front end of the escaping vehicle.   \u201cHey, I think I have a dick big enough to satisfy you!\u201d a courageous and daring man blurted out up to Beth  Rolling her eyes as she placed her left hand sensuously on her waist, Beth lowered her right hand ten feet above the roadway and extended her middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOW LET ME EXPLAIN MY ROLE AS GIANT AND YOURS AS PUNY PEOPLE\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was a having a fine time taking in Beth\u2019s antics as she enjoyed listening to Nelly Furtado on the rafts mp-3 player, music emanating from speakers within the headrest.  Impressed that she remembered, Tara whipped out a joint, which she lit up in delight.  Tara studied the menu options on the vehicle remote control, headset affixed neatly within her hair.  Nelly\u2019s \u201cPromiscuous\u201d thumping in her ears, when the remote\u2019s LCD screen came on, a view of some forty people crammed into some large space.  Another view rotated on, a view of the river, a towering Beth in the distance.  Scrolling below the image, the remote menu displayed, \u201cFerry\u201d.  Tara\u2019s eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the headset\u2019s mic just at Tara\u2019s glossy red lips, the giant was prepared to completely fuck up a lot of peoples\u2019 day.  With LCD screen scanning the vessel\u2019s forty some passengers, Tara primped and cropped her body on the raft, locating the most comfortable reclining position for maximum luxury.  Raft\u2019s rubbery plastic surface moaning and sighing accordingly as she puffed n her marijuana cigarette.  Like a Goddess from above, Tara addressed the unsuspecting passengers via the ship\u2019s PA system.  ATTENTION PEOPLE.  At first, the passengers paid no attention, dismissing the voice as just another announcement by the ship\u2019s staff.  Tara started laughing.  ATTENTION TINY PEOPLE, THIS IS TARA, THE GIANT WOMAN ABOUT TO EAT YOUR CITY.  Tara giggled as did many of the people on the boat, thinking the staff was joking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara then took over the vessel\u2019s controls as the captain stood stunned at the wheel, watching it as it moved seemingly on its own.  With long fingers rotating the remote\u2019s dials, Tara increased the boat\u2019s speed to 40 mph, then 50 mph within ten seconds, steering the boat in the direction of the bikini-clad giant beauties.  For maximum terror, Tara steered the boat erratically, watching as people fell to the floor, screaming in shock.  NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE LISTEN.  I AM ONE-HALF OF THE TEAM OF GIANT WOMEN WHO HAVE TAKEN OVER THE CITY.  THIS BOAT BELONGS TO ME NOW.  I CAN SEE EVERY ONE OF YOU, INCLUDING THE CUTE GUY IN THE BLUE SHIRT THERE.  People turned and located the man, convinced this was no joke; they were unwitting captives of an oversized bikini-wearing giant sunbathing party girl bent on one-upping other Hollywood starlets and pop tarts.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara guided the boat closer in, the view of the giant Beth ever larger, and a menacing figure standing in the river.  Passengers stared in disbelief at Beth\u2019s size as they approached, some gasping.  DON\u2019T EVEN THINK OF JUMPING OFF THE SIDES.  IF I SEE JUST ONE OF YOU PEEPS TAKE A DIP, I\u2019LL GO GODZILLA ON THE REST OF YOU.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026THIS WHOLE GIANT EXPERIENCE HAS REALLY MADE ME GROW AS A WOMAN, Beth bantered on to the nervous people on the roadway below, unaware of the approaching ferry vessel. EW, THAT CAME OUT WEIRD.  I MEAN, WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS I FEEL SO LIBERATED, LIKE I CAN TAKE OVER THE WORLD. AND\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferry was now within 50 yards of the towering Beth as Tara slowed the watercraft down to 30 MPH, guiding it under the bridge.  Passengers hastily jumped over the sides or toward the rear, trampling each other in the process.  Tara smiled as the expanse of water between Beth\u2019s thighs and below her bikini bottom came into larger view.  Tara aimed, hit the accelerator and crammed the vessel between Beth\u2019s legs, nestled in, cold metal pressing on warm silky female flesh, trapping the boat dead in its tracks as passengers were thrust forward like rag dolls. OUCH!, Beth rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth, mid-sentence in her speech to the commuters, was knocked off balance. The leggy giant found herself momentarily straddling the ferry, her cute ass resting on the bow. Severak people and five cars at the front of the boat were sent reeling beneath Beth\u2019s butt.  Passengers\u2019 views were engulfed by the enormous bikini bottom.  Feeling herself fall backwards, her right hand grabbed the edges of the bridge, but her attempts at remaining upright failed.  Like a great big skyscraper on demolition day, Beth\u2019s legs gave way, ass, arms and legs overturning the ferry as her gargantuan proportions made a thunderous collision with the water\u2019s surface, the mighty fall stopped only as the colossus approached the riverbed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara held her hand to her mouth, not in shock, but in an effort to hide the giggles that came out.  OOPSY! LOOKS LIKE WE NEED TO GET SOME NEW LITTLE PEOPLE.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara held on as the raft swayed and rocked from the tremendous waves and wind that ensued, taking in destruction in seeming slow motion\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA puff on her joint for maximum pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beth\u2019s colossal fall from grace into the river created an unimaginable ripple affect, as it were, for the city.  Screams and cries rang out at the sight of one large wave of water barreling down Hesford Street, its massive liquid presence overtaking, pushing and swallowing people, cars, and other debris in its path.  The one large wave spanned out, snaking through side streets, inflicting people with several rushes of water upwards of five feet high. A line of some ten public buses carrying a bevy of some 500 people trying to get out of town was not spared as a wall of water overturned the vehicles, washing them away like nothing more than bath toys.  The buses came to a stop only after careening into an office building and killing some 100 passengers.  The sound of the collision was nightmarish.  Those high up in office and apartment buildings, looked down in horror as people were swept up and carried away.  Others could be seen screaming as they attempted to out run the mighty wetness, the lucky ones escaping to higher elevation in the nick of time.  Subway lines were flooded, stranding hundreds under ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara took another puff on her giant joint, laughing and giggling as she monitored all the destruction.  A massive high had taken over, enhancing her evil streak.  Before her lay the sight of the overturned ferry slowly sinking, people flailing about in the warm river water, begging, screaming for help.  Tara couldn\u2019t resist teasing and mocking the 40 some distressed passengers in the water. Leaning forward as she exhaled on the marijuana cig, Tara sighed, POOR PEOPLE.  I\u2019M TOTALLY SOO SORRY FOR SINKING YOUR PUNY BOAT, BUT NOW THAT I\u2019M A GIANT, I CAN\u2019T BE RESPONSIBLE.  Tara adjusted her massive silky legs on the raft and preened her hair before continuing.  ALSO, DON\u2019T THINK FOR A MINUTE OF CLIMBING ON THIS RAFT.  ALL YOU PEOPLE WILL JUST HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  Tara giggled and cries for help continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen like a mega submarine emerging from the ocean, a large beautiful head erupted from the water\u2019s surface.  GRRRR!  OOHH!  UGH!   The giant Beth roared back to life, having been temporarily knocked unconscious under water.  Beth appeared frazzled, disoriented and\u2026positively pissed!  Rising to her full height as she cleared her eyes, scratched her nose and spit out the gallons of water lodged in her mouth and ears, Beth turned to the rather relaxed Tara.  TARA, DID YOU SEE THAT DAMN BOAT HIT ME!  I AM JUST SOOO PISSED AT THOSE PEOPLE FOR RUNNING INTO ME!  Looking down in the water, Beth made out the doomed ferry passengers swimming around her towering legs.  SERVES YOU RIGHT, STUPID PEOPLE.  I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY STEER YOUR DAMN BOAT INTO A GIANT. NOW I\u2019M A PISSED OFF GIANT!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara smirked girlishly.  YOU GO, GIRL! Tara cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth turned her focus to the bridge she had earlier been lecturing over.  A gaping hole had been torn in the side; the result of Beth\u2019s attempt to gain her footing as she fell.  Several cars had landed in the river, still afloat, though sinking steadily a menacing Beth noticed.  Beth picked up two of the doomed cars and stared business-like into the wrecked vehicles, some four panicked people among them.  MY FRIEND TARA\u2019S GONNA LOVE YOU.  Beth walked back to the raft and placed the cars at the feet of the resting blond.  Slowly returning to the bridge, Beth\u2019s eyes widened with excitement at the sight of an eighteen-wheeler caught dangling perilously over the edge, one small gust of wind away from plunging to the water below.  Beth could make out the cries for help from the driver.  There would be no rescue for this poor man.  Beth lowered her face to where the truck\u2019s cab was swinging below the bridge as she peered curiously at the frightening scene.  \u201cPlease help! I think I broke my leg!\u201d the driver yelled out to the big brown eyes, sultry lips and tanned face of the oversized woman.  Beth giggled as she turned back to Tara.  HEY TARA, LISTEN TO THIS.  THIS PUNY MAN HERE WANTS ME TO SAVE HIM.  SHOULD I LIFT UP HIS TRUCK AND GIVE HIM A HAND?  Tara smiled like a mischievous little girl, luxuriously puffed on the joint, as she casually, sarcastically pondered an answer.  Beth waited with giggling anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGIRL, ARE YOU KIDDING? I\u2019M STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUSH THE TRUCK OFF THE BRIDGE, Tara replied.  Turning again to the trapped driver, Beth purred, SORRY, THE BIG GIRL OVER THERE SAYS I\u2019VE GOTTA LET YOU GO.  SEE YA.  Beth then nudged the back of the truck from its resting position using nothing more than one of her sexy fingers.  The ensuing splash was not lost on the two giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things were getting ugly for the city.  Beth and Tara were taking over, killing people and destroying property like no more than children frolicking in the pool.  Beth had made her way back to the raft, but not before picking up two cars from the ruined bridge and tossing them onto the neighboring highway.  Tara laughed at the resulting pile up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, sir! These fucking women are decimating the city.  Reports have it that over 200 people have been killed or injured.  You can\u2019t let these bikini-clad bitches get away with murder,\u2019 the Colonel pleaded with the mayor.  \u201cI ask that you let me send in the Apaches to spray some tear gas.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, but I don\u2019t want you to kill those ladies.  How do you think it\u2019ll look for me politically if I couldn\u2019t contain two women in skimpy swimsuits?\u201d the Mayor cautioned. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with them once you\u2019ve put them down.\u201d  \u201cYes, sir!\u201d the Colonel responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, what ya think the police are gonna do now that we\u2019ve done some big time damage?\u201d Beth asked of Tara as the sounds of screams and cries could be heard in the distance.  Tara was momentarily distracted by the sight of a large chunk of the Port Bridge crashing down, taking with it four cars and two people as they plunged into the water.  Beth followed Tara\u2019s lead, smiling  as she watched the water bubble from the sinking ferry, people still splashing about.  With a glassy gaze, Tara responded as smoke poured out of her mouth and nose from the joint, \u201cFuck, if I were these puny people, I\u2019d finally call in the goddam military.  Seems the only antidote for a giant woman or two, don\u2019t ya think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara took another puff of the oversize marijuana joint, breathing deeply as her dainty fingers held it out to Beth\u2019 glossy lips for the towering brunette to indulge.  \u201cAhhhh, I feel soo high,\u201d Beth sighed.  Beth\u2019s entire body wilted with sheer relaxation, every limb resting haphazardly on the soft raft without a care as her skin glowed delightfully.  Tara\u2019s high-induced limp state appeared to mimic Beth\u2019s; both women a study in the art of Zen, a state of pleasure that served only to frustrate thousands fleeing the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got them in my sights, sir.\u201d  \u201cFire!\u201d  From behind two office buildings, several attack helicopters launched a total of ten rockets toward the pampering giant babes.  The sounds of the incoming rockets caught the pretty ears of Beth and Tara as their eyes widened in surprise.  \u201cShit, watch out!\u201d Beth yelped as both women slouched instinctively low in the raft.  Five of the rockets found their way between Beth\u2019s legs as they bounced on the lotion-drenched rubbery surface, where upon landing began emitting a thick cloud of smoke.  Two more rockets landed in the water and OUCH!! SHIT! One other hit Tara Reid square in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and Tara began to cough.  \u201cOmigod, I think this is tear gas.  Get rid of them!\u201d Tara cried.  Beth acted quickly scooping up the rockets in her right hand.  Tara reached into Beth\u2019s sweaty palm, grabbing the weapons.   They appeared the size of cigarettes to the 150\u2019 super gorgeous women.  As she threw them toward downtown, smoke trailed away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! CRASH! CRUNCH! KABOOM!.  Screams rang out as some of the rockets collided with the intersection of Grilcom and Main, taking out traffic lights, power lines and scattering uniformly moving traffic like matchbox cars.  A car exploded, sending flames spiraling 50 feet in the air. A crater ten feet deep was all that remained where the rockets landed. The other rockets found their way into Port Stadium, where 5,000 people had found refuge in the time Beth and Tara laid waste to several roadways.  The sound of skidding, crashing and screams united with thick plumes of tear gas, rendering thousands of people into a deep coma.  Smoke continued to snake its way into buildings, subways, into buses and trains.  Having upped the dosage 20-fold for giant 150\u2019 women, the military had inadvertently put an entire city to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayhem was not lost on the leggy giants as they watched all the action on live television, courtesy of the satellite LCD screen affixed to their raft.  \u201cHow cool is this?\u201d Beth asked of Tara in awe.  \u201cDid you see that car explode with all those puny people nearby?\u201d Tara quipped with a glimmer in her big blue eyes.  Just then, smoke jetted from between Tara\u2019s $20,000 boobs as Beth screamed like a little girl.  Tara reached into her bikini top where she lifted out one of the puny rockets with her girly fingers.  Beth and Tara examined the object quietly, and then laughed hysterically as Tara tossed the rocket nonchalantly over her shoulders where it landed on a crowded overpass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYOU PEOPLE ARE SOOO CUTE.  CAN\u2019T EVEN TAKE DOWN TWO SEXY BABES IN BIKINIS, Tara teased loudly toward downtown. Beth adjusted her swimwear, primped her hair and sighed as she gazed into Tara\u2019s eyes, both females drunk with power. \u201cThis is so hot, you should visit downtown,\u201d Beth purred as she put her moist lips to Tara\u2019s.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
