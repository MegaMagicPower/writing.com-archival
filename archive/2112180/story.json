Well Cosmo, who survived the whole ordeal somehow was flying over Sonic's homeworld, and she was now looking over the entire universe, making sure that all of the planet's life is fully restored accordingly across the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell to fully explain how she survived, well that is something that isn't currently known at this point. Some said that her sacrifice turned her somehow into a goddess like being, or maybe the explosion that occurred somehow revealed an unknown being in the world. Well we don't know what that reason was, but all we know is that Cosmo is going to see Tails once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing where Tails once lived, she fly right to the island herself in her transformed state, but that transformed state also did came with one other major thing that occurred to her. She is now 200ft, and some of the worlds that she revisited, well let's just say that there was some complications that had to be sorted out with all the panicking alien races and what not.

Tails then ended up blushing. \"Well, your right, thinking about it now I wouldn't want to end up in your stomach. I wasn't just curious how you gotten so tall or something, and how you still alive.\" Tails wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's a bit of a long story, but let's just say from all I know, my work across the universe wasn't done just yet. Still watching all the planets heal to its original state and what not. So I figure I come by and check on your world to make sure it was healing.\" Cosmo then replied back to Tails, who understands. The planet had to be healing after the entire battle with the Dark Oak, and now with the planets now healing, it was great to visit them once more. \"But now I grew is something I wonder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that could try to find out.\" Tails replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

According to these DNA readings, the females of your species, including you, have the power to just grow huge while still staying attractive. Also, the males became the size of dinosaurs. You are 200 feet, about the size of a skyscraper, so I guess the females can grow larger, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmo replied, \"OH, OKAY.

However at the same time, if she kisses Tails wrong, she would end up sucking him right into her mouth and maybe right down her stomach and that would cause Tails to die a horrible death as he would be burned by her stomach acids. \"Kiss you.\" She said to him just as she finally revealed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing those words Tails begin to blush immensely as this was totally the most unexpected request that Tails has ever heard in his life.

After a minute or so of kissing, Tails and Cosmo end up ending the kiss, and they both feel something amazing for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I have to admit, I really did miss having you around here, and it really makes me want to go out on a date later tonight just for this alone.\" Tails admitted as he really does have a lot of feelings for Cosmo because of all the adventures that's they had truly together while out on space, fighting those alien invaders that wanted to take the planet eggs and rid the life of those planets. It was really scary to see for sure, but at least they pull through and won. Now how Cosmo's came back, is a question in its self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I would really love to go on a date with you. If only I was able to get a outfit for myself and you one, but I don't think they make outfits for giants like me.\" Cosmo giggled as she truly accepted his offer to go on a date with Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will see what I can do, but first question, where do you want to go?\"</span></div></div>",

She started to lick her lips and Tails got worried. \"Cosmo, are you okay?\" Cosmo was trying her hardest to resist the urge and she was fighting it as hard as she could. Part of her said, \"I'M SO HUNGRY. I COULD SWALLOW HIM AND HE'D BE SAFE IN MY STOMACH.\" In her head, she replied, \"NO, I CAN'T! NO MATTER HOW HUNGRY I AM, I WON'T EAT MY OWN BOYFRIEND! I'LL JUST GO TO THE KITCHEN AND MAKE MYSELF SOMETHING.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the temptation was too strong and Cosmo said, \"I'M SORRY, TAILS, BUT I'M STARVING AND YOU'RE DOT SIZE, SO I JUST HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING.\" Cosmo raised Tails above her open mouth, showing her tongue and gigantic teeth. Tails got scared and said, \"Cosmo, no! This isn't you! You're losing control and you have to fight it!\" Cosmo smiled and told him, \"DON'T WORRY, TAILS. YOU'LL SURVIVE IN MY STOMACH. I'LL MAKE SURE YOU LAND ON A DRY SPOT WITH NO ACID, OKAY? I PROMISE I WILL LET YOU OUT ONCE I GET CONTROL OF MY ACTIONS AGAIN.\" Tails replied, \"As crazy as you're acting right now, I trust you. Next time, try to eat some food from the kitchen first.\" Cosmo nodded her head and said, \"OF COURSE. I'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN.\" Tails smiled and said, \"I know you won't. I love you and I'll go along with this only because I'm curious what the inside of a Seedrian looks like. I need to see if it's similar to anthropomorphic animals like myself and our other friends, as well as humans. You know, for science's sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmo laughed and said, \"ALL RIGHT, THEN! I LOVE YOU TOO, TAILS! BE CAREFUL! NOW I HAVE TO TASTE YOU FIRST.\" Cosmo stuck out her tongue and licked Tails' entire body, causing him to be coated in saliva. Cosmo placed Tails inside her mouth and closed it. Tails illuminated the area with his flashlight. Cosmo swished him around with her tongue. \"MMMMM!!! YOU TASTE GOOD, TAILS!\" Cosmo swallowed Tails and he landed on a dry spot in her stomach. Cosmo patted her belly and said, \"YOU WERE DELICIOUS, TAILS! SIT TIGHT FOR A FEW MINUTES.\" Cosmo's stomach rumbled and growled with the acids sloshing everywhere. Tails said, \"Wow, this is amazing to look at. Perhaps I should get out of here, though.\" Suddenly, Cosmo thought about what she just did and gasped. \"OH NO! WHAT HAVE I DONE? I'M SO SORRY, TAILS! NEXT TIME, I WON'T GIVE INTO TEMPTATION SO EASILY, I PROMISE!\" Cosmo started crying uncontrollably. Tails smiled from inside her stomach and said, \"Don't worry about it. I forgive you. You weren't thinking straight, so it isn't entirely your fault. I'll get out of here just fine.\" Cosmo wiped her eyes and said, \"OH, THANK YOU,TAILS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING. NOW I'VE SWALLOWED YOU AND YOU'RE IN MY STOMACH. BEING SO GIANT IS SCARY. JUST BECAUSE I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU'RE LIKE AN ANT TO ME, I MADE YOU MY SNACK. I'LL BE MORE CAREFUL FROM NOW ON. I'M SUCH A MONSTER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails shook his head and said, \"No, Cosmo. Don't ever say that about yourself. You're my girlfriend and I love you with all my heart. Don't ever forget that.\" \"I WON'T, TAILS. I LOVE YOU, TOO. I HOPE YOU GET OUT SAFELY.\" Tails replied, \"Thanks, I'll try my best.\" What happens next? </span></div></div>",

However, it was during that time that he failed to pay attention to the food that was coming down towards him, and sadly he was hit hard by one of them. The weight of the sandwich piece was enough to send him falling right to the acids below. Upon making contact with the acids, Tails begin to scream in panic and agony at the pain of being burned by the acids was just horrible to begin with. His body dissolved until no more of him was seen at all. It was surely game over for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... that was so good. I hope Tails like what I sent him down my stomach.
