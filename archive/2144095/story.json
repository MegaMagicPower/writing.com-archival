It hadn\u2019t been that long since he received the Metaverse Navigator app and so he wondered what this one did. Immediately, he opened the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat greeted him was a short message, stating <i>Who\u2019s heart will be sent?</i>, followed by a list of all his friends\u2019 names as well as his own. Akira looked at the app in confusion. What did it mean by sending hearts? Akira decided the only way he would know is by testing it, so he selected his own name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed next was another message, <i>Who will receive the heart?</i>. Akira, even more perplexed, decided to select the name of one of his friends, to finally know what this app meant by \u2018sending and receiving hearts.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho\u2019s name did he choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akira pressed down the send button and in a blink of an eye was teleported out of his room in Leblanc and suddenly in a completely unfamiliar room. He found himself paralyzed and numb for a moment as his brain raced to try and figure out what had just happened to him as he blinked slowly and suddenly noticed all the changing sensations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to be standing in a room with light blue walls \u2013 a bedroom by the looks of it. But that was much less important than the sudden weight he felt at his chest and the long hair tickling at his neck. Upon looking down, he nearly jumped out of his skin upon seeing a pair of women\u2019s breasts beneath a familiar long-sleeved yellow shirt. \u201cW-wait, it turned me into her?!\u201d Akira yelled in shock, breaking his normally cool and collected fa\u00e7ade. He bent over \u2013 noting that he was suddenly much less flexible than before \u2013 and patted down his now hairless legs, exposed with nothing but a blue denim skirt covering them up. Bolting his head around left and right, he quickly found himself face to face with a long mirror, confirming exactly as he thought \u2013 he was inside Kawakami\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Akira could do nothing but prod himself as he pieced together what the app had done. After a moment\u2019s thought, it actually made some sense given the definition of \u201cheart\u201d in the metaverse. The Heart was the ego \u2013 one\u2019s personality. If the app sent his heart to another, then it probably sent his mind into that person. \u201cDid Igor send this\u2026 if so, why?\u201d Awkwardly, he began to pat down Kawakmi\u2019s hips, hoping to find a cell phone in her pockets, but realized she didn\u2019t have it on her. A quick search of the room revealed it to be on her bed\u2026 alongside her maid outfit for her nights as \u201cBecky\u201d. She must\u2019ve been in the process of getting ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably using the break as an opportunity to work more\u2026\u201d Akira muttered to himself, still fascinated to hear a woman\u2019s voice in place of his. Looking to the phone confirmed his theory \u2013 Kawakami was actually in the middle of texting him, advertising her \u2018services\u2019. He ignored that and clicked out of the text to confirm that the Heart Transfer App was now downloaded on his new phone, giving him a sigh of relief. He felt a lot more at ease with some minor control over the situation. Not only did the app give him a confirmation of its \u2018success\u2019, it also gave him a detailed layout of how it worked, explaining that the process was one way. \u201cGood to know that Kawakami isn\u2019t freaking out Morgana in my body\u2026\u201d It seemed that all he had to do was click undo and he\u2019d be back as himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018But I definitely was given this app for a reason,\u2019</i> Joker thought to himself. <i>\u2018I got the metanav for a reason too after all. Wouldn\u2019t it be a waste to just go back immediately?\u2019 </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyed the maid outfit, and felt his heart suddenly start racing. Not only did he have access to her bod, but he had her clothes, her apartment, her voice, everything. Maybe it'd be interesting to explore the situation and let things play out a bit? The app would apparently keep his body moving like normal after all. He never considered cross-dressing before, but he was certainly already wearing a skirt. If he spent a night playing out Kawakmi\u2019s role, he was certain he would grow to understand her better, and Igor told him that such bonds would be necessary for the rehabilitation process. Atleast, that was the justification he built up in his head. Part of him just wanted a night without Morgana's curfew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018But maybe\u2026 I can even skip a few steps,\u2019 he mused as he flipped through her phone\u2019s apps, noticing with some surprise that the metanav traveled with him as well. He knew Kawakami was in some serious trouble, even if she was slow to reveal it to him. If he was at the wheel of her body, he could find out what was wrong and cut to the chase in helping her fix it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Not to mention see what she\u2019d look like as a phantom thief...\u2019</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akira opened the chat app on Kawakami's phone. \"Maybe there's a clue to her issues in her messages\" he wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through her messages, Akira saw a lot of messages between Kawakami and a man and woman. Nearly all of those messages were related to money and the death of someone called Takase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira didn't fully understand the situation, but one thing was clear. These two people were the source of Kawakami's issues. In their messages they were practically threatening Kawakami if she didn't pay them to 'make up for' Takase's death <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to ask Kawakami for the full story another time. For now, It's time to go to the Metaverse.\" Akira said to himself. He was about to head out and go to the Metaverse when he realized something important \"oh yeah, guess I don't have any weapons on me right now\" he looked around Kawakami's room for something he could use as a weapon. He found a kitchen knife \"this should work as a weapon in the metaverse\" Akira reasoned to himself \"now I'll need a gun.\" He said, he doubted Kawakami would have a model gun just laying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira looked around the room and soon found what He's need. Kawakami's purse. He opened it and found her wallet. Unsurprisingly, there wasn't much in it. He doubted Kawakami had much money to spare after her payments to those two. \"There should be enough in here for a gun from Iwai's\" he reasoned to himself as he put the wallet back into the purse and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira's walk over to Iwai's shop felt, strange, to say the least. He had walked down this road countless times in the short few months since he had moved to this city, but the walk felt very different as an adult woman wearing a skirt. As he walked, he felt the long hair tickling at his neck, the breeze brushing against his legs, and the slight jiggle on his chest. His whole center of gravity felt different too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon arrived and entered Iwai's shop. Inside Iwai seemed to be reading a magazine, he looked up at Akira in Kawakami's body \"You end up walking into the wrong store, lady?\" He said roughly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a model gun.\" Akira said and pulled out Kawakami's wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, looks like you aren't lost after all\" Iwai said with a chuckle. He gave Akira the usual list of guns that he could purchase. Akira was about to buy a model handgun like he usually got, but he hesitated. If he got one of those, he would probably instinctively attempt to move like he would in his own body, flips, rolls, and all. He imagined that Kawakami's older body wouldn't have the energy for that. He instead chose to purchase a model shotgun like the kind Ryuji used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIwai bagged the gun and gave an unenthusiastic \"come again\" as Akira left. Akira headed to where he normally entered the Metaverse, before entering he did a double check of what he had \"Okay, got the gun and knife and the names of the two people blackmailing Kawakami\" he took a deep breath before heading into the Metaverse, this was definitely going to be a tough experience. Not only would he be going in alone, but He'd also be getting used to fighting in a different body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akira entered the Metaverse, he was greeted by the usual sight of a twisted subway system. He was in Mementos. What wasn't usual was the outfit he was now wearing. The Phantom Thieves outfits were usually how they either saw themselves or how society saw them. He imagined that his current outfit repressented how he saw himself in Kawakami's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe base outfit itself was very similar to the maid outfit Kawakami wore on her nights as Becky. However, it had a red and black color scheme was very reminiscent of Joker's usual outfit. There was also an unbuttoned jacket on his back and red gloves on his hands. Although he didn't have a good view of it, he could feel the mask he had been wearing for months on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll even be fighting in a skirt\" Joker said as he pulled on the clothing. Turning his focus away from the outfit to his task he began his walk down Mementos. He began to much further appreciate Morganna's van form as he made his way down </span></div></div>",

Not only was he now truly realizing how huge Mementos was without Morgana to carry him around, but he was in a body that was not used to running around a dungeon like he his body had become accustom to over the last few months.  Grabbing a stitch in his side Akira said to himself, \"I'm going to need to do some training if I ever want to take this body into the Metaverse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed in himself that he was having to give up so soon and that he couldn't help confront the people tormenting Kawakami in the Metaverse, Akira turned around and began to make his way back to the entrance.  But blocking his way was a familiar site of a shadow wandering the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got to start training this body somehow.\"  And Akira quickly and quietly walked behind the shadow, prepared to leap upon it to get the advantage and in one glorious motions, tripped on the subway tracks and fell headfirst into the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ambushed!'  Akira thought cursing the dainty shoes he was wearing that were more intended to lure customers than to fight monsters.  Akira looked around and saw that he was surrounded by Pixie's.  \"This is about as simple a fight as I could ask for, ARSENE!\"  Akira called out for his persona to do quick work of the tiny blue dress wearing monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Arsene didn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Akira questioned before being slapped in the face by one of the giggling hoard surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, guess I'll do this with brute force.\"  Akira pulled out the shotgun he'd purchased from Iwai and took a shot and connected.  \"Score.\"  Akira said to himself, but after he did the damage, one of the other pixies healed the bullet riddled one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad.\"  Akira said as he took another slap to the face.  Akira tried to fight back with slashed from the kitchen knife and while damage was done, the enemy kept healing through the injuries.  \"They're going to whittle me down, I've got to get out of here!\"  He tried to run, but the giggling Pixie's refused to let their pretty prey escape.  Akira looked down at his phone and saw the 'Undo' button staring him in the face.  He could escape and come back with his body and save Kawakami, but if he was too late he would never be able to forgive himself for putting Kawakami in this situation.  As the Pixie's continued to surround and chip away at his health before there was a flash of light.</span></div></div>",

Lines of blood ran down Kawakami\u2019s face as Joker pulled her body up to its feet, mask in her hand. It was the same sensation as when he awoke to his first persona, Arsene. However, the persona in question was different this time. Before Joker floated a 3 armed figure, colored orange and blue, split down the middle. Perhaps most striking was the split in its features - the blue half masculine and the orange half feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see you\u2019re quite alone, stranded in that form you\u2019re not familiar with. What you did was foolhardy, but I must admire your devotion to this woman. Willing to go so far as to use her hands to wrench freedom for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixies still floated about, unsure as to what to do in the face of this new foe. One of them eventually gained the gumtion to dart forward however, aiming straight for Joker only to be interrupted by a harsh blast of radioactive light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Ardha. You can consider me \u201con loan\u201d for now.\u201d The figure spoke calmly once more, the other pixies shuddered in fear backing away at the sight of their friend\u2019s destruction. Weaker Shadows were known to he be cowardly, and it took little more than a smug grin from Joker to scare them away now that he had a persona for backup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the monsters were out of sight, however, Joker exhaled deeply in relief. That was far too touch and go for his liking. This new persona seemed very powerful - the pixies were probably ants in comparison - but he was very nearly tork apart right there. Being alone definitely posed its own dangers, even with Ardha\u2019s extra firepower. And without Morgana to provide transport, he wouldn\u2019t be able to traverse Mementos nearly as easily as usually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Joker do from there?</span></div></div>",

He flopped down on his back, putting thoughts of the crazy thing that just happened out of his mind as he drifted to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Akira had a pleasant dream. He walked through the halls of Shujin Academy, with no one glaring at him or whispering about him as he passed by. He could go where he wanted and do whatever he wanted; he was even in a club. It was as though his record didn't exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight streamed in through the windows as Akira pulled himself out of bed, stretching his limbs. It was still summer break, and with Futaba's palace handled, he had some time to relax and unwind, like a real student on vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough,\" a voice chimed in. Akira turned his head to see Morgana on the other side of the room, on top of his table by the steps. \"Don't go getting lazy on me, Joker. Remember your promise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker swung his feet out of bed and stood up, \"I haven't forgotten. Just enjoying the R&amp;R while I can.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'll do the same in that case,\" Morgana replied. \"it's a nice day out, so I'm going to take a walk. I won't be far in case anything comes up though.\" Akira gave him a nod and waited patiently as Morgana left the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second that the cat was gone, Akira hurriedly ran to his desk and opened up his cell phone. With it, he confirmed what he wanted to know - that what happened the night prior wasn't a dream. \"Now, I have to figure out how to use it while I have a moment alone...\"</span></div></div>",

Telling her now might save him from telling everyone the new power he has. Secondly, he was curious.

The twins were clearly not human, but it was still odd that the app only considered them to have one heart. Maybe there was a reason for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, if they're considered one, what would happen if I tranfered a heart to them?\" Akira wondered the obvious. Would the heart be sent to only one of the Twins bodies? Or would it be split between the two of them?

He guessed that by sending a heart, it must of meant by sending the sender to the receiver in person. It would save him money going back and forth all the time. Now the question is, where is Hifumi? He doesn't see her sitting on her usual spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking out of his thoughts, he now noticed that something was draped around his head tickling his neck. He puts his left hand to one side of his head, and feels something silky and stringy. Curious to what it is he brings it up to his face, and much to his surprise it wasn't a piece of silk cloth, but long strands of human hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Strange? When did I let my hair grow out?</i> Last time he checked it was short and scruffy, not long and straight. Not to mention the hair had something red clipped onto it that he can see from the corner of his eye. He continues pondering to himself, confusion filling his mind of the phenomenon that he\u2019s experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of the lock of hair he gets a better look at the hand that was holding the strands, and the other hand as well that only added another layer of Akira\u2019s curious confusion. The hands themselves were daintier, the fingernails were slightly longer, and well cared for with a polished sheen. Not to say he never cared about keeping his nails kempt, but not at this level of care his hands currently have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on\u2026. huh!\u201d The sound of his voice gave him pause. Speaking for the first time after coming back from the void, it now sounded softer and higher pitched than his voice normally sounds like. A voice that sounds very familiar to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puzzle pieces were coming together, and he felt stupid for not realizing it sooner. If the app had teleported him here, the church goers would have noticed a teenage boy appearing out of thin air bringing unwanted attention to himself. He had to know what has happened to him to confirm his suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Akira sees he is not wearing his usual attire, he is now wearing a\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Downstairs, he could hear the muffled sound of Coffee brewing as one or two customers entered the shop. His body felt exhausted, it's already been two days since they infiltrated and stole Shido's treasure, yet he felt like he couldn't even move a muscle. It wasn't until suddenly, he received a message on his phone. Reaching his hand into his pocket to pull out the device. Opening up to his home screen, he noticed something stranged popped up on the interface. Right next to the Nav, there was a new app that appeared on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" He looked around his room and saw that Morgana was nowhere to be found. \"Strange, what's this all about...\" He knew that he should probably just delete it in case it was just some type of Trojan horse or virus. But a thought still lingered in his mind. \"What if this is like the Metaverse Navigator?\" He thought to himself. Without a second thought, he opened up the app. At first the app opened up with the red and black design, just like the nav. But suddenly, font appeared on the screen. \"<i></i>Who's heart will be sent?<i></i>\", underneath was a list of his contacts including himself. \"Well, I don't want to get anybody else involved in this if it's a scam.\" He clicked on his own name. Next, another screen popped up saying \"<i></i>Who will receive the heart?<i></i>\". Another list popped up, but this time, his name was already filled in. \"Hm, looks like this requires two people huh. I might need to ask Igor first.\" Joker sat in his room pondering what to do next.</span></div></div>",

He only lived in Tokyo for a year, but the constant adrenaline of being a Phantom Thief was a high that was hard to come down from. Not to mention, he was separated from the friends he made until his next break.He had a few pals in town, but even after his conviction was overturned, some people still kept him at arm's length due to his criminal record. He's love to head back to Tokyo if just to drop in and say hi to folks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay there Joker?\" A high pitched voice asked. Akira peered over to his desk to see Morgana staring at him. He at least got to bring one pal with him. \"You look awfully tired, which is weird because it's only 4:00.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pal who was far too invested in his sleep schedule. \"Just a bit worn out from classwork. Need a moment to unwind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat shook its head. \"Well, in that case, I'm going for a walk. Will be back before dark.\" With that, Morgana hopped out the open window to wander the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>buzz buzz</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker raised an eyebrow as his phone started buzzing. To his surprise, it wasn't a text from on his friends back in Tokyo. \"...another app?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker spent a few minutes looking over the strange addition to his phone.

After what felt like a second, he regained sight, but something was clearly off. He was no longer at home, looking at his surroundings he recognized the place he was in as the underground mall in Shibuya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd I get here?\" He said and rubbed the back of his head, his eyes widened as he finished his sentence and felt the large amount of hair on his head. That wasn't his voice, he recognized that voice. \"What the hell?!\" He practically screamed as he looked down at himself. He was clearly female now,, he recognized the outfit he was wearing as the outfit Ann wore often in the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, are you okay?\" A random passerby asked, from an outsiders perspective this scene of a teenage girl suddenly screaming and tugging at he own hair must have looked bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji winced when the person said 'miss' he never imagined he would ever be called that. Not sure what to say, Ryuji ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure where to go or what to do, Ryuji made his way to the arcade he frequently visited \"Okay, calm down Ryuji\" he said to himself, his new high pitched voice sounding completely foreign to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ryuji calmed down, he noticed that there was something vibrating in Ann's purse. He opened it and found her phone vibrating. That's when he remembered the app. Could that weird app have put him in Ann's body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked Ann's phone and to his surprise, not only was there a message from the same app, it was addressed to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ryuji Sakamoto, this message was sent to you as confirmation of your first successful use of the heart transfer app. This app will allow you to take over the body of any of your chat contacts for an unlimited amount of time. During this time your own body will act like nothing is wrong. To return to your own body, simply open up the app and click undo. The app will transfer to the phone of whoever you've taken the body of. Once you leave the body, the owner of the body will have no recollection of anything you did in their body and the app will be removed from their phone. We hope you get great use out of this'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a hell of a way to introduce someone to an app!\" Ryuji yelled at the phone and nearly threw it to the ground, only stopping himself because he knew that was his only way back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji quickly opened the app on Ann's phone. He was greeted by the same 'Select who will transfer their heart' screen as before, but now there was two options at the bottom that said 'undo last transfer' and 'undo all transfers' \"Okay, so all I have to do to return to normal is click this\" Ryuji said as he was about to press the button</span></div></div>",

It was pretty hot in the summer, so Ann was dressed for the heat. He'd be lying if he said he wasn't attracted to Ann, but they were always too different to be more than acquaintances before the phantom thief stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have the app, no rush right...?\"\" Ryuji asked himself rhetorically as he closed the app and put Ann's phone away in her bag. He looked around the arcade nervously. He had gotten a few stares from the customers, which made sense. Not only did Ann look rather out of place among the clientele, but he was also talking to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Let's get out of here,'</i>'Ryuji decided to himself. <i>'Might turn south for me if I meet someone who recognizes Ann.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Ryuji roughly knew where Ann lived, since the two of them were friends as kids. Even better, he knew her parents were both well-off and busy. Which meant he'd probably have Ann's nice home and body to himself for a while. Since he was feeling rather exposed in her outfit, he opted to hurry his way over to the Shibuya station to catch a train to her place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid anything happen along the way?</span></div></div>",

Ryuji recognized them as clothes that Ren had bought for every member of the gang one day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, none of the other phantom thieves ever planned to wear them. They were too....weird. Among the outfits were school uniforms that none of the thieves recognized, halloween outfits, christmas outfis, dancing clothes, and maid uniforms. No duh none of the thieves would willing wear them, even if Ren had bought them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was the thought process when Ryuji was himself. Right now he was alone with Ann's body and a mirror. Sure he entered the closet to grab some comfortable clothes, but maybe putting on a little show for himself could come first <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji looked over the outfits. The first to grab his eyes was a Halloween costume Ren had bought for Ann even though Halloween was months away, it was succubus costume, however even looking at it hanging Ryuji could tell it would show a lot of skin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he looked over and saw 2 maid uniforms. One a traditional black and white and the other a red and white. Ryuji still remembered the failure of Operation Maidwatch, maybe this could be his opportunity to see a maid, even if he himself would be the maid<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Halloween costume wasn't the only other out of season outfit Ren had bought, Ryuji spotted a two piece santa costume, although the only thing that distinguished it as santa was the colorscheme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ryuji could think anymore about the santa outfit, his face went completely red at the next thing his eyes cut. The golden gem of `outfits no one would be caught wearing`, the high cut armor. The high cut armor could hardly be considered an outfit with how little they covered, especially Ann's. Ryuji remembered the girl's nearly killed Ren for suggesting to wear it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh, what do I choose?!\" Ryuji said distressed in Ann's voice.

Oh man of Mona saw Ann like this he'd freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was playing around he heard Ann's phone go off with an ad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ad read, \"Maid for a day!

Is something up?</i> Joker had texted a reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nah, I just want to hang out today</i> the wait for a reply was longer this time.

He would see Joker freak out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji brought out a tray of tea \"Here you go, master~\u2606\" he once again said in his best maid impression as he poured it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana was loving every second of this \"Lady Annnnn! You're so lovely!\" Ryuji was more concerned with his leader's reaction however, he was still completely straight faced <i>'Why isn't he shocked?! Is he used to maids or something?!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought Ryuji accidentally spilled some hot tea on his hand \"Shit!\" He said, okay enough was enough \"Come on, dude! React in some way! I'm dressed as a god damn maid!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker pushed uo his glasses \"You get used to it\" he said <i>'so he is around maids often'</i> Ryuji internally screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever dude, I put on this dumb uniform to see if I could shock you, but it didn't work.\" Ryuji pouted. \"You can head home now\" he was utterly defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker looked satisfied, almost as if he heard some music notes or something, he got up and headed out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji kicked a table. He was so looking forward to seeing Joker's shocked face. He considered trying on some of Ann's other outfits and seeing if those would shock him. However now Joker knew that 'Ann' wanted to see him shocked, so nothing would likely work<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could try a different outfit as someone else?\" Ryuji wondered. Joker had been buying outfits for each of the Phantom Thieves, so Ryuji could try hoping into someone else's body to shock him. Makoto's would do, he would never expect her to pull something like that. Although, that may also work to Ryuji's disadvantage. He was lucky Ann and him acted pretty similar when Ann was peeved, if he tried the same thing as Makoto Joker might be able to tell that Makoto was Makoto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji's other options of course were to either go and do that maid for a day thing and make some money or just stay here and entertain himself, why spend his whole day and risk letting someone else know about the app after all.

Ryuji and Ann ended up locked out of their rooms and would have to spend the night with Mishima and Joker.  However, there were only two beds. The four of them were playing cards to decide who would sleep on the beds, who would sleep on the couch, and who would be cursed with sleeping on the hard floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMishima had won the first round and won bed rights, leaving Ryuji, Joker, and Ann in a nerve racking battle to win the last bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read 'em and weep boys!\" Ann cheered as she showed her deck, Joker and Ryuji had lost and she had won the bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh hell no, I ain't sleeping on the floor'</i> Ryuji thought to himself as he reached into his pocket for his phone. After the last big possession trip he had been on he was more cautious about using the App, however this was an emergency! He needed it. He transfered his heart to Ann and within a second he was now looking at his own body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected Joker won the couch, leaving Ryuji's body to sleep on the floor. Ryuji smiled as he layed on the bed in Ann's body, these hotel beds were much better than his own. Losing out on a night of sleeping on these would've been stupid<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the night the gang occasionally heard Mishima from the bathroom, he had drank some tap water and was now paying for it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning came and Ryuji woke up, he stretched Ann's arms. He had never slept in another body before and it was surprisingly comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to see his own body talking to Joker. \"Seriously man, you can't hang out with me and Mishima today? We were going to the beach and try to get babes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker pushed his glasses up, \"Sorry, I have other plans\" he smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji's own body was shocked \"dude, you have a date?! With who?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, not telling.\" Joker said and did a zipper motion witu his mouth before heading out the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine, me and Mishima will have fun all on our own!\" Ryuji's own body yelled, clearly upset he didn't have a date. He stormed out of the room, holding his back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji in Ann's body was similarly mad, both about Joker ditching him and his own body's situation. Even from a distance Ryuji could tell how much back pain his body had, that could ruin his whole day! Or rather, it could if he was still in that body. Ann got him into that situation, now she would be paying for it. He was going to spend the day in her body. Sure she would miss a day of the trip from her point of view, but she was also responsible for his day being ruined \"Sorry Ann, not my fault I suck at cards\" he said as he headed over to Ann's bag and got her bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the bathroom Ryuji heard the same sounds he heard all night, Mishima. It seemed like he wasn't going to be having a good day either after drinking that water. Ryuji looked at the app, since Mishima was one of his contacts he could transfer him to another body too. After all, not only was Mishima going through a bad day physically as well, he was also ditched by Joker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji looked at some of his contacts. He had Makoto's of course. She was probably going to be studying or some shit instead of relaxing, Mishima would hardly be ruining her day if he became her.

He didn't want to reveal the app to just anyone even if he was friends with Mishima. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to head back to Ann's room and changed into her swimsuit. She look at herself in the mirror and twirled around doing a few silly poses and snapping some pictures and emailed them to his second email account where he hid the things he didn't want others to see. He never checked the thing, so his own body wouldn't check it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered what happened last time, \"Shit better erase these pictures before Ann finds them again.\" He quickly erased the photos from Ann's phone. He made sure to grab some sunscreen and a change of clothes for later on in the day. He made his way to the beach and looked around at the many guys who were clearly checking out Ann's hot body. He grinned this was too easy time to pull off some acting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji went over to one of the beach chairs and laid down his stuff and began putting sunscreen on Ann's body. He got to the back and grinned time for his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cried out, \"Oh drat! I can't get any sunscreen on back if only some kind strong man could help me.\" He put extra emphasis on the second half which drew several guy's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young man approached him, \"Hey little lady need a hand with your sunscreen?\" The guy was pretty well built and looked to be a local in the area judging by how smooth his English was. He was probably only a year older than Ann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji smiled, \"Thank you so much! My name is Ann who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man said, \"My name is Nick pleasure to meet you. Why don't you roll over and I'll put the sunscreen on. Maybe after we could go for a swim together? It's pretty dangerous for a girl like you to be out on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji hid a smirk hook, line and sinker. He bet he could sucker the guy into buying him lunch later too. He rolled over on his back, \"Sure that sounds like a great idea! My friends ditched me so I'd love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy applied the sunscreen, \"All set Ann. I know a great swim spot not far from here. Follow me.\" He offered Ryuji his hand which Ryuji happily took. Nick led him to a shallow area that went a bit deep farther in. Nick was trying to impress Ryuji by showing how great a swimmer he was. As he finished his third lap to the booey and back. Ryuji decided to dive under the water and surprise Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was looking around for the cute blonde but didn't see her anywhere. Had he been ditched? As he was about to head back to shore he felt a large splash from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji smiled, \"Surprise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed, \"Oh now you're going to get it!\" He splashed back at Ryuji getting Ann's hair soaked. He didn't really care though this was too much fun. The two got into a splash fight for a few hour before they both went back to shore to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick said, \"Hey Ann it's pretty late in the afternoon why don't we get some lunch? I know a great Smoothie and Shrimp place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji giggled, \"Sure that sounds great. I was getting really hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick led Ryuji to a small cafe by the beach and ordered two strawberry smoothies and an order of shrimp. Ryuji enjoyed the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick asked, \"So Ann you're from Japan right? When are you going back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji answered, \"Yeah I go to Shujin High School. We have to go back tomorrow. We have a long flight ahead of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick said, \"Damn I was hoping to hang out some more. Can we exchange contact details?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji said, \"Sure why not. It'd be pretty cool to have a friend from America.\" The two exchanged contact details and continued chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji looked outside, \"Damn I got to go back to the hotel and pack up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick said, \"I had a great time today. Want me to walk you back to the hotel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji shook his head, \"Nah I think I'm good, but thanks for the offer.\" He got up and laid a couple dollars on the table to help with the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began making his way back to the hotel but spotted Joker with a girl he didn't recognize. Holy crap! Did Joker have a girlfriend? Why didn't he tell him? That's against the bro code. The girl had a red ribbon or something in her long brown hair that went to her shoulders. She looked familiar. Oh right! She was that Shogi player from Yusuke's school. Damn so that's the kind of girl Joker was into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to interrupt, but he made sure to remember Hifumi. The possible pranks he could do in the future if he got her contact info. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way back to the hotel to pack. He didn't want to switch back yet his back was still going to be freaking killing him on the long ass plane ride, but if Ann suddenly found herself back home after the trip it would lead to questions he didn't want to answer. He could switch to Kawakami she was old right? She would just chalk the plane ride back missing in her mind to bad memory probably. What should he do? </span></div></div>",

He opened the app and transferred his heart to Kawakami. His vision shifted and he found himself on the steps headed into the plane. He smirked to himself as he made his way to Kawakami's seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane trip was mindlillingly boring, at least on the way over he could talk to Joker about stuff, now he had nothing to do but fiddle with Kawakami's phone. He examined the app, just like his previous transfers Kawakami's contacts were added onto the app. Ryuji stared at the list, Kawakami must have texted a ton of students about homework and stuff in the past, as she had the numbers of so many students. Ryuji felt like he could become anyone at Shujin academy now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....that would be.....awesomeeeee\" the boredom of the school trip had gotten to Ryuji as he yawned, choosing to sleep the rest of the trip over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he awoke they were almost back in Japan.

Now what should he do now? He looked at the app and pondered the possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing on his mind was Joker's girlfriend, Hifumi. He was a bit peeved that he hadn't told Ryuji about her, maybe finding out her contact info and hopping into her body for a prank will teach him a lesson<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the new gigantic list of contacts he now had. Maybe the next time they're at school he could go on a mass body joyride. Hopping into a new person every 5 minutes or so. Cheerleaders, student council, delinquents, sport teams, the number of bodies felt endless. No one at Shujin liked or respected him so giving everyone a bit of embarrassment seemed like a harmless bit of payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji stared at the app, still on Kawakami's body and decided too...</span></div></div>",

He'd get all his contact information put into the app. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked, \"Booyah you're a genius Ryuji.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly opened up the app and transferred his heart to Joker's body which grinned. He went to check the app and found Hifumi's contact information had been added. He didn't feel like switching back to Kawakami who seemed confused about their arrival.

Why don't you get some sleep for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji didn't argue and headed up to Ren's room to sleep. He crashed on his bed and fell fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up the next day and rubbed his eyes. He remember he was in Joker's body right now. They all had the day off until classes started up tomorrow time to put his plan into action. Payback for Joker not telling him about Hifumi. He checked the last few messages from Hifumi. They only seemed to meet at night. Damn he'd have to wait. He had a couple idea he could just switch to Hifumi at night and screw with Joker that way or he could get Ren some new clothes for his girlfriend to see. He didn't know if Hifumi had anything like a high cut armor, so he didn't want to rely on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana said, \"Alright Joker let's call everyone together for a meeting we gotta discuss what we found in Makoto's sister's data.\"<br>\r\nRyuji thought, 'Shit right we have to hold a meeting about Makoto's sis.'

However this time when he could see clearly, he was completely tiny! Joker looked like a giant from his point of view <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOOOOOOAH!\" Ryuji exclaimed in excitement.

Nothing seemed the same from this height, things he would take for granted before like transhcan now looked as big as trees to him <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis childlike amazement stuck with him all the way to Shibuya, where it was immediately broken. As he was crossing the street he suddenly heard a sound, the pedestrian crossing had turned to walk! A stampede of giant feet came directly for him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji dodged the footsteps, holding Joker's phone in his mouth as best as he could! His life depened on it! He never thought of the Shibuya crowds as anything more than an inconvenience, but now they were deadly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting away from the stampede Ryuji began breathing heavily \"So that why....Mona stays in the bag...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to risk his life on the chance of there being another crowd, Ryuji dropped the phone and opened the app, he was transferring out of this nightmare!</span></div></div>",

He opened the app and chose to transfer to the most recent number he had put into it, Hifumi's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji's vision shifted, when it cleared he was looking down at a book of shogi strategies. Closing the book he looked at himself and his surrondings. He was sitting in what appeared yo be a church, looking at himself it was clear he was put in Hifumi's body. This was the first time he swapped into a person he had never met before and he felt a bit strange about hopping into a total stranger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god\" he sighed in Hifumi's unfamiliar voice, he was glad just to be human again. Ryuji sat in the church for a while, just trying to catch his breath after the Morgana incident<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his breath waa caught he was overcome with a sense of boredome. Neither Hifumi's Shogi book nor the atmosphere of the church were his style, theh bored him \"No use sticking around here.\" He told himself as he picked up Hifumi's bag and left<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around as Hifumi gave Ryuji a completely different feeling than he felt when walking around as Ann or anyone else, he at least knew those people but Hifumi and him were complete strangers who just happened to both know Joker<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of strangers, Ryuji pulled out his phone and looked at the Heart Transfer app again. Once Ren's contacts were added to it the list nearly doubled, how many people did Ren know? Men, women, and even a little boy were here<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Complete strangers, huh\" a small smirk appeared on Ryuji's face. Most of Ren's contacts were complete strangers to Ryuji, while this meant he didn't know them that also meant they had no way of suspecting him if something were to happen to them. Temptation getting the better of him Ryuji selected one of Ren's contacts, the young boy by the name of Shinya, and transfered his heart to Ann's body. Ryuji snickered \"I'll check in on that later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his tempted mischief over, Ryuji wondered what he should do now. He had enough of hopping bodies himself for now after what had happened with Morgana, but he wasn't sure what he should do as Hifumi. Looking down at his body he supposed he could go somewhere private like her home and see Joker's girlfriend's body for himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought that crossed his mind was to take advantage of being Joker's girlfriend. He knew Joker struck it rich with treasure demons in Mementos, calling a 'date' and being a demanding girlfriend could be fun and good revenge for Joker not telling him about Hifumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought Ryuji decided...</span></div></div>",

Looking down at himself, that was really all Futaba's body had going for it.

As he was waiting for the train he heard someone call out Hifumi's name. He turned to the source and saw a guy about his age he seemed to have just finished working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy said, \"Togo-san! What are you doing here? Aren't you usually at the church practicing for your next match?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji thought, 'Shit I didn't expect to run into someone she knows this damn quickly. I don't know jack about how Hifumi acts. This could be bad.' Suddenly some memories climbed up from the back of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji said calmly, \"I'm going to visit a Shogi friend is all. The church was filling up quickly today. I didn't want to get in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy said, \"Ah that makes sense. Well good luck on your next match. Not that you'll need it Shogi Queen.\" The guy left Ryuji alone and headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji took a deep sigh of relief. How'd he figure out Hifumi acted like that? There was that feeling in the back of his mind about it. Can he access a person's memories when possessing them? That could be useful for later on. Shogi Queen huh? He knew she was good, but was she really as good as the title implied? He tried to reach into those memories again and saw Hifumi roleplaying as a Queen when she got heated in a match with Joker. He thought Ann's acting was weird, but Hifumi took it to another level. She actually acted like a Queen sending her troops to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe muttered, \"Damn so that's the kind of girl Joker is into. I guess it makes sense he carries himself a lot differently in the Metaverse than in reality. No wonder he fell for her.\" But as interesting as the knowledge was it wasn't getting him out of this prank. Never break the Bro Code. Though looking into those memories gave him a brilliant idea. She wants to act like a Queen he'll let her. Joker will be her loyal Samurai. He knew Joker had some Samurai costumes in the closest. This would be brilliant He looked up a cosplay cafe in Akihabara. He knew they had stoick costumes for usage. He read the description, \"Join us in the Dimensional Cosplay Cafe. We got costumes of all kinds and couple surprise for couples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called up Haru in Ren's body. The phone rang a couple times before she picked up. \"Hello Ren Amamiya speaking. Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji said, \"It's me Ryuji. I got a brillant idea for the date. It's a cosplay cafe. I know Ren has a great Samurai cosplay hidden away in his room. Could you find it? I can pick up my costume from the cafe we're going to. It's couple's day we get a big discount on the food and any costumes we need to borrow if we come in a pair. It'll be a wonderful first place for a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji could hear ruffling in the phone likely Haru looking for the costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replied, \"Oh I found it! Is this really a good costume for the cafe though? What will you be dressing as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji said, \"A Female Shogun and you'll be my faithful Samurai. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru said, \"That sounds wonderful! Should I change now or wait till we get to the cafe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji said, \"Wait for me. My train should be here soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru said, \"Alright I'll see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji got on the train and arrived at Yongen Jaya. He made his way to Leblanc and saw Boss talking to some customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSojiro said, \"Oh you're a new face around here. What can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji said in character, \"Oh I'm actually here to speak with Ren. We were supposed to meet up today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSojiro raised an eyebrow was this Ren's girlfriend? He hadn't really kept up with what he was doing, but he did remember him mentioning getting Shogi lessons of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSojiro said, \"He's right upstairs. Try not to make too much noise alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji nodded and made his way up to Ren's room where Haru was waiting with a small bag. Morgana seemed to have returned and he didn't look happy about the meeting being put off, but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji said, \"I'm sorry I took so long Ren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru said, \"It's fine it took me a little while to clean up. Are you ready to go?\" She offered her or rather Ren's hand to 'Hifumi'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji giggled a bit, \"A gentleman are you?\" He took the offered hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru said, \"But of course. Let's get going. I have what I need in my bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made their way out of Leblanc. Ryuji swore he could hear boss say something like ooh boy but didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made their way to the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru giggled as they waited for the train. This was so much fun! She never really had a proper hang out or date with anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said, \"So where are we headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji said, \"We're off to Dimensional Cosplay Cafe. I'll have to borrow an outfit from them, but they rent them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru said, \"Ooh I can't wait to see your costume!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waited for the train and soon arrived at the cafe and were greeted by a receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist said, \"Welcome to the Dimensional Cosplay Cafe! Is this your first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru said, \"Yes it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you two enjoy your time here. Do you need a costume?\" The woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru said, \"I have my own, but my girlfriend needs one. We heard you could rent costumes here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! What kind of cosplay are you looking for miss?\" She turned to Ryuji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji said, \"Do you perhaps have a Female Shogun outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was a bit surprised by the requests, but nodded. \"Indeed we do. Why don't you follow me? As for your boyfriend the changing room is to the left here. Please once you've changed ring the bell in the room and wait for an attendant to show your to your table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru smiled, \"Thank you very much.\" She began making her way to the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist said, \"Please follow me dear. I'll show you to our costume storage.\" Ryuji followed the woman to the costume room and saw a large variety of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist said, \"I know you wanted to dress as a female Shogun, but I think I have another suggestion for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji asked, \"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist searched through the room and pulled out two outfits. One was a Shogun outfit and another a Kunonichi outfit. Both looked really good and could make a fun embarrassing photo opportunities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyji looked between the two and decided on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShogun Outfit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dncache-mauganscorp.netdna-ssl.com/thumbseg/1864/1864060-bigthumbnail.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://dncache-mauganscorp.netdna-ssl.c...</a><br>\r\nKunonichi: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/6186-1720885658.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/u...</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The original plan was to wear the female shogun outfit, however the Kunoichi outfit would allow him to have some more fun roleplaying. Plus it showed more skin, something he knew Hifumi would be embarrassed about, so Joker wouldn't want any photos of her in it getting out \"I'll take that one!\" Ryuji said and pointed at the Kunoichi outfit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter renting and changing into the costume, Ryuji and Haru began to roleplay, Ryuji set up Hifumi's camera to take pictures of the whole thing. \"Hifumi, we mist defend the Shogunate with our live!\" Haru said boastfully and held up a fake sword<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we shall be victorious for our lord!\" Ryuji said and did a pose with two toy knives. He smiled every time he heard Hifumi's camera go off. While Ryuji originally came here for the sole purpose of getting embarrassing photographs of Joker and Hifumi he was surprisingly having a lot of fun with Haru right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while their roleplaying got boring, however Ryuji was determined to get one final photo. Joker hadn't told the phantom thieves about his relationship with Hifumi, Ryuji felt he was keeping it a secret and while the currently taken photos could be embarrassing for Hifumi, they still just looked like two friends hanging out, he wanted to take one more photo thay would unmistakably be of a couple<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji suddenly grabbed Haru by the arm and had her face the camera, he got Hifumi's body as close to Joker's as he could and positioned himself as sexually ad possible. Once the camera flash went off he released a very confused Haru<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" Haru asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji began thinking up an excuse \"Well, uh, Ren and Hifumi aren't that close as a couple, so I wanted to show them how cute they look together\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru seemed to buy it \"Oh, that's so sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji looked at the time. It was still early afternoon, while he had his fair share of cosplay for the day, he wanted to do something else as Hifumi and Ren. Ryuji then suggested to Haru that they</span></div></div>",

Come by my room. Oh, and bring your swimsuit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the phone Makoto was clearly flustered, she had rarely, if ever, been invited for a girl's day out \"Sure! I'll be right there!\" She said before hanging up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji fist pumped. All he had to do now was go to Ann's room and wait.

How did I-\" she began to say before hearing her voice. She looked down at herself and squealed \"I-I- I'm a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji laughed. This had been the first time he had transfered someone else into another body. He probably acted like this himself the first time he had possessed Ann, but he still found Mishima's reaction funny \"Relax, Mishima\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann?! What did you do to me?!\" Mishima questioned, still looking down at his new body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Ann dude! I'm Ryuji!\" Ryuji shouted over him \"Let me explain-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji explained to Mishima the heart transfer app he had mysteriously gotten one day, and how he had so far used it to have fun with other people's bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did you turn me into Makoto?!\" Mishima was still distressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're day was going to be ruined just as much as mine! My body's back is gonna be hurting all day from sleeping on the floor, and you're going to be in the bathroom all day! It's Ann's fault I slept on the floor, so I became her. Makoto would have probably wasted her whole day reading or some shit so I gave you her body\" Ryuji explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMishima seemes to understand his logic, but there was one more question on his mind \"What about Ren? We were supposed to hang out with him today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well he ditched us!\" Ryuji said angrily \"Dude apparently has a girlfriend he wanted to be with instead of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He what?!\" Mishima said, sounding like a girl gossiping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so if he isn't willing to tell me about his girlfriend, I ain't telling him about this app!\" Ryuji said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we going to do with these bodies?\" Mishima asked, looking down at himself again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else?

He found himself boarding the plane and grinned before heading to Joker's seat.

I think I'll sleep on the way back. We got a long way back.\" Ryuji finished his preparations for take off and closed his eyes. he'd look into Joker's mystery girl later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Makoto' sighed in relief that was too close.

The Phantom Theives are in Japan after all. So many questions.\" The announcer said to turn off all phone to prepare for take off. 'Makoto' turned off her phone and pulle dout a book from her bag and decided to do some light reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the group returned to Japan. Ryuji decided to check Joker's message to find his best friend's girlfriend and came across the name Hifumi Togo. That was that shogi girl from Yusuke's school. So those are the kind of girls he was into. He could've sworn he was into Makoto, but eh whatever.

He opened the heart transfer app \"Let's see, I'm pretty sure I returned Mishima to his body.\" Ryuji assured himself. He had left Ann's body late last night and in his tired state assumed he returned Mishima to normal as well \"Makoto must be mad about blacking out for a whole day\" he tried to reason why she seemed off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on the rest of the plane ride was very uneventful. Mishima browsed the phansite on his phone as Ryuji dozed off in Joker's body. As the plane landed, Mishima took the first opportunity to get away from the others. He didn't want to give away that he was Makoto just yet, he wanted to stay as her for a little while longer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of staying as her, Mishima noticed something odd on Makoto's phone. Some app called Heart Transfer: Secondary? He opened it to check what it was. The app greetes him with the question \"Who will send their heart?\" And a very short list of names. Himself, Makoto, the other phantom thieves, somone named Sae Nijima who was most likely a relative of Makoto's, and someone named Eiko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMishima didn't fully understand what this meant, however he had an idea. His name was the odd one out here, the rest appeared to be Makoto's contacts but not him. It must be because he was currently inhabiting Makoto's body. He had a good feeling that if he sent his heart to any of the other people mentioned on here, he would be sent into their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever for now he put the phone away. He didn't feel like leaving Makoto's body after going through all the effort of staying in it the whole plane ride. He began to walk through town, he had no destination in mind but just walking around made him feel confident. Before he was a relatively weak and not very attractive boy with only average grades and an average life. Now he was seen as one of the smartest people on school, was strong and attractive, and he was almost positive Makoto was one of the phantom thieves!

Although just straight up making Mika look bad was tempting, not doing it at all would give him the freedom to do whatever he wanted in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji looked over to Ann, who seemed to be starting to calm down. He realized that she desevered an explanation of some kind. \"Ann, hang out at Big Bang Burger at around 8 tonight\" Ryuji asked her. He planned to tell her about the possession then<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn was confused at \"Mika\" asking to hang out, but her confused face quickly turned to a scowl \"and why should I go anywhere with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji smirked \"So you can understand what I'm about to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ryuji finished, someone came out the door and requested Mika \"Mika, you're up, are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no!\" Ryuji said, surprising Ann \"I'm not doing this damn shoot.\" Ryuji finsihed and began walking toward the exit without another word. He remember to pick up Mika's purse, but in his excitement of confusing Ann, he left Mika's phone, with the app, on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was outside, Ryuji wondered what he should do until 8 o clock. It was around 4 o clock right now, so he had about four hours to do whatever he wanted with Mika's body until he had to meet up with Ann \"hopefully she decides to show up\" he said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji wondered what to do until then, but there was two things that gave him an idea for what to do. The breeze between his legs and the emptyness in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika's outfit had been bothering him ever since he entered her body. He once again pulled at the hems of his skirt as a breeze picked up. he looked through her wallet once the wind stopped \"She probably has enough to buy something more my style\" he told himself. The Shibuya underground mall wasn't far, he could probably go over and buy an outfit real quick<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji's other main complaint right now was how empty his stomach felt. Mika probably had a strict diet that she followed, being a model. Howver Ryuji was not used to it and was taking it pretty bad. He felt so hungry. He needed to go get something to eat. He knew a few good places to eat around here, none of them good for Mika's diet, so he could probably run and get some food before or after he got a different outift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile part of Ryuji felt guilt that he was about to spend someone else's money and ruin a diet, he shrugged it off \"it's karma, she treats Ann like shit, so bad things are about to happen to her\" Ryuji said, indirectly calling himself \"bad\"</span></div></div>",

It was maybe even worse than having Mika's bare legs out to the wind. He'd be able to get food with Ann later - clearly Mika's body was conditioned to hunger - but Ryuji wouldn't wait that long in this outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lucky enough to get to Shibuya without any sort of interruption or harassment on the train. That was also an experience he could do without. Thankfully, the mall was not far off from his stop, and he wouldn't have to walk far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the mall, he found to his surprise that he blended in <i>better</i> than he did in his own body. Young women frequented the mall often, so Mika didn't look at all out of place, while Ryuji's dyed blond hair and general punk demeanor often got him stared at. He supposed he could be grateful for this small mercy as he meandered around open clothing stores, browsing from place to place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I don't even really know what size Mika is...'</i> Ryuji realized as he was looking over tags. Women's sized seemed a bit more nebulous to him overall than men's. <i>'Why did I get myself into this...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ma'am, do you need a hand?\" A high pitch voice suddenly chirped in. Ryuji didn't immediately turn his head until it spoke again. \"Miss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, yes. I, could use some help, if you don't mind,\" Ryuji found himself responding, his tone quick and abrupt. He found  a woman with a nametag reading 'Aika' and a blue polo standing next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything in particular?\" she asked, smile on her face. \"You look like you could be a model - I bet anything would look nice on you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji gave a smirk. If only she knew. \"Heh, yeah, I guess so. I just uh, needed your help with some sizes. Maybe an extra pair of shoes too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gave another quick smile and an affirmative thumbs up. \"I live to serve. Give me an idea of what you're looking for and I'm sure I can help find something matching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Must be paid on commission,' </i> Ryuji figured, putting a hand absently to Mika's hip as he tried to hide an eye roll. \"Well, I was thinking of something like this...\"</span></div></div>",

You have something like that in my size?\" Ryuji asked the woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was confused at first, with the way that Ryuji was currently dressed, she wasn't expecting him to pick out what he did. However, she just kept a smile on her face \"Of course, miss. just follow me for a second and I'll have some for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji followed the woman and was soon given clothes like the ones he picked out and was directed to a changing room. Once he entered and saw a mirror, his face began to turn red. He was about to change clothing in a girl's body. A smile grew on his face as he began to take off Mika's dress. \"Well, it's my body for now, no problem in looking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji exited the changing room \"This will work\" he said absently, still thinking about his experiance less than a minute ago. \"Can you show me where shoes are?\" He asked, walking in heels wasn't something he ever planned to do, and the past hour made him hate heels forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. Follow me.\" The woman said and guided Ryuji to some shoes. Ryuji briefly looked through them, he soon found a pair of red sneakers in Mika's size. He didn't particularly care what they looked like, just that they were sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was finished, Ryuji headed toward checkout and paid for the outfit and shoes he had picked out. \"Good thing I remembered Mika's purse\" Ryuji said under his breath, still unaware that he left something much more important behind at the photo shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ryuji left the mall, he immediately felt more comfortable than he did walking around in Mika's dress and heels. \"That reminds me.\" He said with a smirk. He had put Mika's dress and heels into two bags after he changed clothing after buying the new clothes. He went over to a nearby trashcan and threw them away. \"Who would willing wear something like that in public anyway?\" He said as he walked away from the trashcan <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji looked toward a nearby clock to check the time, he wasn't sure how long he had spent shopping. He wondered how much time he had before he had to meet up with Ann.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thankfully, time passed quickly while Ryuji was shopping, and it was already time to meet up with Ann at the Big Bang Burger. He was a bit jittery as he made his way out of the Underground Mall and into Shibuya proper. It was going to be an uphill battle explaining this all to Ann, but he figured it was as good a way as any. After all, he wasn't the type to keep secrets from his friends. He could barely keep a secret in general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardest part of the trip was climbing all the stairs out of the metro. Ryuji's real body had a bad leg, but Mika seemed to just lack stamina. He was surprised to find himself huffing a bit as he reached the station square. The restaurant wasn't far though, and he thankfully managed to reach it in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, he was greeted in a booth by a curious and somewhat annoyed Ann Takamaki. Ann lifted an eyebrow quizzically as 'Mika' sat down across from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mika? Wh-what are you wearing??\" She asked in a bit of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji smirked a bit. \"Bit of a wild story. Just hang with me here though. Y'see, I'm not actually who you think I am...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short retelling later, and Ann was looking even more confused, twitching an eye. \"So what you're telling me is, you're Ryuji.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji nodded. \"Yup. The real deal, sorta.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"That's insane. I've seen some crazy things, but I don't believe. So tell me, 'Ryuji', what do my friends call me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Panther,\" Ryuji replied proudly and loudly, raising Mika's arms in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were supposed to whisper it you goon!\" Ann replied, waving her arms in frustration. She sighed. \"I... guess I have to believe it then. Another screwy app.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you it was true,\" Ryuji had a goofy grin plastered over Mika's face, crossing her arms smugly. His face faltered as he saw Ann furrow her brow and her expression shifted to anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means, while I was blacked out, you were controlling me.\" Her tone was flat, but hid some fury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, yeah, but I didn't do anything!\" Ryuji asserted, sinking back into his booth seat. \"That was just an accident. I mostly spent that time disoriented.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I know you too well for that to be true!\" Ann replied, smacking her hands down on the table. A vindictive grin came over her face. \"You owe me for that lost time. Let me see the app!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji figured her intentions wouldn't be great for him, but he decided he would be best off complying in the long run. He reached through Mika's purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Ryuji?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...any day now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryuji?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two \"girls\" beat a hasty retreat from the restaurant, leaving their food only half eaten in the rush. Thankfully, neither of them were very torn up about having Mika pay the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You absolute moron! How could you just forget something like that!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno! Everything was kind of a distraction!\" Ryuji shouted back. It struck him that even going full tilt, Mika's body was way too slow. Her chest was bouncing all about, her purse was dead weight, and she was overally a bit slower than Ann even. This body was suddenly becoming a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them squabbled like that the whole way to the site of the photo shoot. Being able to yell at Ryuji and Mika simultaneously was actually pretty cathartic for Ann, but she wasn't going to revel in it until they got the phone safely into their possession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the building, they found...</span></div></div>",

Even if I do get caught, as long as I get the phone first, I can just quickly change bodies\" Ryuji explained his plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Mika?\" Ann said and crosses her arms.

He breathed a huge sigh of relief when he saw that it was lying on the table where he had left it.

You've been reckless with this thing! And you've only had it for a few hours. I think I should hold on to it while you learn a thing or two about responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eff that, give it back!\" Ryuji made a rush for the bag, but Ann held him off with a simple dodge and push.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryuji, we're in public! Cut that out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, how long do you intend to leave me like this then,\" Ryuji asked, teeth gritted in embarrassment as he realized they were getting some stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn shrugged. \"However long I think it takes you to learn a lesson. Now, if you're done, I think we should be one our way. I'll atleast tell you where Mika lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, eff this,\" Ryuji murmured to himself as he turned the keys to Mika's apartment. Mika was a bit older than the Phantom Thieves, and lived on her own. Being a model, it seemed, required her to travel around a lot, so living with her family wasn't very convenient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Atleast that's one lucky thing,' </i> he reasoned as he opened the door to a very bland living room. Beige walls, a two-seat couch, and a kitchenette were all that adorned the tiny abode, other than a closet and a door to a bedroom. Most apartments in Tokyo <i>were</i> pretty small, so Mika was lucky to have this one to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking off the shoes he had bought, Ryuji let out an undignified grunt as he collapsed onto Mika's couch, exhaling deeply. <i>'Damn, what an exhausting day.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis exhaustion soon, came to anger, however. \"It was all an effin accident! She didn't have to freak like that!\" he shouted as he stomped around. \"What am I even supposed to do in this body?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BZZZZ* </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji's head turned on a swivel. A noise was coming from Mika's bedroom. Was that a phone? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Ryuji's consternation, it was a work phone. It seemed Mika kept an older model for business contacts, and Ann had taken her personal phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atleast I have a freakin' cell phone,\" he murmured as he looked the phone over while sitting on Mika's bed. Thankfully, Mika's fingerprint sufficed, letting him skip the number password. She had some texts from work it seemed, asking her if she was okay. Ryuji had made a bit of scene just storming off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>We don't want to push you too hard. You can take a day or two off if you need to, just inform us in advance.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking a few sickdays would be a tempting offer,\" Ryuji murmured to himself. \"But what if Ann wants me to pretend to be her? Ugh. I think I have to go with this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji drafted up a reply apologizing for running off set. Something about a family emergency, but everything was fine now. He assured the contact that everything would be fine and he'd show up the next day, throwing in a few hearts and the like to make it all look extra sweet and flowery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that unpleasantness set to the side, he turned an eye to Mika's bedroom mirror. \"So... got some time to kill I guess.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the past few days he had been pretending to be Mika and attending these shoots for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had much less trouble with the shoots than he was expecting, most of the time Mika's muscle memory did all the work for him. If it weren't for the fact that he was doing it against his will, he might've enjoyed it, not that he would ever admit that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, <i>Mika</i>\" Ann, who was also at the shoot, said. \"Soooo, what have you been doing after work lately?\" Ann asked Ryuji, she was only really able to keep an eye on him during shoots, she had no way of knowing what he was doing any other time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji knew she was testing him, so he quickly made up a lie \"Oh, not much. Mostly staying in shape and keeping my diet.\" In reality, Ryuji had been acting like himself anytime he wasn't at the shoot. His current body certainly made him popular around the arcade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're also not wearing punk style clothes like you were the other day\" Ann said, holding back a giggle. Ryuji was currently wearing a short dress similar to to the one Mika often wore, however the one he was wearing was red <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji clenched a fist, it was clear Ann was trying to tempt him into snapping at her, but he persevered. \"Yeah, it's not very professional for a model to not wear clothes as fashionable as the ones she models\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn seemed to be thinking about something for a second. She then spoke \"Well, <i>Mika</i>, you've done a pretty good job the past few days.\" Ann said and reached into her purse<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji was ecstatic. He was sure that he'd finally be able to go back to his body.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't the biggest fan of their music, but at least it was something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking for directions, Ryuji eventually found his way to where they were. There was a stand set up and two lines of people waiting to get a handshake and autograph from Rise and/or Kanami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I'm not waiting in that.\" He told himself, and was about to walk away, when he suddenly heard a voice talking into a microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone, That's enough for the handshakes. Next up we have a special event planned for you.\" A man in a suit, probably Rise's agent, said. This gained Ryuji's interest. \"For the next hour, Rise and Kanami will be able to answer your phone calls and answer your question in front of everyone here!\" He said and put up a banner showing a phone number, probably one that would only be used for this event<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji saw oppurtunity here.

What are you wearing?\" Ann said, shocked that Mika had not only come back, but was wearing an outfit much unlike her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll....explain.....later.\" Ryuji said, gasping for air between words. \"Is my phone here anywhere?\" He asked, but looking around, he quickly found it sitting on the table from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had the phone back, he left again. \"Okay, so I want to become an idol girl for a bit, but I also need to meet up with Ann later.

Once he got on the train he pulled out Mika's phone. \"This should keep Mika distracted long enough.

So which one of you girls wants to answer the final caller before the special goodbye?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise-chan you can have the honor, I got the most calls so it's only fair you get the last one.\u201d Kanami quietly chirps in Rise\u2019s ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure Kanami-chan? Rise whispers back to her fellow idol and friend. \u201cWell if you insist, thank you.\u201d Rise perks up quickly putting her \u2018Risette Face\u2019 back on for the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise picks up the ringing phone a part of her hopes the final caller is senpai calling her, just the thought alone made her feel warm and tingly all over. She answers the phone with more enthusiasm than the calls she answered to from the past hour. \u201cHello, you're talking to Ri-\u201d Her words were lost when her mind and body is suddenly taken over by another consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji presses send and faster than he can blink, he was no longer in the subway train, but sitting in front of a large crowd of people. It was clear it worked. He looked down at himself and saw that he was wearing the outfit Rise had been wearing, he felt very exposed. The top jacket left her chest very exposed with her bra visible for the world to see, and her plaid skirt was very short showing off every inch of her smooth legs leaving little to the imagination. The exposed midriff of Rise\u2019s lean yet soft stomach didn't help at all to keep Ryuji\u2019s face from turning red. He darted his eyes away to keep his mind focused on the crowd, and prevent himself from accidentally cause \u2018Rise\u2019 to have a nosebleed in front of her fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise-chan what's wrong?\u201d A voice next to Ryuji spoke to him that he almost ignored until realization hit him that the speaker was addressing his new body's name. He looked towards where the voice came from now remembering that the other idol Kanami was with Rise during the call session who now was leaning over on his side of the booth with a worried look on her face wondering why her friend suddenly stopped talking to the caller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh uh\u2026 they uh\u2026 they hanged up I guess.\u201d Ryuji lied unconvincingly while trying to get his head out of the gutter, and getting accustomed to his new voice and identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhearing what Ryuji said, Rise\u2019s manager speaks again into the microphone. \u201cThat's unfortunate to hear Risette-chan, but I'm afraid that's all the time we have. Thank you all for coming here today, but before we go Risette and Kanamin wants to give you lovely fans a special goodbye from the bottom of their hearts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Special goodbye! I don't even know what the hell to say to these people!\u2019</i> As much Ryuji enjoys being the center of attention, public speaking was a different story. In a state of panic he blurted out the most idol girl goodbye he could think of. \"Thank you for coming to see us, we love you all!\" He ends it with an awkward wink to the crowd which in turn was eaten up by the fans with loud cheers and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEffing nailed it!\u201d Ryuji said to himself, very proud of his BS-ing skills. After \u2018Rise\u2019 gave her goodbye closing line, Kanami gives her own goodbye ending it with her signature pose getting the same results from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the event was finally over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were done, they left the booth and were greeted by Rise's manager. \u201cGood job you two, and that was a great ad-libbed goodbye on your end Rise-chan. You didn't even need the script we made for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... script?\u201d Ryuji half listened vaguely recalled a piece of paper on Rise\u2019s booth, but was too distracted to actually look at it, and he didn't want to look down at his new body and \u201cassets\u201d again until he was somewhere more private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding to get away from the idol and manager he makes a hasty excuse. \u201cHey uh, I'm gonna go take a leak if you guys need me for anything, and like whatever.\u201d he said crudely, not sure how to act like Rise since he knew next to nothing about her as a person, so he just winged it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kanami or the manager could question his unlady-like choice of words, he quickly leaves for the nearest restroom for privacy only to nearly stumble over himself rediscovering he is wearing the most \u201cpain-in-the-ass footwear\u201d he had the misfortune of wearing again: High Heels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod dammit! I just got rid of these effing things! Why do girls wear this shit?\u201d Ryuji angrily kicks off the shoes, and carries them with one hand contemplating whatever or not to toss them in the trash like he did with Mika's. Depending if this Rise chick is as bad or even worse than the aforementioned model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Ryuji eventually make it to the restroom?</span></div></div>",

He had short silver-grayish hair in a bowl style haircut, with a matching color set of eyes.

It\u2019s very unprofessional to be playing games on your phone when you should be focusing on your idol work\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji\u2019s body betrayed him and his blushing grew more and more intense as Yu reprimanded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about this, if you make sure to be a good girl on our trip today, I\u2019ll let you have it back tomorrow morning\u201d, Yu whispered to his humiliated partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji\u2019s fury and embarrassment quickly switched to confusion when the man uttered the word trip. \u201cTrip? What the hell is going on?!\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting her confused expression, Yu stated, \u201cOh you didn\u2019t hear? I know we planned to head out tomorrow, but I thought we could go to Inaba today. In fact, I already bought the train tickets\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrain tickets? Inaba?\u201d, Ryuji mumbled in a confused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I already got your bags ready. They\u2019re waiting for us in a taxi just outside. But we gotta go now!\u201d, Yu spoke before he grabbed his girlfriend and pulled her outside and into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile riding the vehicle that would take him far away from his home, Ryuji thought about the mess he got himself into. He knew that the instant he got access to his phone he had to undo the error he just made. \u201cBut would it work over such long distances?\u201d Thoughts like this tormented Ryuji as he got closer and closer to his destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis concentration was broken when a ringtone went off. He looked over to \u201chis\u201d lover as he pulled out a phone from his pocket. Catching a glimpse of the caller ID, he made note of the name \u201cNaoto Shirogane\u201d. Wasn\u2019t that a famous kid detective or something? Thinking about how many years had passed he realized that she probably wasn\u2019t a kid anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short conversation later, the grey-haired young adult leaned towards Ryuji and said, \u201cShe\u2019s already waiting for us at the train station\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji looked into this man\u2019s eyes, which he noticed had a startling resemblance to his hair, and nodded. He looked forward and jumped when the man, put his arm around Rise\u2019s body. He pulled her close and planted a kiss on her cheek, causing Ryuji\u2019s face to flair up into a bright red again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived a blue haired girl was waiting for them. She was wearing a white dress shirt, with a blue t-shirt underneath. She waved at the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis must be Naoto\u201d Ryuji thought. He thought that he remembered that Naoto was a guy, but maybe this was a different Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they drew near, the girl greeted them. \u201cHello Rise. Hello Yu\u201d, she articulated in a formal tone. As Ryuji made a mental note of the name of his pretend-lover, she bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re always so formal Naoto\u201d, Yu declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow have you been Rise?\u201d, asked the blue haired possible detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh g-g-good Nao-chan! Th-thanks for asking\u201d, Ryuji replied uncomfortably, trying to put on his best Rise impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how much I hate it when you call me that\u201d, the girl expressed. Ryuji gulped as her eyes narrowed in suspicion. Fortunately, her face returned to a neutral expression. \u201cWell we should be going now!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji sighed in relief as they entered the train station. Some time after they climbed aboard a train heading to Inaba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours Ryuji tried to maintain his best Rise impression as Naoto chatted with him. He was sure that she knew that something was up, but considering the strange nature of the app he was sure she would never find out the truth of his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at 11pm and when they left the train station another girl was there to welcome them. Her hair was long and black and she was wearing a kimono. She bowed towards Naoto before nearly knocking Ryuji over with a bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much! You\u2019re so busy with your idol life that you never visit..\u201d, the girl spoke to Ryuji. With a mad expression she said, \u201cEven Naoto comes to visit more than you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhehe, s-sorry about that\u201d, Ryuji replied in his feminine voice. He caught a glimpse of Naoto\u2019s suspicious eyes in his peripheral vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry that the rest didn\u2019t come but it looks like they\u2019re all asleep\u201d, the girl apologized. \u201cYou think they would\u2019ve gotten used to falling asleep late because of the midnight channel\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidnight.. channel?\u201d, Ryuji thought. \u201cWhat are they talking about\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m ready for some shut-eye too\u201d said Yu. \u201cDo you have our rooms ready in the inn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou betcha!\u201d, the girl exclaimed. \u201cBut next time can you not ask for them on such short notice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu chuckled. \u201cI wanted to surprise you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the inn, Ryuji noticed a portrait of the long-haired girl done in an older Japanese style with a plaque beneath it. The plaque had something inscribed on it: \u201cYukiko Amagi\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like it Rise?\u201d, Yukiko asked. \u201cI had it commissioned last year. I think it adds to the \u2018traditional atmosphere\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji nodded before Yukiko lead them upstairs. She showed Naoto to her room, and after they said good night, Yukiko led the two of them to theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Ryuji noticed when entering the room was the single large foam mattress in the middle of it. This trip just got worse and worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Yukiko said goodnight closed the door, Yu tore off his clothes (sans underwear), fell on to the mattress and instantly started snoring. It was now time for action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji remembered that he had put Rise\u2019s phone away in the  shirt pocket he had been wearing. But when Ryuji checked it, nothing was there. He proceeded to check any other area he could\u2019ve put his phone away in, but he found nothing. Confused he headed over to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring into the attractive face of the idol he was possessing Ryuji began to think. Where could her phone be? Maybe he had hidden it in his luggage? But Ryuji has been with him this entire time and he had never gone near his luggage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking was never Ryuji\u2019s forte, he\u2019d need some help. Some phantom thief help. This was an old town, he was sure there was a pay phone somewhere. Maybe Ren even had access to the app and could bail him out remotely. And with that, Ryuji snuck out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crept towards the lobby and soon the door was in reach. And when he looked out that door he saw...</span></div></div>",

Other than the hum of the street lights the town was silent. He stepped onto the asphalt and slowly walked over to the pay phone. He wasn\u2019t used to wearing a skirt yet and it was a bit uncomfortable, but nevertheless he persisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there he began to think. Ren was their leader and it would make most sense to call him. Ryuji was sure that he\u2019d know what to do. He hadn\u2019t memorized Ren\u2019s number yet but he had a vague idea of it. He put a few coins in and tried the first number he thought of. No answer. It was late but Ren usually answered even at this time, so he tried one similar to it. Three rings later, someone picked up. A wave of relief fell over Ryuji\u2019s face when he heard the voice of his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d asked a tired and pissed off voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Ren POV\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Tokyo, Ren has been in deep sleep before his phone had woken up. He checked it and the caller ID displayed an unfamiliar number. Despite this he answered. Maybe it was one of his his friends who was in a pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d were the first words to come out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-h-hello, is this Ren Amimaya?\u201d, a female voice uttered from the other end. It sounded familiar but it definitely wasn\u2019t one of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this commotion Morgana was woken up and he certainly wasn\u2019t happy. He jumped up on to Ren\u2019s bed, determined to stop whatever was keeping him from sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, who is this?\u201d, he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d, asked the cat. \u201cWho the hell is taking to you at this time of night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure that out too\u201d, replied Ren. \u201cPipe down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might not believe but I\u2019m actually Ryuji. Ryuji Sakamoto\u201d, answered the female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome girl is saying that she\u2019s Ryuji\u201d, Ren told Morgan\u2019s<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell whether if it\u2019s Ryuji or not tell them to piss off\u201d, Morgana retorted. \u201cIt\u2019s late and I\u2019m trying to sleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I can hear you, you stupid cat\u201d, the female voice surprisingly screamed back. \u201cShut up! I really need some help\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait did she just hear me talk?!\u201d, Morgana exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you! I\u2019m really Ryuji Sakamoto\u201d, the voice yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re really Ryuji tell me something only he would know!\u201d, Ren commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously!?\u201d, the girl snapped back. \u201cFine! You\u2019re the leader of the Phantom Thieves!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so loudly!

Do you know anything about this Mona?\u201d, asked Ren<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not really\u201d, the cat replied. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something meta verse related, but I had no idea this was possible\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji sighed. \u201cUseless as usual Mona\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up doofus!\u201d, he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you let your horniness get you stuck in Japan\u2019s number one idol!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Kanami dingus!\u201d, Rise\u2019s voice yelled back, in a tone that had never touched her lips before. \u201cAnd don\u2019t pretend you wouldn\u2019t have taken Ann out for a spin if you had a phone, you stupid cat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a cat!\u201d, Morgana cried out. \u201cAnd I never would\u2019ve possessed her. I\u2019m not a creepy pervert like you a-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Morgana was cut off by Ren yelling:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, both of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Mona, \u201cWhether you like it or not, you\u2019ll need to help him get back Mona\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he leaned closer to the phone, \u201cAnd you\u2019ll need his help unless you want to keep being some grey haired guy\u2019s chick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of silence later, an idea burst into Ryuji\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t have the app Ren?\u201d, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, let me check\u201d, the leader answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen swiped into his home screen and found...</span></div></div>",

He could risk bringing out his and fighting, but he didn\u2019t want her to know that he wielded the same power. Besides, he didn\u2019t even know if it would even work.

But instead of either of those options, the girl stuck her hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for Ryuji to figure out what she was doing, but eventually he took her hand and helped himself up.

Her exposed midriff didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Ryuji blinked, the crowd of people in front of him made it clear that the possession.

He looked in the bathroom mirror. He really was the idol Rise Kujikawa now. \"How does she stand wearing this?!

That split second was all Ryuji needed to know that the unknown guy was eyeing him. Being a guy himself, he would've looked away if any girls he checked out caught him staring. Then a thought occurred to him that he is currently in the body of an attractive young woman. He got chills in his spine knowing that some creep was checking him out like today's lunch special (not realizing the irony of his thoughts).

All their targets previously had undergone similar states, acting drowsy, off kilter, or strange after a heist, but Futaba was more or less completely drained by the whole thing, leaving most of the thieves worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can send her my heart. Best I can do to wish her a speedy recovery,\u201d Ryuji joked to himself as he idly tapped her name, not expecting what was to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn intense drowsiness hit Ryuji as he suddenly found himself lying down face first on a bed, eyes closed. Not only did he feel exhausted, he felt\u2026 weak. And light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026 where am I?\u201d he murmured as he pushed himself upwards. He opened his eyes, but everything was blurred, like he was underwater or something. He began to panic, thrashing around and throwing the sheets off himself as he stumbled to his feet. Everything felt off as he stumbled around, feeling blind. The room he was in was cluttered, and he felt a sharp pain in his foot as he stepped on a stray piece of plastic he couldn\u2019t identify. He fell forward, onto the floor, orange strands of hair spilling over his face as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-orange?!\u201d Who died his hair while he was sleeping? Why was it so long? He pushed the hair out of his sight, only to find something that raised even more questions as he looked face forward to find a mirror reflecting a blurry, but familiar image: Futaba Sakura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Ryuji a few more minutes of panicked searching before he ultimately pieced together what was happening and managed to find Futaba\u2019s glasses, hesitantly putting them on. The fact that his vision cleared up perfectly only confirmed his worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did that thing do to me?!\u201d A scan of the mirror with clear vision revealed himself to be in Futaba\u2019s body, wearing a long sleeve shirt and a pair of short shorts that left his legs very exposed. Not to mention, he was tiny. \u201cThis can\u2019t be real\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018You\u2019re telling me\u2026\u2019 </i>Ryuji suddenly heard a voice echo through his head. The voice was high pitched, a girl, but still a bit sardonic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that!?\u201d Ryuji shouted with a jump, far too off set by everything happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Who am I? Who are you!\u2019 </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I was Ryuji, but I\u2019m not entirely sure right now\u2026 eff this, I need my phone!\u201d Ryuji scrambled over to Futaba\u2019s desk, loaded with monitors and the like, locating a smart phone. Unfortunately, it was pass-code protected \u2013 nothing he did would open it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Try 386750,\u2019</i> the voice chirped in his head again. Tapping in the code, Ryuji found it worked perfectly. Ryuji realized it sounded a lot like his own voice at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFutaba?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Ring ring ring, you got it, now what\u2019s going on? Why can\u2019t I move my body?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea, but maybe I can fix it\u2026\u201d Ryuji murmured as he found the app from before, opening it up to find a message pop up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cError, Heart Transfer Incomplete due to Interference. Recommended that User Return Immediately.\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he clicked through, he found an option that said \u201cUndo\u201d. He gave a sharp sigh of relief, knowing there was a way back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018What is this on my phone?\u2019 </i>The voice asked again. <i>'I'm kinda freaking out here too. Could you tell me what's going on? This is a weird fever dream, right?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Ryuji opt to leave without saying more, or did he stay to explain what had happened to Futaba. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You said you were Ryuji a minute ago, but how are you in my body?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji explained to Futaba everything he knew about the app he received, which admittedly wasn't much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji re-read the app explanation on Futaba's phone \"It says that the transfer didn't complete because it was interuptted, I wonder what could have caused that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji then heard Futaba's voice chuckle in his head. <i>\"I still had the protection that prevented you guys from texting me back unless i allowed it enabled. Good to see it works well enough that even an out of this world app had troublesending something\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it still let me through, it just didn't finish\" Ryuji said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Quiet you! It worked well enough! Besides, we can use this mess to stop the fake Medjed!\"</i> Futaba said, starting to get excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For real?!\" Ryuji practically shouted surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah! Hear me out. I was asleep until you took over my body, I bet the second you leave I'll fall asleep again. So what I'll need you to do is listen and hack into the fake Medjed for me. That way we won't have cut it so close to the deadline\" </i>Futaba began to explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait wait, no way man. I Don't know a thing about hacking!\" Ryuji shook Futaba's hands in a no motion with his hands as he said this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba's voice somehow sighed despite her not currently having lungs <i>\"You Don't need to know anything. I'll walk you through every step. You'll just need to do everything I say. Now sit down at my computer desk, we have a lot of work ahead of us\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji thought it over for a few seconds before grinning and walking over to Futaba's desk \"Alright, let's take 'em down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few hours Ryuji obeyed as Futaba barked orders at him and berated him every time he made a small mistake like pressing the wrong key. After what felt like an eternity, Ryuji looked at the clock and saw that it was almost midnight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay, we're almost done. Just two more hours of this and we'll be done!\"</i> Futaba informed him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Futaba said this, Ryuji raised her arms and yawned \"then we'll finish in the morning\" he said and stood up from the desk and began to walk sleepily to Futaba's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What?! No! We're almost done! Less sleep! More hack!\"</i> Futaba mentally yelled at Ryuji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body is too tired to continue working.\" Ryuji said as he laid down on Futaba's bed. \"You can't always push yourself to Your limits, it's not healthy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba wanted to say something to convince Ryuji to continue working, but part of her knew he was right, so she said nothing as Ryuji went to sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ryuji first awoke in the morning, he thought that what had happened the previous night was a dream. That was until he heard Futaba's voice shouting in his mind <i>\"finally! Get up! Get up! Let's finish this!\"</i> She said hyperactive and excited to finish this hack<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji opened his eyes and looked down at himself, he was still in Futaba's body. \"Damn, all of that actually happened yesterday.\" He said, amazed he didn't dream it all up. He blushed as it occurred to him that he had spent nearly a day as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji picked himself out of bed and once again sat down at Futaba's desk. He followed her orders exactly for what felt like 2 more hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And we're finished!\" </i>Futaba exclaimed. <i>\"Fake Medjed is going to be panicking really soon\" she said, proud of her work</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what did we do to them?\" Ryuji asked, he may have been doing everything Futaba said, but he didn't understand a single part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll explain to you at the same time as the other Phantom Thieves, but don't worry, I have saved the day, you can begin thanking me now.\"</i> Futaba said smuggly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Now that's over with, I can head back to my own body.\" Ryuji said as he picked up Futaba's phone and opened the heart transfer app back up.</span></div></div>",

It seemed like he was on the subway train to Shibuya, dressed casually for the summer heat. Losing a day of his own life was definitely a strange reality to come to terms with, but it seemed like everything was fine while he was out in Futaba's body. As far as his texts told him, nothing significant had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'll hit up the arcade for a bit of normality...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thought came to him, the train itself came to a halt at his stop. He hopped off, and made his way to his usual hangout spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not anywhere near the King, huh?\" Ryuji murmured as he put away the controller of a shooting game. He'd hoped that all the Metaverse battles would improve his aim, but there was no such luck. In truth, his mind was still on that app, and the fact that he and Futaba seemingly took down Medjed together while sharing her body. It wasn't easy to jump straight from that back to his own day to day, even with Metaverse training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to his phone, the app still there. Would Futaba wake up and explain things soon? Would she want Ryuji to share the details of the app? Ryuji would rarely admit it around others, but he knew he wasn't that smart of a guy. However, even he was able to take down an international hacktivist group with Futaba doing some backseat driving. He sort of wanted her judgement on the matter before he started using it more or telling other people about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she'll reply if I shoot her a text...\"</span></div></div>",

He found himself staring at a blank point on the wall, not sure where else to look while talking to a voice in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Akihabara!\"</i> she replied back. <i>\"There's some computer parts I need to get, and I don't want Sojiro asking too many questions.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji furrowed Futaba's brow. \"You don't need me for that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes I do though!

Eyes focused on the ceiling, he slid off the shorts Futaba had been wearing, cringing as his now hairless legs felt even more exposed to the air. Much to his relief, he quickly replaced them with a pair of cargo pants, glad he didn't have to linger too long on the differences between himself and Futaba as he pulled the zipper and buttoned them up.

Who created it...\u2019 Futaba wondered before deciding to select her own name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part was very similar to previous. The differences were that the message now said \u2018Who will receive the heart?\u2019 and that her own name was now missing from the list. \u2018I guess I can\u2019t send my heart to myself, whatever that means.\u2019 Futaba thought before selecting another name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho\u2019s name did she pick?</span></div></div>",

The moment she said that, she knew something was off. That wasn't her voice and she was no longer wearing glasses. What had happened to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurriedly left the mall, hoping to escape the crowds and find out what had happened to her. She eventually reached a secluded area where she then reached to look for her phone. As she did, she realised something else,. She wasn\u2019t wearing her own clothes, she was wearing Ann\u2019s. Frantically, filled with more panicked confusion, she reached into her pocket and pulled out Ann\u2019s phone. She quickly opened the camera app to finally solve this mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m Ann!?\u201d Futaba stated, completely shocked. Did the app transfer her consciousness into Ann\u2019s body? Is that what it meant by sending hearts? What happened to her own body? closed the camera app only to find that the mysterious app was now on Ann\u2019s phone too, accompanied by a message that explained the app\u2019s features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo my body will simply act like me? That\u2019s convenient but I\u2019d have liked to know this beforehand\u201d Futaba muttered, her anxiety dissipating.

Futaba pulled out her phone and opened the app.<br>\r\n\u201cThis app.\u201d She said, looking into his eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s special about this app? Did you make it to help the phantom thieves or something?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make it. It downloaded itself onto my phone just like the metanav.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt did?\u201d Akira stared inquisitively at Futaba, trying time gauge if this was a joke or not. \u201cWhat does it do?\u201d<br>\r\nFutaba took a big breath before stating \u201cit allows a person to possess someone else.\u201d<br>\r\nAkira stared at her, dumbfounded. \u201cFutaba, I want to believe you, especially when I\u2019m surrounded by the strangeness that is the metaverse, but I\u2019m going to need proof.\u201d<br>\r\nFutaba sighed. \u201cI knew you would say that. Luckily this app doesn\u2019t require the user to be the who does the possessing. Hehehe\u201d Futaba laughed before selecting Akira\u2019s name before selecting Ann\u2019s name. <i>\u2019Sorry Ann. I just need to prove something to Akira.\u2019</i> she thought. She looked up at Akira, who simply stated \u201cwhy am I here, again, Futaba?\u201d Futaba ignored him before looking back at her phone. She had received a text from Ann, or rather, Akira in Ann\u2019s body. It simply stated \u2018What did you do? Why am I in Ann\u2019s body? Does this mean the app is real?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba laughed, Akira\u2019s confusion and panic was hilarious. However, she had to bring him back, this wasn\u2019t why she decided to tell him about the app. She pressed undo and Akira\u2019s body immediately shot up.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I have no choice but to believe you now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep. You have noooo choice. I\u2019ll talk to you about it in a bit, I\u2019ve got a few loose threads to tie up.\u201d Futaba then chose to possess Ann herself to delete that text message herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then found herself in the middle of Shibuya. She glanced down at Ann\u2019s phone. It seems she hadn\u2019t totally recovered from being possessed by Akira as the IM app was still open between her and Ann.<br>\r\n\u201cWell that text is going bye-bye\u201d She whispered, not used to having Ann\u2019s voice. She pressed delete on the text and then proceeded to undo the possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was then back in LeBlanc, with Akira\u2019s hand waving in her face. \u201cFutaba, what\u2019s wrong with you? How did you forget why you called me here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d was all that she could say as she pushed Akira\u2019s hand out of the way. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBack? You didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\nFutaba decided to fill Akira in on what she did and how the app works. <br>\r\n\u201cAh okay. So that\u2019s why you seemed really confused before. Was my body like that when I was in Ann\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are we going to do with the app?\u201d Akira asked.</span></div></div>",

She quickly messaged Ann, asking her if she wanted to meet up somewhere. To her delight, Ann agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba met up with Ann in Inokashira Park. The smell of fresh air drifted around her nose, an unfamiliar yet not unwelcome aroma. Ann saw Futaba before smiling and waving at her. Futaba quickly jogged towards Ann, her mind focused on how she was going to word her apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Futaba!\u201d Ann\u2019s cheery voice cut through her thoughts like a knife, snapping her out of her focus.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hi Ann.\u201d Futaba responded.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did you want to show me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis App.\u201d Futaba whipped out her phone and showed her the app. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat does the app do? Just looks like a bunch of names to me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt allows you to possess people, like a ghost.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Futaba. That\u2019s a little far fetched, even for you.\u201d Ann replied, baffled by her explanation.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll prove it, then. Who would you like to possess, then? It would only be for a very short while.\u201d<br>\r\nAnn was taken aback by this question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of thinking, she responded \u201cFor a second, I\u2019ll assume the app will work. Prove it by having me possess Makoto for a bit. She\u2019ll probably be studying right now so it won\u2019t appear too strange for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba then selected Ann\u2019s name from the list, followed by Makoto. In an instant, Ann\u2019s demeanour changed. \u201cSo Futaba, what do you want to do?\u201d Ann acted as if the previous conversation never happened, which is exactly what should have happened. Futaba then pressed the undo button after around 20 seconds. <i>\u2018That should be long enough, right?\u2019</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn\u2019s demeanour changed yet again. \u201cWow Futaba,you weren\u2019t lying!\u201d She stated, shocked.<br>\r\n\u201cI told you so.\u201d Futaba replied smugly.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you decide to tell me about the app, though?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell....uh..\u201d This was the moment she was dreading. \u201cI decided to tell you as an apology. You see.....You were the one I possessed when I discovered what the app does..I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn stood there, speechless. Eventually, she composed herself and said \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. I\u2019m glad you told me, though, Futaba. Now we can have some fun with it.\u201d Futaba gave a sigh of relief. She was happy that Ann wasn\u2019t mad at her, and now she had an accomplice. \u201cDo you have any idea of what you want to do with the app, then?\u201d She asked Ann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn said \u201cWe could either possess 2 of the other members of the phantom thieves. Maybe we could try possessing some of the boys? Or maybe one of us could hop into one of the others while the other person hops into their body, that would work, right? The other option would be to possess some of Akira\u2019s long list of friends. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Futaba decide on?</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ll meet up here.\u201d Ann cheerily replied. Futaba quickly pressed Ann\u2019s name followed by Akira\u2019s. She was now in Akira\u2019s body. Futaba looked up, checking to see if the possession had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn\u2019s body smiled at Futaba and said \u201cok, Futaba. I\u2019ll guess I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d The possession most likely worked. Futaba then selected her own name as Ann\u2019s body began to walk off. As she selected Ann\u2019s name, she found her vision momentarily darken, just as it did the first time she possessed Ann. Her vision soon returned and she found herself stood where \u2018Ann\u2019 once stood. It had worked, perfect. She felt around her body, checking to see that she had actually possessed Ann. She had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba pulled out Ann\u2019s phone. She had received confirmation texts about the possessions from the app.<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Hehe. All according to plan.\u2019</i> she thought as she glanced back to her own body. Her own body had begun walking off, presumably towards Sojiro\u2019s house. Futaba then decided to wait for Ann to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for her to show up. About half an hour later, she saw Akira, or rather Ann in Akira\u2019s body, showed up. She walked over to Futaba, a smile on her face. \u201cHey, Futaba. Wow. It\u2019s really weird to see my own body from a third person perspective.\u201d She laughed, Akira\u2019s voice unsurprisingly coming out of her mouth.<br>\r\nFutaba smiled. \u201cSo how is it being a guy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStrange. Not unpleasant but strange.\u201d Ann briefly said, looking down at Akira\u2019s body. \u201cSo what do you want to do in these bodies?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That would be ample payback for the way he insulted you yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn thought about the image of Ryuji wearing one of her dresses and let out a snort of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, you could have either Akira or Yusuke write a love-letter to yourself and then pretend to blackmail them with it when you de-possess them. There's lots of ways to prank them if you just think hard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn thought hard about it for a moment before she answered. \"Alright; I've changed my mind. Using the boys' own bodies to set them up for pranks is an ample motivator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" exclaimed Futaba. \"All you have to do now is to choose which one of the boys you'd like to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn thought hard about it. Which one of the boys should she possess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji was of course the first to spring to mind; if only so she could dress him in girlish clothes and then take some humiliating pictures as revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira and Yusuke were also possibilities. They were both handsome and very strong when it came to fighting Shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Morgana. Ann wasn't quite sure what she should think about becoming him. Sure; he was as much both a friend and a part of the Phantom Thieves as she was, but on the other hand... he was a cat! Being a boy would be tolerable, but being a different species, too...?<br>\r\nIt was at once both fascinating and frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of thinking, Ann made her decision.

Luckily, one was to alter his voice. Sliding the little bar to the right, he spoke. \"Hello?\" Now Ryuji's voice came from his mouth. Perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say, I feel much stronger as you, Sakamoto.\" Akechi chuckled, flexing his biceps before cracking his neck. \"I definitely made the right choice in choosing you as my spy.\" He grinned only to leave the bathroom afterwards with his hands stuffed in the pockets of his gray cargo shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkechi had many devious plans forming in his mind and he was ready to set them into motion.
