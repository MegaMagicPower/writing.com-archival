            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy Dearly is a single mom trying to manage a  home with two rather independent children and a busy upward business career. She has found that  being the sole parent is difficult and at most exasperating, but she loves her children and wouldn't compromise their safety or well being for all the world. Yet she must make a living to afford their home and pay all the bills associated with normal day to day living.<br>\r\nAs her job as senior assistant to the CEO of her company, she makes a decent salary but it also affords little time to spend with Brooke or Michael, her children. She HAD spent a long time searching for the right woman to serve as their nanny while she is at work, but now nanny Mary was leaving her employment to spend time caring for own grandchildren. <br>\r\nNow Wendy is searching for someone to take over the care of Brooke and Michael. She had taken the day off to interview applicants sent to her by the employment agency. Several seemed ideal but none had reached that level of perfection Wendy required.<br>\r\nAs Wendy reviewed the last applicants interview she heard giggling and laughter coming from the family room down the hall from her home office. Her children were home from school, which meant that it was sometime after 4pm. and Wendy had spent the last 6 hours interviewing.<br>\r\nShe was about to look in to the dining room where she asked the applicants to wait when the laughter and giggling stopped.  <br>\r\nBeing a concerned mother, she knew that when children are quiet that usually means trouble. Instead of looking in the dining room she proceeded to the family room instead. <br>\r\nAs she approached the door she heard a man's voice speaking softly. <br>\r\nBeing suspicious of a man in her home she bounded around the corner to see a tall, lanky, red haired man sitting crossed legged on the floor, in a business suit and tie telling a story to her children. Brooke was laying on her stomach with her head in her hands and propped up on her elbows. Michael was sitting with his legs crossed same as the man in front of him.<br>\r\n\"...then the pirates stuck a sharp sword into her back and forced her to walk the plank.\" the man looked up and saw Wendy and he stopped speaking.<br>\r\nBoth Brooke and Michael turned to see what he was looking at and saw their mother in the door. Brooke ran to her mother excitedly. \"Mommy, can Peter be our nanny.\"<br>\r\n\"Please, Please, Please.\" Michael said, coming up behind his sister.<br>\r\nBefore Wendy could respond the young man with the red hair was standing before her with his right hand extended. \"My name is Peter Banting and I'm here for the position of care taker for your children.\"<br>\r\nWendy took his hand and his handshake was that of a determined man, something that she found to be a rather distinctive of the power hungry individuals in her career. \"I'm sorry, but I'm looking for someone a bit older\"<br>\r\n\"But Mommy we want Peter!\" Brooke screamed.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you do, honey.\" Wendy placed her hand on Brooke's head and smoothed her soft golden hair. \"But I'm looking for someone capable of discipline and take care of you when I'm not around and not someone who will play and tell you stories all day.\"<br>\r\n\"Ms. Dearly, I've taken care of numerous children and I'm more than qualify.\" Peter says.<br>\r\n\"I don't question your abilities but you are entirely too young to watch my children.\" Wendy replies.<br>\r\n\"I'm a lot older than I look.\" He says putting his hands on his hips and stand with his legs shoulder width apart.<br>\r\nMichael goes over and stands next to Peter assuming the same stance. Then Brooke moves to stand with Peter and the three of them look at Wendy. <br>\r\nFinally the scene before her softens Wendy's disposition and she shakes her head. \"O'k I'm out numbered. But this will only be a trial. After a week if I'm not satisfied, I let you go.\"<br>\r\nPeter kneels and puts his palm out and both children slap it as a sign of them winning over their mother.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She said her grandkids needed her and she would call and explain later.\" Peter tells her.<br>\r\n\"She let a total stranger pick up my kids, I thought she was more responsible than that. \" Wendy says, \"I guess I'll have to start dinner, now.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of that you go into your office and do some work, after all you wasted one day at home and things do have a way of backing up if you don't attend to them regularly.\" He turns to Brooke, \"Brooke get your homework and meet me and Michael in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n\"Ms.Dearly. We will call you when everything is ready.\" Wendy looks at Peter's sparkling green eyes and suddenly feels comfortable about his caring for her children. <br>\r\nBrooke runs off, Wendy turns to leave and Peter and Michael head off to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy hears giggling coming from her kitchen and she begins to wonder what Peter and the children are doing. She shuts down her computer and gets up from her soft chair to investigate. As she nears the kitchen she realizes that it's Michael who is doing all the giggling.<br>\r\nShe looks and sees Brooke dutifully studying at the table. Michael is running around as though he's chasing and invisible bug. Peter has his back to the door as he pulls something from the oven. <br>\r\nWendy is taken by his broad shoulders and thinks that Peter is quite handsome. There is something about him though that intrigues her.<br>\r\n\"Arg, ye mates are ye ready for ye grub.\" Peter says imitating a pirate.<br>\r\n\"Arrrg.\" Michael repeats.<br>\r\n\"Are you ready too, Madam Dearly?\" Peter asks turning to face Wendy. <br>\r\nIf he didn't face the doorway, Wendy would have believed that he was speaking to Brooke.<br>\r\nShe entered shyly after having her hiding place revealed.<br>\r\n\"We're having pirate pizza.\" Michael proudly tells her.<br>\r\n\"Is that right.\" Wendy ruffles Michaels hair. \"Brooke put your books away. It's time to eat.\"<br>\r\n\"I just have to finish this last one, Mother.\" Brooke then reads out loud. \"Ok, If I have 6 apples and I want to share with two of my friends then we will get 2 apples each. Right? Two times  three is six.\"<br>\r\n\"Can't you say you'll make apple sauce.\" Peter sys as he cuts the pizza.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Peter.\" Brooke says closing her book.</span></div></div>",

She then handed each dish to Michael, who carefully dried them before handing them to Peter who put them away.<br>\r\nSeeing that thing were under control, Wendy went back to her office. It was remarkable how this young man made such a impact on their lives so quickly and she still didn't know much about him, such as his work experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" Wendy looked from her screen to see Brooke in her nightgown, ready for bed standing in the doorway, holding her hand was Michael who was also in his pajamas and clutching a tattered blue blanket.<br>\r\n\"Peter told us to come and say 'good night'\"<br>\r\nMary always had trouble getting the kids to go to bed, yet here Peter had them going almost willingly.<br>\r\n\"Good night, dears.\" <br>\r\nWendy watched the kids turn and walk away.

If you want I can deposit your check into your account, but I'll need to know your bank and account number as well.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you always treat your home like your office?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"I'm serious.

For some reason in this light he seems younger than he did before.<br>\r\n\"Never had any that paid before.\"<br>\r\nWendy begins questioning Peter's abilities to care for he children.\"Then how can you have experience raising children?\"<br>\r\n\"You don't have to get paid for having fun.\"<br>\r\n\"Life isn't always fun and games. Sometimes you have to grow up.\"<br>\r\nPeter turns back and Wendy wonders if it is her imagination or is ears slightly pointed. \"But you have to have fun sometimes or life isn't worth living.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Wendy goes to the door.\"It's late.

Wendy had told the children stories before, about men and women who would kidnap children and do horrible things to them, but they never believed it would really happen. Michael began to struggle again, but after a few fruitless minutes, he sighed and his shoulders shook as he began to sob quietly. Brooke felt out for his hand. She found it and grasped it firmly.<br>\r\n\"We'll be okay Michael. Peter will come and rescue us soon. Remember what he said? He said that no matter what happens, he will always be there to save us.

Thank you for looking after the kids.\"<br>\r\nPeter returned the smile. \"No worries, Miss.  I enjoy it.  They're a pleasure to look after.  Angels, even.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad to hear it.  Actually, Peter, I need to go to a business conference tomorrow night.  I was wondering if you'd be able to look after them overnight.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, of course.\" Peter beamed.  \"I'd love to.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much.\" Wendy shook her head.  \"I know this was last minute and all, so I really appreciate it.\" <br>\r\n\"Of course, Ms. Dearly.  It's no problem, at all.  Absolutely no problem.\" <br>\r\nThe following night, Ms. Dearly gathered her children for a talk.  \"Now, follow Peter's instructions, okay, children? He will look after you tonight and tomorrow night, and I'll come back the morning after.\" <br>\r\nBrooke squeezed her mother.  \"I'll miss you, Mommy!\"<br>\r\n\"I'll miss you, too.\" Ms. Dearly hugged her son as well.  \"Behave, okay?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, Mother.\" Michael rolled his eyes.<br>\r\nPeter rested an arm on each child as Ms. Dearly left.  \"Bye!

I'm going to teach you two how to <i>fly</i>!\"<br>\r\n\"Flying's impossible.\" Michael frowned.  <br>\r\n\"It is if that's how you think.\" Peter replied.  \"Just you wait until we get back to your bedroom.  You'll see.\"<br>\r\n\"This will be fun!\" Brooke exclaimed.  \"I wanna fly, just like a fairy.\"<br>\r\n\"That won't be too hard.\" Peter grinned.  \"Now, close your eyes,\" he instructed. \"You, too, Michael.\"<br>\r\nThe older boy sighed and closed his eyes.  <br>\r\n\"Now repeat after me: 'I believe I can fly.'\"<br>\r\n\"I believe I can fly,\" Brooke murmured.<br>\r\n\"I believe I can fly.\" Michael repeated in a deadpan.<br>\r\n\"Keep saying it,\" Peter encouraged, \"'I believe I can fly.'\"<br>\r\n\"I believe I can fly,\" Brooke repeated.  \"I believe I can fly.\" She felt her body lighten up.  \"I believe I can fly!\" She squealed as she felt her body rise.  \"I'm flying, I'm flying!\"<br>\r\n\"I believe I can fly,\" Michael tried again, a little more enthusiastically once he heard his sister's excitement.  He thought about the many things he could do as a flying boy, and as he repeated the five words, he felt his body rise up, following his sister's example.  <br>\r\n\"Now, open your eyes.\" <br>\r\nThe bedroom looked rather different from the ceiling, Michael observed.  Brooke seemed too involved with her flying to notice the difference.  <br>\r\n\"Now, follow my lead.\" Peter opened the bedroom window, and checking outside to make sure nobody was watching, soared into the sky.<br>\r\n\"Whoa! We can fly in the sky?\" Brooke gasped.  <br>\r\n\"Just don't tell your mother.\" Peter winked.  \"It'll be our little secret.\"<br>\r\nWith that, he flew off into the night sky, with Brooke and Michael trailing close behind him.</span></div></div>",
