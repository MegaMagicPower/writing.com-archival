            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cool night did nothing to deter Bill from finding a new watering hole. He had just moved out to this small town to get away from his gold-digging ex and away from the fast-paced city life. He worked too hard for too many years and was going to enjoy his early retirement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a leisurely drive around town Bill discovered what looked to be a biker bar on the outskirts. The plain-looking brick building had several motorcycles in the lot and a few men hanging around outside. After pulling into the parking lot, Bill could make out the sign dimly lit by flickering lights. Jotunheim. 'Interesting name,' he thought. The men hovering around a few of the bikes were large, much bigger than the shorter Bill. And while Bill was fit, he wasn't nearly as wide as some of the men either. Some were a more muscular stocky build, some were on the chubbier side, but all of them were large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men all eyed Bill as he climbed out of his pick-up truck. The leering bikers seemed strangely interested in him. Bill shivered, chilled by their hungry gazes more than the cool night air. Doing his best to ignore the stares, he walked up to the door. At the entrance was an immense man, presumably the bouncer. He had a wide, thick build. Bill figured he spent most of his off hours in the gym. The huge bouncer wasn't cut though, he went for mass, and he had a lot of it. Despite the night temperature, the bouncer wore only a leather vest, jeans, and heavy leather boots, as well as a gold chain with some kind of locket. The cool air didn't seem to perturb him at all. This put the bouncers wide, heavy, hairy pecs and gut on display. Red fur covered much of the large man's skin. His hair on his head was close-cropped and he had thick mutton chops on his cheeks, leaving the lip and chin bare except for a bit of stubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer gazed intently at Bill, though it looked more out of curiosity than hungry lust. The bouncer stood up and blocked Bill's path. The shorter man noticed with some trepidation that he only came up to the bottom of the bouncer's pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there,\" came a deep rumbling voice as the bouncer spoke. \"I need to see your ID if you plan on entering Jotunheim.\" The burly redhead simply stood there with his arms crossed as Bill fished out his driver's license. The bouncer causally took the ID and glanced at the birthday, smiling.  Then unexpectedly he slipped the license inside his vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keys too. We won't have any drunk drivers leaving here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That ridiculous. No place does anything like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our place, our rules. If you want in, you give me your keys. You'll get them back along with your license when you leave Jotunheim.\" The bouncer smirked as he said that. \"Of course, once you step inside you might find it hard to leave.\" The hefty redhead placed a heavy hand on Bill's shoulder, almost as if he didn't want him to back out of going inside the bar. The men were hot and Bill's curiosity was growing, so he complied and fished out his keys from his pocket and handed them over. The bouncer took them and placed them in his own pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, you're free to enter. However, if you're willing to wait, my shift ends in 20 minutes and I'd love to show you the place.\" Bill noticed the bouncer's eyes took on a bit of lust. \"Up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill...</span></div></div>",

As soon as Bill stepped inside the bar everything changed. The noises got louder and everything looked bigger than it should be. From the size it looked outside it shouldn't be this big on the inside. Wandering what happened Bill soon got his answer when he saw an old biker man pass by, the only problem though was that the man was huge compared to him. Bill had to crane his just to see part of the huge biker. Not thinking it was safe he ran towards the nearest table. As he looked around he noticed other giants and if he focused enough he could make out people his size with the giants. \"This must be a regular thing in the bar.\" Bill said aloud knowing the giants will most likely not be able to hear him. As he looked around he saw a lot of giants but not many tiny people. 'No wonder the bouncer asked me to wait I'm new and he would be able to have me and also as soon as we got in too.' Bill thought to himself as he started thinking it might've been better to take the Bouncer on his offer. Hearing the entrance open Bill turned around as he looked he saw two people enter one was a young guy who looked no older than 25 walk in and saw that he shrunk immediately and right behind was one of the huge bikers Bill saw outside who was much older looking than the shrunken young man, but as the biker walked in he didn't shrink at all he stayed huge. As Bill turned his attention to the young man, the young man didn't look scared he even looked excited to what was going to happen. Bill just stood there and watched as the biker crouched down and picked up the guy who came with him and he walked away. 'So I guess most people know about this place then.' Bill thinks as he starts wondering what to do himself. Being honest with himself he had no problems being the submissive one in a relationship that's how he ended up buying so much stuff for his last boyfriend. This time though he knew it was going to be different and he was already getting excited about what he was going to try to do. As Bill looked around he took notice of four guys, the old biker guy from earlier,a very muscular one sitting a table away, one that looked like he was more fat than muscle, and last one is actually a group of two bikers sitting next to each other one thing the all had in common though was that they were all really hairy that Bill could make out their hairs from where he stood. Even though these were the four he liked he could take a look around if he wanted too maybe find some different giants to go up to instead. In the end though Bill decided too...</span></div></div>",

Bill would be lying to himself if he said he didn't like men older him heck one of the reasons he came to this bar was because mos of the biker's are older than him. \"Retiring\" at a very early age left him with a lot of money to spend and not have to do anything. Making sure the coast was clear Bill made a dash for it to the table the older biker was at. As he got closer he noticed the biker already white hair, and he wasn't bald. He also noticed the biker had a horseshoe mustache too. As Bill made it to the older biker he got a good look at him. The biker was muscular but it was more noticeable on his arms since he had a beer belly you wouldn't be able to tell from looking at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling nervous approaching the giant man Bill takes a few deep breaths as he prepares himself. After a bit he takes his first steps as he nears the giant's boot. Not wanting to chicken out Bill starts to climb the biker's leg immediately knowing of he waited to much he would back out and miss the chance of a life time. After a bit of a climb Bill finally made it to the older biker's knee. Just as Bill was catching his breath though a huge hand came down and wrapped around him. As soon as he was brought up the hand released Bill onto the table. Looking up Bill saw the face of the man he was just climbing moments ago. \"Well what do I have here a little man climbing my leg I've been waiting for ya for a while runt ever since I saw you run under the table.\" The biker tells Bill as he looks at him staring at him. Bill a bit intimidated looks down and says \"Sorry for taking too long to get to you Sir by the way my name is Bill.\" \"Well it's alright that you took a bit at least you're with me now and I didn't have to go convince someone to come inside with me or hunt one of you down in the bar and since you told my your name I'll tell you mine it's Bryon Fields.\" Bryon tells you as his head moves in to inspect you his beer breath covering your body. \"No need to by scared Lil Billy don't I'm going to treat you good, so first thing we gotta do is...</span></div></div>",

Bill still worried about stripping in front of a giant man he just met was taken by surprised when out of nowhere he was grabbed by the giant man. \"You did know that a lot of people come here to be played with by giant men.\" Bryon tells you. It seemed you're suspicions were correct in that most people knew about possibly ending up shrunken, but to think some people came here knowing that they would shrink and be played with by giant men. As you were thinking about how that didn't sound so bad your pants were then stripped off by Bryon's huge fingers. \"Since you're not stripping yourself seems like I'll have to do it for you.\" Bryon tells you as he starts picking up your shirt. As your shirt is lifted off e reaches for your boxers. As soon as they are pulled down Bryon sees that you have an erection. \"Well well so Lil Billy is excited to play with me well lets get started.\" Bryon says as he...</span></div></div>",

You sit down gracelessly and gaze up at the giant with wide, startled eyes. His smirk has broadened into an eager grin. \"Just relax, now,\" he growls, almost purring. With just his fingertip, he pushes you down onto your back and holds you there against the bar, keeping you from moving even if you were trying to resist. Your heart is throbbing wildly, but you swear it stops for a moment when Bryon's other hand makes contact with your dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thumb and index finger caress your cock slowly, careful not to damage the tiny, delicate organ. Each touch sends a shockwave of ecstasy through your body, electrifying your extremities and scrambling your already racing thoughts. Your breaths come in gasps, and your eyes are practically watering. Through the fog of euphoria, you vaguely wonder if it's appropriate to be jerked off like this in public, and you shift your gaze to look towards the nearest group of patrons. But if anyone is aware that a tiny man is receiving the biggest fingerjob of his life right there on the bar, they don't seem to care enough to pay any attention. You turn your head back to revel in the visage of the godly giant before you, drinking in the laugh lines around his eyes, the slight puffiness of his cheeks, the bushy but well-groomed beard, the gray and white fur beneath his unbuttoned shirt and vest. Holding these images in your mind, you close your eyes and ride the wave of pleasure for as long as your manhood can endure. Hardly a minute must have gone by before the telltale stirring in your groin begins, and a cry escapes your lips just as your cock erupts all over Bryon's fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant lets out a booming laugh and takes his hands away, leaving you panting and gasping for air on the bar while he licks his fingers clean. He watches you with a strangely protective twinkle in his eye as you catch your breath and finally sit up. Still in shock from what may have been the best orgasm of your life, you look up at the old biker and return his smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryon decides to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill found himself gazing at the the heavyset giant a couple tables away. The man was massive; he must have weighed over 300 pounds. He wasn't as solid as some of the other guys here, but he carried his weight well. The first thing Bill saw were the heavy black motorcycle boots. Extending up from there were the denim-clad cliffs that were the biker's legs. The tiny man saw a hairy paw resting on one of the thighs with a black leather wristband behind it. Beyond that was a chubby arm covered in thick dark hairs. It was hard for Bill to see more as the table was blocking much of the view. Bill tentatively approached the giant, unsure of how he would react to finding a little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill stuck to the wall as he made his way over to the giant's table. Huge boots were stomping everywhere, making it feel like there was a constant mild earthquake assaulting the bar. From the new perspective farther down the wall Bill could see more of the chubby giant. Continuing up his torso Bill noticed he was wearing an open black leather vest. The giant had no shirt underneath, though from the side he couldn't make out the chest very well, though the large furry gut was obvious. The giant had a massive beard, dense with coarse hairs. The giant had on a black Muir cap and a ring of dark hair along the sides and back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill stood there mesmerized for a moment, lusting over this colossal biker. The tiny man saw the giant glance in his direction, then went back to his drink on the table. Did the giant see him? There was only one way to find out. Bill waited for a moment when his part of the floor was light on traffic and made a dash for the behemoth's table. Just as the little man arrived one of the giant's boots shifted and knocked him over. The huge foot started tapping on the ground; the heavy thuds made it difficult for Bill to get back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm down here! Please don't step on me!\" Bill yelled up to the giant. The huge biker looked down quizzically, as if he might have heard something but wasn't quite sure. Not saying a word, the chubby bear reached down and scooped up the little man in a fist, only leaving Bill's head exposed. Bill was brought up before the giant's face as large brown eyes gazed at him with a penetrating stare, evaluating his new capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say something, little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill gulped nervously, thoroughly scared now that he was actually in the giant's hand. \"I...I said please don't step on me, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better,\" the giant said in dismissive approval. \"What brings a lowly creature such as yourself over to my table, little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I wanted to meet you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Well, here you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill kind of just stared in awe, a bit dumbfounded by his position before realizing he hadn't introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Bill, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want little man?\" The giant appeared to be somewhat irritated. \"Tell me before I drop you back on the floor for another giant to find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know,\" the tiny man answered honestly. He just knew he was attracted to this dominant giant of a biker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you bothering me if you don't even know why you're here?\" The giant slowly swung his hand out over the side of the table. Bill knew the giant wasn't kidding about dropping him. Was the biker really going to drop him to his death?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to be with you!\" Bill yelled out in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmf.\" The giant swung Bill back up in front of his face. \"That's a start. Now for what I want. I want...\"</span></div></div>",

The odor of sweat mixed with leather was overpowering; Bill had difficulty breathing in the tight, humid space. At least the vest itself was still open as the giant's belly was too large for it to be buttoned closed. This meant the air circulated a little bit as the biker walked over to meet with the bouncer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you have something that belongs to me,\" Bill heard his owner declare to the bouncer without even so much as a hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, sir, I was hoping to get him for myself.\" Bill was surprised to hear the huge bouncer sound so deferential as well as a bit dejected. The little man couldn't tell what was going on from inside the pocket, but he figured the bouncer was handing something over to his giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're always welcome to join in the fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir, I know. Thank you for the offer. I'll think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someday I hope you do decide to take it. I understand why you haven't yet, but you're really missing out, son.\" Suddenly fingers invaded the tight space and fished Bill out of the pocket. The little man was dangled between the two giants. Bill gasped in awe upon seeing the furry red mountain of a man at this scale. \"Maybe this will be enough incentive for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer started to reach out but the chubby giant brought Bill back closer in towards his own body. \"No touching. If I didn't like you so much, I'd have you punished for breaching protocol, son. But I'd rather you come willingly.\" The giant then placed Bill back inside the stuffy vest pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I did that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't thank me yet. Thank me after you pay me a visit.\" With that the chubby let out a cruel-sounding chuckle and exited the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill heard the rumble of the bike engine.</span></div></div>",

The cigarette was surprisingly heavy to the tiny man and Bill struggled to lift it up. Just as Bill lifted the end up in order to tap in clean, the giant picked it up to take another drag. Bill's arms were still around the cigarette as it was lifted up from the ashtray. The tiny man got the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach as he shot up to the giant biker's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant pulled in some air through the cigarette and blasted Bill with hot smoke from his nostrils. The giant gently shook the cigarette while Bill was struggling and coughing, causing his new little pet to tumble off into the giant's thick beard. \"Not doing a good job so far, little man. Ash could've fallen into my beard, just like you have.\" Bill clung to the thick hairs, scared of falling from his perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant chuckled at his pet's predicament. \"Maybe it's better if I just leave you in my beard. You're not much good elsewhere. Or maybe I can find another use for you.\"</span></div></div>",

No wonder he didn't need a shirt or jacket; his fur and mass kept him warm. \"No, um...\" Bill realized he didn't even know this guy's name. He tilted his head up towards the bouncer's face, searching for a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, little man. Just call me sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy.\" The bouncer lowered his head and whispered down to the shorter man. \"Good boy. They know you're mine now.

Prove to them you're a good little man and wait by me until my shift is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do and no means of escaping if he wanted, Bill quietly waited by the bouncer. The redhead would occasionally rub his hand up and down Bill's back or pull him in to kiss him deeply. The smaller man found himself starting to get turned on by the blatant foreplay. He could practically feel the seething jealousy from the other bikers outside. Still, none of them made a move while the bouncer was present. This was starting to turn into a good night out after all, despite the oddity of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long the 20 minutes had passed and the bouncer got up from his stool. \"Now be a good boy and give me a few minutes, then meet me inside. You got that little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill nodded in reply. \"Yes, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive redhead simply stood up and walked away around the side, presumably to the employee entrance. He didn't even look back. While Bill stood outside waiting, the other men outside were glaring at him, some darkly. Obviously they weren't happy, not that Bill cared. He would be glad to get inside and away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill...</span></div></div>",

Now that he could see, Bill tried to figure out where he was. A colossal bed was few dozen of feet away by the little man's perspective. An equally enormous dresser was off to the side, and a nightstand with a lamp and alarm clock was next to the vast expanse of the bed. As Bill was taking this all in it struck him that although he was no longer in the bar, he was still tiny.

But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what, boy? That's what humans are here, pets. Did you not know that before entering Jotunheim?\" The giant laughed down at the little man in his hand.

Why am I still small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant roared in laughter this time. Bill cowered and covered his ears from the deep bellowing laugh. \"We left the bar, but little men can't leave Jotunheim. They can't open the door!\" The bouncer bellowed again. \"Not without help anyway, heh.\" The bouncer brought a huge finger to his little pet and rubbed his torso roughly, pushing his shirt around. \"Strip for me, boy. Pets don't need clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yessir...\" When the bouncer lifted his finger Bill pulled his shirt off, exposing his lightly furred torso. The bouncer plucked the shirt from his hand as Bill continued to strip, each piece disappearing into the giant's maw after removal. Bill was frightened but also in awe at the sheer power displayed by the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make myself comfortable.\" The giant laid back on the bed. Once settled, the bouncer released his little pet onto his chest. The chest hair was thigh-deep to the tiny Bill. Despite the little man's nudity, the heat radiating from the massive bouncer kept his pet warm. \"Make yourself comfortable, boy.\" A colossal digit pushed Bill from behind down into the chest hair. The giant stroked his pet's back and ass and he could feel the little man grow hard against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...feels nice, doesn't it, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir.\" Bill squirmed in pleasure, his body betraying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like being my pet, don't you, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill hesitated. He didn't want to be stuck as a pet for the rest of his life, but he didn't want to anger the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer picked up on the hesitation and withdrew his hand from his pet. \"Well?

The impact knocked the little man over and stunned him as the titan above bent over to peer down past his gut. \"Well what do we have here? A visitor? Let me give you a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill could only watch as the colossal biker bent over with an outstretched hand. He was a large, heavyset giant, with a large thick grey beard. Grey hair was on display on the giant's chest as the biker was only wearing a tank top with a black leather vest. Behind the calloused hands were black leather wristbands, and the giant's legs were clad in denim before ending at his booted feet. A black leather hat topped the bald head. Crystal blue eyes practically shone with delight as the giant snatched up the helpless little man from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill nearly got sick as he rocketed up as if he was on some crazy carnival ride. When it stopped, Bill was nauseated and dizzy. The hand opened so that Bill was laying in the giant's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a hot little man. Been a while since I've caught one. Most stick with the giant they meet outside. You're a brave little human to run off on your own. Or foolish!\" the older giant laughed. \"Tell you what, since it's so dangerous for you to be running about on your own, I'll keep you someplace safe,\" Bill's hopes got up before the giant added with a hearty laugh, \"as part of my collection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, let me go! Put me down!\" Bill screamed, hoping someone would help him. He saw the giant bouncer approach the heavyset biker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" the redheaded giant said. \"I was hoping to take him home with me.\" The bouncer knew the rules; possession was nine-tenths the law. That's what he got for toying with the little man. He loved the cat and mouse game but it always cost him the mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Scott, you can always join him,\" the biker offered.</span></div></div>",

Fingers ran up through the red fur as they sought out the locket hanging from the thick neck. The biker casually played with the adornment. \"Oh, yes you can. Face it; you're not a very good giant. You've never even captured a little man and my collection has dozens. You want this little man?\" The biker held up poor Bill in front of the bouncer's face, taunting him. \"You become MY little man.\" The older giant then stuffed the tiny visitor inside the inner pocket of his vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biker noticed Scott's gaze flicker towards his vest as he stuffed his new pet inside. He closed his hand around the locket and pulled it out taut, not quite hard enough to break the chain but enough for it to dig into the bouncer's neck. Scott stood very still; he didn't want the chain to break and lose the locket.

First things first, though.\" Hank gave the locket chain a slight tug. The bouncer gulped, knowing full well what relinquishing the locket would mean. But what choice did he have? No one ever saw nor heard from little men in Hank's special collection ever again. The bouncer reached up and unclasped the chain, letting the locket to free into the older biker's hand. The chain dangled loosely in Hank's fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older giant wasted no time in claiming his new pet. Two in one day, and one of them a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer's stomach lurched as it suddenly felt like it dropped out from under him. He got dizzy as his height rapidly diminished, causing the older man to shoot up into the sky. In a matter of moments, the former bouncer was only a few inches tall, gazing up at the colossal biker just as Bill had done only minutes ago. Hank loomed over the miniature bouncer for a few seconds before reaching down with a huge hand and snatching up the stunned little redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank held the tiny bouncer up to his bearded face, smirking while peering intently at his new pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as promised, you will join your little friend.\"</span></div></div>",

He laid there, frozen in awe and fear. Hank would have been imposing to most normal-sized men. Now, to Scott, the biker's presence was overwhelming. The tiny bouncer never felt so subdued just by someone's presence. He suddenly regretted allowing himself to be shrunken by Hank. He would soon regret it even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank basked in his new capture, soaking in the fear and awe coming from the tiny man in his palm. Yes, capturing a giant was even more of a rush than what a normal little man gave. The biker would have to see if he could get any other giants to submit to becoming his pet. But for now, he had one giant-turned-pet to keep him occupied. It was certainly a special occasion. To celebrate his first-ever giant capture, he would make him part of his special collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Scott was starting to wrap his head around his new size, it changed on him. If the tiny bouncer thought he was small before, soon his initial shrunken size would be gigantic. The bouncer shrank again and the giant's palm expanded from a fleshy platform into a grooved football field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep chuckle rolled out of the giant biker. \"Seeing that taking a giant as a pet is such a special occasion, I think you should become part of my special collection.\" The biker stuck his hand into his pants and he gathered a bit of precum on his fingertip. Just the thought of owning the tiny bouncer was causing him to leak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special collection? No... No!\" Scott now understood why no one ever saw or heard from people in the special collection; they were too small to find! And now he was going to become part of that collection. He looked around for somewhere to run, but up in the biker's palm, there was nowhere to go. As the tiny bouncer glanced around in panic, a colossal digit descended upon him. The finger was sticky and smelled strongly of musk and cum. The biker was using his own precum to adhere the tiny man to his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank brought his finger up to his eye to get a better look at the twice-reduced former giant. A moan of arousal rumbled through the titanic biker. He could practically feel the panic of his new pet. \"Don't worry, little man, you know the magic of this place will keep you safe. Of course, you know I can't change your size unless I'm here, so I wouldn't try to escape, or you'll be stuck at that size for the rest of your life. And don't worry about your little friend. He'll join you in my special collection as well. In fact, I'll make sure he's even smaller than you so you can feel like you're still a giant to someone. That's if you can find him.\" The biker inserted his fingertip in his bushy grey beard. With a tiny nudge he deposited Scott into the dense beard. \"Welcome to your new home,\" the biker declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott got to his feet, standing on the new \"ground.\" Sure enough, the magic of Jotunheim made the beard his new home and the skin of the giant's face was \"down\" to him. Thick grey \"trees\" surrounded the tiny bouncer. Even if Scott tried to escape, he doubt he could find his way out of the dense jungle of a beard he was trapped in. Given Hank was his only chance of ever growing again, Scott was not inclined to try to leave. And the little man he wanted was going to be even smaller than he was! Yeah, he would get him, if Scott could ever find him.</span></div></div>",

Scared by the idea of some random man just taking him home Bill was relieved by the fact that he would be alright no matter what happened though. \"So that should be mostly it by the way my name is Steve and also didn't you come in with someone?\" Steve asked as he introduced himself. \"My names Bill and I followed the Bouncer in but he told me to wait outside for a bit and when I come in I find myself tiny and scared.\" Bill answered as he looks around as sees the boots of many bikers. \"Oh that Bouncer probably went to clock out first seeing as they're not supposed to hog tinies while working, but that never stops some of them though, by the way is it that one over there?\" Steve tells Bill as he points to the Bouncer you came in with earlier as you notice he's seems to be looking for you. \"Yeah that's him.\" Bill replies. \"Well whether you go to him or not is up to you I'm going to find a giant to use me if you want you can even come with me.\" Steve tells Bill.

Bill felt himself collide with the torso of a larger man, presumably one of the bikers from the lot. A gruff, deep voice rumbled, \"Welcome to Jotunheim, little man.\" Bill tried to squirm free but a second arm came around front across the chest holding him firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer smirked at the scene. \"Guess you got an offer you can't refuse. Maybe he'll let me play with you another time.\" The bouncer reached over and opened the door. It looked more like a barn than a bar; all Bill could see was wide wooden planks for a floor and tall wooden pillars. He couldn't believe the building could be so open on the inside. Where was the bar? Something huge came into view and left just as suddenly. It was a black pillar with a rubber bottom. It almost looked like a boot, but that couldn't be right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go little man.\" The biker behind Bill herded him towards the door. </span></div></div>",

Bill felt the larger man bump into him and the both fell through the door onto the hardwood floor. Before the door slammed shut they heard the bouncer chuckling, \"Have fun, little men.\" The biker rolled himself off of Bill and onto his back. Bill groaned as he rolled over himself. He finally got a look at the stocky biker that came up behind him. He was stout though a bit shorter than Bill. The biker was wearing a white tank top and well-worn blue jeans with black motorcycle boots. Black bands adorned his wrists and a chain was around his neck. Just as they were both getting their bearings a giant hand came into view reaching to grasp them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" the biker mumbled as he was being surrounded by fingers the size of tree trunks. \"No! I was supposed to be big!\" he shouted in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meaty, calloused giant hand scooped both the biker and Bill up and lifted them off the floor. The little men nearly got sick before the fleshy elevator ride stopped before a chest covered in white fur. A harness ring sat at the base of the valley between huge pecs over a firm hairy gut, holding together the black straps the ran under the giant's pecs and over his shoulders. \"Well, good things do come to those who wait. I didn't think I'd get two little men at the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's voice drew the gaze of the little men upward. A bald head with bright blue eyes, a wide nose, and a dense bushy white beard was gazing back down at them. \"And a fine pair of little men you are. My name's Jim, but everyone calls me Big Jim. What're your names, little men?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is some kind of mistake. I'm not supposed to be a little man. He,\" the biker pointed at Bill, \"is supposed to be my little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mistake here, little man. It's finder's keepers here in Jotunheim. You may have been a big man in Midgard, but you're with the giants now. Now answer my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill! My name is Bill,\" the frightened little man yelled out. The last thing he wanted was to get on this giant's bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's eyes looked over at Bill and he smiled briefly. He then brought his gaze back upon the biker. \"Your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Just let me go! I won't ever come back! Please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill saw Big Jim frown though it was difficult to tell through the heavy facial hair. \"That's not a name. If you don't have one I'll have to give you one. I need something to call my new pet. Let's see...Mickey. Yeah, I like that. Well, now that introductions are done, let's get going. I can't wait to start playing with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not a pet! Please...please make me big again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Jim ignored the pleading and plucked Bill from his hand. The giant brought the little man to his chest and pushed him under one of the tight harness straps. \"Hang tight, little Bill.\" Big Jim  did the same with the stocky little biker in the opposite strap. The giant biker rubbed the little men before grabbing his vest and heading out from the bar. Bill looked around as he was brought along on this unusual carnival ride. Even though they had just left the bar, he and Mickey didn't return to their normal sizes. They were still tiny pinned against the giant's furry chest. The chest hair was deep and dense and the little men were nearly hidden by it, let alone the harness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heading out already, Big Jim?\" The giant biker turned to face the bouncer. The redheaded giant looked huge before, but he was unbelievably massive now. Even scarier was when Bill realized the giant he was pinned against made the bouncer look small. The bouncer smirked down at the little men behind the harness straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Going home to play with my new pets.\" The older giant stroked the two little men again. Mickey squirmed, trying to get away from the probing finger. The little man's efforts and the warmth of Big Jim's body were making him all sweaty. \"Help!\" the tiny biker yelled to the bouncer. \"Get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feisty one your got there. Sure you can handle him?\" the bouncer joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Mickey here? Yeah, he won't be no trouble. Just needs some training is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you ever want someone to take him off your hands, you know where to find me.\" The bouncer leaned down in close. Even though he was the smaller giant of the two, he was still incredibly huge. The redhead inhaled deeply and snaked out his tongue to lick little Mickey. \"Mmm...wish I got a chance at you. Both of you.\" The giant bouncer's gaze shifted over to Bill. \"Take good care of your new pets. I hope you let me play with them sometime, Big Jim.\" The massive bouncer then shifted back up on his stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that can be arranged sometime, Scott. See you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gave Big Jim a wide berth as he walked to his bike. Bill imagined it was due to the giant's size, but he wondered if the others knew about him, too. As Big Jim raised his right arm to sling his vest on, the harness strap Mickey was under loosened a bit and the little man started slipping. Mickey had continued squirming, trying to free himself before being carried away from the bar. Now he was caught between a choice of slipping free and falling a long way or holding on for dear life and being stuck tiny with the giant biker.</span></div></div>",

At this point Bill wasn't sure if the other little man was struggling to get free or keep hold, but it became moot as gravity won and Mickey tumbled off of the giant's body. Bill couldn't see what happened to Mickey and Big Jim didn't seem to react at all to the loss of his second pet. Were they so insignificant that the giant didn't even notice? Bill shivered despite the warm space in which he was trapped. Bill could barely move but he grabbed some of the copious amounts of chest fur surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deafening roar of the bike engine, Big Jim took off with his new prize. It had been a while since the giant had claimed some little men for his own and he was eager to play with his new toys. He had seen Mickey lurking around the bar before; that little man was one of the cowardly lot too afraid to journey into Jotunheim. Bill on the other hand looked to be new around here and Big Jim looked forward to his earnest reactions to this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill wasn't sure how much time passed but eventually the bike stopped and the engine was turned off. He could feel Big Jim moving but with the vest blocking his view the little man couldn't tell where they were or where they were going. Bill heard the fumbling of keys and figured they must be at Big Jim's house. After the sound of the door opening, closing, and locking, the giant removed his vest and hung it on a wooden coat rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're home little men.\" One of Big Jim's large hands pulled Bill from his temporary prison but the giant felt the tug on his chest hair. \"Let go, little Billy. Big Jim's got you. Now for your little friend...\" The giant's voice trailed off as he searched under the other harness strap for his lost pet. \"Damn, little fucker must have slipped out. His loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill was chilled by the casual indifference the giant had towards his shrunken men. The shudder didn't go unnoticed by the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cold, little Billy? Big Jim will warm you right up. Stay here for now and you'll be warm in no time.\" Big Jim pull out the front of his jeans and Bill could see the giant went commando as the giant deposited him into the crotch. The giant was hard and heat pulsated from the huge cock. \"There you go, little man. I'll get you out in a moment when I'm ready for you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
