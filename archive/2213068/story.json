            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The small, rural town of Spring Falls had never been a particularly noteworthy town; but now, it was home to a multi-million dollar investment from an up and coming corporation called \"Expansive Candy\", who had promised to build their new, state of the art candy factory in the town, offering new jobs, business opportunities and discounted candy to the locals. With nothing to lose, the town's Mayor had accepted the offer, and now, after a surprisingly quick construction, the factory was fully up and running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one month, the factory was almost fully staffed, though still recruiting from the local population. Several new \"Expansive Candy\" stores had appeared throughout the town overnight, fully stocked and ready to start selling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob vacancies had appeared just as quickly as the factory; almost two hundred vacancies for the townspeople to apply for. These had included anything from cashiers, office workers and taste testers to engineers and salespeople. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the factory gears up for mass production, the townspeople are about to undergo a transforming experience...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lucy: <br>\r\n</b>Job: Just starting a job in the offices of the Factory. <br>\r\nAge: 24<br>\r\nAppearance: Dark red hair (dyed), slender figure with large breasts. <br>\r\nPersonality: Lucy has jumped between jobs since finishing college, and thought the office job at the factory sounded pretty simple. She tends to lose concentration easily and can be a little lazy. She is very friendly and outgoing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Allyson: <br>\r\n</b>Job: Just starting a job at a candy store as a sales assistant. <br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nAppearance: Brown hair, slender figure. <br>\r\nPersonality: Allyson has just finished college and wants to save up enough money to go travelling before she moves on with her career. She is very intelligent, and can be quite reserved. She figured this would be an easy way to make money and isn't really that excited about the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Claire: <br>\r\n</b>Job: Works as a journalist for the Spring Gazette, the town's biggest paper. <br>\r\nAge: 27<br>\r\nAppearance: Red hair, freckles, very fit.  <br>\r\nPersonality: Claire works as a journalist for the local paper. She is very ambitious and ideally wants to move away from the town and work for a national newspaper. She is naturally inquisitive and cunning and something of a workaholic. Finds herself investigating the new company and their factory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lana: <br>\r\n</b>Job: Just starting a job working as a company taste tester. <br>\r\nAge: 23<br>\r\nAppearance: Pink hair, slightly curvy build. <br>\r\nPersonality: Lana is very quirky, frequently a comedian among her friends with a dry, sarcastic sense of humour. She shares an apartment with her friend, Rachel, and noticed that the taste tester job was the best paid job at the factory, so thought it would be easy money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps focus on a group of character here for a tour of the factory...</span></div></div>",

She hadn't been awake this early for months; with her college days over and no job for a while, she was used to long lie ins and waking up at 11am, at the earliest. She could still make it in on time though, if she hurried. The factory wasn't that far away. Lucy ran her hands through her long, red hair and hurried to the bathroom, where she brushed her teeth, washed and straightened her hair. After applying her makeup, she pulled out the first of three new outfits she had bought for work; a black skirt and blue, button up shirt. After stripping from her pyjamas, she slipped into a red bra and panty set and got dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the time on her phone, she was pleasantly surprised by how quickly she had managed to get ready. She grabbed her bag, shoved her phone inside, and jumped in her car. The commute was pretty easy, with a new road built to the factory which hardly anyone was using right now. The factory was nestled deeply between the town's thick forests, and the winding road up the gates seemed to go on forever. Just when she was beginning to think she had gone the wrong way, the factory suddenly loomed over her, and she passed through the gates to the car park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking her phone again, she realised she only had two minutes to go. \"Shit! Can't be late, can't be late...\" Lucy repeated over and over. She really couldn't afford to lose this job. Not before she had even begun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping out of the car, Lucy made her way inside and followed the signs to the offices. She jogged up a flight of stairs and dashed round a corner just in time to see the clock above her head strike 9am. As she entered the main office, she was greeted, to her relief, by a smiling woman in purple pantsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy! We were starting to think we'd scared you off,\" the woman, Abigail, who looked to be in her late 20's, had interviewed Lucy for the job, and would be her new boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all,\" Lucy panted. \"I'm so sorry I wasn't here earlier, I uh...got a little lost...\" She lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem at all,\" Abigail said. \"Follow me, and we'll get you set up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy breathed a sigh of relief as Abigail led her along a row of cubicals. Lucy peered at each one as they walked by, noticing that all her co-workers seemed to be women, looking roughly the same age as herself. They were all typing away, mostly looking immersed in their work, though one or two looked up and smiled at her as she passed. Abigail walked ahead, and Lucy realised for the first time how tall she was; she had been sitting down throughout the interview, but looked about six foot now. She had a slender figure, but a strangely curvaceous one, with wide hips, a bubble butt and breasts as large as Lucy's own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we are,\" Abigail said. \"You'll be sitting here. I've left some training materials for you on the desk, but you shouldn't find anything too difficult. You'll mostly be logging our shipping and distribution figures and producing monthly reports for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Lucy said, sitting down at her new desk. It didn't exactly sound good, but it sounded simple enough, if a little dull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get to a meeting now, but let me know if you need anything,\" Abigail said. \"Or just ask Kat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail gestured to the girl in the cubicle opposite Lucy; a blonde girl with a pleasantly round face and a rather chubby figure. She was sitting down, but Lucy could see her shirt was quite tight, and her stomach seemed to be pushing against her desk. Kat waved at her, and Lucy waved back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, I'll check in on you after my meeting,\" Abigail smiled and walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like she had been thrown in without any real guidance at all, Lucy sighed and switched her computer on. Her company log on was pinned to her computer, so she took a moment to sign on and check her work email, which had a single email welcoming her to the company. She wasn't really sure what to do next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eyes scanned her desk, she spotted the training guide Abigail had mentioned, and was about to open it up, when she noticed she had also been given a small bowl full of candy. \"Huh, free samples,\" Lucy smiled, reaching for a candy and popping it into her mouth. She had to admit, the candy really was good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up the training guide, she decided to get to work...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well let's get started.\" Lucy thought. She causally flipped through her guide, she jotted down page numbers in a piece of paper located on her desk. Ten minutes later, Lucy decided it would be the best time to take a small break. She looked around her area, women ran down the isles with papers and other office related items. One women in particular held what appeared to be a canister, why it wasn't handled by professional Lucy couldn't say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did note how many women worked in the off, there were so men of course, but it seemed to be mainly filled with ladies. She shrugged, maybe it was a push for women in the workplace. Opposite to her, she saw Kat hard at work. Lucy's eyes gazed upon how quick and efficient the older---in terms of office experience---worker was. Phones were answered and put down, papers were sorted and handed out, and emails were sent and received.Lucy felt somewhat intimidated, but Abigail did say she would answer any of Lucy's questions, so she must at least cordial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll introduce myself to her.\" Lucy mumbled, she got up and paced over to Kat, who was lightly signing a piece of paper. The chubby woman blinked and gave Lucy a heartfelt smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there! You must be Lucy, Abigail said you'd be my new neighbor.\" Kat spoke. \"It's been lonely in my section, no one had ever sat across from me before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they expanded this section about a month ago, our factory's growth has been exponential.So what do you need hon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to say high and find out a little more about this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat shifted for a bit, her large belly rubbed against her desk. Lucy wondered why they gave the woman such a small piece of furniture, it seemed kinda demeaning to her. She watched the buttons on the larger woman's shirt stretch a bit, it looked like her belly grew but it could've been a trick of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to know what's in this place, I'll show you around.But if you want to know about the green, I'll tell you right now.\" Kat said, she rubbed her fingers together as a motion for money. \"This factory will become the biggest in the tri-state area, with reported plans to open up in another state. We're hiring workers up the wazooh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy listened on to Kat's story, soon enough the two's discussions went to their personal life. Surface level stuff, but they were breaking the ice. Through this Lucy managed to muster up the courage to ask her senior a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do they give you such a small desk aren't you uncomfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat looked at Lucy for a bit, her eyebrows raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,why do I need to change it? This desk is perfect for when I sh-\" Kat stopped and swallowed, she seemed to wanna eat the word she was about to spit out. \"-rink back down. Going on a diet plan right now, its a three month plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat burped after that spiel, clearly embarrassed about something. Lucy swore she could hear the sound of thread snapping, though she didn't know where it was coming from.</span></div></div>",

Kat made a high pitched \"Eek!\" noise and quickly turned her back on Lucy, practically running from the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" Lucy called after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen no response came, Lucy decided she had better go and check on her new co-worker. She pursued her out of the large, open plan office just in time to see her round a corner and turn into the women's bathroom. Lucy followed her in, and found her her panting heavily as she stood next to the sink, staring at her reflection in the mirror. She heard Lucy enter the room and looked startled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...sorry...\" Lucy said, seeing Kat's bewildered expression. \"I just thought you might be in trouble or something, do you need any help? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine,\" Kat said awkwardly. \"I just...\" Before she could say anything else, a ripping noise came from her skirt. She shrieked, and scrambled to cover herself up as her tight work-skirt split along the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy would have pretended not to notice, but it was pretty obvious what had just happened. Lucy could only surmise that Kat had gotten a little too big for her current outfit, and had been in denial about her much weight she had put on. The skirt was barely clinging on, stretched across her chunky thighs and large, prominent butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my own fault,\" Kat said dejectedly. \"I should have bought some bigger clothes. I told myself I'd be able to lose the weight and fit back into my dress in no time. I'm so embarrassed. Ugh...sorry you had to see this on your first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was feeling hugely awkward, but didn't want to make things worse. \"Hey, it happens to the best of us,\" she said, reassuringly. Though it had never happened to Lucy in her life. Her weight had always been pretty consistent. She had certainly never bust out of a skirt, let alone in the workplace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I've gained so much weight since I took this job,\" Kat moaned. \"I used to be so active...I know they say starting a desk job makes some people gain weight, but I didn't think it would happen to me, not this fast anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were on a diet though, right?\" Lucy asked, trying to get her to stay positive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kat said. \"Not so good at sticking to it though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, give it time,\" Lucy said. \"You should probably go and get changed or something, do you have a spare set of clothes anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat's eyes welled up with tears. \"No...I don't bring anything with me, I'd have to go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll cover for you until you can pick something up,\" Lucy suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah that would work,\" Kat said, breathing a sigh of relief. \"Thanks so much, I won't be long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled and checked the coast was clear, before sending Kat on her way. The plump blonde held onto her ripped skirt as she walked awkwardly down the hallway and out of the building. Lucy shook her head, wondering what kind of weird workplace she had joined. Still, she did feel bad for the girl. Hopefully that diet of hers worked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy returned to her desk, stopping by the reception desk to explain that Kat had had to attend an urgent meeting and wouldn't be back for an hour or so. The girl on the front desk didn't seem to know who Lucy was, but she just nodded politely, while chowing down on a bowl of sour candy.</span></div></div>",

Pen in hand, she began to quickly flick through the training manual, jotting down the occasional note. It was one of her old study habits from college, one that had served her extremely well. Get the general gist of what she's meant to learn, divide it into sections, then expand upon it. However, not five minutes into her learning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, so boring...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy reclined in her chair with a heavy groan, arms falling limply to her sides. While her study plan was good in theory, she had only ever managed to pull it off once or twice without taking breaks every five minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing is so long!\" Lifting the hefty manual, she ran her fingers along the width of the book, page edges brushing against her fingertip. It had to be an inch at least, maybe even an inch and a half. An inch of boring, meaningless information, with nary a reward for her hard work... But maybe there could be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting one of her many candies between her fingers, she inspected it for a moment before glancing back down at her manual, then finally at her notes. With a smirk, she popped the sweet into her mouth, savouring its delicious taste. It was followed by another, then another, before she stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay! For each chapter I manage to complete, I reward myself!</i> Lucy grinned at her idea, enthusiasm rapidly returning to her bored body. Brandishing her pen, she quickly finished scribbling down the various headings. Once done, her efforts were rewarded with a handful of heavenly candies. <i>Mmm, delicious... Studying for college would've been way better had I thought of this! Now, chapter one...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple of hours, the office around Lucy vanished in a muffled background as she steadily worked her way through the manual. For each chapter she slogged through, she treated herself to some candies, whose tantalising taste re-energized her and allowed her to work her way through the next chapter. What she didn't realize was that, with each completed goal, her reward grew, going from three candies to four. Four became five, which became six. And after a particularly long and uninteresting chapter about the correct way to fill out a report, she treated herself to a whole eight sweets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done~\" Lucy sang quietly to herself as she turned to the final couple of pages. She was prepared to give it her all, only to find the final chapter was some sort of letter from the owner of Expansive Candy that urged her to do her best for herself and the company. Despite taking no notes, she had grown accustomed to her read-for-reward scheme and, upon finishing the letter, devoured another eight sweets. \"And I'm done! Finally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pleased sigh, Lucy relaxed, pushing the manual to one side. Smile on her face, she found a hand snaking its way to her candy bowl, scooping up what remained in it and popping them into her mouth. As she swallowed, her hand returned to the bowl, her fingers scraping against the ceramic bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finished them all?\" She muttered to herself, blushing slightly at her sudden and surprising gluttony. \"Man, I hope they don't affect my figure too badly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Lucy, her rewards had already begun to affect her...</span></div></div>",

Casting a subtle glance around to make sure nobody was looking her way, her hands moved to her breasts and adjusted her bra, which was strangely right around her chest, before moving downwards and slipping into her skirt, fingers picking at her panties. <i>These fit perfectly earlier...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how Lucy adjusted her underwear, both bra and panties dug uncomfortably into her body. Trying to ignore it didn't work either, as the sensation remained prevalent. Eventually, she was forced to admit defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kat, right?\" Lucy turned to her neighbour, who glanced over her shoulder with a kind smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Is everything alright, Lucy?\" Kat responded. \"You look a tad uncomfortable\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, everything's fine!\" Lucy lied, ignoring the overwhelming urge to adjust her bra for the seventh time. \"It's just... I'm heading to the bathroom, so if Abigail comes back while I'm away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll let her know,\" Kat assured her. \"Bathroom is across the office, near the door you came in. You know where that is, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Lucy was up like a shot. She began to power walk down the aisle towards the bathroom, the irritating tightness growing more and more prevalent with each step. Try as she might, it became too annoying and she ducked into a vacant cubicle. Crouching down, she picked furiously at her underwear, yet it didn't nothing to lessen her discomfort. Forced to admit defeat, she returned to the aisle, her pace closer to a job than a walk. A few people cast her off glances as she moved, but she paid them no mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, finally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarging onto the bathroom, Lucy wasted no time in finding an empty cubicle and locking herself in. Her fingers worked quickly to unbutton her shirt and unzip her skirt, Lucy soon stood in her red underwear. It didn't last long as she pulled her bra from her breasts, allowing her considerable bust to bounce free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All this stuff is brand new</i>, she thought as she adjusted her bra, soon pulling the loosened garment around her chest. Despite this, it was still snug around her breasts, though no longer uncomfortable. Sadly, her panties remained uncomfortably tight around her hips, no amount of adjustment and wiggling enough to reduce it. Reluctantly, she left them alone, pulling her skirt up her legs. <i>Well, at least it's somewhat bearable now. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her underwear issues had been somewhat solved, her shirt and skirt presented another issue, one she hadn't realized. Both clung tightly to her body, any creases in her skirt gone as it was drawn right around her lower body. Her top was the same, however the issue was quickly fixed as she left a couple of buttons undone, revealing her ample cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thankfully the office is mostly filled with woman</i>, Lucy thought as she left the bathroom. <i>And I doubt any men will try anything...</i></span></div></div>",

Lucy would have been lying to herself if she had said she wasn't proud of her breasts; truth was, she loved them. She had always been busty, to the point where it sometimes made buying underwear and shirts difficult. But she had never gone through a working day showing quite this much cleavage. Her station was a cubicle with walls on either side, and a gap where she could look over and see Kat directly opposite her, so she decided to shift my monitor over to the right slightly to obscure her upper body and hide her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat leaned out and looked at her curiously, probably thinking she was just being anti social. Lucy gave her a wave, and Kat waved back, but looked no less confused. Breathing a sigh of relief, looked down at her chest again, and found herself staring down at her canyon of cleavage. <i>Wow, that looks a lot worse in this light...I need a new bra. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to focus on her work again, Lucy noticed a stack of papers had now appeared on her desk, dumped atop the manual she had only just finished reading. She took the top paper and read through it; it was a set of instructions for contacting company suppliers and confirming orders and distribution lists. It wasn't terrible exciting work, but at least it was simple, so Lucy decided to get to work. She was just about to reach for another piece of candy, but realised she had emptied the bowl. <i>Dam, forgot I finished those off...wait...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked down, she saw, with some surprise, that her bowl had been refilled. That was generous of them. But there was probably plenty of candy to go around. With a smile, she popped a few candies into her mouth and started work. The task was pretty easy; it just involved composing an email, confirming the reference number for the order and setting up a regular shipment. There were, however, a <i>lot </i>of shipments to log. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, as she worked, Lucy reached, instinctively, for more candy, again and again, continuously popping them into her mouth until the day reached it's end. The clock struck 5, and, though she wasn't finished with everything on her desk, she decided to call it a day and finish off the rest tomorrow. She cast a glance down to her candy bowl again, and saw there was only one piece left. <i>Did I really get through all of that stuff a second time? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged and popped the last piece into her mouth, telling herself she would savour the taste before promptly biting into it and swallowing it down as soon as it hit her tongue. She rose from her desk and stretched her arms above her head, realising she hadn't actually moved from her seated position for about four hours. In doing so, she forgot about her tight top, and suddenly felt one of her buttons come undone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, she ducked down behind her computer again and stared back at her breasts, which seemed to be escaping her shirt. <i>God dammit, girl, make yourself decent! </i> She quickly redid the button, though it felt tighter than before. Grabbing her bag from beneath her desk, she shielded her cleavage, waved goodbye to Kat, and quickly headed home for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it had been a successful first day. Besides her strangely tight clothes, nothing had gone wrong, the people seemed nice and the work was pretty basic. Plus, that candy was really good. She found herself wishing she had taken some home with her...but she had probably had more than enough for one day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy's trip home was, for the most part, uneventful. The new road was just as empty as it was that morning, though the winding road felt no less long. The entire way, however, she found herself shifting uncomfortably in her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is with these things?!</i> Coming to a stop at a set of traffic lights, Lucy took the opportunity to pick at her irritating clothing. Her bra, which had been fine up until she left the factory, was once again clinging uncomfortably to her breasts while her panties, which she had subconsciously adjusted throughout the day, felt like they were just about ready to tear from her body. <i>These have always fit me! So why, all of a sudden, do they -</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>HONK</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a car behind her honk its horn angrily, Lucy glanced up with a start, realising that the lights had turned green. Gritting her teeth, she floored it through the junction, perhaps a bit harsher than she normally did. Now that she was aware of her clothes returning tightness, it was all she could feel. The faster she got home, the faster she could figure out what was wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Finally home!\" Lucy announced to her empty flat, dropping her keys into the little bowl next to her door. \"Which means I can finally figure out what the hell is wrong with these clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomping through the flat, the short walk to her bathroom drew a few other clothing issues to her attention. First was her skirt, which had fit her perfectly when she first put it on this morning. Now, however, it clung to her hips and backside like a second skin, making her gait a tad awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the issue she could see, and one she found difficult to ignore. If she glanced downwards, even slightly, her wobbling bust entered her vision. And while her seeing it was an issue in itself, the fact that it had developed a visible wobble as she walked was another. Her breasts had always been firm and perky, not soft and bouncy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's see here...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in her bathroom, Lucy wasted no time in stripping. Her shirt came off easily, the blue garment fluttering to the floor. Her skirt, however, put up more of a fight, refusing to slide down her hips. After a considerable amount of grunting as she struggled, it was soon freed and joined her shirt on the floor. Now stood in nothing but her bra and panties, Lucy spun to face her mirror, a hand moving to her bust and the other to her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are they... bigger?\" Raising a red eyebrow, Lucy cupped on of her breasts. While she couldn't speak regarding the potential size increase, she couldn't deny that her once firm bust had softened slightly, giving it a bit more of a jiggle. It was the same for her backside which, while not as prominent as her upper half, now had its own slightly bounce to it. \"N-No, that's absurd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the thought from her head, Lucy turned her back on the mirror. She stared at her ill-fitting outfit on the floor for a few moments, slightly upset that it didn't quite fit her. She had liked that outfit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, if they don't quite fit anymore, who's to say my other new outfits also don't fit?\" Lucy wondered aloud. \"Maybe I should invest in some larger clothing, just to be on the safe side...\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she weighed up the likelihood of her clothes no longer fitting beside the rather pitiful state of her bank account, Lucy began to have second thoughts. There was no way her new work clothes didn't fit anymore. She had only purchased them last week, and had made sure to try each and every item on in the store before paying. She couldn't explain why today's outfit had become so tight, but she was sure it must just be a fluke. Maybe she was just imagining things? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had always been busty. She just wasn't used to wearing smart clothes. She had gotten so used to lounging around her flat in sweats and jeans that it just felt weird being in a shirt and formal skirt again. That was all. Nothing to to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy took another look at herself in the mirror, admiring, as she often did, her sizeable breasts. She hefted one in each hand, giving them a little lift to emphasise her cleavage. <i>\"Still got it.\" </i> She changed into her pyjamas, a pair of loose shorts and a crop top, and headed out to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much left in her cupboards, so dinner was some leftover pasta from the other day. It was a pretty small portion, and she found her stomach rumbling through the night, but until she got paid, she was going to have to eat light. She resolved to make the most of the workplace cafeteria tomorrow. Maybe she could sneak some food away in a doggy bag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a little tired after her first day of work in several months, Lucy headed to bed early, falling asleep in no time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Lucy awoke, thankfully, on time. With a tired groan, she swung her legs out of bed and crossed to her wardrobe. As the fog of her sleep lifted, she suddenly remembered her clothing issues from yesterday, and became a little nervous as she pulled today's outfit from the wardrobe. It was a white shirt and long, black skirt today. Lucy took a deep breath, as she pulled off her pyjamas and put on a light blue bra and panty set. They, at least, felt perfectly comfortable, though she had owned them for a while, so that was to be expected. At least there would be less chafing today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy put the shirt on first, enjoying the feeling of the soft, silky material of the garment around her shoulders. She had spent a little too much on this one, but it felt great to wear. As she fastened the buttons, however, a familiar feeling washed over her. They were tight. As soon as she got to the button just below her boobs, she found she was having to breathe in to get it fastened. She had to repeat the step for the next three buttons, and when she finished, she could feel her breasts rubbing up against the shirt, almost as though they were about to burst through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her mirror, she looked over her reflection and was relieved to see it looked a lot better than it felt. Perhaps she was just imagining things again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the skirt next, she gently pulled it up over her legs and over her butt with ease, then breathed a sigh of relief. As she zipped it up though, she turned to look at herself again and noticed how much her butt seemed to be sticking out. Had it always been so...round? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no time to worry about that now though, she had to get going for work...</span></div></div>",

Her drive this morning was uneventful, though the road to the factory was a little busier. She must've passed about five trucks, all leaving the factory for town and all marked with the bright 'Expansive Candy' company seal. Had she to guess, they were stocked full of candy for the many shops that had sprung up across town. And if her guess was correct, that would mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, Lucy, good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muffled clack of sharp heels on carpet heralded the arrival of Abigail, who held a massive pile of papers in her arms. It was easily double the amount she had filled out yesterday, leaving Lucy to guess that two people would be required to fill them out. Her guess, unfortunately, was wrong as the entire pile was slammed down in front of her, a few papers from the top fluttering from the mountain onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry about that!\" Abigail apologised, bending over to scoop up the fallen papers. As she did so, Lucy got an eyeful of her full backside, her skirt drawn tight around it. \"Anyway, as you probably saw on your way in, a number of shipments left the factory today. It's your job, alongside a couple other people, to fill out these distribution forms. I've left instructions atop the pile, alongside a little something for you. As always, if you have any questions, I'm sure Kat would be more than happy to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Abigail vanished, leaving a stunned Lucy staring at her massive workload for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm not the only one filling this much out?!</i> she thought in disbelief, peeling a sticky note from the top of the pile. <i>Just how much candy did they send out this morning?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucy wondered about the amount of factory's startling output, she read through her instructions. The forms she had to complete weren't at all complicated, but they were incredibly tedious. She had to look up the store specified on that particular form, then note down the number of the truck that had been assigned to it, which would then allow her to figure out what candy had been sent to it, allowing her to finish the form. However, some stores had multiple trucks sent to them, others were being visited by the same truck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, so maybe it's a little bit complicated</i>, she admitted to herself, logging into her computer. As she waited for it to load, a hand subconsciously reached towards the pile, where a number of filled bowls, also double the amount she had yesterday, sat. Scooping up a handful of candy, she began to munch on it. <i>At least I've got more candy... Though it seems I've got way more than yesterday. I'm not complaining or anything, but I hope it doesn't affect my figure too much. Don't want to end up like Kat!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a subtle glance towards her neighbour, Lucy's eyes lingered on Kat's spherical gut. Much like yesterday, it was pressing heavily into her desk, though it did look slightly heftier, as did the rest of her. Kat didn't seem at all bothered by her size, chubby fingers dancing nimbly across her keyboard as she worked, occasionally pausing so she could scoop up a handful of sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should get to work as well</i>, Lucy thought, pulling the first form towards her. <i>Got a lot to do, after all...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy got to work as quickly as she could, hoping she would be able to clear some of her backlog and have a decent break by mid-morning. She soon realised, however, that this was a pipe dream. It took her roughly fifteen minutes to completely input a single form, and the satisfaction of moving that form from her \"to do\" pile to her \"completed\" pile was undermined slightly by the fact that the \"to do\" pile never seemed to get any smaller. <i>How many more do I have? I feel like at the rate I'm going these will take me all week! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, she reached for her candy bowl closest to her and grabbed a handful of gummies, tossing them back all at once and chewing away. Somehow, the delicious candy seemed to make her feel more optimistic about her work load, or at least take her mind off how much she had left to do, so she kept grabbing more, tossing them back as she worked on. After an hour had passed, Lucy took a look down at the pile again and sighed as she saw she still had a ton left to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh come on, I swear I must have done half that pile already, I wonder if everyone else has this much work to do? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy wheeled her chair back and looked down the aisle, hoping to catch a glimpse of her colleagues desks. She couldn't see much from her current vantage point, so she decided to stop for a moment and have a walk around. Rising from her desk, she suddenly became aware that her shirt was bunching beneath her breasts, and pulled it down. She tugged at her skirt, straightening it out as she walked on. Did it feel tighter again? Maybe a little? Maybe she was just imagining things? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy walked down the aisle, sweeping her red hair behind her shoulder as she tried to subtly look over at the other girls desks. From what she could see, it was split down the middle. The girls on her side of the office were overloaded with paperwork, and were in various states of distress, scrambling to sort out their workload while digging into their free candy. On the other side of the room, it seemed more chilled, with the administrators working at their own pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy also noticed something strangely coincidental as she turned around and returned to her own desk...everyone on her side of the office was pretty slim, while everyone on the other side, Kat's side, was rather chubby. There was a girl even larger than Kat in the middle of the row, just staring idly at her screen, not really doing anything but eat candy from one of three large bowls in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, some people here are pretty lazy. Maybe I should take my time. I might just be making more work for myself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sat back down, breathed out, and carried on working. Her hand kept going for the candy bowl every few seconds now, to the point where her jaw was starting to ache from all the chewing she was doing. Her shirt was bunching again, and she found herself having to keep tugging it to make herself more comfortable...</span></div></div>",

Slowly chewing through it, she groaned as she swallowed, a hand massaging her aching jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jeez, I've finished it all?! Felt like I just started on the gummies...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the three empty bowls, Lucy groaned and stood, stretching her arms above her head as she moved properly for the first time in a couple of hours. Doing so, however, presented her with a new problem as two of her shirt buttons popped loose, a slight breeze blowing across the tops of her breasts. With a startled squeak, her arms flew to cover her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>W-What?! How'd... How'd the buttons break?! I made sure they fit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around nervously, Lucy sank back into her seat and slumped low. Glancing sideways at Kat, she made sure her neighbour wasn't paying attention before turning her own attention to her chest. For a moment, she gazed into her cavernous cleavage, a red eyebrow raised in confusion, before she attempted to cover it. As her fingers fiddled with the button and its accompanying hole, she realised that her bra, formerly fitting, was just as right around her bust. As subtly as possible, she worked to loosen her overly fitting bra, managing to do so after a couple of attempts. With her breasts no longer being pinched painfully, she returned her attention to her buttons, which were a lot less cooperative. After a couple of futile attempts, she was forced to admit defeat as one of the buttons fell off, landing in the floor and rolling out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least I managed to loosen my bra, if only just</i>, Lucy shrugged, her arms falling to rest on her chair. <i>And besides, even if I did manage to button this stupid thing, it'd probably be super uncomfortable... Well, I suppose there isn't an awful lot I can do until I get home. Until then, I should just stay at my desk and keep a low profile!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, Lucy? Want to join me for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy flinched, arms flying to cover her chest again, as Kat's head peeked over her cubicle walls. Her chubby co-worker eyed her with obvious amusement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"First time I've managed to spook anybody! Normally, they see me coming!\" Kat joked, giving her gut a light slap. \"Anyway, lunch? The food here is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yeah, sure... I'll join, just give me a moment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat nodded, her head retreating from the cubicle. With a final, worried glance down at her bust, Lucy stood. Doing so revealed a second issue, this time with her skirt. It felt a lot tighter around her backside, as did her panties. Twisting to glance at her rear end, she ran a hand over it, trying to gauge if her earlier guess was correct or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It can't be bigger, can it? I mean, bodies don't just grow like that... I guess I'll check properly when I'm home. For now, I'll head to lunch, see what this food is all about...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her cubicle, Lucy started for the cafeteria, thankful that the majority of her co-workers were female and/or thicker than average. As she walked, she was only vaguely aware of her wobbling breasts and swaying hips, both of which were new sensations...   </span></div></div>",

What immediately struck Lucy was the ridiculously generous serving sizes; there were huge vats full of pasta, burgers, pizza...nothing looked incredibly healthy, and she was conscious of her current clothing situation growing any worse...so she decided to play it safe and just ask for a slice of Pizza and some salad. The serving lady looked a little bemused by this, probably because Lucy was the only person not current carrying an overflowing tray back to her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat, on the other hand, had gone for one of the jumbo sized burgers, a pizza slice <i>and </i>a piece of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No wonder she's gotten so chubby, that's a crazy amount to eat for lunch...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sat down at a small table with Kat and bit into her pizza slice, and she had to admit, it tasted really, really good. She could see how it would be easy to pig out on this stuff. Casting a furtive glance around the rest of the room, she saw her colleagues chowing down greedily. The newer girls mostly seemed to be going for smaller portion sizes, but one dark haired girl was digging into an enormous burger excitedly. The larger women in the office all seemed to have extra helpings, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good food, right?\" Kat said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded, and decided to change the subject, a little unnerved by how massive the meals were in this place. \"So, how did you first start working here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was one of the first applicants, so they took me on early and showed me the ropes,\" Kat explained, wiping some cheese from her mouth with the side of her hand. \"So I've been here for like a month. I think I have a picture of my first day...hang on...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat reached into the pocket on her skirt, which seemed like it took some effort, but she finally produced her phone and swiped to a picture of herself wearing her uniform on what was, presumably, her first day. She held the phone up for Lucy to see. To Lucy's astonishment, Kat looked almost completely different; she was at least fifty pounds lighter. Her work clothes fit her perfectly, and she wasn't nearly as chubby as she was now. In fact, she was even slimmer than Lucy. She tried her best to hide her surprise and smiled. \"C-cute...\" She said, trailing off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How the hell did she get so big in one month? It can't just be the cafeteria and the candy! That's insane! She must have some sort of glandular problem or something. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished their food, Kat was looking a little tired. That huge burger had clearly left her a little sluggish, and as she rose from her seat, Lucy could see the buttons of her shirt stretching to accommodate her bloated gut. Lucy avoided looking directly at her, more concerned with her own rapidly constricting wardrobe. Fortunately, her pizza slice had been a pretty light lunch, so she hadn't noticed any further tightness, but still, she was concerned what the afternoon might bring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning to their desks, Kat slumped into her chair with a grunt, while Lucy sat down more carefully, not wanting to aggravate her tightening top button any further. As she went to continue with her work, she noticed that her candy bowls had been replenished and instinctively reached for a handful of candies and popped them in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>These guys are a bad influence...so many refills...</i></span></div></div>",

No matter how many forms she filled out, however, the pile of forms to be filled out on her left side never seemed to grow any smaller. She could tell she was making some progress, at the very least, as the obviously smaller pile of completed forms on her right was steadily growing with each one she finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And that's another done...</i> Lucy thought to herself, sliding a particularly irritating form involving the same truck visiting about three different stores over to her right. As she set about straightening the pile, her other hands grabbed a handful of strawberry straws and ferried them to her mouth. <i>Just another... Urgh, I don't even know how many are left! How am I meant to get all these done today?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an anxious groan, she grabbed the next form. She didn't start filling it out straight away, instead choosing to stare blankly at the still towering unfinished pile. A quick glance over the walls of her cubicle at her neighbours revealed that she was the only one so far back, everybody else powering ahead. A few of her co-workers were even drawing close to finishing, something that seemed like a dream given the mountain of work she still had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Am I just slow?</i> Lucy wondered, chomping down on another handful of straws. <i>Or just really bad at this?</i> A second scoop of straws entered her mouth. <i>Should I really be working here if I can't even fill out some simple paperwork?!</i> A third helping of straws, and she realized she had finished her first bowl, leaving only two left. This bothered her for only a second, her thoughts quickly returning to her unfinished work. With another groan, she began to fill the form out, oblivious to her hand now continuously ferrying treats to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Barely five forms in, and I'm already out of candy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy groaned as she eyed her empty candy bowls. Not only did she still have a ton of work to finish, but now she didn't even have a way to reward her efforts? Another glance over the walls revealed that those close to finishing had done so, and they even had candy left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great, now I'm slow at working and fat for eating all my candy...</i> Lucy sighed heavily, fingers picking anxiously at her shirt. The white garment was pulled tight over her torso, though nothing was tighter than the top-most button. It felt one deep breath away from exposing off, revealing more of her tantalising cleavage to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was her skirt. It was drawn painfully tight over her hips and backside, forcing Lucy to glance around nervously before pulling the zip down slightly, loosening the pressure on her lower body. Unfortunately, there was nothing she could do for her bra and panties, the former on its biggest setting and the latter one size only. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Urgh... Mrph...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling through the next form, Lucy found her candy grabbing hand twitching anxiously. Her fingers tapped, and tapped, and tapped until she could take it no longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need something to eat!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, her eyes zoned in on Kat's desk. Kat herself seemed to have dozed off, her stuffed gut rising and falling slowly with each breath. Kat herself wasn't what attracted Lucy's attention, rather, it was the candy she hadn't eaten. Four large bowls sat atop her desk, calling out to Lucy, demanding she eat them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sorry, Kat, but I really need these... I promise, I'll make it up to you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching low, Lucy darted across the aisle and snatched up the four bowls, two in each arm, and returned to her desk. Rewarding her successful theft with a couple of handfuls of her plunder, Lucy got back to work, her stressed hand still ferrying treats to her mouth... </span></div></div>",

How are you getting on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the upbeat voice of Abigail over the wall of her cubicle, Lucy paused for the first time since she had stolen Kat's candy. Chewing quickly, she gulped down the remnants of Kat's third bowl, or her fifth one of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A-Abigail!\" Lucy smiled weakly, gesturing to the pile of unfinished forms on her left. While it was still rather chunky, it was much smaller than the absolute mountain she had started with this morning. \"I'm... Well, I'm not quite done yet. I guess I'm still getting used to doing paperwork again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, not to worry!\" Abigail responded with a dismissive wave of her hand. \"You're only new here, after all, and we aren't too strict about time limits. That being said, these do need to be done today, so I'm afraid I am going to have to ask you to stay late to finish them off. You don't mind, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh... I suppose that's a reasonable request...\" Lucy mumbled in response. \"But can I make a quick request? Could... Could I get a top-up of candy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course you can!\" Abigail smiled down at her. \"And thank you very much, Lucy. Keep up the good work, and somebody will be along soon with your refills!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail moved onto the next cubicle, leaving Lucy alone. Before she started on her next form, she scooped up a couple of handfuls of gummy bears from Kat's final bowl. Dropping them one at a time into her mouth, she lifted her pen and returned to work. Not five minutes later, however, she was forced to stop as yet another strained button fell from her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Goddamn it, not again...\" Lucy sighed, swallowing some more gummy bears. By now, the amount of cleavage she was showing off to the office was scandalous, the cups of her bra visible to those who dared look enough. And no amount of careful tugging was enough to hide them again, forcing the redhead to give up, arms falling to rest on the arms of her chair. \"At least nobody is around to see me... Still, I don't feel comfortable showing off this much flesh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she had nothing to cover herself, forcing her to return to her work, albeit slightly more hunched over. Doing so presented her with another clothing issue. Her shirt, formerly tucked into her overly tight skirt, rode up at the back, which wouldn't have been an issue had she not felt a slight chill travel down between her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning slightly, her fingers moved to inspect the sudden chill, only to discover that the tops of her rotund ass cheeks were no longer covered by her skirt. Blushing slightly, she tugged her shirt down to cover her rear end. In doing so, more of her breasts were revealed to the world, deepening her blush and turning her face a bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"T-This stupid shirt!\" Lucy growled at the white garment. \"Can't cover my chest, can't help cover my backside... Whatever! I'm almost done anyway, then I can head home and change into clothes that actually fit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing aside her clothing issues, Lucy pushed onwards, still feeding herself candies until, with one final mouthful, she finished both her final bowl and her final form. With a relieved sigh, she relaxed in her seat, thankful that she was finally done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Only took me an extra hour</i>, Lucy noted, glancing at her clock. <i>Not too bad, Lucy, not too bad... Would've been nice to get them done on time, but baby steps. Anyway, I'm outta candy, so no reason to hang around!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Lucy continued to ignore her intensely clingy clothing and started for the exit...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy arrived home pretty quickly. Leaving work late did leave to her avoiding the rush hour traffic, so at least that was one positive. She could hardly believe the amount of work she'd be given on only her second day, but maybe that was a good sign - she must have been doing something right if Abigail trusted her with more tasks. Still, it was pretty heavy going, and she hoped that the rest of the week would be a little less intense. It was hard to believe she was only on her second day; there really hadn't been much in the way of on the job training so far, and she was still slightly confused about what how exactly the company were making their strange business model succeed, but as long as she kept getting paid, she wasn't going to worry too much about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stepping into her apartment, the first thing she decided to do was remove her constricting shirt. Though before she get get the buttons undone, she caught sight of herself in her bedroom mirror, and was shocked at just how scandalous her clothing situation had gotten over the course of the day. Her boobs were practically exploding out of her shirt, the lace cups of her bra visible and a considerable amount of cleavage on display. <i>Oh god, I didn't realise it looked this bad! I really should've checked myself out in the bathroom after that second button went...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy undid the remaining buttons on her shirt and took it off. Standing in front of the mirror in her bra, she couldn't help but feel, once again, that her breasts looked bigger. Were they swollen? Was she pregnant?! No...that couldn't be right either. But they definitely looked bigger. Lucy had had quite a growth spurt in high school, her breasts quickly outgrowing many of her classmates, and she had been busty ever since, but she had never seen them looking quite <i>this </i>big before. Lucy cupped her breasts and hefted them up and down, feeling their weight. She then pulled out her phone and flicked through her photos; there were some pics she had taken while on a girls' vacation last summer where she was wearing a bikini, so she brought them up and zoomed in on her tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...they do look bigger!\" Lucy said out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no denying it. The picture of her from last year showed her in a skimpy bikini top, which showed plenty of cleavage but nothing quite like what she was wearing now. This either meant that her boobs were going through another growth spurt, or that she had gained weight...but that couldn't be right either...everything had fit perfectly last week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea what was happening. She considered weighing herself to see if she had put on a few pounds, but decided she didn't really want to know. She unzipped her skirt and let it fall to the floor, running a hand over her prominent butt. Taking a look at the photo on her phone again, she couldn't really get a clear look at her ass, but she was convinced it felt bigger too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I need something new for tomorrow,\" Lucy muttered. \"No more shirts. No more button popping. No more dam cleavage at my desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to her wardrobe and selected a purple, once piece dress instead. She had accidentally bought one size too big a few weeks ago and forgotten to return it, so she was sure there would be no issues this time. She'd just have to go shopping again at the weekend...</span></div></div>",

She hadn't a clue why she kept them around, but she was thankful that she did. One clothed, she bounced into bed with a grateful sigh. After spending the entire day sat on her ass, it felt nice to lie atop it instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope...\" She paused to let out a long yawn, hand swinging out to turn off her lamp. \"I hope tomorrow is easier than today was... Doing all that paperwork really took it out of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dim darkness overtook the room, Lucy's eyes slowly shutting. It didn't take her long at all to drift off into sleep, a sleep that was quickly interrupted by a familiar landscape forming before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Man, more work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy groaned as another small mountain of paperwork was slammed down on her desk by a faceless figure. Before she could even take a look at it, another pile was dropped atop it, the now towering pile leaning dangerously to one side. With a sigh, she quickly split the pile before it had a chance to fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is this much work even possible for one person to do?!\" She asked aloud. \"Well, at least I've got this candy to get me through it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a handful of chewy pastilles, she hungrily chomped down. However, instead of beginning on her next form, she helped herself to another handful. And then another. And then another. With the speed she was eating, it didn't take her long to finish an entire bowl, only for another to replace it, this one filled with decadent bonbons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmph, so tasty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second bowl, piled high with strawberry laces, appeared next to it. Gulping down a helping of bonbons, she washed them down with a large handful of laces. She alternated between the two until both bowls were empty, at which point she realized that she was getting no more refills. With a whimper, she glanced around, desperate to find more. Yet every desk was barren, the bowls of candy that decorated them during the day nowhere to be seen. Her belly, hidden from view by a pair of massive breasts, grumbled hungrily, demanding more candy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith wild eyes, Lucy sat bolt upright in her bed. The grumbling from her belly continued, their demands unchanged from the dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"C...Candy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy mumbled this to herself as she swung her legs out of bed and stood. Stepping slowly and carefully, she left her bedroom and headed for her kitchen, a hand gently rubbing her rumbling but. Flicking the kitchen light on, she flinched, the bright light temporarily blinding her. Once she had recovered, she moved to one of her cupboards, pulling open the door to reveal a small stash of candy. It wasn't made by Expansive Candy, unfortunately, but she wasn't too concerned by that at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowsily tearing open a chewy sweet, she dropped it into her mouth, moaning as the sweet taste of blackcurrant filled her mouth. A strawberry one followed it, Lucy pausing after each one to sigh happily. They weren't as tasty as the ones provided for her at work, but they were enough to satisfy her. She swallowed sweet after delicious sweet, her stash steadily decreasing... </span></div></div>",

Groggily, she stumbled back to bed, flicking off the light in the kitchen and feeling her way back to her room. Her stomach gurgled ominously, which, she figured, was probably because she had eaten pretty much nothing but candy all day. This lifestyle really wasn't healthy. She would need to tone it down tomorrow. But God...that candy at work was so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing back into bed, Lucy rolled over onto her side, her stomach still making some very strange noises. The vast amount of sugar in her system kept her awake for about half an hour, but eventually, she managed to drift back to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy awoke at her normal time the next morning, relieved that she was finally getting into this new routine. She actually seemed to be getting up a little earlier each day, which was cool. After her near lateness on the first day, she was starting to feel more alert. She was also beginning to feel strangely excited to actually start her day and get to work, which was an odd feeling for her. She had never been anything resembling a workaholic before, and had been downright lazy in her past few jobs. This time, however, she didn't seem to have that much difficulty concentrating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Must be all the candy,\"</i> she thought to herself with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy slipped into her dress, which, much to her relief, fit as well as it had last night. It accentuated her curves, and drew more attention to her breasts and butt than she would have liked, but it was comfortable and there was no chance of losing any buttons or showing any cleavage. The neck was pretty high, so there was actually no cleavage at all. After the last two days, that was probably a good thing. Hopefully nobody saw her rather indecent look post-lunchtime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the office, Lucy noticed that two of the girls down her row had gone. Whether they were just late or not, she couldn't say, but they usually beat her in. On the other side of the aisle, the chubby looking row was already hard at work, popping candies into their mouths almost in sync.  Kat, waved at her as she reached her own desk and sat down, her dress tightening slightly around her increasingly hourglass-like figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" Kat called over. \"Hey, great work yesterday, Abigail said this morning that you did a really good job last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did?\" Lucy asked, somewhat surprised. \"Huh...I guess hard work does pay off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think some of the other new girls didn't work out though,\" Kat said, gesturing to the newly empty desks. \"Abigail said they had to let them go already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so soon?\" Lucy was shocked at the harshness of the company's sudden dismissal of their new employees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat shrugged. \"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy turned to a new pile of papers on her desk, which was thankfully much smaller than the one from yesterday. As she laid them out, she looked up at Kat again to ask her question, and saw her portly colleague tugging awkwardly at her shirt. Kat's buttons were looking even tighter than yesterday, with large gaps now appearing between each one. <i>She must be wearing quite an old outfit. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Lucy cast her eyes down to the bowl of candy on her desk, which seemed like it had tripled in size since Monday. <i>I should really cut back on the candy today...so just a few pieces...in moderation.</i> Lucy grabbed a handful and slowly started chewing as she got down to work...</span></div></div>",

Feel free to take the day off!<br>\r\n - Abigail</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy re-read the note, making sure she wasn't misreading something. She had earned herself a day off already? She had only been working for two days, even though yesterday felt like a week's worth of work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, in that case...\" Lucy pulled her candy bowl towards her. She had been treating herself to one of two pieces after every completed form, meaning she had barely made a dent in the small, sugary mountain. \"I think a small reward is due!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting a handful of candy in both hands, Lucy began to shovel the sweets into her mouth, her earlier restraint a thing of the past. She chewed maniacally, cheeks bulging with a mixture of chewed and unchewed candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmm... This stuff tastes way better than the candy I had last night!</i> Lucy thought as she swallowed a massive mouthful of gummy sweets. <i>Though I should really watch my intake... Don't want to end up like Kat!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced sideways at her work neighbour, who had taken a page from her book and was more interested in gorging herself than actually working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Though, I may already be headed down that path</i>, Lucy groaned as she plucked at her dress, which was beginning to tighten around her body. Subtly glancing sideways, she made sure Kat wasn't watching before grabbing her breasts and adjusting them, trying to make her outfit fit a little better. Unfortunately, no matter how hard she wiggled her chest and tugged at her dress, it continued to tighten. <i>God, what is up with this thing all of a sudden?! And why... is it always... my breasts and ass causing me trouble?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting in her seat, Lucy picked at her backside, becoming increasingly irritated with her outfit. And, in her irritated state, her candy intake increased, the redhead practically inhaling handful after handful as she struggled with her dress...</span></div></div>",

She had paused for lunch and managed to eat a tuna salad before immediately returning to her sweet, sweet candy. Eating anything else was starting to feel very jarring at this point, and her sugar cravings seemed to be there constantly. Lucy would have been more worried about this had she any time to think about her situation, but instead, she just switched right back to eating candy as soon as she had swallowed her last mouthful of greenery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to work, Lucy found herself struggling more and more with her dress. The figure hugging outfit had seemed perfectly form fitting this morning, and, if anything, had been a lot more comfortable than her skirt and shirt combination from yesterday, but now it was beginning to feel very constricting. It hugged her hips, breasts and ass so tightly that she had to keep sitting up straight to help her breathe properly. <i>God, this feels terrible. I wish I could just wear casual clothes here. </i> She tugged at her chest, trying to free up some room, but there was no give to the fabric of her dress at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached for a handful of candy to console herself, Lucy suddenly heard a loud <i>Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrip </i>from beneath her. <i>Oh crap, was that my dress? Did I just...rip my dress?! </i> Lucy pulled her hand back from the candy bowl in shock and turned her attention downwards, but found herself unable to find any tears. The dress looked as tight as ever, but didn't seem to have ripped anywhere that she could see...unless...the noise had come from beneath her. <i>Oh God, is my ass going to be on display?! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy wasn't sure what to do. If she got up and checked out her ass, everyone would see what had happened. She could maybe wait until everyone else had left? But how long would that be?! She grabbed a handful of candy and started stress eating. She couldn't believe she had actually outgrown her dress, seemingly within a single day. How the hell had she misjudged her choice of outfit this badly?! </span></div></div>",

Don't want her thinking I skipped work or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yeah, no problem!\" Lucy watched as Kat lumbered down the aisle, a hand gripping the sides of her skirt. <i>Looks like she's having clothing issues as well... No, it's just her! I'm sure my dress is completely fine!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling nervously to herself, Lucy helped herself to another couple of handfuls of candy before preparing to stand again. Just as she began to rise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, Lucy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling back into her seat, Lucy turned to face Abigail, who was stood in the aisle between her cubicle and Kat's. Much like her neighbour, Abigail's body nearly filled the entrance to her cubicle, though it was less her belly and more her curvy figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm looking for Kat,\" Abigail said, glancing at the empty seat behind her. \"I don't suppose you know where she went?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A-Ah, she said she was grabbing something from her car,\" Lucy replied, subtly picking at her dress. Her chest felt so incredibly constricted by the purple fabric...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's fine,\" Abigail nodded, glancing down at the clipboard held under an arm. \"When she gets back, could you reminder her that I need those testing forms on my desk within the next hour? I have need of them during my next meeting\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course!\" Lucy smiled until Abigail had vanished from sight. Letting out the anxious breath she had been holding, her dress tightened immensely, the fabric groaning as her bust bulged. <i>Crap, crap, crap, crap! Don't rip!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, her dress remained intact. Resisting the urge to let out another relieved breath, Lucy reached for another handful of candy. As she gobbled it down, her face turned a bright red as another *<i>Riiiiippppp</i>* echoed throughout her cubicle. Unlike the last, she immediately found the source of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fuck!\" Lucy hissed as she fingered the hole in her dress that had opened just above her breasts, revealing her deep, almost cavernous cleavage. \"Goddamn it! How the hell am I meant to hide this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forwards, Lucy froze as she heard another couple of rips. A hand flew to her right hip, where another hole showing the waistband of her painfully tight panties had opened. As she stroked her skin, she found a third hole, located directly above her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, I'm just exploding out of this thing! Why... What... I don't know what I meant to do!</i></span></div></div>",

She hadn't done any work since Abigail left, instead focused entirely on her increasingly dangerous clothing situation. She looked around in a panic, staring across the aisle at some of her colleagues, who, she was relieved to see, were too focused on their work to have heard the series of noisy tears coming from her position. She then looked to her right, staring at the smaller number of girls on her row...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, they were also squirming slightly in their chairs. The girl closest to her, who she hadn't even managed to speak with yet, was shoving handfuls of chocolate into her mouth and constantly adjusting her shirt, while the next girl down seemed to be chugging a large bottle of soda in between hard candies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell do I do? My tits are bursting out...I've got a boob window that was very clearly not on this dress this morning, and my ass is going to start ripping out of this thing soon enough. God, what the hell is happening to my body? These stupid, massive, tits...ugh...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than return to her work, Lucy found herself going for more candy. Her mind was racing, considering how she could hide herself away, leave without anyone seeing, repair her dress...anything to hide this disaster. Handfuls and handfuls of candy passed by her lips as she anxiously devoured every last piece of her table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another loud <i>Rrrrrrrrrrrrrip</i> came from beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God, what the fuck was that?! </i> Lucy thought as she scrambled to find the source of the latest tear. She looked down into her cavernous cleavage and was relieved to find that it didn't appear to have grown any larger, but a further inspection revealed that the source of the noise was beneath her breasts, along her thighs. The entire right side of her dress had ripped along the side, from her knee right up until the top of her thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, this isn't so bad...that's a look...you an buy dresses like this. It's fine. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy grabbed the candy bowl closest to her and upended the contents into her mouth, her cheeks bulging ominously with about twenty gummies...</span></div></div>",

Giggling anxiously, she sunk into her chair, an arm moving up to hide her new boob window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph, mmph...\" She swallowed the mess of sweets in her mouth, hiding a fruit-scented exhale behind her other hand. \"Sorry! Clipped the bowl with my hand, that's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the people staring at her all seemed to accept her excuse and returned to their work/candy, allowing Lucy to sit back up and lower her hand, revealing her cleavage to the world once again. Staring back into it, her arm reached out and clutched her final candy bowl, pulling it closer. As one hand explored her steadily eroding dress, the other worked tirelessly to try and calm herself down by ferrying handful after handful of hard candies to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Urgh, I much prefer the gummies</i>, Lucy thought as her mouth reached max capacity, her cheeks bulging madly with candies she couldn't immediately chew. <i>These are still great, though... Loads of flavour!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced to suck her sweets, Lucy soon froze as she heard another long *<b>RIIIPPP</b>* on her left. A hand flew to her hip, only to find a long hole from her knee to her hip that matched that on her right had opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck!</i> Lucy scratched the skin revealed by the new hole. <i>If this keeps up, I'm going to end up with no dress at all! I need to get out of here!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewing down on her now soft candy, she quickly swallowed and grabbed what was left in her bowl. Chucking them in her mouth, she got to her feet and started for the exit. Unfortunately, the problems started almost immediately for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>T-That was worryingly tight</i>, Lucy thought as she squeezed her hips through her cubicle exit. As she began to strode towards the exit, her face scrunched up as she heard a series of rips from either side of her body. <i>Goddamn it! I can't even walk without destroying this stupid thing!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing a few candies, her boob window widened slightly, causing her to turn a bright red. A few steps later, and there was a worrying rip from behind her. Moving a hand behind her, she found that there was indeed a hole over her ass, and not a small one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm almost there!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the exit came into view, Lucy swallowed the last of her candies. She could both feel and hear her dress groaning at this point, and just hoped it lasted until she was safely in her car...</span></div></div>",

With a sigh of relief, she passed the exit to the office. Thankfully, nobody had stopped her on her way out; she just prayed she could leave the building without being seen by anyone else, but that was probably a little hopeful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rrrrrip! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy didn't stop to check where the latest tear had emanated from, but she did feel some of the pressure around her chest relieve itself, so she suspected that the upper half of her dress was not falling apart. Picking up her pace, she began to jog, hoping she could reach her car before any more of the fabric gave way. Unfortunately, this only sped up the process. As Lucy's breasts bounced up and down with her new pace, the seams of her dress started splitting much more quickly. The tearing noise was so quiet this time that Lucy didn't really notice it, but she could feel her dress stretching apart ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding a corner, she reached the staircase to the car park and darted down the steps. With each one, her chest heaved and bounced, her swollen breasts jiggling up and down. Her enlarged ass swayed from side to side, causing a little tear each time as her dress struggled in vain to contain her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please let me make it in time...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer keys in hand, she hurriedly crossed the - thankfully empty - car park and pressed the button on her key fob. She had never been happier to hear the beep of her car doors unlocking and lights flashing. Darting across to the car, she released her grip on her dress, lowering both of her hands as the dress ripped even further. Without Lucy's hands holding it together, it's destruction escalated quickly, her breasts surging forward and bulging through the now enormous boob window, her bra now fully visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the door open, Lucy practically jumped inside the car and sat down in the seat, breathing a sigh of relief which, in one, sudden, motion, caused her dress to emit one final <i><b>RRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP </b></i> before it completely tore away from her body. She screamed in shock, unprepared for her final loss of dignity, as the seams of her skin tight outfit split apart completely. Her breasts exploded forward, practically overflowing her undersized bra and completely filling her line of vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in her underwear, the tattered remains of her dress wedged underneath her large, round, butt, Lucy could only stare into her cavernous cleavage, amazed she had ended up in this humiliating situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the fuck is happening to me? How did I just...explode out of a dress?! My tits are gigantic!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy raised her hands to her sizeable breasts, cupping them from underneath and feeling their weight. A soft moan escaped her lips as they stirred within her bra, her nipples almost overflowing the lacy cups...</span></div></div>",

Like, right now. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for her bag, Lucy froze as she heard two snaps, one after the other, followed by a worrying breeze across her chest. Returning to a sitting position, she stared straight ahead, reluctant to look down. After a minute, she closed her eyes and groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, I hope that wasn't what I think it was...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, her worst fears were confirmed. Her gargantuan breasts completely hid her lap from view, forcing her to lean forwards to look past them, only for her to see her bra sitting in her lap, a clean rip between the lacy cups. Silently swearing, she cupped her naked tits, shivering slightly as her fingers brushed over her nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"They're so fucking big!\" The words burst from her mouth, the incredibly curvy redhead unable to keep silent any longer. \"And so goddamn heavy without a bra... God, what the fuck even happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing her arms to fall to her sides, she discovered the source of the second snap. Grabbing her underwear, which had torn down the right side, Lucy growled, her anxiety at suddenly having all her clothes explode off turning to anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What the hell is this place doing to me?!\" She shouted, gripping her steering wheel so tightly her knuckles turned white. \"Ever since I started working here, nothing has fit me! It's gotta be something, but what?! Think, Lucy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on all the things she had done since working there, Lucy eventually hit on something. Something she had eaten every single day, something that everybody in the office was eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"T-The candy?\" Saying it out loud sounded absurd, but it was the only thing she could think of. \"God, this is insane... I need to get out of here, get myself dressed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching back towards her bag, she retrieved her keys. Sinking down in her seat, she turned her car on and, with a cautious look around, started for home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Gah, that was close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming her door shut behind her, Lucy let out a long sigh. The drive home had been fine, except for every time she had gotten stopped at traffic lights. As soon as she reached her apartment complex, however, everything started going wrong. Forced to sprint across the path, she had almost tripped when her breasts smacked into her jaw. Then she realised she had forgotten her keys, forcing her to return to her car. And then, when she was finally in the building, the postman suddenly appeared. Thankfully, he failed to notice her, even though her tits slapped together whenever she ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, I'm fine now... Completely safe, nobody can see me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding into the living room, Lucy...</span></div></div>",

She was still in something of a state of shock after what had happened. <i>How the hell did I rip out of everything? Did anyone see me? I don't think so...I was so careful...but what if they did? Oh God...this is humiliating. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying to her room, she found herself stopping for a moment to examine her reflection for the first time. She felt her jaw drop as she caught sight of herself in the glass; her breasts looked huge, bigger than she had ever seen them. She turned to the side and examined her butt next, marvelling at how wide and round it was now. She ran her hand over one of the cheeks, and found it to be surprisingly firm, like she had been doing squats each day...but that wasn't the case. At least it wasn't fat, which was something, but why was her body changing so rapidly? She thought back to the candy again...an allergic reaction, maybe? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back to her breasts, Lucy hefted one in each hand, feeling their weight. Like her butt, they felt perfectly firm too, though heavy. They were completely round, perfectly balanced, with no hint of them sagging. She jiggled them a little, up and down, watching them bounce. A small moan escaped her lips as her fingers brushed against her nipples. Were they always this...sensitive? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy had an overwhelming urge to squeeze them, and tightened her grip on her boobs, eliciting another moan, and a wave of pleasure. Stumbling back slightly, she let go of her huge, sensitive tits and held out her arm as she fell back onto the bed, her boobs jiggling slightly as her ass hit the duvet. \"Urgh...they feel...so...so good...\" She mumbled aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the mirror, she again took stock of her body and found herself groping her breasts. Her legs trembled, but now that she was sitting down, she was able to keep going without becoming light headed, her hands kneading and squeezing her enhanced assets. She panted noisily as she found herself growing more and more aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So big...they're so big...big...big fucking tits...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to keep her thoughts on anything else, she released her left hand and plunged it into her crotch as she felt herself grow increasingly wet. All the time, her attention stayed focused on her reflection. Her body looked amazing. Her breasts were incredible. Her waist small and toned, her ass almost as big as her tits. God, she looked sexier than she had ever been in her entire life. Moaning, she kept furiously fingering her pussy with one hand, while her other groped and squeezed her massive, bulging boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lucy let out a long, almost animalistic, moan as she came, collapsing onto her back with a sigh, her tits obscuring her view of anything else...as she came back down to Earth, she suddenly realised she hadn't alerted work to her absence, she was still naked and she would probably have difficulty squeezing into anything else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap,\" she sighed, realising her situation was still rather complicated.</span></div></div>",

That dress had been the biggest thing she owned. If she had managed to completely demolish that just by wearing it, there was no way she'd be able to squeeze herself into anything else she owned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"God, this is... <i>Urgh...</i> so... <i>Mmm...</i> weird!\" Lucy gasped, her hands still idly fiddling with her body. Pulling them away, they tested by her sides for only a few seconds before they returned to her enhanced body. \"O-Oh, this feels so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her fingers tickled her damp pussy, Lucy jumped to her feet, almost stumbling in the process. No matter how hard she tried, all she could think about was her glorious, sexy body. Her massive breasts, her slim waist, her fat yet firm ass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I... I need... I need to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands began to grope her tits again, pulling a long moan from her lips. Before her other hand delved into her aching womanhood, she started forwards, managing to navigate her increasingly lust-addled body to her bathroom. Grabbing a towel, she quickly wrapped it around her bust, discovering that it took the entire towel to even do so. With her breasts hidden, her hand fell away, control over it gradually returning to her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What is happening to me?!\" The words finally burst forth from the curvaceous redhead. \"My ass and tits have nearly tripled in size, I feel hornier for myself than I've ever felt in my life... Whatever's in that candy, it's... Well, it can't be legal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her urged barely controlled by a towel that just about hid her breasts from view, Lucy returned to her room. Grabbing her phone, she quickly located Abigail's number, which was given to her as a part of her welcome email, and dialed it. It rang a few times before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi, Abigail?\" Lucy asked nervously, taking a seat on her bed, her face wrinkling slightly as she felt the damp sheets on her bare ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. And this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's Lucy from the factory,\" Lucy explained. \"I just wanted to let you know that I'm... not feeling the greatest, I guess is the best way of putting it, and I decided to head home rather than spread... whatever I've got\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's fine, Lucy,\" Abigail responded. \"However, if you feel like unwell in the future, make sure to personally let me know before leaving the factory, okay? It's just in case we have a fire drill or an actual fire, we need to know who's here and who isn't\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O-Of course, that makes sense,\" Lucy whimpered quietly as her hand adjusted her towel, brushing against her breast in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anyway, take a few days to recover. Don't force yourself back if you don't feel like it,\" Abigail continued. \"Hope you feel better soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"T-Thanks!\" Lucy gasped, quickly hanging up before she let out another animalistic moan. She felt so goddamn horny, she needed another release... \"N-No, not yet... I need to order... new clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her hand away, she stumbled towards her laptop and collapsed into the chair before it. Logging in, she located her favourite clothing website and began to scour it for new clothes that would both fit her and look good at the same time. After a couple of minutes, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"These look atrocious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy frowned at the clothing options before her. They would all fit her, hopefully, but nothing looked even remotely nice. Grey bras, grey panties, grey tops and grey pants... Everything was a full shade of grey! The most colourful thing had a splash of white on it, but it was still grey! With a sigh, she glanced at the clothes she usually ordered. They were bright, they were colourful, but they most definitely wouldn't fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could always improvise</i>, Lucy thought as she looked at the two separate options before her. <i>Resize them myself...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Lucy decided on...</span></div></div>",

Not only was she managing to keep to keep her candy intake under control, only allowing herself a single handful for each form she filled out, but she was making good pace as well. The same, however, couldn't be said for her struggling neighbour, who spent more time anxiously fingering the buttons on her brown shirt and pinching at her skirt than she was working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't help but feel a little bad for her</i>, Lucy admitted to herself as she shifted her attention from the document in front of her to her computer screen. <i>She looks just about ready to explode free of those clothes!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Lucy's fingers began to tap away at her keyboard, her prediction came true. From behind her, there was a number of pops, followed by the sounds of small objects ricocheting around a small area. After a few seconds of silence, Kat cursed quietly. Lucy, curious about the sudden sounds, was tempted to turn and see what had just happened but decided otherwise. Before she could return to what she was doing, she heard somebody hiss her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lucy... Hey, Lucy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh-huh? What's up, Kat?\" Lucy finished what she was typing and spun her chair, only to be met by a blushing, nearly half-naked Kat. Her pudgy arms were folded tightly over her chest, soft flesh bulging over and under them, while her hefty gut quivered slightly, the orb filling her lap. \"A-Ah... That's what's all that noise was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yeah...\" Kat glanced around nervously. \"H-Have you got a jacket or anything like that? I don't really want to call Abigail over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry, Kat, I've only got what I'm wearing,\" Lucy apologized with a sad smile. \"Is there a lost and found? Maybe I could find something for you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, I don't think there is...\" Kat sighed heavily. \"Guess I'm going to have to let Abigail know about this. Thanks anyway, Lucy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final sad smile, Lucy returned to her work. Behind her, she could hear Kat on the phone, presumably explaining what had happened to her. It didn't take long for Abigail and another girl, probably an assistant, to arrive at her desk. The trio talked quietly amongst themselves, Lucy unable to hear them properly. After a few moments, the assistant produced a large towel, Kat eagerly snatching it from her and wrapping it around herself. Once covered, she followed Abigail, who paused briefly to smile down at Lucy, out of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wonder what that was all about</i>, Lucy couldn't help but wonder. <i>Abigail didn't seem at all surprised that Kat burst out of her shirt. Is it a common occurrence around here or something? Well, given the size of some of the women on the other side of the room, I wouldn't be surprised... And was it just me, or did Abigail seem more interested in my chest than me? Maybe it's more noticeable than I thought...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that lingering thought, Lucy put her head down and got back to work, her pace and candy intake both steady...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time lunch came around, Lucy had made quite a dent in her work, suppressed her desire for more candy and managed to avoid accumulating any more files. All in all, it was a much less stressful day than yesterday, for which she was grateful. As she rose to grab her lunch from the refrigerator, she suddenly became aware that Kat's desk was still empty. Had she been back at all following her wardrobe malfunction earlier? Maybe she'd gone home to get some new clothes? <i>Poor Kat. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy walked to the fridge and took out her pre-prepared sandwich; it wasn't terribly exciting, but the food in the canteen was crazily huge, and she really didn't want to make a habit of dining on their jumbo sized burgers and fries every day. As she returned to her desk, she noticed Abigail leaning over the receptionist and making a few marks on a piece of paper. She lurked for a moment before Abigail turned around spotted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Lucy!\" Abigail greeted, though not quite as cheerfully as usual. \"Can I help you with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just grabbing my lunch,\" Lucy said. \"But...um...I was actually wondering if Kat was okay? Last time I saw her she'd had a bit of an issue with her shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, poor thing,\" Abigail said, though her tone was less than sympathetic. \"Shrunk her clothes in the wash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty clear that Kat had definitely not shrunk anything in the wash lately, but Lucy decided it was best not to challenge her boss on that. \"Yeah, it happens I guess...\" she trailed off. \"So is she coming back? She's been gone all morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kat and I had a little talk this morning...I'd been meaning to speak to her for a while actually,\" Abigail said, seeming half distracted and casting her eye back over the piece of paper in her hand. \"I've had her moved to another department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was surprised, and also a little sad. Kat had been the only person she had really spoken to since she arrived, and the two had been getting along pretty well. \"Oh, good for her. Which department?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you always ask so many questions?\" Abigail suddenly snapped, her face darkening. \"I suggest you concentrate on your own work!\" With that, Abigail turned on her heel and handed the piece of paper she had been fiddling with back to the receptionist. She turned away from Lucy and marched from the room, muttering something under her breath about her bosses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful,\" the girl on reception, whose name tag Lucy could now see read \"Jessica\", cautioned. \"She's got a nasty streak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy would never have suspected; Abigail had always seemed so nice. <i>I wonder why she wouldn't tell her where Kat was? Have they fired her or something? I know she had an embarrassing moment but that seems pretty harsh...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy returned to her desk, ate her sandwich, and went back to work, her eyes occasionally drifting to the empty space left by Kat...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Still no Kat...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy stared the empty cubicle once occupied by her only friend. All the stuff that had been strewn across the top of the desk was gone, the filing cabinets were empty, some IT guys had spent the majority of the morning wiping the computer... It was like they, whoever they were, wanted to erase any traces of Kat having ever worked there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if I'll get a new neighbour</i>, Lucy wondered, spinning her chair back around. Gripping her pen, she leaned forwards, a hand scooping up a handful of candy before she began to write. Despite her keeping an extremely close eye on her intake, her dress still seemed a tad tighter. Thankfully, it still fit and she wasn't showing off any parts she didn't want to, but she still couldn't help but wonder why her clothes suddenly refused to fit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, Lucy, there you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy paused, a familiar voice at the entrance to her cubicle. Before facing the owner, she chewed frantically, the candies she had been provided with today being slightly chewier. Once she had finished, she spun around, a bright smile on her face that gradually faded as she found herself facing Abigail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, uh... H-Hi, Abigail!\" Lucy greeted her boss nervously, unsure of how to act. Before yesterday, she liked Abigail. She wasn't too strict, always willing to help... But after her sudden outburst and Jessica's warning, she wasn't sure what to think anymore. \"Can... Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No need to be so formal, Lucy,\" Abigail smiled, though it looked more forced than anything. \"I'm here to apologize after yesterday. My bosses... Well, they weren't too pleased with me suddenly reassigning Kat. So they decided to take it out on me, leading to me taking it out on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, it's fine!\" Lucy gave her boss a genuine smile. \"I was just curious about Kat. She's the only person I really spoke to here, so I suppose I wanted to know were she was. I don't suppose you could let me know her new department?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail's eyes flashed dangerously for a moment, forcing Lucy to shrink back slightly. Her threatening look didn't last long, thankfully, as her boss sighed heavily, her gaze falling to the floor. Lucy followed it, brow furrowing as she stared at Abigail's midriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is she... Did she put on weight?</i> Lucy wondered, eyeing the barely noticeable curve to Abigail's belly. <i>I don't remember her belly being... Well, curved! It was always flat, wasn't it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anyway, uh...\" Abigail scratched the back of her head. \"You'll be seeing a bit more of me. My bosses decided to... demote me for not consulting them about Kat. I'll be taking over her cubicle, doing her work, eating her candy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail didn't look too pleased at the prospect of that last one, though Lucy hadn't a clue why. The candy here was exceptionally tasty, after all, and you didn't even have to pay for it! If anything, you got paid to eat it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh, I guess that's all I've got for you...\" Abigail shrugged, turning to her new cubicle. \"If you need anything, please, feel free to ask\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy watched for a few moments as Abigail shuffled into her cubicle. As she sat, her top inched up, revealing a tiny band of puffy flesh that only reinforced Lucy's idea that her former boss was indeed putting on weight. Spinning back to her desk, Lucy got back to work...</span></div></div>",

Or is there something else I need to do? Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering about her next move, Lucy gripped the arms of her chair and adjusted her position, which hadn't changed since she had sat down and was now extremely uncomfortable. As she did so, her thumb just so happened to brush against her belly, Lucy pausing as it did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did... Did my stomach always feel this firm?</i> She wondered, peering over her breasts at her stomach. After her recent binge, she had expected her normally flat midriff to have grown slightly. She had expected a slight curve to it at most, it was only candy, after all. Instead, she found her hands gripping a stuffed potbelly that pressed against her shirt, giving the blue garment a noticeable bulge. <i>O-Okay... Maybe I ate a bit more than I expected...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nEven so, the shock at her new belly was brief. She had just finished eating, so given a few hours, it should shrink away to nothing. At the very worst, she'd be left a thin layer of pudge, nothing a couple hours of hard exercise couldn't get rid off. And besides, it would have no affect whatsoever on her  work performance! Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still don't know what I meant to be doing...</i> Lucy sighed in boredom, a curious hand still inspecting her new belly. <i>Wait, maybe Kat knows what I meant to do...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Kat, right?\" Lucy turned to her cubicle opposite her, where the chubby Kat appeared to be hard at work. Upon hearing her name, she tried to spin her chair to face Lucy, only for her considerable gut to stop her. With a sheepish smile, she pushed her chair back and spun around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's me!\" Kat replied happily. \"And you're Lucy, right? Gotta say, you've got a serious work ethic! Never seen somebody finish that manual on their first day! It normally takes them the whole week at the very least!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I had the whole week to finish that stupid thing?</i> Lucy cast an irritated glance over her shoulder at the offending manual. \"A-Anyway, now that I've finished it, what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you normally do what Abigail tells you to do,\" Kat began to explain, one of her soft hands reaching out to scoop up some candy from her own desk. \"But seeing as you've finished what she asked... Guess you've got some time to yourself! If you wanted to take a look around, I'm sure she wouldn't hold it against you. Lunch is also coming up soon, and the cafeteria makes some great food. Or you could just wait here for her to her back. She's normally very good at making the rounds, checking up on us, you know? Plus, I wouldn't mind a bit of a distraction...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy mulled over the options Kat had just presented her with, all of them equally interesting. She had only really seen her office at the moment and, judging by the size of the factory, there had to be more rooms. Though lunch was kinda tempting, despite her earlier meal. And Kat seemed incredibly eager to talk as well...</span></div></div>",

It was pretty much lunch time already, but Kat seemed pretty studious and didn't seem to want to leave early. She returned to her desk and shuffled some papers around, not really wanting to start any proper work until she had taken a break. As she sat back in her chair, her hand reached for what was left of her candy. Kat was still working when she looked over, so she shrugged and scooped the remains of the bowl into her mouth, her cheeks bulging with what seemed to be gummy worms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy hadn't heard Kat approach over the sound of her own ardent chewing, but she found herself looking up at her chubby co-worker, who was standing over her desk, her circular tummy brushing the edge of the workstation. Lucy nodded, her cheeks bulging. \"Mmm hmm,\" she said, not quite ready to swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy got up from her desk, the slight bulge of her stomach still visible from earlier, and began to walk with Kat towards the cafeteria. It was, remarkably, right next door to their office, so the journey was a short one. Whatever they were cooking smelled delicious, and as Lucy followed Kat inside, she could see they were serving Burgers today, and they were gigantic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, that can't be all for one person, right?\" Lucy asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat seemed puzzled by the question. \"Well...of course it is, did you think they were going to cut that burger in half?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's bigger than my plates at home!\" Lucy protested, gesturing to the burgers sitting behind the lunch trays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a round faced, smiling lunch lady serving them, who didn't really look much older than Lucy herself. In front of her, enormous, cheese filled burgers sat on display, ready to be scooped up by the workers, and beside them, sat what appeared to be very sweet looking cakes of all shapes and sizes. Lucy could hardly believe what she was seeing. This was way, way over the top for a workplace lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she followed Kat's example and grabbed a tray. The lunch girl placed the huge, greasy cheeseburger on top of it, and Lucy, against her better judgement, followed that up by picking a large piece of cake with pink frosting. There was no way she was going to be able to eat all this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Kat crossed to an empty table and sat opposite one another. Kat eagerly bit down into her burger, a soft moan escaping her lips as cheese oozed from the sides and fell onto her plate. Lucy had to admit, it looked good. She drew the burger to her mouth, her jaw barely stretching around the bun, then took a bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...mmmmf...\" Lucy moaned aloud, unable to stop herself. \"Man that's a good burger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you,\" Kat said. \"The food here is so tasty. Almost as good as the candy...hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy went in for another bite...</span></div></div>",

I'm so full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlumping heavily on her seat, Lucy hid a meaty belch behind one hand and cradled her poor, stuffed belly with the other. She had never, in all her life, eaten something as big as that burger. Each bite had been so tantalizingly delicious that she just had to have another, leading to her eventually gobbling down the entire thing. And then, just when she thought she couldn't possibly stomach anything else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, you got the new candy frosted cake!\" Kat noticed, excitedly cutting a piece of her own cake with a fork. \"You've got to tell me what it tastes like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Urgh, I don't think I could possibly eat anything else...\" Lucy groaned in response, both hands now lightly caressing her belly in an attempt to lessen some of the pressure within it. \"You... You can have it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the plate towards her gluttonous dining companion, Lucy was surprised to find it swiftly pushed back towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on, it's both your first day of having lunch here and that kind of cake being served!\" Kat responded through a mouthful of her own cake. \"What if they never serve it again? You'll regret not trying it then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy groaned weakly before forcing herself forwards. Her stuffed spherical belly oozed atop her lap, pale flesh bulging through the gaps between the buttons. Yet her attention was elsewhere, namely the limited time cake before her. Pulling the plate towards her, she gripped her fork and carefully cut it into small, bite sized pieces. Spearing one, she lifted it to her mouth and reluctantly dropped it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"T-This is...\" Lucy chewed slowly, savouring her first bite. The cake itself was moist and so soft, while the icing tasted exactly like the candies she had been treating herself to all day. Despite being stuffed to her absolute limits, Lucy had another piece. And then another. Before she knew it, the cake had vanished, save for a few crumbs and a small bit of icing, and the pressure in her belly had returned, forcing her to slump in her seat. \"T-That was... a mistake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Was it nice?\" Kat asked, polishing off her own cake. She smiled at Lucy, seemingly oblivious to her plight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Absolutely... delicious, urgh...\" Lucy managed to moan in response, eyes staring over her bust at her bulging belly. The buttons on her shirt seemed ready to explode off, not that she would complain. The garment was only adding to the tightness around her midriff. \"E-Excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to cope with it any longer, her sluggish fingers worked to undo a few buttons, allowing her belly to surge forth. It almost filled her entire lap, something that would've shocked her, had she not been near comatose after her lunch. With another groan, she slumped further into her chair, ready for bed. Unfortunately...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ready to get back to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat beamed down at her, not even fazed by her meal, which was comparable in size to her own. Extending a helpful hand, she helped Lucy to her feet and escorted her back to her desk. Once the bulging redhead was comfortably sat in her seat, Kat returned to her desk, leaving Lucy alone with her churning belly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy sank down into her office chair, slouching tiredly so that her bloated stomach was just about hidden from view. Not that she thought anyone would have minded; the other side of the office ranged from curvy to chubby, and each of them seemed to have had an equally huge lunch. Unlike Lucy's flat stomach, however, their larger bellies seemed to have less trouble digesting their meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Urgh...all that meat...and cheese...and bread...I need something sweet. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she had claimed she couldn't eat another bite, candy was different. It didn't count as real food, or so Lucy reasoned as she spotted her refilled bowl at the edge of the desk. Sitting up slightly, her belly bulging against her shirt buttons, she reached for the bowl, dragged it closer, and slumped back down. Some of the pressure was starting to subside now, so she quickly redid the buttons she had unfastened post-burger, though they were still rather right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No more lunches here...that's for sure. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy popped a sour gummy into her mouth and returned to her work. She still felt sluggish and full, and it was difficult to really concentrated for the rest of the afternoon, but somehow, she managed. The sugar from the candy balanced out her general tiredness, at least, but she could feel herself losing interest, and all she wanted to do was go home, change into her sweats, and curl up on the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was a few hours away yet, so she tiredly carried on with her work, yawning between snacks and suppressing the occasional belch. Unfortunately for Lucy, her stomach didn't really seem to be deflating as time went on, and her buttons were still pulling tight across her bulging tummy for much of the afternoon. As her eyes started to grow heavy, she forced herself to sit up straight in her chair in case she fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she rubbed her eyes, looked around, and decided she needed to take a break. Rising from her desk, she sucked in her belly as best she could, smoothed a hand over her shirt, and walked to the bathroom. Her stomach seemed to churn and bounce as she went, her normally toned, trim abs still bloated and rounding out. Still holding her breath, she let out a gentle exhale as she approached the ladies room, before ducking inside and breathing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the mirror, Lucy watched her stomach slowly expand back out like an inflating balloon, pushing up against her buttons and pushing them apart slightly. \"Ughhh...\" she groaned, turning to the side and looking at her food baby. \"I feel huge. Stupid giant burgers...and cake...and candy...URRRRRRRRRRP!\" The sudden belch shocked Lucy so much that she jumped back a little, covering her mouth with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to her reflection, she slowly lifted her shirt up, exposing her lightly tanned stomach, which stuck out considerably. She couldn't recall ever looking this full in her life. For emphasis, she pushed her stomach out as far as it would go, then laughed to herself. \"God, I look pregnant...ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her shirt back down, Lucy went to the toilet, adjusting her clothes, and walked back to her desk, where she sat back down, sank into her chair, and tried to concentrate on her work once again...</span></div></div>",

Since graduating from college, she had enjoyed a pretty leisurely summer; waking up late, doing what she wanted and enjoying some downtime. But after all her money dried up, she had started to get a little bored. She had studied Bio-Chemistry at college, which had completely exhausted her, and she had promised herself she would travel once she was finished studying. She was determined to stick to this goal, so had put off her professional career for the time being, wanting to make enough money to sustain her travelling before getting a \"real job\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was way, way overqualified for the job at the candy store, but the money was amazingly good. This new candy company obviously had great faith in their business model, because they had been offering practically five times as much in wages as any other store in town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson had been given her uniform, which consisted of a blue skirt, shirt and blazer. The skirt and blazer were dark blue, while the shirt was a much lighter shade, but still, Allyson felt it was a little too much blue. For the money they were paying her, however, she was happy to wear anything they wanted. The uniform fitted nicely, having been measured to her exact specifications during her interview. While Allyson was often complimented on her cute, pretty features, she had always felt that she had quite an unremarkable figure; she was slim, but not skinny, and never really seemed to gain or lose any weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tied her auburn hair in a ponytail and grabbed her packed lunch, a salad. As she stepped into the hallway, she saw her room mate, Sandy emerge from her bedroom, rubbing her eyes and stretching. Sandy had been a friend of Allyson's through college, and had suggested they get a place together when they both graduated. Sandy worked at a clothes store in the mall downtown, but was hoping to get a job as an artist. Sandy was very much a goth; with pale skin and long, black hair that reached down to her waist. She had a nose and lip piercing, and several tattoos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck today,\" Sandy yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, should be easy enough,\" Allyson replied. \"Hopefully it's not too boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy yawned again. \"Just think of that sweet, sweet money,\" she said. \"You'll be out of there quick enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson hoped that was true. She was looking forward to the money, but not so much the work. Hopefully, the store would be busy enough that she didn't get bored. She hated not being stimulated or having nothing to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at the store, she entered through the back entrance and saw two of her new colleagues just ahead of her. Unlike Allyson, these girls were wearing green and pink uniforms. They looked to be around the same age as her, and turned as one to smile at her as she approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your first day too?\" The girl in green asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Allyson replied. She really wasn't great at meeting new people, but decided she had better make the effort. \"I'm Allyson.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tara,\" the girl in pink replied. She had short, cropped, blonde hair and a cute face. Her figure was snugly packed into the pink outfit, with the material accentuating her prominent breasts and bubble butt. \"This is Carla.\" She gestured to the girl in green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla was of Latino heritage, and had long, dark hair. Her figure was more curvy than Tara's, though Allyson had to admit to being a little jealous of how good both girls looked in their outfits. Carla gave Allyson a smile and a wave, but otherwise seemed more interested in her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just waiting for the boss,\" Tara said. \"I'm so excited to start work, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Allyson said, with less enthusiasm than she had intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door ahead of them swung open, and a a woman, perhaps in her early 30's, stepped through. She was wearing a blue pantsuit not dissimilar to Allyson's own, and wearing a large pair of thick glasses. Allyson was struck by how curvy she was; her hour glass figure perfectly filling out her uniform. \"Girls, I see you have all arrived bright and early. That's good to see! Welcome to your first day at Expansive Candy. I hope you'll enjoy being part of our expansive family. I'm Sarah, and I'll be your general Manager. I'll be on hand to answer any questions you might have, but hopefully you girls will find it simple enough. Let's get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah led them into the main store front; it was brightly decorated, with purple and pink walls on all sides, and shelves stocked to the rafters with all sorts of candy. Allyson found herself impressed by the sheer quantity of products they had on offer, though she found herself wondering whether they had overdone it slightly...was the demand for candy really that high in this town? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you all know about the many benefits of working for EC,\" Sarah went on. \"Paid vacations, health insurance, dental plan...oh and of course, free candy samples. You'll find a pre-prepared bag waiting for each of you in the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla didn't seem to be listening, instead swiping past something on her phone. Sarah noticed this, and suddenly dropped her affable, friendly facade. \"Excuse me, Carla, but you'll have to put that phone away. Absolutely no phones allowed on the shop floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever,\" Carla grumbled, shoving the phone into a pocket on her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately brightening back up, Sarah continued with her induction. By the time this had finished, she had shown them how to open up, use the cash register, the card machines and where the store room was. It all seemed simply enough to Allyson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, without further ado, it's time for the grand opening!\" Sarah said, gesturing to the doors. \"Allyson, you man the till. Tara, please stay on the door and greet our customers. Carla, you restock the shelves as fast as you can, can't have our customers wanting for candy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson wasn't expecting anything to be restocked on day one, but when she looked through the store window, she suddenly noticed a queue amassing outside. \"Huh...looks like our first customers are already here,\" she said, taking her place behind the cash register. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wonderful! They must have got the free samples we sent out,\" Sarah said, clasping her hands together excitedly. \"Tara, the doors if you please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded and put on her most friendly customer serving face as she opened up the doors. She barely had time to say hello before the crowd outside poured into the shop in a frenzy, nearly knocking her aside. One thing was for sure, Allyson's day was certainly not going to be boring. Before she knew it, customers were dumping handfuls of candy on the desk and thrusting wads of money in her face...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her reservations about the excitement of this kind of work, Allyson's day flew by. The customers kept filtering in to the store, apparently enticed by some free samples EC had sent out to a portion of Spring Falls. Allyson wouldn't have thought people would be this desperate for candy, of all things, but apparently they were now hooked. That suited Allyson just fine; the better business was, the more chance she had of getting paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, Allyson's cheeks were aching from how much she had smiled at people all day. Sarah had kept an eye on all the new employees, giving them encouraging pep talks and thumbs ups throughout their first shifts. Allyson appreciated the enthusiasm she had for their work, but her constant cheeriness was exhausting at times. Finally, the doors closed for the day, despite there being a few more people waiting outside, who Tara had to politely turn away. Allyson breathed a sigh of relief, eager to have a rest. Her feet were killing her. She just wanted to go home and collapse on the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done girls, a very profitable day, all owing to your hard work!\" Sarah congratulated them, beaming with pride. \"Tomorrow, we'll switch things around, so that Allyson can restock, Tara can be on the till and Carla can meet and greet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swell,\" Carla said sarcastically, producing her phone from her pocket again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah ignored the comment. \"Now then, I'll close up here, you girls get yourselves home. Hopefully, tomorrow won't be quite so tiring for us. Oh, and don't forgot your free candy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson, Tara and Carla all left the store front and walked back through the office, where they saw three huge bags of candy laid out in a row, each one practically half the size of each girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she wasn't kidding about the free samples,\" Tara said, smiling. \"I thought it would just be a pack or a candy bar or something. These are huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla grabbed her bag and headed out. \"Whatever, we earned it. See you tomorrow guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her work ethic isn't that great,\" Tara observed. \"This is easy work for the money they pay us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Allyson said. \"I guess if business keeps up the way it was today, they can afford it though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara and Allyson grabbed their free samples, said goodnight, and headed home. Allyson found herself being weighed down by the bag as she bundled it into her car. She wasn't even a big fan of candy, but it seemed rude to just leave it behind. When she finally got home, kicked off her shoes and took off her blazer, immediately staggering to the couch and collapsing with a content sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy, still dressed in her own work outfit; a much more casual looking black t-shirt and jeans, was sitting in the chair opposite, watching some sort of true crime documentary. \"Hey, how was your first day?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiring,\" Allyson said, laying her head back. \"You wouldn't believe how busy it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People like candy that much, huh?\" Sandy laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently so,\" Allyson replied. \"Got some free samples if you want some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy looked over to the huge bag that had been dumped by the door...</span></div></div>",

The auburn head girl opened the bag up and turned it into a faux-bowl. The duo gasped at the collection of confectioneries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome were in their own little, smaller bags, each containing three or four candies. Others were single wrapped. And a few of them were in some sort of translucent wrappings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Sandy noted with actual enthusiasm. Allyson remembered she had a hidden sweet tooth. \"She gave you all of this to eat, by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she said I could share them with friends...\" Allyson waved her hand around for a bit. \"So what do you think we should have first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy was about to place her hand on a piece but stopped herself. She got up, while Allyson looked at her, and soon came back out of the kitchen.In her hands was a whiteboard-roulette spinner, a novelty toy the girls had won in a college game. She placed it down onto the table and walked back off again. In her hands she came walking back out with eight coloured cards, with some effort, she made room to place the cards down onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with all this?\" Allyson questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy smiled back at her friend. \"A little game. we take turns spinning the wheel, and then eat whatever candy is placed there.\" Sarah explained. She maneuvered bundles of sweets in front of the colored paper. Sandy appeared to be placing them in an order,which was: chocolate, hard, soft, sour, sweet, crunchy, weird,sticky-which was <i>everything </i>but chocolate, and gum. Finished, she sat back down onto her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a game my siblings and I used to do when we were younger. We have all these sweets for ourselves, why don't we have some fun as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson smiled at that suggestion. \"Alright, who goes first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pooped.\" Sandy laid down onto her back. \"You go take a whirl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson nodded and gave a spin...</span></div></div>",

Allyson wasn't much of a fan of hard candies though, she hoped she got chocolate first. The auburn hair girl looked down onto the prone form of Sandy, she appeared with her eyes closed. Allyson wiggled her fingers for a moment and was about to spin again, but was stopped by Sandy's hand reaching out to her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.Nah. Let me see.\" Sandy got up and looked at the wheel's arrow. She gazed at Allyson and gave her a quick 'tsk' of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No spin-backsees Allyson, you eat what the arrow tells you.\" Sandy admonished the girl for what she was about to do. Allyson sighed and looked over her options. She touched each candy and stuck her tongue out in disappointment, not wanting to place one in her mouth. With puppy-dog eyes she looked over to Sarah who yawned as if to say '<i>not going to work on me</i>', Allyson sighed once more and tapped her fingers down onto the hard sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to choose, what to choose.\" She mumbled.A flourish of the candy factory had given each of the hard candies a symbol to indicate it was such. The name of the candy was stylistically written in a blocky, rigid font.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Kinda cute that they did this for all of them, makes them both eye-catching and easily place able as a EC crafted candy...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to pick or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.

The current consumer didn't mind exaggerating her consumption. Sandy sat down to watch her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final few lip flaps, the sweet melted into Allyson's mouth, which left her done with the candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, sour on one side and sweet on the other.

It was at that moment that Sandy could see Allyson's body become wider. Sandy shuffled back from the growing form of her friend. Allyson's body had grown an extra foot in height, while her shoulder had expanded to allow a slowly morphing stump to form. With a soft pop, a exact replica of Allyson's head had appeared on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only sound for over five minutes was of the stiches on Allyson's clothes popping open from the stress of her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong Sandy?\" The two heads echoed.</span></div></div>",

She hadn't actually mentioned to her new employers that she didn't really eat much candy, fearing it might make them overlook her the job. \"I think I'm going to grab something to eat and head to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy was already opening the sack. She reached in and pulled out a handful of wrapped candy bars, sweets and lollipops, then returned to the couch. Allyson went to the kitchen and made herself some Ramen Noodles. Out of the two of them, Sandy usually ate the most unhealthily, but the svelte Goth never seemed to put on any weight, and in fact was a little lighter than Allyson at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how were your co-workers?\" Sandy asked, unwrapping a chocolate bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not bad,\" Allyson said, returning to the couch with her noodles. \"One of them seems super enthusiastic and the other doesn't seem enthusiastic at all. They balance each other out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy's face suddenly lit up as she bit into the chocolate. \"Wow! This is seriously good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that explains why people were clamouring for them,\" Allyson laughed. \"I don't think I've ever seen you look so happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy took another bite, smiling to herself as she continued to munch on the delicious chocolate. \"Ughh...so good...maybe I'll stop by that store myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get there early, the crowd today was ridiculous,\" Allyson said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy didn't seem to hear that, as she was busy unwrapping another chocolate bar and popping the first chunk into her mouth. Allyson decided to leave her to it. She stripped out of her work uniform, got into her pyjamas, and quickly fell asleep after climbing into bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, after a comfortable night's sleep, Allyson changed into her uniform and headed out. Sandy didn't greet her this morning, which was odd, as this was her early shift at work. Allyson grabbed her packed lunch, a light salad, and headed out the door. As she left, she noticed that the sack of candy was still open, and it looked like it had gone down considerably since last night. Had she looked back at the couch, she would have seen a sea of empty wrappers littered across the cushions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, she had arrived at the store for her second day of work, which she hoped wouldn't be quite as hectic as the first. Tara entered just behind her, smiling cheerfully. \"Hey, you came back,\" Tara laughed. \"After yesterday, I wasn't sure any of us would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson chuckled. \"I was so tired yesterday, I fell asleep pretty much as soon as I got home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, same,\" Tara said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnusually, Carla seemed to have beaten them both in. While she had looked completely nonplussed yesterday, today, she seemed a lot more bright and cheerful. As she approached, she reached into her pocket and produced a handful of gummy bears, which she then popped into her mouth. \"Morning guys,\" she said. \"You tried any of this candy yet? That stuff is goooood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't really feel like it last night,\" Tara said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, same,\" Allyson replied. \"My room mate liked it though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good,\" Carla said, her cheeks bulging as she chewed the gummies. \"You guys should try some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Carla was about to reach into her pocket again, Sarah appeared from behind her, beaming enthusiastically. \"Good morning girls, ready to go to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Carla said, swallowing her mouthful of gummies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Sarah said, clearly pleased by the girl's change in tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson and Tara exchanged a confused look at Carla's sudden change of tone, but nodded in agreement. Under Sarah's guidance, they all took their places in the store front. Carla actually looked pretty happy on the doors, while Tara looked a little more hesitant behind the till. Allyson, for her part, was pretty relieved to just be re-stocking today. It had seemed like the most chilled of all the jobs. Just go back to the store room and replace what was selling out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors soon opened, and Carla welcomed each customer to the store. Her change in attitude was really quite noticeable. Maybe she had just been having a bad day yesterday? There wasn't quite as many customers as yesterday, but still plenty to keep them busy. The candy really was selling extremely well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the candy bars were starting to run low, and Allyson went into the back to find some more...</span></div></div>",

She hoped it wasn't Rats or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the room and closing the door behind her, she suddenly saw the cause of the noise. It was, surprisingly, Carla, who was currently tearing into a large industrial sized box of Expansive Gummy Bears and was surrounded by empty packets. Had she been...eating them all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Carla...you okay there?\" Allyson asked, taking a nervous step towards her colleague, who looked like she was in some sort of trance. When Carla didn't reply, she stepped a little closer. \"Carla...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla was emptying entire packets of candy into her mouth, grabbing anything she could and tearing it open. She was nosily chewing down on some gummies when she finally seemed to realise she was no longer alone, and froze in her tracks. \"Uh...hey...I'm just...doing inventory...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you are,\" Allyson said, trying her best to ignore what she had just witnessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked past Carla and started to gather up what she needed to restock, ignoring the mess on the floor. She cast a glance down at her feet as she heard wrappers rustling, and realised that practically the entire room was covered with them. Just how much had Carla been eating in here?! For someone who spent her first day so ambivalent her surroundings, she sure seemed to be embracing her role now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't tell anyone about this,\" Carla said, awkwardly cramming all of the empty wrappers back into one of the open boxes. \"I only had a few...really!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, maybe you shouldn't eat the product, are we even allowed to take samples from the store? Seems like something you could get fired for,\" Allyson said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla looked very guilty. \"I...I don't think we're supposed to but I just couldn't help myself. It's all so good! Maybe just one more...\" She grabbed an open pack and upended the contents into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson rolled her eyes and returned to the task at hand, gathering up what she needed for the front of the store and side-stepping Carla, who looked like she was still considering continuing her candy binge. \"You coming back now?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh uh...yeah...sure...\" Carla said absent mindedly. She folded up the box she had crammed her rubbish into, shoved it under a shelf, and followed Allyson back out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, she supposed she should be grateful that business was good, even if she was slightly concerned by the sheer enthusiasm of the townspeople for what looked like ordinary candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson restocked dutifully throughout the day, grabbing new boxes and replenishing the supply out the front. She had thought that this would be a less taxing job than being on the cash register, but apparently not, because her arms and back were now starting to ache considerably from all the lifting she was doing. It seemed like she was carrying a new box out every five minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the day, she had also caught Carla - who seemed to be growing ever more excited as she welcome customers to the store - sneaking back to the store room to pocket more candy. Her trips had been pretty quick, and she didn't seem to be indulging in any huge feasts like the one she had enjoyed this morning, but Allyson was still slightly concerned by her apparent candy addiction. <i>Maybe that's why she wanted to work here? She didn't seem all that bothered by the candy yesterday though. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked over at Tara, the petite blonde looked to be struggling with the constant stream of visitors, and was looking ready to collapse at any moment. She was just trying to figure out someone's change while another customers asked her a question about how many types of candy were in the store. Allyson was just about to help her out, when she noticed another empty row on the shelf, and headed out back to grab another box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had carried the box out of the store room, Tara had cleared the queue. She caught Allyson's eye, exhaled in an exaggerated way, and smiled. Allyson laughed and returned to her work, noticing that Tara was now helping herself to an opened candy bar she had hidden beneath the register. Allyson couldn't say she blamed her, though she had still yet to sample the candy herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, Allyson was, once again, exhausted. She rubbed her aching back as she gathered up her things and prepared to head home. Tara looked equally tired; her day on the register having really taken its tole on her. She ran a hand through her cropped, blonde hair and yawned noisily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long day, huh?\" Allyson said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I've been here for days,\" Tara groaned. \"Do you think we'll have some peace tomorrow? I can't keep doing this every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm greeting tomorrow, so hopefully,\" Allyson said. \"Cash register seems to be the most stressful job here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked together, Carla emerged from the store room, a large gummy snake hanging from her mouth. She looked embarrassed and pushed it inside as the other girls approached. \"Uh...hey...\" she said, shifting from one foot to the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carla, you gotta stop sneaking free samples,\" Allyson said. \"How many times have you been back there today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, it tastes so good,\" Carla moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Tara said, turning her attention back to Allyson. \"I'll see you tomorrow, I need some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same,\" Ally replied. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Allyson arrived at her normal time to find she was the last to arrive. Carla was already there at her workstation - quite the turnaround from her bored attitude on her first day - she now seemed to be the most enthusiastic worker amongst them. Tara was on restocking today, and walked up to greet Allyson as soon as she arrived, noticeable snacking on a lollipop. '<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, looks like Carla beat us both in today,\" Tara said, gesturing to the smiling Carla behind the counter, who waved at them both cheerily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson waved back before turning to Tara. \"Lollipop for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara blushed. \"Oh, yeah...well...turns it this stuff is pretty good. I opened up my supply last night and tried some of the candy. These lollipops are great. You sampled any of yours yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Allyson said. \"Not super into candy, to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me either,\" Tara said, placing the lollipop back in her mouth and sucking on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah entered the room from the back office and smiled enthusiastically. \"Morning girls, I must say, business has been booming all week. We're only on our third day and already we've cleared a third of our stock! If this keeps up, we'll be the best selling store in town. So let's try and keep up the hard work until Friday, if we sell the most candy we can all look forward to a nice bonus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson wondered what kind of bonus they might get, and, not for the first time, found herself asking how Expansive Candy could possible be affording all this? Though apparently their faith in their product was paying off due to the amount of stock they had managed to clear so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't exactly looking forward to greeting and meeting today, not being the most social person, and being well known amongst her friends for being the introvert of the group, but it did seem like the easiest job. Taking her place at the door, she let the first few customers inside. Once again, there had been a line forming outside about an hour before opening time. These people really must not have had anything better to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, welcome to our store, where the candy is - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Allyson had finished, the first few customers charged past her, ignoring her cheery greeting and hurrying to the shelves. <i>Huh, good morning to you too, candy fiends... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went on like that for most of the day. Allyson would say hello, and nine times out of ten, she would just be ignored. Carla was, surprisingly, doing very well behind the cash register, acting much more calm and collected than Tara had been yesterday despite a similar influx of customers. Whenever Allyson looked over at Tara, the petite blonde had a new lollipop in her mouth, which Sarah seemed to be fine with. Their manager had not been seen for a while, and was in the back office, so Allyson decided to move away from the doors and have a break. She doubted she would be missed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat nearby, Allyson noticed she had positioned herself next to the free samples; a bowl of assorted candies laid out each morning by Sarah. For the first time, she found herself tempted, and, with nothing better to do, she grabbed a small chocolate from the bowl, unwrapped it and popped it in her mouth. <i>Wow, these are really tasty...that's some good chocolate. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, she found herself reaching for a few more, eventually grabbing a handful and returning to the entrance as she popped another three freebies into her mouth, savouring the rich, chocolatey flavour. For someone who wasn't a candy fan, she sure was enjoying these...</span></div></div>",

She was definitely getting used to her new workplace and the rapid pace; though the influx of customers hadn't really slowed yet, she, Carla and Tara were definitely getting used to the system and their stress levels seemed to be dropping after the chaos of Monday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened the door to her apartment, she spotted the sack of candy she had been given on her first day, still propped up next to the door. Her mind immediately thinking back to the chocolates she had sampled at work today, she was overcome with a craving and decided it was finally time to open up the bag. Unfastening the string that tied it together, Allyson dumped her stuff by the door and leaned in for a closer look; to her surprise, the heavy sack was filled to the brim with what looked like thousands of candies. <i>This is way too much, maybe they expected us to give out free samples or something? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson pulled out a handful of chocolates in purple wrappers with the EC logo on them. They looked a little different to the ones she had eaten earlier, but she wasn't about to go rifling through the entire bag. She'd be there all night! Unwrapping one of the chocolates, she popped it into her mouth and bit down, revealing it to be a caramel. \"Mmmmm...\" A soft moan escaped her lips as the rich, velvety chocolate melted in her mouth. She looked around for Sandy, but her roommate was obviously not home yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing to the couch, she unbuttoned her blazer and tossed it over the arm, before taking a seat and switching on the TV. As she sat down, she was greeted by the sight of a female news reporter standing outside the gates to the Expansive Candy factory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, it's us!\" She said aloud, unwrapping a second chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...and the candy is now sweeping through our town like wildfire, Bill!\"</i> The reporter was saying. <i>\"To the surprise of local investors, the new Expansive Candy enterprise has brought jobs, interest and tourism to our small town, and it looks like their profits are only going up. Latest estimates show that the five stores across town will soon be restocking completely.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I wonder how the others are doing,\" Allyson said to herself, popping her third chocolate into her mouth and chomping down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe report cut back to the studio, just as the reporter produced a bag of sour candy from her pocket.<i> \"Thanks Sally,\"</i> the bearded presenter said cheerily. <i>\"Well, it looks like all of Spring Falls loves our colourful new business partners. Join us tomorrow when we will have an exclusive interview with the owner of the factory, Miss Elena Exco.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the TV cut to commercial, Allyson realised she had already finished off her chocolates. \"Huh, they didn't last long,\" she said, looking down with mild surprise at her empty hand. Drawing herself back to her feet, she immediately returned to the sack and grabbed a second, much larger, handful, before returning to the couch and popping one after another into her mouth...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the evening went on, Allyson found herself continuously restocking her candy supply. Each time, she would return to the sack, pick out another handful and return to the couch, but five minutes later, it was all gone, so the process kept repeating itself, and each time, the handfuls got a little larger. She was doing it almost by default now, not really even thinking about how much sugar she was consuming, or the fact that she hadn't actually made herself any dinner yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fourth trip, she just grabbed the sack and dragged it to the couch, dumping it beside the arm rest and she put her feet up and kept reaching for more. Her hand ferried gummies, chocolates and all manner of assorted candies into her mouth with surprising speed. All the while, she just carried on watching the TV, her eyes taking on a blank, emotionless stare as she digested both her candy and a trash reality show where a group of people had to date each other while living in the same house for a week. She didn't usually even watch that much television, let alone a show like this and would often prefer reading, but tonight she couldn't bring herself to turn it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention was finally diverted from the candy when she heard the door open, and Sandy returned from her shift. Looking over at her arm, she found it mid way towards the bag, and pulled it back, surveying the sea of empty wrappers that had accumulated beside her. \"Huh...didn't realise I'd eaten that many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Sandy asked, hanging up her jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...nothing...\" Allyson replied, sheepishly gathering up the wrappers in her arms and walking them to the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finally cracked open the candy, huh?\" Sandy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Allyson said, dumping the wrappers in the bin. \"They're actually really good. They're a bit moreish though, I didn't realise I'd eaten so many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you actually had any dinner or anything?\" Sandy asked, making her way to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I...\" But as she went to answer, Allyson realised she hadn't. Weird, she could've sworn she had eaten, but now that she thought about it, all she had had since getting home was candy. Though, now that she thought about it, she really wasn't hungry. All that sugar had taken the edge off whatever appetite she had. \"Actually no, but I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Filled up on candy, huh?\" Sandy chuckled. \"Careful you don't eat too much of that stuff, it can't be good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllyson knew that was probably right, but she found herself reaching for just a few extra chocolates before bed. She had been so busy snacking that she had forgotten to change out of her work outfit, and as she returned to her room, she noticed a slight bulge beneath her shirt. \"Huh...must have eaten a bit too much I guess,\" she thought, unbuttoning her shirt to reveal a slightly bloated stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging into her pyjamas, Allyson climbed into bed and soon drifted off to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she first saw the job advertised, Lana had thought it a very easy way to make some money; she had been out of work for a while now, since the restaurant she used to waitress at had closed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana wasn't really a fan of hard work; she wasn't lazy, exactly, but she liked jobs where she could relax, take her time and not have to stress about deadlines. So \"taste tester\" was pretty much a perfect way for her to chill out and earn good money for just eating candy every day. The job was on a two weeks trial basis to start with; and she imagined it probably wouldn't continued much longer than that, because hey, there's only so much candy in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty cold out, and some snow had landed on the ground as she approached the main entrance. She pulled her jacket tighter across her chest as a cold wind hit her. Lana was wearing a leather jacket and green, flannel shirt with hip hugging jeans. Her time in unemployment had, she was aware, added some extra pounds to her once slender frame, and her once flat stomach had expanded slightly, gaining some added pudge. She was still getting used to the fact that her clothes were a little tight, but hey, at least they weren't making her wear a uniform for this. She ran a hand through her short, pink hair and stepped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reception staff welcomed her politely, perhaps a little too politely. <i>Must be all that sugar. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey led her down a corridor away from the offices and to the main factory, where she was greeted by a short girl in a bright pink shirt and striped, white and red skirt. Lana was nearly blinded by the garishness of her outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiiiii!\" The girl waved enthusiastically. \"I'm Tammy. You must be Lana. Oh my God, I love your hair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Lana said. \"Matches your outfit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy laughed a high pitched laugh and linked her arm through Lana's, before leading her off through a large set of double doors. Lana found herself being ushered into a huge, open environment, which to her shock, resembled a large, indoor park, complete with trees, bushes and a flowing river. \"Wow, this is like...some sort of indoor garden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Tammy said, still dragging Lana forward. \"We're still adding the finishing touches though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked past the river, Lana could have sworn the water was brown and gooey, but she had little time to dwell on that before Tammy ushered her through another set of doors and into a very clean, sparkling white room with a table and chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the testing room,\" Tammy said. Her attention suddenly went to the table, and she raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana followed her gaze and saw a small lump of what seemed to be marshmellow on the other immaculate table surface. \"Am I meant to eat that?\" She laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy laughed awkwardly. \"Sorry...this was meant to be cleaned up after the last girl...erm...anyway, just ignore that. Welcome to your first day! You got the induction pack, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana shrugged. \"I glanced at it, I think...\" She had not, in fact, glanced at it at all. It was still lying unopened on her kitchen counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GREAT!\" Tammy enthused. \"We can probably get started then. We'll just be trialling a few of our new candies today. These haven't been tasted by anyone yet, so you're very lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana unzipped her jacket, feeling her belly bulge out slightly as she was allowed some room to breathe. She had become very aware of her extra weight, and had found herself sucking in whenever she was around people. For now though, she just quickly took a seat at the table and folded her arms. \"Ready to start when you are,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We're about to conduct phase two in our experiment and we need you to stay where you are.\" Lana nodded and took out her phone. She began to play with it for about ten minutes or so until a man came in and politely asked for it. Lana didn't put much thought into why he needed it so she easily complied with his words. Another three minutes passed until a young woman came walking into the room. She looked a little older than Lana, not by much, but their was some quality of her that yelled \"senior\" in the woman's general attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lana meet Christine;Christine meet Lana.\" The voice spoke. The two greeted to each other a hello before Christine was brought in a chair to sit down in. Another piece of gum, same as Lana's but in yellow wrappings, was brought in front of Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can chew this right?\" Christine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, though we like for you to blow a bubble first.\" The voice explained. Christine shrugged and did so which left Lana wondering what was her job to in all of this. A bubble soon issued forth from Christine's mouth followed by a strange tingle to pass through Lana's bottom. The tingle passed though Lana soon felt how tight her bottom had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuffled for a bit unaware of the processes passing through her cheeks. Her bottom was ever so slowly expanding larger in her pants all the while Christine's bubble expanded larger and larger.</span></div></div>",

You really think people are going to be interested in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's huge news, chief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, hands on hips, stood before the oversized desk of the Spring Gazette's editor, Mr Stone, a heavy set man with a huge, bushy moustache and what seemed to be an ever present frown. They were currently locked in a stare-down, with Claire's piercing, blue eyes fixed on Stone's own, twitching pupils. Stone seemed to be losing concentration, as he always did. He claimed it was because he was always too busy to get into an argument, but Claire knew the old guy had a soft spot for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Stone said, his face reddening. \"Cover the dam factory story. What's so interesting about it anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It practically sprung up over night,\" Claire explained, relaxing her posture. \"That company has bought up property all over town. They seem to be banking on everything being a huge success, because there's stores opening everywhere. There's already six. We're a tiny town, why do they need all those stores?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone shrugged. \"Does seem a bit excessive, but people do like candy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they really like candy this much though?\" Claire asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I? An expert?!\" Stone snapped irritably. \"You are sure there's nothing more interesting you could be covering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed. \"Chief, in the past week, the only other story you found me was one about a dog wearing a hat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People like that dog, Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, chief, we all like the dog,\" Claire allowed herself a smile. \"But it wasn't exactly newsworthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone sighed. \"Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a small town and a slow news week...month...year...\" He cleared his throat. \"I know you feel like you're wasted here. Truth is, you are. You can do better, and I appreciate you staying on...for now. Okay Claire, see what you can find on. Who knows? Maybe the Spring Falls candy mystery will be front page news this time tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Chief!\" Claire grinned. She turned to walk from the office, but Stone cleared his throat, causing her to turn back to face him. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cause any trouble,\" Stone said, wagging his finger. \"I know what you're like. You're an instigator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled mischievously and adopted an innocent look. \"Who? Me?\" Stone chuckled as Claire ducked out of his office and into the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pleased she had been allowed to do the story, she was certain there was something here. That factory and the oddly successful company behind it gave her a bad feeling. On looking into their past, she had found that the company had been founded twenty years ago as a small time candy shop in New York. They were moderately successful, but hardly in the big leagues. After the founder passed away, his daughter, Elena, had taken over, and at that point, she had somehow managed to turn around the company's fortunes. The shop in New York had been closed abruptly and the company had undergone a huge renovation and restructure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire found it all very suspicious. Samples of the free candy had been sent to some select people in town, but apart from that, it was still not available for public consumption; that was, until tomorrow when the stores had their grand opening. It seemed like a hugely risky gamble to take; what if people didn't like the candy? Was this Elena so convinced of her business acumen and the quality of her product, that she was sure her new venture would be a success? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire returned to her desk and sat down, eager to get started. She hadn't mentioned it to Stone, but she already had a few leads...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There wasn't a lively attitude in the factory. No sounds of hustle and bustle or even the creaking movement of workers.Near dead silence. Megan turned to look at the front,a large desk greeted her.With some reluctance, Megan moved closer. On the desk was a single button, the words under it read \"press for assistance\" in bright yellow letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan did as the words told, quickly pressing down onto the single button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello madam.\" A voice spoke. Megan jumped in shock, she looked forward to see a woman causally sitting on a chair. An unfamiliar phone was held in her hand, the woman looking down at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Hello to you to.\" was Megan's only response. \"Got. I got a job here, this pager I got on me is buzzing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So you're our mechanic! I apolgize for not recognizing you, my name is Cheryl.\" The receptionist replied. Megan's nerves were calming as human interaction came into play. The two shook hands before Cheryl got up and asked Megan to follow her. The mechanic nodded and followed Cheryl deeper into the facility. Megan's eyes glanced at the various fruits on the wall,it made the factory look somewhat childish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have kids here?\" Megan joked. \"They like all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheryl glanced back at Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are yo- oh, the wallpaper, sorry bout that, yeah you can say people enjoy them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan swore she heard a small \"slurp\" from Cheryl's mouth but ignored it. The sound of darting feet caused her to briefly turn around, a small shadow passed behind her,which made Megan jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, its nothing.\" Megan replied. She didn't dare say she saw a tiny shadow run behind her. That wasn't what professionals said to their employers.Finally the two arrived into the cafeteria, which like the rest of the factory,looked empty. Cheryl pointed forward, Megan could see a powered down fountain dispensers like what most restaurants used. Except this one was the twice the size of a normal one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't lunchtime yet.\" Cheryl explained. \"You have about two hours to fix the machine or at least tell us the problem.Don't worry, we'll compensate you for an entire day's work even if you don't fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded walking up to the large dispenser. She took out her tools,and with a quick stretch, looked inside the soda fountain.Thirteen minutes later, Megan was slowly unhooking a tube, her hand gently loosen its cap.Upon loosening the tube a hum came from inside the machine and Megan only hand time to say \"what\" before a blast of soda smashed against her face. It only lasted for a minute but it left Megan stumbling out of the fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah.\" Megan screamed, she spurted soda from her mouth. \"This is gonna ruin my hair! Sticky son of a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stopped her rant as she touched her face, she didn't feel the stickiness of a corn-starch product like she'd usually did. It was like water, but the sweetness still could be tasted on her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She licked her lips as she tasted the flavorful drink that she had been splashed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to pry,but what's with your soda?\" She questioned. Cheryl smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been working on a new formula that doesn't stick to surfaces. Our employees get to taste it before it hits the markets.\" She pointed over to the fountain. \"Its been real popular,both because of its lack of stickiness and in flavor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan licked her lips once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,its like I've been splashed with water. It won't stain my clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.We pride ourselves on this new formula,its big selling point is being smooth in the throats of drinkers!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled and went over to a stack of paper towels. She wiped herself down making sure she was somewhat dry. Cheryl looked at Megan for a few more moments before she took off.The mechanical savvy lass finished her drying,she went back to the machine and restarted where she left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thirty minutes, Megan saw nothing else to repair or check up on. She walked away to grab a hold of a Styrofoam cup. Holding the white cup in her hand, Megan went back over to see if everything checked out. A trickle of cola came foaming out which meant Megan had done her job right. Though she did frown as the soda only made up a quarter of the cup's volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta ask if they want me to refill the fountain as well?\" Megan mused. She gulped down whatever contents that was in the cup and sat down on one of the cafeteria's seats. From her pocket she pulled out a wrapped cylinder of delicious minty mentos. She popped one into her mouth. She chewed on the snack for a few moments until she swallowed it whole,she never liked mashing mentos until they were easily digestible. Many did warn her that she could choke,but hey, it never happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumble came from her stomach and Megan clenched herself in discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh. That doesn't sound good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burp erupted from her throat,the mechanic blushed. The weird rumbles in her gut didn't stop,the pressure felt like it was building up inside of her. Another burp gave some much needed release but they happened every so often and not enough to stop her building pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore gastric noises came from within,Megan lifted her arms away from herself. She yelped in shock at what had happened to her once trim stomach.She was about to dismiss this as a bad case of gas, if not for the fact she could see her stomach continue its growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore burps came from her mouth and Megan clenched her jaws to quell it. That was a terrible mistake though, her growth kick started. Her once slim ass and small tits blew up almost immediately in response. They stretched her clothes and pushed against her overalls. Megan opened her mouth to release a loud burp to curb the growth,which it did, to a small margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere on the seat Megan sat, her body inflating without anyone to help her.</span></div></div>",

This was told to her by one of male janitors, Ted or something like that. Naturally, to see if something illegal was going on or perhaps getting a scoop on something just as juicy. Her body she trained hard during her high school days and doing this job will aid her way in getting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited until night, and under the cover of darkness and dim lights she sneaked towards the supposed hole in the fence. She made sure to wear black jeans, a black hoodie, and as well as a equally black long sleeve shirt just so she wouldn\u2019t be discovered easily. The factory seemed like any other factory from the outside but she had the wonder what the inside as well as the staff was like inside the brick and metal buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cMan this is easy. Actually it is way too easy it's scary.\u201d</i> Claire thinks as she gets close to the man sized hole just barely big enough to fit the redhead through. <i>\u201cSeriously is it because this opened recently and don\u2019t have the manpower or is security just lazy because this is a candy factory?\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe thought of either is nice but if Claire has learned one thing as a journalist it\u2019s that not everything is as it seems. With a few curses at her clothing getting caught on the fence and a minute of gentle pulling Claire manages to get fully inside the factory taking several looks around to make sure the coast is clear as well as making sure  that Janitor\u2019s info was right.

She cast a furtive glance down the corridor, then back over her shoulder, checking the coast was clear before she darted ahead and pushed open the door. She was half expecting it to be locked, but apparently security around here was pretty lax, so she was able to easily pushed on ahead. There were signs on the wall which read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> - Testing Room<br>\r\n - Assembly<br>\r\n - Taste Testers<br>\r\n - Mixing Vats<br>\r\n </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she read the sign, she heard some faint footsteps in the distance, and the sound of male voices. Quickly, she looked for cover, and saw a large stack of metal containers in an alcove to her left. As the footsteps drew closer, Claire ducked behind the containers, crouching behind the largest of them and peeking over the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't know why we're not allowed free candy either, but whatever, it pays well,\" the first voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me, I could put my kids through college with my first three paychecks...not that I actually have kids,\" a second voice replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they grew closer, Claire could see they were security guards, dressed in garish, dark purple uniforms. They stopped for a moment just the other side of the containers, and she ducked down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You clocking off now?\" The first guard asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, our shifts over,\" replied the second man. \"Do we have to do a handover or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, don't worry, the night shift will already be here,\" the first said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...the night shift...they give me the creeps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean, they always seem so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheerful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards turned and walked on, passing through the doors and out of Claire's line of vision. She breathed a sigh of relief as she emerged from her hiding place. She wondered what they had meant by the \"creepy night shift\". Surely security guards should be the night shift, but maybe there was more security on the way? In which case, she would need to be careful. She cast a glance back up at the sign and decided on her next move...</span></div></div>",

She hadn't a clue what would make the Night Shift so creepy, and she didn't really want to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, damn...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking one of the heavy double doors open an inch, Claire couldn't help but gasp as she got a look at the Testing Room. The word 'Room', however, was a bit of an understatement. From where she was, she couldn't see the ceiling above her, not the wall opposite her. All she could make out was a metal catwalk just in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This place is massive!</i> Claire pushed her way into the room, the door slamming shut behind her. <i>I don't even know where to start! Uh... I guess right is as good a place as any...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to her right, Claire tip-toed across the catwalk, pausing occasionally to glance over the railing. Various machines and tables decorated with papers and candies stored in airtight containers met her gaze, each one more enticing than the last. Eventually, she came across a staircase that she wasted no time in bouncing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>First table! Let's see what you're hiding...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first table, unfortunately, wasn't all that interesting. A neat plaque in the corner of the table told her that the candy on the table was nothing more than simple chocolate. Even so, she took a moment to open one of the containers and pluck out a few pieces of said chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Looks normal, feels normal... Tastes normal?\" Claire mumbled to herself, rolling a bit between her fingers. With a shrug, she plopped it into her mouth. Almost immediately, it melted atop her tongue, spreading its rich taste throughout her mouth. With a happy moan, she devoured the rest of her stolen pieces, licking her fingers clean once done. \"Never mind, tastes absolutely delicious! A bit more wouldn't... No, hold it, Claire! You can't afford to get stopped at the first table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with surprising will, she tore herself away from the chocolate and began to wander through the massive room. Each table she came across had a plaque stamped to it, indicating the name of the candy stored atop it. Some were self-explanatory, like the '<i>Toffee Chewers</i>', while others were slightly more obscure, such as the '<i>Bootilicious Bites</i>' and the '<i>Plump Suckers</i>'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So many candies!\" Claire exclaimed as she finally came to the end of the first row. She must've passed at least fifteen tables, and there were easily another five or six rows! \"Well, I guess I've got a good but of searching before I get any answers...\"</span></div></div>",

She pulled out her phone and snapped a few pictures of the room, then a close up of the test tubes. She hadn't exactly found anything interesting yet, but thought it best to take a few photos, just in case, and she wasn't entirely sure she would be able to come back the same way she had come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPocketing her phone into her black hoodie, she took a closer look at the tubes, before noticing one of the desk drawers under the table was slightly ajar. <i>Jackpot. </i>Pulling open the drawer, Claire was confronted with a clipboard containing some hand written notes and a results chart. She laid the notes out across the desk and started reading. The first set of notes read: <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nDay 1 - New Chocolate Testing <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResults so far have been unpredictable. While we have been able to replicate the same taste as previous chocolate products and, indeed, improved upon it, we have struggled to contain the expansive effect of the new recipe. We do not recommend going to human testing at this stage. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire froze as she read the words \"we do not recommend human testing\". She scanned the page again, hoping she had misread, but her eyes had not deceived her. The chocolate appeared, from these notes, to be unsafe for human consumption. The chocolate she had, stupidly, just eaten. But surely it was only chocolate? What could they possibly be putting into it that would make it dangerous? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she went any further, she took her camera out again and photographed the notes and chart. She wanted to make sure she had record of everything after what she had just read. <i>God, I could really go for some more of that chocolate...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had to stop herself from turning back, but the intrusive thoughts about that chocolate kept coming back to her. She could still taste it on her tongue, which darted between her teeth looking for leftover fragments. But it wasn't safe! She had literally just read that. It would have been stupid to try some more. Claire resolved to check the rest of the room and then move on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to the next work station, her head now filled with paranoid thoughts about what was going to happen to her after eating that chocolate. That rich...delicious...chocolate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire suddenly turned and darted back to the table. She needed more. She had to have more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to control herself, she grabbed a handful of the chocolate pieces on the table and started munching down on them, grabbing one after the other and devouring whatever she could get her hands on...</span></div></div>",

More!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolishing off the bits and pieces that were scattered across the table top, Claire's arms shot out, grabbing a sealed container of the chocolate and pulling it towards her. Tearing the top from the box, her hands hungrily dug in, scooping out handfuls of the rich treat and stuffing them into her mouth. After a few particularly large and particularly delicious chocolates had been swallowed, she managed to tear herself away from the table, breathing heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"U-Urgh... So many...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire groaned heavily, stifling a chocolate scented belch with the palm of her hand. Doing so, however, brought the scent of the heavenly treat to her nose and she found herself racing back to the table to scoop up another couple of bites. This time, she found she couldn't stop, nor did she particularly want to. All she did want to do was eat... and eat... and eat... and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>PING</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire came to a sudden halt, slightly melted chocolate held aloft in both hands, as she heard something other than the sounds of her stuffing her face. The world around her gradually came back into focus, bringing with an unusual weight to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"God, I feel so heavy!\" She moaned quietly, licking her hands clean of any remaining melted chocolate. \"Surely I didn't eat that much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down, it was painfully obvious that Claire had eaten that much. In fact, her trim body, toned after many years of her visiting the gym on daily basis, now looked as though she had fed it '<i>that much</i>' every single day for the past several years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled into a stunned silence, her hands first gripped her hefty belly, which had swollen out into two round, wobbling rolls that neither her sweater or her hoodie could completely cover. Pinching the lower roll, which hung down over the waistband of her jeans, one hand travelled downwards, discovering that the sound from earlier had been the button on her jeans flying off and colliding with something, presumably the table in front of her. Said jeans were now stretched tightly over her lower body, particularly her much rounder backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her left hand explored her new, corpulent lower half, her right was discovering her much softer and much less firm chest. She had never been particularly blessed when it came to her breasts, not that being average had ever bothered her. But now, her average breasts had ballooned into two orbs of soft flab that, from what she could feel, were overfilling the cups of her bra. Each one had to have doubled in size, almost equalling the size of her own head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-What happened to me?!\" Claire managed to finally stammer, her newly formed second chin wobbling slightly as she spoke. \"W-Was this what the notes meant when they said the chocolate weren't ready for human testing? There's gotta be more notes...\"</span></div></div>",

If the company had notes about this highly unpredictable new product, they must have tested it, and if they had tested it, then surely there must be some way to reverse it's effects? There would have been a huge lawsuit against the company if a taste tester had suddenly suffered these side effects. Claire hoped that was the case, anyway...it was also very possible that some poor taste tester had just been left to balloon out of control and was then quietly paid off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, though, Claire didn't think a journalist who had broken in in the dead of night and eaten samples of a new product would receive a nice payout. As she rooted around, she felt her stomach gurgle ominously, and ran a hand over her bulging belly. Deciding she needed some insurance, she pulled out her phone and started recording a video. She was immediately struck by how much fuller her face seemed; her once angular features now rounder and softer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Claire Williams, reporting from the Expansive Candy factory. I entered the factory earlier this evening and have discovered some...strange new product...some sort of chocolate which has caused me to experience strange side effects.\" She moved the camera over her body to show how tight her outfit had grown, then stopped recording. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to her search, Claire picked up a brown file from the nearest desk and opened it up to find another set of notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Test Subject 1: Lana<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject found new chocolate to be very tasty, said it was her favourite so far. All seemed to be going well until her cravings became difficult to control. We would naturally expect cravings to set in after a day or so, but not within the first few seconds after consumption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs subject tried to satisfy their cravings, they appeared to ease off and then return at regular intervals. Rapid weight gain ensued as she consumed more and more chocolate and the effects of the chocolate caused a more enhanced cell multiplication than we are used to. Subject eventually tired self out and was transferred to the recovery room while we work on bodily restoration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould not recommend we test product again until modification have been made to the recipe.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no...\" Claire felt sick. If this poor girl doing the testing had had such an extreme reaction so quickly...was the same thing going to happen to her? Had she eaten enough chocolate to trigger the same kind of reaction? She was already swelling up...</span></div></div>",

She had been faced with her fair share of weird situations, such as that time she had ended up as a part of a major showing of some play, rather than the one reporting on it. But this, without any doubt in her mind, had to be the most outlandish one ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't continue sneaking around, not at my size</i>, Claire was forced to admit. <i>I need to leave, maybe check in at a... Urgh...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's belly grumbled loudly, a sudden craving for more chocolate gripping her. Try as she might, she found herself unable to resist it, the memory of its rich taste lingering on her tongue. With heavy, lumbering footsteps, Claire returned to the chocolate, a sliver of drool running from the corner of her mouth. Lifting a bit, she dropped it into her mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire groaned as she slowly sat up, a hand running the back of her head. She hadn't a clue when it had happened, but she was now sat on the floor, something incredibly soft spreading out beneath her. And there was a chilled breeze brushing against her belly, which she could've sworn was covered by her jumper. Well, mostly covered, anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why's it so cold all of a... sudden...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down, Claire received the answer to her question. Sitting between two thick legs was a bare, heavy, spherical gut that gurgled and churned quietly. And atop them, filling the majority of her vision, sat a pair of corpulent, flabby orbs, something digging tightly into their flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O-Oh, crap...\" Claire sat still for a moment, mouth hanging open in silent shock. One of her hands cautiously probed her body, discovering that the growth wasn't just limited to her breasts and belly. A plump second chin had developed beneath her first, her toned arms had vanished beneath a healthy layer of pale fat, her backside was softer and wider than her chair back at the office... \"God, I'm so heavy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy grunt, Claire hauled herself to her feet. Once she was finally standing, a number of worrying snaps caused her to blush a bright red. Suddenly, her breasts didn't feel so constricted, and whatever had been digging painfully into her hips was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's not good,\" Claire mumbled to herself, scratching at her pudgy hips. \"I should probably get outta here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to leave, she paused as she caught sight of the table. Broken boxes and melted chocolate were strewn across the top of it, making it painfully obvious that somebody had been here. Despite what the chocolate had done to her, part of her wanted to stay and clean it up, destroying any evidence that she had been here. But in doing so, she might get caught! Or worse, lose herself to her ravenous desires her again...</span></div></div>",

Claire couldn't stay here any longer; she would either be caught by security, the ominous \"night shift\" or, worse, be drawn back to the delicious chocolate supply and end up making things even worse. She could hardly believe what had happened to her since arriving. All she had wanted was a juicy story, but instead, she had gained about fifty pounds in a single night. She was trying to avoid thinking about her sudden, rapid weight gain, but the newfound jiggle of her bulging tummy made that difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gathered up what she could from the workstations, shoving the testing notes into her satchel for safe keeping. Even if her...condition...was permanent, which she was desperately hoping wasn't the case, she would at least have some sort of evidence of what was going on here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back the way she came, Claire had to fight the urge to grab more chocolate...though truth be told, she couldn't actually see any left on the table now. <i>Please don't say I ate the entire supply...fuck.</i> She tugged awkwardly at her hoodie as she ran, her new flab bouncing up and down, her breasts heaving beneath her top. Her top kept riding up above her belly button, and she had to keep pulling it back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner, Claire quickly checked the coast was clear before darting back down the corridor and out of the door she had originally entered through, before disappearing into the night, glad to finally be away from the house of horrors that was Expansive Candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally back at her apartment, Claire breathed a sigh of relief as she climbed the stairs to her floor, panting heavily. She usually ran about three times per week, and could have easily bounded up these stairs in a few seconds on a good day, but today she was just sluggish, bloated and slow. With a groan of discomfort, she reached her floor and hurriedly stepped into her apartment, slamming the door shut behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, and glad to finally be safe, she finally took stock of her situation and her body. She slowly lifted her hoodie up over her tummy, which bulged free with a wobble. Claire winced at the sight of her newfound pot belly, barely able to believe what she was seeing. She ran a hand over the globe of round chub that had developed on her middle, and moaned softly in despair. \"Noooo...this can't be happening,\" she said. \"My body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire ran her hand down over her soft, flabby stomach and down to her pants, suddenly realising that the top button on her pants had popped open at some point. Mortified, she let out another moan, grateful, at least, that nobody had seen her like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and waddled to the bathroom, her clothes clinging tightly to her newly curvy figure. As she walked, she lifted her hoodie up over her head, struggling to get it past her enlarged breasts. She grunted and groaned as she pulled the top over her head, allowing her breasts, and a broken, undersized bra, to fall free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the bathroom, she turned to look at herself in the full length mirror and gasped. Her boobs were huge! Her belly looked like she was nine months pregnant! She was huge! Most of her extra fat seemed to have gone straight to her stomach and tits, though her thighs and face had also been hit. Claire unzipped her pants and yanked them down her thicker legs, kicking them away across the tile floor before looking herself over once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no denying it. She was fat. At least twice the size she had been when she entered the factory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please, no, I don't want to be stuck like this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire grabbed her scales and stepped onto them tentatively, watching the numbers rocketing upwards. When the display finally settled, she could hardly believe her eyes. She had been 130 lbs this morning...and now she was 201 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit! No! What have I done?!\" Claire screamed. \"How am I going to get back to normal?!</span></div></div>",

And what about all those other treats?! If the chocolate did this to me, what would they do?! U-Urgh, I don't feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's belly grumbled ominously, the redhead falling to her knees. Staring at her worried reflection, she screamed as her belly, still rumbling and grumbling, bulged further outwards. It inched down her legs and rose like bread in an oven. Scooping up her swelling gut, she quickly dropped it with another scream as her upper arms began to thick, whatever muscle they had left vanishing beneath another layer of flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wh... How?! How am I still growing?!\" Claire began to sob, tears rolling down her rounding cheeks. \"H-How much ch-chocolate did... did I eat?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little else to do other than wonder the answer to that question and allow her body to continue growing, Claire remained on the floor, eyes firmly focused on the floor in front of her. After a few minutes had passed, she felt her growth come to an end. With a sad whimper, she stood, new body wobbling slightly, and turned to her reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-I'm so... so big!\" Claire stared sadly at her obese reflection, at her fat breasts that were beginning to sag down the sides of her corpulent gut. Said gut had split into two thick rolls, the lower one hanging down past her naked pelvis. Turning to the side, she inspected her fat ass, one that made her look like she spent the majority of her reporting career sat on a cushy chair in an office and not searching maniacally for her big break. \"W-Wait, those notes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumbering from her bathroom, Claire stumbled into her bedroom and began to shuffle through her stolen papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Test Subject One...

Discomfort lasted for ten minutes, at which point rapid weight gain set in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowth was rapid yet insubstantial, leaving Subject Two approximately seventy pounds heavier. After Subject Two returned home, we received a call that she was growing for the second time. Observers arrived late, missing her growth, but did take a number of readings.

The thought of being recognised (though recognising her at this point would have been difficult) was terrifying, and she would have been humiliated if one of her friends or colleagues saw her like this. Rather than get back out there, she decided she would need to work remotely. Her work laptop was, luckily, with her at home, and she had access to all her files here, so her apartment would just need double as her office for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire wasn't exactly sure how long \"a while\" would be. She was still hoping there would be some sort of miracle cure or treatment to reverse what had happened to her; surely the company had to be paying for something like that to get themselves out of legal troubles with their taste testers? She doubted, however, that they would be ponying up any money for her, a journalist who had broken in and, through her own foolishness, consumed her weight in unattended chocolate. She cursed herself for being so stupid, still not quite able to believe she was in this ridiculous situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire turned again to look at her increasingly pudgy body in the mirror. Her belly was huge now; during the last growth spurt it had grown even rounder, and was surprisingly solid, considering it was all fat. Her ass had ballooned considerably, sticking out behind her almost as far as her belly, while her huge breasts had clearly gotten far too big for any of her bras. Claire walked to her wardrobe, thighs rubbing together with each step, and started searching for something that she might be able to squeeze into. Her pants, shirts and skirts were completely out of the question now; each one was about half the size of her new body. Her underwear was equally useless, so she would have to go without it for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only acceptable option was a pair of sweat pants she had bought in the wrong size a little while ago, and an oversized sweater that had belonged to her old boyfriend. With a sigh, she resigned herself to her new, less fashionable outfit, and pulled the sweat pants up her chunky legs. Even being a few sizes too big, they were a tight squeeze to get on, and Claire had to tug at them to get past her ballooning behind, but eventually, she succeeded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief, she grabbed the sweater and pulled that on over her head. Once again, it was harder than she was expecting. Her thick arms were a tight squeeze in the sleeves, but it did, thankfully, allow her breasts some room to breathe as she gently pulled it down over her chunky torso. Annoyingly, it didn't quite cover her entire belly, leaving her soft, pale belly on display up to the belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...dammit...better than nothing though,\" she grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire took a look at her reflection again and tried to pull herself together. <i>This isn't permanent. You can beat this. You can beat <b>them</b>. </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling from her room, Claire grabbed her laptop and decided to get to work, curling up on the couch and beginning to look for leads. She already had two; the names of the test subjects, and as the factory had only recruited locally, those girls would have to be living somewhere in town. Hopefully, they would want to talk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Doing so, unfortunately, caused her breasts and belly to simultaneously rise up and hide her laptop from view, an unhappy grumble escaping her. \"Urgh, stupid boobs and stupid belly! Get outta the... Actually, hold on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, she lifted her laptop and cautiously placed it atop her gut.

India was a rather petite girl, brown hair pulled back into a low hanging ponytail. Her green eyes glittered brightly as she stared into the camera, a slight smile on her face. \"Let's have a look...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she rose to her feet, Claire wobbled and had to grasp the arm of the couch for support. Unfortunately, she was not yet accustomed to her new centre of gravity; her globular, heavy gut, and it's size and weight was entirely unfamiliar to her. She had never really been chubby or so much as curvy her whole life. How did people cope being this...round? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweater had ridden up again when she stood up, and was now exposing the entirety of her fattened tummy. With a sigh, she yanked it back down and considered her next move; the University would probably be the safest option to contact, but it might land her in trouble and she would need to identify herself to make contact. There was also a risk that someone from the university might recognise her...on the other hand, the Rowdy Bull was going to be pretty busy, but it was on the other side of town, none of her friends went there and it was would be much easier to just lye low and make some discreet enquiries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe downside, of course, was that she would have to go out in public in her new, obese, state. Not to mention, she wasn't exactly dressed for a trendy bar frequented by college students. But it was literally open right now...and could she really afford to waste any time solving this mystery? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith considerable dread, she decided she would set off for the bar. Hopefully, she wouldn't draw too much attention to herself. She grabbed her shoes and had to sit down to put them on, her arms barely stretching past her hefty belly to tie the shoe laces. Even her shoes felt tight now, with her feet considerably chubbier than they used to be. Everything she did seemed to cause her some sort of uncomfortable hassle, and even something as simple as putting on shoes left her out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, she rose again, pulled down her sweater...again...and headed out. Squeezing into her car was her next obstacle, and she found herself barely able to climb inside; her belly bumped up against the wheel, and her ass occupied the entire seat. <i>I am getting so sick of this. I feel gross. Ugh. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne forty minute drive later, Claire parked up her car near the Rowdy Bull; which had a large, neon sign outside depicting an anthropomorphised Bull winking and holding a keg of beer. There wasn't much of a queue to get in, which she was thankful for. The less time she spent in public, the better. Security let her in easily enough, though they raised an eyebrow at her choice of clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped inside, Claire found herself in a trendy, but relatively quiet, establishment. The customers here mostly seemed to be college age, and for the moment, nobody was really giving her a second glance.<i> I guess they're a body positive crowd.</i> A few groups of people were gathered at different tables around the room, some dancing drunkenly, others having hushed conversations...</span></div></div>",

Hopefully I can find her quickly. The less time I spend here, the better...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around the bar, Claire zoned in on an empty table in the corner. Waddling towards it, she found herself apologizing every couple of steps for her cumbersome hips, which insisted on colliding with people and tables alike. And her issues with her new hips and backside didn't end when she reached her table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What the hell is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down at the bar stool tucked nearly beneath the table, Claire sighed. She had barely managed to fit into her car, so the chances of her fitting her corpulent ass onto this stool were close to nil. Even so, she pulled it out and carefully lowered herself onto it. It creaked dangerously, obviously unused to supporting such a weight, yet it thankfully held. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alright, let's have a little look...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing her eyes, Claire moved her gaze from person to person, searching for India. After inspecting everybody in the bar twice and some lookalikes thrice, she was forced to admit defeat. Just looking for her wasn't working, meaning she'd have to actually do her job and ask questions. Hauling her bulk to her feet, she slowly made her way to the bar, once again apologizing to those she accidentally bumped into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce stood at the bar, Claire waved at the bartender. A young man with a mop of blonde curly hair atop his head nodded and, after pouring a drink for another patron, rushed over, a friendly smile on his face. \"I was wondering if you could help me find somebody. Have you seen... this girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender inspected her phone, his expression neutral. After a moment, he smiled sadly and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry, can't say I have,\" he apologized. \"We get a lot of students through here. She a part of any clubs or anything like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh, I don't think so...\" Claire scratched the back of her head. \"She recently started working at the Expansive Candy Factory as a Taste Tester, if that helps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, her!\" The bartender snapped his fingers. \"Yeah, I know her! That picture's a little out of date, so apologies for not recognizing her immediately. She was here... Maybe an hour ago? Said she was heading home to grab something, then she'd be back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anything else you can tell me?\" Claire asked. \"Her address, any friends here I can talk to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I mean, I know her address, but that's not something you just hand out, you know?\" He replied with a shrug. \"I can tell you that that factory pays extremely well. Like, '<i>the expensive stuff every drink</i>' kinda well. Kinda makes me wonder why I'm slaving away here, rather than just chomping candies for money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If only he knew what those candies were capable of</i>, Claire thought to herself dryly. <i>He does know her address, though... If I play my cards right, maybe I can get her address from him. Otherwise, I guess I'm waiting for her to turn up...</i></span></div></div>",

Even so, she found herself bumping into more people than she would've liked, her flabby form wider than she originally anticipated. <i>Finding India in all this might be a bit harder than I thought...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing past a giggling couple, one of whom stopped giggling to shoot her an irritated glance, Claire found herself standing at the bar. Aside from the bartender, who seemed busy on the phone, only one other person was sat at it. As they sported a rather curvy figure, Claire paid them little mind as she made her way up to the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Excuse me?\" Resting her thick arms on the counter, she leaned forwards and waved at the bartender. It took him a few moments to finish talking, but he eventually wandered over to her, obviously annoyed at having his call interrupted. \"Sorry to interrupt, but I was wondering if you'd heard of a girl called India?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, I've heard of her...\" The bartender grunted in response. \"That's her, sitting right there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing his gesture, Claire stared at the curvy girl sat at the other end of the bar. With a raised eyebrow, she pulled her phone from her pocket and searched up India's profile on Facebook. She looked down at the smiling, petite girl, utterly bewildered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That... That's India?</i> Claire thought to herself, looking again at the lone figure. <i>She's so... Well, she isn't small anymore, that's for sure!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndia's figure had blossomed greatly, her chest and backside especially. Each of her round breasts, clad in a low-cut green tank-top, looked to be double the size they were in her profile picture, easily on par with a ripe watermelon, while her denim shorts struggled to hide her bulging ass cheeks. As Claire looked closer at her, she noticed that it wasn't just her assets that had grown, but her belly as well. It was only a slight bulge, not very noticeable at first glance, but it was definitely there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She definitely doesn't look 140 pounds heavier</i>, Claire noted as she started towards her. <i>She doesn't look like she even comes close to weighing that! Hopefully that means the factory has some way of reversing the growth caused by their products... Now, how do I go about this? Can't just walk up and say I broke into the factory...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey-ho! Need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire blinked, unaware that she was just standing staring at India. Clearing her throat, she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh, yeah... India, right?\" Claire asked, breathing a sigh of relief as India nodded. \"Great, so... You work at the Expansive Candy Factory as a Taste Tester, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndia lifted her drink and took a swig before answering...</span></div></div>",

Whether she worked at the factory currently or not didn't really make much difference; it was information on what exactly had happened there that the journalist was interested in. \"Oh...\" she said, trailing off for a moment as she tried not to sound too curious. \"Didn't work out at the factory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndia shook her head before taking a sip of her drink. \"Oh, it was only temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was the exciting world of taste testing?\" Claire asked with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was fine,\" India said, a hand dropping to the bulge of her stomach and rubbing it gently. \"I'd had about all the candy I needed though, heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have any bad side effects or anything like that, did you?\" Claire asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...not at all...\" India looked uncomfortable. \"Anyway, I better go...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs India rose from her seat, Claire panicked. She would normally have kept her composure, but the thought of losing her when she was so close to an answer sent her into crisis mode. \"Wait, I...I know what goes on there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndia froze, looking over Claire with more detail, taking in her chubby form with new awareness. \"I...I don't know what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire leaned in closer, lowering her voice to as much of a whisper as she could over the loud music playing above their heads. \"I'm a journalist, I was working on a story about the factory and managed to sneak in for a closer look, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate something,\" India said, knowingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded, blushing slightly. \"It was just chocolate but...I've gained about one hundred pounds in a single day. I've never been fat in my life and now...\" Claire gestured to her bloated body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndia looked around suspiciously before leaning in closer. \"You shouldn't have done that, even the taste testers were warned about the potential side effects,\" she said. \"Although they didn't tell us it was going to have the effect it did...luckily they could change us back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's eyes lit up. \"So there is a way to reverse this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndia nodded. \"Yeah, but...it's only for the testers, I don't think they make that stuff available in their stores or anything. They just used it on us to keep us quiet, then paid us off. I shouldn't even be saying any of this...it's violating my NDA...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this stuff? How do I find it? I need to change back!\" Claire asked desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndia shook her head. \"I don't even know, but...we still have to take it every day. They didn't say how long for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's eyes widened. \"India...do you...do you have some of this stuff? Could you give me some of your supply?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could give you a few...\" India said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curvy girl reached into her handbag and pulled out a small packet of pills. She tore a strip off and handed it to Claire. \"Here, just take one a day for a week. There's six there, so that should last you. I need the rest for now until my body changes back to normal and they only top up our supply once a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, thank you, thank you so much,\" Claire said, shoving the strip of tablets into her pocket. She pulled out her business card and handed it to India. \"Listen, take this, if there's anything else you can tell me, it would be really helpful. They shouldn't be doing this to people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndia nodded and pocketed the card. \"Listen, I have to go...I've already said too much.\" She slipped her considerable booty off the stool and disappeared off into the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire breathed an immense sigh of relief and immediately turned and hurried back to her car, where she immediately opened up the tablets and swallowed her first one, hoping it would take effect sooner rather than later...</span></div></div>",

Realizing that this means that she is captive in some form, Claire\u2019s mind forcefully waking up her senses so she has some idea where she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? Where am\u2026.I?\u201d Claire says before her speech escapes her as shapes finally form in her vision. First she saw various vials filled with different colors as well as computer speeding through an analysis, various equipment is going off as people in white lab coats, some coated in fluids and some brownish stuff that seemed to be chocolate rush in every direction. Normally one would be able to hear all of this but the short haired redhead notices that she is in the center of a thick glass box, while there was some metal that built the frame everyone could see inside it. Finding her strength, Claire stands up putting more power than needed, almost flying forwards as she sees thick metal cuffs binding her hands together and a chain leading to the roof of the cage she finds herself in. <b>\u201cWOOOAH!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is then that Claire gets a good look at her body since waking up, her body had lost a lot of weight based on how loose the sweats she was wearing. Due to her previous immense size, the elastic material had been stretched out making the legs look like a tent. The waistband is precariously on her waist making Claire sigh in relief at her lower half being covered. Looking at her arms she still sees a layer of pudge on it and her cheeks feel much the same. Her stomach was not toned as it was as layer of fate causes it to distend out slightly; her breasts were a bra size too big as they swim without support in the oversized sweater of her former boyfriend. Her butt is much the same in the now too big sweats as she can feel the fat clinging to it as if to remind her of her previous condition. She tries to use her hands to examine her body by touch but the chain get tight as it gets closer to her body, only barely allowing her fingers to feel her still softer and larger chest. The chains don\u2019t allow her at all to feel her face, refusing to budge any closer.<i>\u201cI must still be at least ten possibly up to twenty pounds over my usual weight. But this is a lot better than before\u2026.to bad I can\u2019t be happy about it.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looks up after the examination of her body, seeing that the sliver metal chain is basically a leash in a cross shape, allowing the captive to at least walk the entirety of the room while also allowing any visitors a good length to keep away from her. Just as she starts to take a few steps to examine her glass prison as well the wall in front of her opens with a mechanical sound, making her green eyes look towards it as she sees one of the lab coated people enter. Underneath the lab coat is a business suit making Claire realize that this must be someone of reputation. \u201cWho are you\u2026.where am i?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I am Sloan Ridge, legal representative of Ms. Elena Rows\u2019 Expansive Factory and the sub division of the lab you find yourself in.\u201dThe black hair man says, his face stiff and business like. \u201c And you, Claire Peterson of Spring  Gazette, is in a predicament.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that. You do know that kidnapping is a crime right?\u201d Claire shakes the cuffs on her wrists, making the chain extend and distend back repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if that person trespasses on company property and consumes some of our experimental product it is not. Especially with the latter crime, Ms. Peterson. \u201c Sloan fixes the glasses on his face, a small smirk adorning his handsome face. \u201c You are now stuck here till we deem you \u2018safe\u2019 enough to leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Safe</i>\u2026..that\u2019s a load of bull if I ever heard one.\u201d Claire says with defiant growl, wishing she could cross her arms. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me her against my will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, my fair lady, is where you are wrong.\u201d Sloan says slowly as if to drive a point as he procures a paper and shows it close enough to his captive to see after toddling a few steps on her leash. It was a paper for her temporary leave from her job!\u201d You see the government allows us to do as we wish, but we have to make sure that any treated person is safely\u2026taken care of after their time with us. That also calls for journalists who happen to not know their place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d Claire could not believe what is happening. <i>\u201cThey are involved with the government somehow? It also makes sense why India was so happy to give me over to them. Following them and allowing them to test and play with your body must be a killer pay! Still\u2026.this is not right.\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cSo where are the papers you have stolen? We cannot allow any leaks of what is going on here. Tell us and sign some paper promising to keep silent, and you can return to your ratty like life style. Keep quiet and we might just have to convince you before we get the legal means to enter your home and find them ourselves.\u201d Sloan shrugs, uncaring for the redhead\u2019s decision. Still he waits for Claire\u2019s decision. He doesn\u2019t have to wait long as Claire\u2019s journalist tendency for the truth comes through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI refuse! You  can\u2019t just experiment on people, even if you pay them to allow to do so!\u201d Claire refuses. Everything about this place is wrong; this is not a candy factory even if the candies they give out to the public are normal, who knows what would happen if they let something like the chocolate she had eaten!? <i>\u201cThe town would be in utter chaos\u2026.and the government would easily cover it up. This place needs to be torn down.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026.I expected you to refuse.\u201d Sloan says as he snaps his black gloved fingers a couple times as two expressionless researchers come inside with confident purpose, a man with black hair and a  fit woman with blonde hair who stood a couple inches taller than her lanky male partner. \u201c You see while everyone is a researcher in here, some of them are also part of the night shift guard. Just in case someone like you comes around.\u201d Taking a moment to turn toward the new, now smiling, duo behind him Sloan speaks, \u201c Megan, Jeffery, please do a <i>service</i> and allow Claire Peterson here to-\u201c<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

About halfway home, she was stopped at a set of traffic lights.

Her belly was the first to grow, pushing harder and harder against the wheel and making it increasingly difficult to turn it. Even when Claire spotted an empty lay-by, it was a fight to turn into it, her belly bulging into the wheel. Haphazardly parking, she fumbled for the door handle, barely managing to push her door open and squeeze herself out of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-Not again!\" Claire practically screamed, falling to her softening knees. \"W-What did I even do?! It c-couldn't be a third batch of chocolate, there was nothing about a third batch in the notes! So why?! Why am I growing again?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody answered Claire's question, leaving her to sob quietly into her hands and continue to grow. She refused to look at herself, closing her eyes and relying on her clothes to tell her just how big she was getting. A cold chill gradually slipped up her belly as her top inched up, while the waistband of her pants dug tighter and tighter into her widening hips. After a few minutes that felt closer to hours for poor Claire, her growth came to an end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I don't look, I won't see how big I've gotten! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her eyes still closed, Claire groaned loudly as she stood. She felt so much heavier than she had ten minutes ago. She didn't want to look, but she just had to know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How big am... I... Oh, God...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stared down at herself, mouth hanging open in pure shock. While looking down, her breasts now dominated her vision, each one like a rippling lake of flab barely contained within her top. The curve of her pale belly was clearly visible over her tits, a quick inspection with her meaty hands revealing that it was incredibly round, reaching out before her like a small mountain, and strangely firm. And then there was her lower half, which was completely hidden from her eyes. Gently proding at her backside, she whimpered as she felt the entirety of her ass jiggle. Her thighs were pressing against one another, and continued to do so no matter how wide she stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've gotta be near, if not past, three hundred pounds!</i> Claire thought to herself, a hand resting atop her gut. <i>Two hundred pounds in one day... What the hell is that factory up to?!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gripping her new gut, Claire's shock at suddenly having put on another one hundred pounds slowly began to subside, a heavy feeling of loss washing over her. Falling to her tubby knees, Claire watched her belly quiver from her fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, I'm just so...</i> She sighed, arms falling to her sides. However, as her hips had widened considerably, they were forced out slightly. Claire glared silently at herself, sadness giving way to anger. <i>There's no third batch, which means those pills India gave me... She did this to me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl, Claire pushed herself to her feet. Waddling to her car, she threw the seat back as far as it could possibly go and, with numerous grunts, groans and complaints about her size, managed to squeeze herself into her car. It was an incredibly uncomfortable fit, with her backside spilling over the edges of her seat, making it difficult for her to reach the handbrake and change gears, while her belly pressed heavily into the steering wheel. Even so, she managed to set off, albeit with a few tougher changes and lurches as her thicker feet struggled with the pedals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Watch out, coming through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire lumbered towards the Rowdy Bull, people quickly parting before the three hundred pounds redhead. A few chuckling students failed to see her approaching, only to find themselves forced aside by a large wobbling belly. The bouncer, the same one as earlier, recognized her and stepped aside, a frown on his face. Once inside, she stormed towards the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, you!\" She pointed angrily at the bartender, who was quickly finished serving a couple of giggling girls and strode over. Before he could even open his mouth, Claire was talking. \"Tell me where I can find India. Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry, Ma'am,\" He grunted. \"Can't just tell you where she lives\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My name is Claire Hawkins, a reporter with the Spring Gazette,\" Claire explained impatiently. She hadn't planned to reveal who she was, but she also hadn't been planning to put on an extra hundred pounds. At this point, she just didn't care. \"India is an important part of my next story, and I need to find her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender sighed, his shoulders slumping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"God, why do I always get the weird ones?\" He grumbled to himself. \"Fine, just don't mention this to anyone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a nearby napkin and a pen, he scribbled down an address and handed the napkin to Claire, who snatched it from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddress in hand, she rushed out as fast as her body would allow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course she'd live in the student village...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into a parking space, Claire squeezed out of her car. While a few students lived in Spring Falls itself, the majority could be found living in the SFC Student Village. Glancing down at the crumpled napkin in her hand, Claire began to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's see here... Orwell, Flat 208. Well, that's awfully convenient!\" Claire mumbled to herself, pausing in front of the building next to her. She had familiarized herself with the majority of the buildings in the village, and she had just so happened to park near Orwell. Waddling towards the door, she attempted to open it, only to find it locked. With a frown, she crouched down, pulling a clip from her hair. \"Slip that in here, jiggle, jiggle... And I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the door open, Claire headed straight for the elevator and took it to the second floor. Thankfully, nobody saw her lumbering through the halls. She definitely didn't look like a student, and she couldn't afford anymore encounters with the Village Security. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"206, 207, 208!\" Claire paused in front of the door, pocketing her napkin and rapping on the door...</span></div></div>",

It seemed to take her a moment to really register that Claire was looking considerably larger than she had been earlier, and her eyes bulged in shock as she took in the reporter's swollen body. \"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?!\" Claire exclaimed, incredulous. \"I took those dam pills you gave me, expecting them to work, and instead I immediately gained another thirty pounds!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndia, looking thoroughly surprised, ushered Claire inside her room and quickly closed and locked the door behind her. \"But the pills work, I've been taking them for a few weeks now and I've never had a relapse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you gave me the wrong pills, tricked me or something!\" Claire insisted, her chubby face reddening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that? I didn't even know you were going to run into me!\" India argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I guess that's true,\" Claire said, relaxing slightly. \"But...but...the pills must have done this to me! I didn't eat any more of the chocolate, so there couldn't have been another reaction from that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might just need to go and confess what you did to the factory,\" India suggested. \"I just gave you what they gave me. Maybe you had a bad reaction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a little more than a bad reaction,\" Claire said with a sigh. Her clothes had grown much tighter since her last growth, and even her once oversized sweats had shrunk around her hefty body. The bottom of her gut hung out from beneath her top, having started to sag down, while the top of her ass was now visible over her pants. \"I'm so fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, sit down, maybe this will get worse before it gets better?\" The college student suggested as she lead a sad looking Claire over to the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sat down, her body filling up more than one seat and bulging onto the second so that India could not sit comfortably beside her and sat to perch on the arm of the chair. Her stomach bulged out into her lap, reaching her knees, and her top rode up even further, exposing her huge, round belly. Claire had to tug heh sweater down and hold it in place to conceal herself. Claire appreciated India's effort to console her, but she was not convinced that confessing to her breaking and entering was the way to solve this and was concerned it might just make matters worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still wasn't totally sure that India was even telling her the truth. The girl could have lied to her about the pills and given her something totally fake to get her to go away. She seemed innocent enough, but Claire had learned not to be too trusting...</span></div></div>",

For a few moments, nothing happened, other than Claire's considerable belly letting out a hungry grumble. As she stroked it with a meaty hand, India shivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"G-God, such a weird sensation...\" India groaned as her body gurgled. Her breasts began to shrink down, quickly halving in size, while her belly receded back into her torso, becoming flat. Her hips cracked inwards, leaving her with the barest hint of a feminine figure, while her plump rear end deflated, leaving her with the petite figure Claire recognised from her Facebook. \"Urgh... S-See? They work for me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then why did I blow up like a balloon?\" Claire wondered aloud, shifting slightly as India slid her slim frame onto the sofa. \"Was there anything unusual when they gave them to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not really,\" India answered with a shrug. \"Just the usual stuff they tell you when you get new pills. Take one every week, don't take more than one in a weekly period, etcetera. Maybe... Maybe they only work for the people they're prescribed to? Only thing I can think of, really\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That would make sense,\" Claire mused, stroking her second chin in thought. \"You aren't meant to take medication that isn't for you, after all. Or maybe... Is the medication experimental as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wouldn't surprise me,\" India chuckled. \"Some of the stuff in there is seriously weird. You think the chocolate is bad, you clearly didn't dig around enough. That other girl, Lana, and I were the only two on chocolate duty. Some other girls ended up with massive chests, backsides, bellies... A couple of people ended up with extra limbs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm glad I didn't dig around then...\" Claire sighed in relief. Being her size was bad enough. Being her size and having two heads or a third arm or something sounded awful. \"Well... If we go with the first theory of don't take medication that isn't meant for you, I suppose I'll need to go see them to get some for myself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Guess so,\" India smiled sadly. \"Sorry I couldn't help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nah, it's no problem,\" Claire grunted as she stood and tugged her too back down. \"And if you feel like talking about your experiences at the factory, I wouldn't mind an interview. Here's my card\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping a card with her name and work number on it, Claire waddled towards the door...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leaving the halls somewhat despondent, Claire headed back to her car. The pills hadn't worked, and her condition only seemed to be getting worse. It really wasn't looking good at the moment, and she didn't really want to hang around and see what happened next. If the pills worked for India, then there had to be something that would work for her. As she squeezed her pudgy body back into her car, and her stomach filled her lap as she sat down, Claire decided she would need to face up to her earlier crime. There was no choice left. She would have to return to the factory, tell them what she did, and ask for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did, unfortunately, present way more danger to her career. She had essentially broken and entered, then stolen corporate property, so they could easily file charges against her, which would likely spell the end for her career...but then again, was eating chocolate really a crime? She could just as easily argue that the factory hadn't taken precautions, and that their testing methods were unsafe. The more she thought about it, the more Claire realised she was in a pretty good bargaining position after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving at her new size was something of a hassle. Claire didn't know how overweight people coped in cars; her belly was pressing into the steering wheel, her breasts all but obscuring her view of anything beneath them, and her ass overflowed the sides of her seat. She felt absolutely huge, and wondered how much she actually weighed at this point. Easily over three hundred pounds now...at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving her car to the front gates of the factory, she took a deep breath and pressed the intercom. \"Uh...hello? Is anyone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am, can we help you?\" Came a male voice over the intercom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'd like to speak to someone in charge please, I ate some experimental chocolate when I was at your factory earlier and...I'm having a bad reaction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a few moments, before the male voice spoke again. \"Okay ma'am, please come in, park near the entrance. Miss Exco will see you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The owner will see me? What the hell?! Maybe I can actually get an interview out of this? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gates opened up, and, oddly excited, Claire drove her car to the front entrance and clambered out awkwardly. She groaned audibly as she swung her legs out of the car and pulled herself up. Her sweater rode up over her belly button as her flabby gut spilled out and she got to her feet. Tugging the sweater back down awkwardly, and holding it in place, she hurried inside, where the security guard was waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, if you'll come with me,\" he greeted amicably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded, more than a little nervous. She was dreading the reaction she was about to receive...but maybe it wouldn't be so bad? Maybe they would just pay her off and give her some medication? She hoped that would be all. Leaving her with a lawsuit, or worse, nothing at all...would be a nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they turned a corner and went through a set of double doors, Claire was greeted by a young, attractive woman in a navy blue dress. She was very pretty, with striking eyes and bright pink hair which was cropped above her shoulders, not unlike Claire's own style. To Claire's relief, she smiled warmly. From the pictures Claire had seen during her investigation, she knew this rising star and head of the company, Elena Exco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry to hear you've had a bad reaction to our product,\" the woman said. \"I was working late and when security told me there was someone here asking for help, I decided to come and meet you myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Claire said. \"That's really kind of you. I uh...may have some explaining to do...you see, I'm a reporter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Elena said, dismissing security with a wave of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Claire said, her usual confidence faltering slightly. \"I was actually planning to do a story on your factory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" Elena said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Claire blushed as her sweater rose up again, her belly struggling to stay hidden. \"I actually visited the factory earlier, well...snuck in...basically. I just wanted to have a look around and I happened to stumble upon some chocolate samples and well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena didn't seem phased by the confession, instead nodding along sympathetically. \"Oh dear, I do hope you didn't try anything we were trialling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...actually did do exactly that,\" Claire confessed, her face going red. \"I ate some chocolate from one of your labs and I seem to be gaining weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena looked shocked. \"Oh my goodness, what on earth was that chocolate doing left out? Our products are so delicious, of course someone would be tempted by it! I will be having a serious word with my testing team. Please, come with me, lets see what we can do for you...\"</span></div></div>",

Nothing had been said about her breaking in, which probably wasn't a good thing. At any point, Elena could turn around and press charges, which would inevitably lead to her losing her job. Being fat and jobless... She could imagine little worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, I have to ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire jumped, her entire body quivering, as Elena suddenly spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You only trialled our chocolates, yes?\" Elena asked, turning right down another corridor. \"You didn't decide to mix and match?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"U-Uh, no... But I did try to reverse this myself...\" Claire immediately regretted her words as Elena came to a stop, the young woman turning to eye her curiously. \"I did a busy of research and found a couple of women who, you know, worked for you as Testers. I tracked one down after leaving, thinking they'd have some sort of cure or something\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Testers, you say?\" Elena tapped her chin twice before snapping her fingers. \"Ah, that would be Lana and India, yes? They were the two assigned to the chocolates, if I'm not mistaken\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yeah...\" Claire nodded, impressed that she was able to recall their names just like that. From what she had read, Expansive Candy was a rather big company, easily over five hundred employees. Being able to recall two names was no small feat. \"A-Anyway, they had pills or something, and I thought they'd help but... Well, they only made me bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, they would do that,\" Elena smiled sadly. \"The pills we issued to them were meant for their use only. If anybody else were to try them... If I'm honest, I don't quite know what would happen. We didn't really think to test the cure on others. Perhaps I should suggest that to the Recovery Department... Ah, forgive me. We're here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing next to another set of double doors, Elena scanned her card, the reader beeping twice. Pushing the doors open, Claire waddled in, a massive room greeting her. One side of the room had a few beds, a makeshift living area and a small kitchen, while the other was dominated by various lab equipment. A single person, dressed in a clean lab coat, was sat on the sofa in the living area, sipping away at a steaming mug and watching a small TV. Upon hearing Claire and Elena enter, they jumped to their feet, brushing a few crumbs from their coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Miss Exco!\" The doctor, revealed to be a young woman, smiled brightly. \"Always a pleasure to see you! But what brings you here so late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Doctor Doran, working late again, are we?\" Elena glanced towards the TV, a slight smirk in her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ahaha...\" Doctor Doran chuckled weakly, rubbing the back of her head. \"Y-You know how it is... Who is this, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is Claire,\" Elena said, turning to look at her. \"She's a reporter, but unfortunately, she had a run in with one of our trials. CH-02, from the looks and sounds of it. If you would be so kind as to whip her up a few pills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course, right away!\" With a mock salute, the doctor bounced towards Claire, gripping her by the hand and leading her towards the lab equipment. \"So, Claire. I can call you Claire, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure, that's fine,\" Claire replied, her usual confidence gradually returning to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Great! If you could take a seat, I can get what I need from you!\" Doctor Doran smiled, gesturing to a wide armchair. As Claire collapsed heavily into it, she fetched a syringe, carefully unwrapping it. \"You've got nothing against me taking a small bit of blood, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, go right ahead,\" Claire held out her arm, allowing the carefree doctor to jab the needle into her arm and extract a bit of her blood. \"Can I ask what for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, you could, but then you'd have to be detained,\" Doctor Doran replied cheerfully. \"Anyway, just give me a few moments and you'll be back to normal! For a while, anyway. The pills are only a temporary solution while we perfect the reversing serum\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young woman danced around the lab, Claire did her best to observe. Unfortunately, the Doctor made sure to hide what she was doing, meaning she caught very little. After a couple of minutes, the doctor returned, a pill in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is the test pill. If this works, I'll create a full strip for you and save the details and such in case you need a top-up,\" Doctor Doran explained as Claire took the pill from her.

Hitting the fifth fistful of chocolate in one hand she begin to lick her fingers clean, hoping by eating what remains in her hand this mad craving for chocolate will disappear from her body. Melted milky brown sweetness went down her arm staining her black hoodie. Some didn\u2019t even make it down her throat and dribbled off her chin as she nosily licks her hand similar to a cat.  Even her tight black pants were not spared as her slowly curving gut became noticeable nor her short red hair has even a few dark specks as her face becomes messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ah</i>\u2026<i><b>hmgh</b></i>\u2026\u201d Claire groans in frustration as she allowed herself to consume so much chocolate.

Her body, the heat radiating from her stomach to the tip of her fingers to her very toes, starts to sweat as dull throbbing starts. Holding the rail as her tight filled stomach gurgles and groans in frustration at not having more candy of any kind inside it. Her mind thinks of numerous kinds of candy trying hard to drive her to the nearest candy pit but somehow the twenty-seven year old woman somehow manages to fight back from such madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have eaten that damn muddy shit!\u201d Claire curses herself then her stomach seemingly as it releases a grumble of protest at insult of the chocolate.

Her breasts were about average, about B cups, just large enough to notice. However the breasts in the mirror were much larger about C cups heading towards D cups. Looking down Claire realizes that this is no mirror trick. Her hoodie was loose on her chest but now it defined her hefty breasts, the zipper forced down, showing off her white shirt partially. Her stomach groans, shrinking back to it\u2019s former size as her breasts grow even larger, getting extremely close to D cups as the redhead grabs them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2026.are bigger. Much bigger.\u201d Claire says robotically as she bounces them in her hands, they were heavier but the sound of something sloshing inside them makes her stop. She bounces them once more, ignoring their increased sensitivity, making sure she heard and felt right. \u201cI have\u2026.milk\u2026or something inside them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHow the hell can those chocolate cause all this?\u201d</i> Claire thinks as she moves along the catwalk to a normal looking hallway, getting used to the heavier weights on her chest. Her bra was tight and her flesh was over flowing from all sides based on feeling. It was uncomfortable and Clair wanted to fix it but she has no idea where exactly where she is at. There is no doubt she is in the testing area at least. But exactly where in the Testing Area? Or maybe she is another part of the factory now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cGod I am lost and <b>still</b> hungry\u2026.those chocolates\u2019 effects are probably not going to leave anytime soon now.\u201d </i>Claire had no idea how hungry she was as her flat and toned stomach was back.

Her stomach releases a growl as more meat travels there.\u201cMuch better and much healthier\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her snack break done, Claire decides to continue her exploration of this factory and their strange product. Any normal person would have left, considering themselves blessed just leaving  with a bigger bust. However Claire was no normal person but a determined one that wanted to get the bottom of this strange factory. <i>\"Once I get some more evidence about this place and publish it publicly. This place will be torn done faster then a thunder strike.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire moves onwards, trying not to think or notice her slightly bigger bust or her growling stomach as it works overtime to convert the food into her breasts and whatever is inside them.  Her breasts seem slightly bigger and heavier as her stomach growls to Claire\u2019s annoyance. <br>\r\nJust then-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sound of boots is getting closer and closer altering Claire. <i>\u201cShit,shit, I got to hide quickly!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not many places to hide in the area she was in so she did the next best thing. On the side, similar to the chocolates that have caused any food she eats to go straight to her breasts and fill with a mysterious fluid, there existed a small table. It was wide enough to hide her body and hopefully her stomach will be quiet long enough so the security force is able pass by. Holding her breath and ignoring the feeling her bigger and heavier breasts Claire crawls underneath the table as the sounds of footsteps finally get close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you saw someone with the experimental chocolates?\u201d The sound of a woman says as she step in front of the table where Claire is hiding. The redhead could not make out any distinct features due to only seeing the black boots she was wearing. However she could tell that the woman seemed oddly\u2026.pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep and considering things on the video I saw they consumed quite a bit of it as well.\u201d A man speaks nearby, the voice distinctly familiar to her ears. The sound of gurgling comes from stomach, making Claire stiffen in fear of being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GROWLLLL*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear something?\u201d The woman says, her emotions seemingly alert. Claire herself paled, putting a hand on her flat stomach hoping that would cease any more noises. However it only seems to help bluster it as another hungry gurgle comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GURRRGLE*<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cProbably just the machines you know how the guys keep some of them going.\u201d The man with the familiar voice says before stepping forward. \u201cWell it\u2019s a good thing someone came and ate some the testing product. The higher ups were getting bored ad heck we were getting bored, right Elizabeth?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHm yeah\u2026.to be honest I rather like this approach. We attract some noisy people and show them a weakness and the company gets to try their new products.\u201d The man sighs. \u201cWe also get to experiment as well. A win-win for everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cSave the poor sap who came here. Even if they did come they did trespass on private property we can charge them publicly if they try anything they did<i> take </i>our product. Plus we might just be the only ones to <i>help</i> them. Who did you get this time Jeff?\u201d</i> The woman giggles and asks as Claire connects the dots\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GRRRRRRROWWWWL*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fit redhead woman\u2026.decently built and prideful trying to become something big. The usual journalist around here.\u201d The words describing the hiding redhead the man speaks of makes Claire realize everything. This was a trap! From the very beginning! The lack of guard was only portrayed so Claire would get cocky and confident then make a mistake when she relaxed, which she did if her boobs have anything to say about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of hunger come from Claire as her shock changes to anger. Part of her wants to kick the butts of these two guards but she can\u2019t be found. Also who knows what they are planning to do with her once they get their hands on her. \u201cThere are others too\u2026who knows what has happened to them. Perhaps I should retreat for now and come back better prepared?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the sounds of her stomach still did not attract the pair of guards\u2019 attention making her suspious  . The two seemed to be playing that something else was going but the journalist can tell they know she\u2019s hiding underneath their noses. They even pat the table she is under to see if she comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell either way we\u2019ll find them\u2026.or perhaps they might just find us. Let\u2019s get back to our rounds.\u201d Jeff snorts, Claire even sees part of his face glance down with a smile, a finely shaved graying beard adorned on it, all the proof she needed that she was found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing boss.\u201d Elizabeth say as the two walk away nosily before the steps fade away. Claire refuses to look , yet alone breath harshly for a couple minutes until she is sure the man and woman were gone from the area. Slowly and careful of her larger breasts Claire crawls out feeling like a kid caught with their hand in the cookie jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cJesus, the other two guards are right. Night crew is freaky. So does this company if what they said was true about the higher ups want the guards to let people in at night to test their product.\u201d </i>Claire looks down at her breasts and her growling stomach as she stands up to her full height.

She couldn't put her finger on what the smell was, but it seemed to be a combination of chocolate, sugar, fruit and any other variety of sweet treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room was bathed in a bright, multicoloured glow, which seemed to be emanating from beneath her.

They must be coming in,\" she said, slowly backing away as she started to think over her options. She noticed a few protective suits hanging on a rack on the other side of the catwalk and started to move towards them. Perhaps she could pass herself off as a worker if she put one on? Then again, maybe she should have been wearing one anyway, was it safe to be in here, inhaling the sweet, sticky fumes from the vats beneath her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way towards the suits, the catwalk creaked ominously under her feet...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the highest window at the Expansive Candy Factory, a young woman smiled down as a group of visitors were led towards the entrance to the factory. <i>Her </i>factory. Elena Exco, the chairwoman of Expansive Candy, was the daughter of wealthy industrialist Jonathan Exco, who had passed away in mysterious circumstances two years ago. Elena had been left her father's vast fortune in his will, and had, much to her detractors surprise, managed to turn around the fortunes of his small, failing company. Elena, with her business acumen, enthusiasm and passion for candy, had taken the company global in only a few months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the pieces were in place. The first factory was complete, stores opening up around this backwater town and customers eager to get their hands on her product. Elena couldn't wait to see the results. Once this town was hooked, she would move onto the next, and the next, and the next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena saw her guests filter in through the gates and prepared to greet them. She took a moment to admire herself in the mirror of her lavish, brightly decorated office. She was only 26, but already a titan of the industry. Framed magazine covers from Time were across her wall, from when she had won \"Youngest businesswoman of the century\" a few weeks ago. Due to certain...enhancements she had discovered in her candy's properties, she had been able to adjust her own body in exactly the way she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpansive Candy was no ordinary candy; it was manufactured with very special ingredients, discovered by her father, which, when consumed in refined form, could have a very significant effect on a person's body and metabolism. Elena, through trial and error, had found this out, and had been able to transform herself from a skinny geek to a gorgeous bombshell. She was particularly proud of her DD cup breasts and shapely bubble butt. Her stomach was perfectly trim and toned and she had even gained a few inches in height. She had dyed her hair purple, the signature colour of the company, and wore a white and pink striped skirt and purple tank top, which drew attention to her figure. She wasn't one for formality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unlike the candy that Elena had consumed to refine her appearance, the candy that her customers would be eating would be quite different. It was much more potent and uncontrollable, and would even effect their minds. She couldn't wait until she controlled the entire town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the elevator from her personal office to the ground floor, she stepped out to find her guests gathered around, waiting for her. There were four of them in total, all of whom had received a surprise invite to the factory for an exclusive tour. Elena had hand picked every one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first choice had been <b>Charlotte</b>, something of a minor celebrity - or as a close as you could get to one - in this town. Charlotte was gorgeous, with supermodel good looks and impeccable fashion sense. She had long, black hair a perfect figure; not quite as curvy as Elena's enhanced frame, but certainly one to make any woman envious. She looked like she belonged on a movie set, not a factory floor. Despite her good looks, however, she had struck Elena as a little shallow and vain. She was mostly just known for being an Instagram influencer, rather than doing anything particularly noteworthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside Charlotte was a couple who had been invited on the tour together, <b>Jenna </b>and <b>Matt</b>. Elena had chosen them due to their great physical fitness. Jenna was a pretty, blonde girl in her early 20's. She had, Elena discovered, been a cheerleader in high school, and now she was a champion swimmer. Matt, her boyfriend, stood the tallest of the group at just over six foot, and was lean and muscular. He worked as a personal trainer at the local gym, and it showed. He had chiselled good looks, a handsome face and, Elena had to admit, a great body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking like the odd one out was another girl, <b>Sophie</b>. Sophie had been chosen for the tour more due to Elena recognising her potential; she was a chef at a local cake shop, and had won awards for her recipes and designs. Cake wasn't exactly candy, but her creativity with icing, flavouring and sugar had appealed to Elena. Unlike the super fit Charlotte, Matt and Jenna, Sophie was a little shorter and less striking. She was very pretty, with a cute face framed by a thick pair of glasses and freckled cheeks. Her auburn hair was tied back in a pony tail, and she was looking around eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome!\" Elena said as she approached. \"You probably recognise me, of course, but I am Elena Exco, head of the company. You can call me Elena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte looked unimpressed. Matt and Jenna smiled politely, and Sophie let out a small squeal of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm sure you're all eager to get on with the tour, so let's get started,\" Elena said, ushering her guests towards the large double doors ahead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choose a character to focus on:</b></span></div></div>",

Why she had decided to choose that weird, multicoloured outfit was anyone's guess, but the girl clearly needed some fashion tips. Charlotte was still a little confused as to how she had even ended up on this tour; the letter with a free \"golden ticket\" had just randomly arrived in the post for her one day, and it wasn't like she usually blogged or live-streamed about candy. Her Instagram was usually holidays, clubs, make up and fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she wasn't complaining, it was a pretty exclusive invite, and if it brought her a few new followers, all the better. Charlotte had over 600,000 followers on Instagram, a twitch channel and an OnlyFans account where she posted lewd pictures of herself in skimpy outfits...or nothing at all. Her good looks had gotten her very far in life so far, and she usually took in a lot of money from her fans each month. Hopefully, she could attract some more revenue today with her live blogging the tour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte had opted to wear an outfit that drew attention to her body today, as usual. She was wearing a pair of hip hugging denim shorts which just about covered her butt, with a tank top that was tied in a knot beneath her perfect breasts, exposing that toned, tanned stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProducing her phone from her pocket of her denim jean shorts, Charlotte held it up and hit record. \"Hey guys!  Charlotte here, live from the new Expansive Candy factory. Guess who got a free tickettttttttttttttt?\" She smiled, showing her whitened teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Charlotte ,\" Elena turned around to face her. \"I'm going to have to ask you to put that phone away. Everything from this point on is classified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine,\" Charlotte sighed. \"You heard the lady guys, guess I'm just going to have to let you know more later, chao!\" She signed off and uploaded the video before continuing. She had no intention of just walking around here without taking any more pictures or videos. That would have made for a very boring day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, then onto the first part of the tour, the chocolate fountain!\" Elena declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte followed, alongside the others, as Elena pushed open another set of doors and led them into what looked like a large, artificial garden.

The group all spanned out and Elena occasionally walked over to someone's waving hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte occupied herself by going over to the grove It was if someone took the entire world's fruit supply and made an orchard for them.While there were only one bush,tree,or fern for each fruit, all of them seemed to be ready to harvest. But the fruits that were on the greenery shined a little, as if they were covered in sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a diorama? Some sort of artist work\" Charlotte thought. <i>\"Does it matter though, i'm going to get so many hits, oh wait.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Miss Elena?\" The tour guide walked over to the Instagram e-celeb. Charlotte pointed a thumb at the area. \"Why are the fruits all shiny? Are they fake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no dear, they are completely edible. These are our 'Candy Fruties' specially made and all around great. Actual fruits that taste much sweeter than their mundane counterparts.\" Elena explained. \"Our eggheads did their best to make a special genetically modified plant that not only mimics all fruit bearing flora, but give each and everyone of them this luxurious gleam. And not only that, but you can eat the skin as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled at Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can just.\" Charlotte began to reach over to grab a fruit, Elena interrupted this action with a quick 'tsk' from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, dear. If you want to eat some you'll have to give me a few moments to call in my workers. They'll prepare something quite delectable, but never eat a fruit straight from the branch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte nodded and complied, Elena smiled at the girl and quickly made a call to someone, turning her back on Megan as she took the call. Charlotte watched for a few moments until she looked back at the enticing fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What harm can one fruit do to me? She already said its edible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Charlotte picked what she'd stuff into her mouth...</span></div></div>",

It was a pear tree that stood proud and high and Charlotte wondered how would she get up to the branches. She scratched her chin for a bit and jumped back in shock as the branch lowered itself down towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..hello?\" She politely asked the tree. The branch drooped but didn't react to the woman's voice. The e-celeb took very precise steps until she could reach a hand towards the branch and pluck a fruit off. She jumped back,waiting for the sign that the tree was a sentient being. Nothing came from her theft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better get outta here.\" She mumbled. Placing the pear into her pocket, Charlotte made her way back towards the outer rim of the garden. There Elena stood tapping her foot up and down,her eyebrow raised as the woman approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Miss Elena, I was just trying to pick out my fruit for that 'delectable' food you were offering.\" Charlotte lied to the guide.Unbeknownst to her, Elena knew exactly what she had done. In some sealed off area of the facility, a small betting pool had been going to see what fruit Charlotte picked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena skillfully acted as though she believed that lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course! I do apologize if I seemed like I was admonishing you for your selection.\" Elena said.\"Have you've picked your course?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pear.\" Charlotte replied. Elena nodded at that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice, well it seems the rest of our little group has gotten enough of out gardens and would like to see where our 'magic' happens. We'll meet at the tail end of the chocolate river.\" Elena explained. She sauntered off with a smirk, Charlotte shrugged at that fact. With eager hands,and a much more eager mouth, she took a bite of the pear. Instantly her taste-buds were overwhelm, it was like eating pear plus one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte's bites became rapid chunk taking off of the pear, which she soon finished in under three minutes. She licked her lips and wiped her hands onto her top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go see the rest of this place.\" Charlotte announced before she expertly hid the core of the pear under some shadowed bushes.</span></div></div>",

Matt had made no secret of the fact that his ambition was to one day own and manage a gym in town. Jenna, however, was a little more uncertain as to what her future held. She had often been stereotyped as air headed in high school purely because she was on the cheer squad; but nothing could have been further from the truth, she had studied really hard, and got a first class honours degree in college...she just wasn't really sure what her future held now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Matt had first met when they noticed each other on their morning jog. After two weeks on running past one another, Matt had finally plucked up the courage to ask Jenna out, and she had immediately said yes, having been hoping he would do just that. They had been together ever since, and now lived together, having moved in just after graduating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had both been surprised to get the invite to the grand opening of the factory, and Jenna hadn't even really wanted to come, but Matt had suggested she take a break from planning her future career to have some fun. What exactly was fun about this place, however, she wasn't sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they passed through the doors, they found themselves in a large, open space resembling a huge garden. The room seemed to go on for miles, and she was amazed she had missed it when she first approached the building. Through the room, she noted that there were trees and bushes that seemed to be growing...candy? Candy canes stuck out of the ground, chocolate bars hung off the trees and candy flowers were growing on plants. There were also large, oddly shiny looking fruit growing everywhere; she spotted blueberries, strawberries and pears, just to name a few. </span></div></div>",

Jenna smiled at the suggestion,her previous talk with the man faded away in her mind. The couple paced over to candy section of the land ignoring the fruits all around them. They gaped at the selection of confectioneries all around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's that overthere?\" Matt questioned. Jenna followed the man as he led them farther into the candy flora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you see?\" Jenna asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked like something glowed behind all this stuff. It was like it was metal or something.\" Matt walked farther inwards and Jenna soon noticed how every plant seemed to grow larger the farther they traveled. The candy though got more exotic in appearance, though not to the point of being alien.White chocolate bars and mint chocolate candy canes were just some of the new sweets that were revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, I don't think we should be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they not cut this area off if they <i>didn't</i> want anyone to see it?\" Matt answered. Soon though the duo came to a large clearing, a brief shadow passed by the pairs eyes, but their view was quickly filled by the area in front of them. A large house, which seemed to be made of gingerbread, was built with a small pavilion in front of it. A decorated fountain was the epicenter of this clearing. Tables, though untended,were scattered around randomly. One chair and table was filled however, with a young woman drinking from a teacup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Jenna hesitantly introduced herself. The woman looked up from her cup and smiled, she placed it onto the table to greet the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you must be some of the contestants, I'm Alana, pleased to meet you.\" Alana dusted herself off to give the pair an open handshake. She was dressed in a modest pair of workshorts and a sun-flower shirt;Matt noted her seemingly curveless body compared to Elena,though didn't choose to vocalize that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this place?\" Jenna said. She sat down onto a chair, while Matt stood looking at the working woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is The Cabinet,though management has some gobbley-gook name for it. Its where we display our really sweet stuff, things that are not planted in the candy forest.\" Alana explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that where the candy for the factory is made?\" Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that's down the chocolate river, hopefully you'll see it during the tour. No, here is the place where our perfected goods are displayed.\" Alana took a sip of her tea. \"You can knock on the door if you'd like, Denise will gladly show you what we have in stock at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noted.\" Jenna spoke. \"But why change it out though? Who eats the candy or whatever else you have in there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us workers and the little gals. Ahh you don't need to worry about the little gals though, they won't bother you on the tour.\" Alana said nonchalantly. \"Oh if you'd like, we can have a small lunch together, I can phone in Elena to tell her where you two are at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and Matt shared a look, both pondered on what to do next.</span></div></div>",

She put away the walkie-talkie and continued to drink her tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gingerbread building would've been quite imposing if it wasn't, you know, made of <i>gingerbread.</i> Was the building actually made of gingerbread though? That didn't make it look structurally sound. But if the duo dwelled on that thought, they'd have question the candy forest that laid behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we knock or?\" Jenna asked until the door creaked open. The two jumped up in surprise, only to see a fairly tall woman peak her head out. She wore,of all things, a purple dress stylized to fit the candy themed surroundings. Her earrings were some sort of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome you two,I'm glad that two contestants have chosen to grace this humble abode.\" She stepped aside to allow the two in. The couple hesitantly walked in until the very calming looking interior made their journey inwards much less hair-raising.The smell of frankincense and hazelnut filled the air. Stairs that led to the second floor spiraled upwards. The two gaped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, lets get to the store,\" Denise interrupted their gape. The duo nodded and approached what was probably the store section of this building. Glass drawers and stands greeted them, signs were placed on top of the glass that read what candies they held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look around and tell me what you like,\" Denise said.</span></div></div>",

She had no idea what she had done to prompt the mysterious invitation, but she half hoped, if it wasn't too immodest, that her work had somehow drawn her to the attention of Elena and her company. She had been following the young company exec admiringly for some time, watching her rise to fame and success. They were the same age, and Elena was a role model of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sophie certainly took pride in her work, she had started to feel like her talents were a little wasted at work. Her creativity was stymied and her bosses were quite controlling. They often put down her more esoteric ideas and designs, wanting things that was more traditional  and conventional. Sophie was a shy girl, and didn't really have the courage to stand up to them. She had often found herself without much confidence. Even amongst this group, she felt a little invisible next to the glamorous Elena, sexy Megan and athletic Matt and Jenna.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when do we get to see how you make the candy?\" Sophie asked excitedly, sidling up to their hostess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your enthusiasm, Sophie,\" Elena winked at her with a smile. \"But patience, there's plenty to see before we get there. I really enjoyed your cake decorations, such creativity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie clasped her hands together and gave a happy little squeal. \"Oh my god, thank you so much.

And her parents had always said it was a waste of her talents going into this business. Ha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie walked on ahead, following the other's into the first room.

With a deep inhale, she prepared to fall forwards into its soft embrace, to drift off into a sweet, dreamless sleep that would leave her feeling refreshed and ready to try again for the fourth time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dorothea, I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the front door open, followed by the voice of her father, Dorothea halted her fall, pushing herself back onto her feet. With a smile on her face, she raced for her door, prepared to rush downstairs and see her father. As soon as her hand grabbed the doorknob...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you're coming down, don't forget to dress properly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"U-Uh...\" She paused, glancing down at herself. She was indeed dressed, however it wasn't what most people would call 'decent'. While her bottom half was clad in a pair of baggy pyjamas pants, she wore only a bra on her upper body, a bra that was getting rather snug around her ample chest. Grabbing the matching top, she hurriedly threw it on and ran downstairs, a wide smile on her face. \"Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father, who was busy rummaging around the kitchen, stopped just in time to get tackled by her. The duo chuckled between themselves for a moment before Dorothea pulled away, smile still on her face. However, it lasted only for a few seconds before vanishing, replaced with a stern expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dad, you're working way too late!\" She chided him, watching as he dug around in the fridge. \"I barely see you anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, I'm sorry, Dora...\" He apologized, pulling a container marked with his name from the fridge. \"I promise, I'll make it up to you. Right now, in fact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting his dinner off to the side, he moved to the table and picked up his bag. Unzipping it, he shifted some stuff inside before producing a transparent bag filled with various small objects. Handing it to Dorothea, she inspected the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Candy?\" She asked, recovering an affirmative nod in response. \"Well... I suppose it's something... Thanks, Dad\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving him another hug, she watched her father rush around the kitchen, a sad smile on her face. Since starting at that new candy factory, she had been seeing less and less of him, only really seeing him in the evenings or, occasionally, some mornings she managed to get up early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm off to bed, Dad,\" Dorothea finally said, inching towards the archway leading to the stairs. \"Don't stay up too late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I won't...\" Her father chuckled. \"Goodnight, Dora\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to her room, she quickly discarded her top and flipped down atop her bed, bag of candy still clutched in her hand. She eyed it for a few moments, curious about its contents. She had heard nothing but good things about the stuff that factory was producing. Normally she didn't like to eat anything sugary before bed, but surely a few candies wouldn't hurt?</span></div></div>",

She was an adult now, capable of controlling herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's see what I've got...\" Gently tearing open the bag, she poured its contents into her bed and began to pick through them. \"Chocolate balls, gobstoppers, strawberry laces, fizzy cola bottles...

It was perfectly smooth, a slight shine to its brown surface. Setting the chocolate balls off to the side, she returned the rest of the candies to their bag and set it atop her nightstand, making a mental note to share them with her class. Not everything in that bag was to her liking, and she wouldn't want to throw out perfectly good candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing one of the chocolate ball, she quickly unwrapped it, eager to taste it. Chocolate was a particular weakness of hers, especially milk chocolate. It was just so rich and creamy... And the way it melted atop her tongue, spreading its divine taste all around her mouth... Oh, how she loved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Down the hatch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the small sphere into her mouth, she allowed it to sit atop her tongue for a moment, softening the sweet treat slightly, before chomping down. The taste of caramel filled her mouth, pulling a delighted moan from her. Swallowing hungrily, she reached for a second one, eager to taste it again. The caramel was so sublimely sugary, the chocolate was so thick and milky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmm... Sho gud!\" Dorothea mumbled as she pressed three caramel ball into her mouth at the same time. She teased one with her tongue, rolling it around her mouth, while she pushed the other two to either side and allowed them to slowly melt. Falling backwards, she allowed her treats to dissolve in her mouth, eventually releasing their sugary innards. \"Ohhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, her eyes gradually fluttered shut, the sugar apparently having no affect on her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"More!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea slammed a fist down on the arm of her chair. The room around her shook and, seemingly from nowhere, small brown spheres rained down around her. With excited hands, she began to grab as many of them as she could, ramming them hungrily into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"More... More...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were the only words she could utter as she devoured more and more of the heavenly chocolate rain. With each handful, her hunger for more grew, her thoughts turned to the caramel balls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Gimme more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant ball landed in her lap, easily the size of her own head. Yet its size did nothing to deter her as she picked it up and dug in, quickly demolishing a hole in the outer chocolate layer to reveal the amber insides. Lifting it to her lips, she hungrily chugged the thick liquid, ignoring the bloating sensation in her midriff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n*<b>RIIINNNGGG</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea sat bolt upright as an alarm rang through her room. Glancing towards her alarm, her eyes went wide as she saw the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Half eight... I need to get ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping out of bed, she began to rush around her room. Pulling her pyjama bottoms off, she replaced them with a pair of denim jeans. Pulling on a black shirt and her favourite red leather jacket, she ran for the door, pausing partway to scoop up her bag. As she passed her mirror, she paused again, noticing something off with her reflection... </span></div></div>",

She had rather fair skin, not so light that people would think she spent all her time hiding from the Sun's rays, but not so dark that they'd think she spent every hour of every day bathing directly in them either. But rather than her pale, almost ivory, skin meeting her gaze, slightly tanned skin greeted her. \"W-What? Why am I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping closer to her reflection, Dorothea inspected herself. It was a noticeable enough change in hue, one that, upon further inspection, wasn't restricted to her face. A quick glance down her top revealed that her torso had also changed colour, looking more brown than white. Her hands, her legs, even her feet had all changed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"People don't just tan overnight!\" She said, scratching her arm just in case it rubbed off, which it didn't. \"And it doesn't even look like a tan! More like I've been this colour my whole life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at herself for another minute, Dorothea eventually shook herself from her thoughts. While the change was concerning, it wasn't affecting her in any discernible way. And she was running late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll check it later! For now, I need to get to class!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she ran from her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just in time!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping into her usual seat at the back of the room, Dorothea pulled her books from her bag and prepared for the lesson. After yesterday's failed attempts at beginning her assignment, she was looking forwards to this distraction. Her professor was a witty guy, always throwing around puns and metaphors that, once in a blue moon, broke her from her block. She just hoped that today was one of those days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good morning, class!\" Her professor, Doctor Griffin, strode into the room, a bright smile on his face. \"I hope everybody is ready for an enlightening session!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding behind his desk, he looked out over the room, receiving a few chuckles in response. The lights in his class had been broken for almost a week now, leading to no end of light based puns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Broken lights aside, lets begin with today's lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to teach, Dorothea relaxed, yesterday's issues with writing and her earlier worries over her newly browned skin vanishing into the back of her mind... </span></div></div>",

Usually, she was rather good at picking out the keywords and working out what they meant, but today... She just wasn't feeling it. With each reading, the words blurred closer and closer together until the page was one big black mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is up with me today?</i> Dorothea wondered, flipping back a page only to find it was just as blurry. <i>I'm just... so tired...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long yawn escaped her mouth as she sank into her seat. The benches the College provided for students were uncomfortable at best, receiving no end of complaints from people nursing numb backsides, but in her unexplainably exhausted state, the wood felt just right for a quick nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just... Just a few minutes... I shouldn't miss out on anything big...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another yawn, she leaned forwards, folding her arms atop the desk to form a makeshift pillow. Resting her head atop them, she did her best to focus on whatever Doctor Griffin was teaching but, before she knew it, her eyes had closed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright smile adorned Dorothea's face as her father strode into the kitchen. He clutched his usual brown briefcase in his left hand while the right held a large bag of familiar brown balls. Her smile only widened when she caught sight of the delectable treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"More candies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father smiled before disappearing in a puff of smoke, the bag falling to the ground and spilling its contents everywhere. Dorothea fell to her knees, extending her arms and gesturing for the candies to roll towards her. They all obeyed, changing directions and heading straight for her. Upon reaching her, they began to neatly stack atop one, forming layer upon layer until a pyramid consisting of caramel chocolate balls had appeared in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, so many chocolates...\" Dorothea inched towards the pyramid, the tip of the structure level with the top of her head. Reaching a hand up, she carefully plucked the top chocolate away, slowly unwrapping it and dropping the ball into her mouth. \"I forgot how good these tasted... I need more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing caution to the wind, Dorothea began to ferry chocolate after chocolate to her mouth. With each one she swallowed, her hunger only grew, demanding she eat more. She was all too happy to obey, now grabbing handfuls of the balls. She was barely even chewing anymore, intent on eating as much as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's it, fill me up! Fill me full of your sweet caramel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea moaned as the words left her mouth. She felt so incredibly full, yet she just couldn't stop herself from eating. As she reached the last layer of the once glorious pyramid, she fell forwards, landing comfortably atop something soft. Glancing down at herself, she caught sight of her rounding body. Her perfectly spherical belly, stuffed full of chocolate and caramel. Her thickening ass, each cheek round and hefty, rising high into the air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-Wait, what's happened to me?!\" The sight of her body broke her from her ravenous state, worry washing over her. Moving her hands down to her belly, she began to rub it, only to find doing so caused her skin to rapidly darken. With a scream, she yanked her arms away and tried to stand, however her legs refused to obey her. Her arms reached out, resuming their frantic feeding. \"Mmph! No more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body refused to obey, stuffing her with more and more candy. Ann's with each one, she swelled larger and larger, her body becoming increasingly spherical...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>=====</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea awoke with a jolt, startling the people sitting on either side of her. Ignoring their startled gazes, she sat up and rubbed her eyes, somewhat disoriented after her nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... I'm still me...\" Dorothea sighed in relief as she gripped her flat belly. \"God, what a weird dream... No more candy before bed for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her eyes again, Dorothea returned her attention to the front of the room, only for Doctor Griffin to conclude the lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll see everybody in a couple of days!\" He announced to the room. \"Remember, we'll be moving onto a new author next lesson, so make sure to decide which one you want me to cover! Goodbye for now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room began to pack up, all aside from Dorothea who was still trying to understand her weird dream...</span></div></div>",

It was almost like she just flew through her other three classes.  Dorothea goes to her car, a clunky old looking car in order to have home as her stomach goes off. <i>\u201cStrange I could have sworn I have eaten enough for lunch\u2026.\u201d</i> Dorothea thinks placing a tanned hand on her stomach and rubs it as if it would ease away her hunger.<i> \u201cEither way I better get going home, that package that ass told me about should be coming soon.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasing herself into the car as her stomach goes off yet again, Dorothea growls at her own hungry as she turns her car on and drives home. The short drive feels even shorter due to how good the day wise. Soon the tanned girl is front of her home with the sight of the post man\u2019s vehicle parked in front of her home. Pulling her car into the driveway, Dorothea barely gets a chance to make it a few steps away before the usual mail man, a large stocky guy with short black hair named Mike, uncharacteristically rushes towards her making her gasp in surprise. \u201cMike what\u2019s wrong?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Ms. Browne I am in a mad rush.\u201d Mike say as he pushes a decent sized package into her now full arms, either not caring or not noticing the change in the skin tone of one of his usuals. \u201cA lot of people have ordered from that candy factory your father works at.

With a sigh of relief, Dorothea takes off her top exposing her white lace bra to the world, it snugness showing that its owner really needs to stop being cheap and get some new undergarments before removing her pants and putting on a yellow fluffy pajama bottom with sleepy cartoon chicks printed all over it. For some reason she always found herself able to work harder and longer without something rubbing against her arms or stomach. Even when her father asked her long ago she was only able to tell him it just works for me to his dismay. \u201cAll set and ready to write that story of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already done her homework during lunch instead of hanging out with her friends, Dorothea instead gets to her collapsible laptop and turns it on, fully intent on making some progress with her story. It\u2019s her dream to become an author, what kind of dreamer would she be if she did try every day? \u201cOk Dorry this time we had a nice day so we should make some progress\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could however another thought occurs to her as her green eyes stare at the package, stomach growling and craving something sweet. <i>\u201cWell I did get sent these in order to eat them so I should have a couple while I work.\u201d</i> With those words Dorothea opens the box roughly, uncaring to the careful packaging of the company who made the confections as the spheres of chocolate reveal themselves; nearly tumbling out the packaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to tempt her more, her stomach gives a loud growl making the mostly brown haired girl blush in embarrassment, making her thankful that no one is here or can see her.<i>\u201dAlright let\u2019s satisfy my stomach and work at the same time\u2026.before I waste away or something for not indulging my sugary needs\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that small joke, the woman started her work on her personal project, Dorothea puts  the balls of chocolate and caramel into her mouth enjoying the sweet taste before swallowing it after it melted partially into her mouth. Suddenly having some real motivation to write, the tanned college student begins to type away every once in awhile snacking while making sure that her chocolate stained fingertips are wiped clean. Without her even realizing it, the author to be had already been snacking for some time while slaving away and before she knew it most of the box had been already eaten without her knowledge. Dorothea only stops what she is doing when-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With the speed she was typing at, there were a few spelling mistakes spread throughout her work, but she could always go back and fix them. And besides, what famous author didn't have a few errors with their first works?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've completed a chapter!\" Dorothea let out a joyous yell, a grin spreading across her face as she saved her work. \"Well, almost completed. But I can fix those little mistakes some other time. Now, I think a few chocolates are in order... Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching towards her box, Dorothea's hand found nothing, her fingers scraping against the bottom of the box. Frowning, she turned away from her laptop and grabbed the box, flipping it upside down in case she had missed something. Nothing but a few discarded wrappers fluttered out of the box, causing Dorothea to sigh heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw, man... I was supposed to save some for when I was done!\" Putting the box back together with considerably more care than she opened it with, she shut her laptop down, making sure she had actually saved her work before doing so, and got to her feet. \"Urgh... Who would've guessed eating an entire box of chocolates would leave you feeling so bloated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching her belly with both hands, she discovered that it had developed a slight curve to it, presumably due to her snacking. Wandering towards her mirror, she paused in front of it, turning to the side to get a better look at her midriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still not used to seeing me with a tan</i>, Dorothea eyed her skin for a moment before shifting her gaze down to her belly. <i>Yeah, looks like bloating. Should be gone by the morning! If not, well... I can always walk it off!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving her mirror, she gave her belly a couple of slaps. Doing so, however, forced a chocolatey burp out of her, each one louder than the last. After unleashing a belch that would've made her own father simultaneously proud and somewhat concerned, she wisely decided to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her work done, the rest of Dorothea's evening was rather dull. After cleaning up some of the rubbish strewn around her room, she returned to her computer and began to look for a replacement for her bra, only to give up ten minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I dunno, this one just feels right...</i> She thought to herself, staring at a rather lacy vibrant red bra. <i>I'll give it another couple of months...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her failed attempt at shopping, she found herself staring at Google, unsure if what she could do. She could always try more writing, but she didn't want to burn herself out this early. It was still rather early, so bed wasn't really an option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's just search something random...\" Hitting a random key on her keyboard, which turned out to be '<i>E</i>', a whole host of various results greeted her. \"Ebay, Etsy, Expansive Candy... Actually, I wonder what shows up if I search for them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking on Expansive Candy, a bright website greeted her. '<i>Expansive Candy</i>' was printed across the top of the screen, each letter resembling a piece of candy. There was a section showing some employees, the company mandate, a product section... The usual website stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wonder how much these chocolate balls cost?\" Dorothea navigated to her new favourite snack, her eyebrow rising as she spotted their cost. \"Wow, that much? Guess what Dad said is true, I do have expensive taste when it comes to snacks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling to herself, she shut down her laptop. With nothing else to do, she made her way downstairs, made herself something simple for dinner, made sure the front door was locked, and then retreated to her room. Grabbing her Kindle, she jumped into bed, ready to knock out a few chapters of the book she had bought recently. However, barely give minutes in, and an odd exhaustion washed over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright... Guess that's me for the day...\" Dorothea dropped her Kindle on her nightstand and, one hand resting atop her belly, slowly drifted off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

Her position waking up was on her side, a gift of a restless sleeper as her father would put it.  Releasing a groan, her green eyes welcome the partial ray of sunlight as she twists her body, noting that her midriff felt off with a curious hum. \u201cWha\u2026.ugh it\u2019s too early for this stuff. Can this wait for one minute body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling downward with a tanned hand, Dorothea\u2019s eyes widen in mild surprise that her stomach is still as bloated as it was before she drifted off to sleep her discarded Kindle laying on the floor from her movement from sleeping. However unlike the feeling of gas built up at night and her burping massacre, her gut now feels like there is something liquidly similar to something like mud. Underneath her fingers Dorothea can feel it move about when she presses gently on it. <i>\u201cOkay that\u2019s concerning\u2026.perhaps I am constipated? Or perhaps I am not done digesting the chocolates yet? I mean I did eat <b>a lot </b>of that chocolate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nEven if she was worried about her stomach, she still had to get ready for classes today. Thankfully she only had two classes making this day an easy day then to go find something to do. Her classes were not until late in the morning giving her some time to get herself awake, pumped, and possibly dressed properly. The room was dark so Dorothea stumbled toward her light switch, nearly tripping over her clothing from yesterday making her curse as she flips her switch before her eyes see her fingers seeing the new tan still on her. \u201c At least I am not darker or something\u2026.\u201d With that mumble Dorothea finds a white shirt not caring to change her bra just yet. She rather chose her clothing when she is more awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing a solution to this problem, the tanned possibly constipated college student goes to the bathroom hoping to splash some water in her face. She manages to do but notices something beyond the usual with her usual brown hair. The caramel colored stands on her scalp have extended making them notable on the top of her head. \u201cOkay,,,,this morning is just getting weirder and weirder. I mean hair does supposedly change a slight color when it gets long enough. Could I be getting sick?\u201d<br>\r\nPlaying with her messed up hair that was going left and right from her sleeping body\u2019s tossing and turning, seeing if she just got some caramel in her hair somehow during her snacking or some kind of color that needed to be washed out Dorothea wets and smoothes out her hair, seeing that it does not help her out. With a growl Dorothea does not want to call in sick as the second class is a class about writing history , and she hopes to get all she can from that particular class so she can improve her writing. <i>\u201cBut if I am getting sick maybe I should stay home\u2026.perhaps it\u2019s spreadable.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hum in thought, Dorothea walks to the kitchen seeing the destroyed box that contained the chocolate balls she relentlessly devoured. \u201cPerhaps this is an allergic reaction to this chocolate? No I saw what it was made of yesterday and everything looked normal enough\u2026.but still\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\nDorothea\u2019s mind wonders on this abnormal changes, not sure on what she should do exactly. She rather not stay home but it would beat people making her stay home. Staying home did have it\u2019s own perks as well such as being able to write and finish all her homework for the week. Those cho-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*GRRRR*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYes, stomach and getting another delivery of those candies too.\u201d </i> The mere thought of having those candies dance on her tongue makes her mouth water. <i>\u201c But first I need to wake myself up with a light breakfast.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final thought, Dorothea makes herself  toast with some jam on top of it, not wanting to make a hassle for breakfast. Soon the meal is made and quickly consumed by her, giving herself time to think. She did not know yet if she wanted to call in just yet. But just then Dorothea-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Drying her hands, she started towards it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Somebody knocking before ten?\" She hummed in thought before it hit her. Only one person ever visited before ten, though it tended to be a rare occurrence. \"Mike's here already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the front door, her hand was resting atop the knob, ready to open it, when she suddenly remember her clothing situation. With an anxious giggle and glance down at her practically uncovered chest, she grabbed a coat from the nearby rack and quickly covered herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Morning, Mike!\" Dorothea greeted the stocky mailman with a smile. \"Bit early for a delivery, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No such thing, Ms Browne,\" Mike responded, his mood noticeably better than yesterday. \"Anyway, if you could just sign here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigning her initials, Dorothea found a familiar box handed to her, its contents rattling lightly as she held it under her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks much!\" Mike thanked her, pocketing his signature device. \"See you tomorrow, Ms Browne\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yep, see you tomorrow!\" Waving farewell to him, Dorothea shut and locked the door behind her. Dropping her coat off at the rack, she returned to the kitchen, dropping her parcel atop the counter. \"More chocolates already? They're certainly prompt with their deliveries...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanning to leave the box until she got home later, her belly urged her otherwise, letting out a hungry grumble. Rubbing her bloated midriff, she groaned as she felt a hunger befall her. A hunger for chocolate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Maybe... Maybe a few wouldn't hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those final words, Dorothea tore open the box with little care, tossing the crumpled lid aside. Her eyes glittered eagerly as she stared at the tiny wrapped treats, each one looking as delectable as the last. Lifting one in each hand, she quickly unwrapped them, dropping the small balls into her mouth and allowing the heat of her mouth to melt them. Sweet, succulent caramel began to fill her mouth, the taste intensifying her bodies demand for more. All too happy to obey, she ferried another couple of chocolates to her mouth, sighing happily as she filled her mouth...</span></div></div>",

Even though she slept heavily last night, right now she cannot help but feel tired after eating so much supple tasty  stuffed caramel balls. With a sigh she steps away putting the still half full box of chocolates into the refrigerator where they will be out of sight and out of mind for awhile until she feels like some more. Realizing she is staining the fridge with her chocolate covered fingers, she licks them clean wiping whatever is left on her yellow fluffy pajamas.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\u201cWell since I had desert after breakfast I suppose it is time for me to wake up and get ready for class I suppose.

Glancing around, she cocked a confused brow when she found no apparent source for the almost inaudible creaking. Taking another few steps, she paused again when an elasticated *<b>SNAP</b>* echoed throughout the hallway. It was followed a light slap as her breasts, finally free of their overly tight prison, bounced slightly. Looking down at the snapped remains of her favourite bra, Dorothea tutted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw...\" She knelt down, scooping up the torn garment. \"This was my favourite thing to wear around the house! Now I've gotta buy a new one... Ah, I'll do it later. I look for a new one now, I'll end up being late to class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to her room, she noted that her breasts, above average for somebody her age, had a bit more of a bounce to them than usual. As she gently laid her bra out on her bed, she glanced towards the mirror. Compared to how she looked a few days ago, she looked like a completely different person now. Tanned skin, almost chocolate coloured, a swollen gut stuffed full of chocolate, hair that was steadily changing colour from dark brown to an almost caramel hue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should probably see a doctor about this</i>, Dorothea decided as she marched around her room, gathering up a new set of underwear. Her chosen bra, thankfully, fit around her breasts, though even it wad somewhat tight around them. The same went for her panties, the waistband of which were beginning to dig into her hips. <i>It's probably just a little extra weight. I haven't exactly been eating the best the past few days.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressing herself in a white t-shirt decorated with a quote from Shakespeare and a pair of black jeans, she grabbed her jacket, slung her bag over her shoulder and headed back downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think I'm gonna walk today!\" Smiling, she ignored her car keys, which were sitting in a small ceramic bowl at the side. \"It's good for the mind, and I might work off some of this weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, she was about to set foot outside when she heard the ominous rumble of thunder, followed by a flash. Her smile morphed into a frown as she stepped back and grabbed her car keys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll walk tomorrow!\" Her smile returned as she sprinted towards her car, the contents of her belly grumbling at the sudden exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Morning, everybody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class greeted their Professor, Mrs Locke, as she strode into the room.

Work had to be in on time, and not a moment past, it had to be up to her impossibly high standards, there had to be zero spelling mistakes... In other words, Dorothea actually liked her, apart from that last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Before we begin today, I'd like everybody to remember that I want the first draft of your assignment in by next week!\" Mrs Locke announced loudly. \"If you miss the deadline, you miss out on valuable feedback!

Thankfully Dorothea was hopeful that the older teacher had asked the needed amount as she was currently having an issue with her body, an increasingly harder to hide issue as something escapes Dorothea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Sqqqqueak*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of her chair squeaking made a few heads turn but with Ms. Locke\u2019s noises as well as the sound of other students, any suspicions toward her was quickly adverted. If not for her tanner skin they few that looked towards the college student would realize that Dorothea would be blushing  from the embarrassment. Her stomach grumbles somehow staying silent as the stuff inside her shift around making her cheeks swell as a burp tries to nosily escape her mouth before another squeak  escapes her butt a few seconds afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cW-why now\u2026..?\u201d</i> Dorothea can only ask  herself with a quick yet quiet squeak. It just started after Ms. Locke\u2019s last question. As things inside her started to shift inside her body,  as if all the chocolate and caramel was combining inside her gut. As the stuff inside her was shifting and moving the means the space between, the pockets of air trapped inside the spaces the chocolates is pushed out either as a burp or a small blast of air into her chair. She had no true idea why this was happening, especially around people, but either way Dorothea had to be careful as the building air wanted to escape loudly and quickly.  \u201cGod\u2026..I hope this passes quickly.\u201d Dorothea thinks as she passes more air from her behind.  While only to graze her stomach, she can feel her stomach becoming harder and stiffer, similar to that of an expecting mother to her further confusion. \u201cPerhaps this is more than mere constipation? I may just tell the next class I am sick if this\u2026.new problem continues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her wants to run away or find a way to go to the restroom but Ms. Locke is old fashioned and wants everyone to stay until class is over. For the currently struggling woman it is just like being stuck in high school once more to her annoyance as well as her impending embarrassment even if she like Ms. Locke\u2019s respectable approach to teaching. She has no idea how much longer she can hold by the worst of his escaping air while also trying to take notes and seem busy enough. Another part just wants to let all the pressure out but Dorothea\u2019s pride would not let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for that we have explained the thought process\u2019s of  Hans Anderson when he has written his themes and why for some reason or another. Why do you think people try to avoid bad ends?\u201d Ms. Locke speaks out as Dorothea allows a slightly louder squeak to escape from her rear as she flushes from strain and humiliation. Thankfully this time,  the aging teacher does not call on her but someone else to the tanned woman\u2019s relief as she risks lightly tread on her stomach underneath her  white Shakespeare shirt as it starts to cramp as more stuff combines together as more air escapes . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>UM</b><i>mgh</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a strength that Dorothea didn\u2019t know she had to stop from being too loud from her combined groan slash burp.
