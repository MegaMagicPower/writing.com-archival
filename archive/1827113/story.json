            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Many grew up with tales echoing around their ears, but few know the tales they heard were not exactly the same as originally written. Cinderella, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, the Little Mermaid. None of them has an ending like the tale states. Something is being hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa grew up hearing tales like many others, but her interests in tales never faded. Even at the age of 18, she still dreams about being a character in a fantasy world. For this, she has suffered much bullying. Despite being one of the cutest girl in the entire high school, her reputation is always under the shadow of being \"nerdy\" and \"childish\". Indeed, being only five foot tall, she does look childish comparing to the mass population, and this has just become a perfect starter for teasing her. Suiting her seemingly childish interest and height, Theresa's fashion choice is just as different. Despite having clothes and shoes filling out her walk-in closet, heels and prom dresses are nowhere to be found. The majority of her footwear collection are heelless short boots and high-top sneakers, rarely even sandals. Unlike other girls with cute feet and silky skin, Theresa never liked showing her feet. Almost entirely from waking up to going to bed, Theresa hides her feet in one pair of her shoes collections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is no different from any other weekend. Stuffing her bare feet into her furry ankle boots right when she gets off bed, Theresa walks downstairs, yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Theresa, boots again? I haven't seen your feet for like a year!\" Theresa's brother teases her. He is two years older than her, but apparently not much more mature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Jake, I'm gonna ask mom to take you to a psychiatrist if you don't stop saying that.\" Theresa fights back while pulling a storybook off the bookshelf and lies down on the couch in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, you just got up and now you are lying down again? How do you even stay in shape?\" Again, Jake teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess what, I'm only 90 pounds. And you are what, 190 pounds?\" Mercilessly, Theresa's words stabs right into Jake's heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me tickle you weak spot\" Jake mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Jake's foot fe....\" Theresa yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truce! Truce! One treat at Cheese Cake Factory, anything you want!\" lowering his voice, Jake quickly interrupts Theresa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Theresa shows a big smile, then makes a face at her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuts on a long face, Jake runs off to his part-time job. Winning another fight against her brother, Theresa opens up the book to where she left off last time, lightly swings her legs. Subconsciously, she presses the tip of her left foot against the back of her right boot and slides her right foot lightly in and out of her boot. All in a sudden, with a pound her heart, the world freezes. A black dot appears in the center of Theresa's book. The black color spreads, and soon covers the entire book. At the same time, the situation is happening to every book of the same story all over the world. The next moment, Theresa is turned into a blob of light and sucked into the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********Theresa's perspective***************<br>\r\nTheresa's sight turns black and quick restores. The view in front of her has changed. Instead of book page she was staring at earlier, she is now staring at cloud floating in the sky; instead of the soft couch under her back and butt, grass is now underneath her. Her left foot, covered still in her boot, is pressing against the ground on her sole, while her right foot is only partially in her boot, with her heel exposed, touching the grassy ground and the boot hanging on the front of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly presses her exposed foot back into her boot, Theresa stands up and looks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is in the world of .....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Several servants, covered also in black robes, kneel in front of the being, lowering their head and trembling in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIND OUT WHO CAME IN AND BRING TO ME!\" The being strikes his palms onto arms of the throne, growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********Back to Theresa's Perspective**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa stands up, sweeping the dirt off her shorts and looks around her. Although still in shock of the abrupt transition to another location, she has already accepted the fact that she is teleported to another location. More than once has she dreamed being part of a fantasy world, it seems that her wish is now fulfilled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleportation it is!\" Theresa cannot help but glancing over everything within her sight. Her optimism and excitement has completely taken over the control of her body and mind. Definitively, more important matters await for her to worry about, like finding out where she is, how to survive and changing into something that is not designed solely for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is not until several minutes later before Theresa calms down. Realizing that she is still wearing her pajama shirt and shorts, Theresa gives herself a facepalm. Already, that is the least critical matter she needs to worry about. From her hiking experience, locating herself seems to be the priority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoods, plain, and a tower, those are all the landmarks she could think of based on her observation. From afar, the tower seems to be constructed of cobblestone blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That couldn't be the Tower of Gargalesis* from Jake's weird game, could it. Ha, the look on his face is gonna be so delighting when he knows I found his R-18 collections.\" Theresa chuckles, imagining her brother going outrageous but unable to do a thing about his sis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about tower, a hypothesis comes to her's mind; correlating to the book \"Rapunzel\" she was reading on the couch earlier, Theresa is almost certain that she is brought into this particular story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I be... Rapunzel?\" Theresa cannot helping asking herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Tower of Gargalesis: A tickling RPG game made with RPG Maker. It is used as a meme here.</span></div></div>",

Correspondingly, Rapunzel World is impacted in a similar fashion - the existence of Theresa would replace the existence of someone in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I be... Rapunzel?\" Theresa wishes deeply in her heart that she is indeed Rapunzel, for this is what she has dreamed about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be. I'm not even sure if this is Rapunzel World yet.\" Theresa's hope of being a real fantasy character battles her conscience fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Theresa's wild thoughts are interrupted by a voice. \"Miss Rapunzel! Miss Rapunzel! Here you are!\" A man in brown robe is waving his hand in front of Theresa's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" Theresa cries out, apparently shocked by the sudden appearance of the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be terrifying alone in the wild, but worry not, Lady Gothel requested me to bring you back. You shall be sound under Lady Gothel's protection.\" The man lightly bows, with left hand behind his back and right handing holding out, pleading Theresa to go with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much information bombarding her brain, Theresa is at a loss. Subconsciously, she places her right hand onto the man's reached-out hand, with her fingers touching the man's fingers, displaying a sign of consent. The man shows Theresa a big smile. A magic circle appear under their feet; light enshrouds. Theresa shades her eyes with her left hand, soon closing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right now.\" The man's voice sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa opens her eyes and looks around her, astounded to find that they are at the very top floor of a tower. The entire floor is consisted of only a bedroom with a  bathroom on its side. Despite so, the interior is luxury. Six feet wide bed with silk quilt and sheets, woolen carpet, chandelier; everything Theresa could imagine having in a princess' bedroom is here. Lying on the bed is a silk gown, but collocating shoes are nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Rapunzel, fear not. I only teleported in to bring you here, your privacy is always assured.\" The man has misinterpreted Theresa's awe as apprehension. <br>\r\n\"I shall depart. Lady Gothel will arrive shortly; she will be pleased to see you dressed appropriately.\" The man disappears, before Theresa could say anything.</span></div></div>",

She turns around, facing ceiling, trying to put together as much information as possible before Dame Gothel, the witch, arrives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA train of thoughts begins its journey in Theresa's mind: <br>\r\n\"The witch sends the man, then he must know Rapunzel, but he still recognizes me as Rapunzel.\"<br>\r\n\"I, then, must have somehow taken the place of the original Rapunzel in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thought continues:<br>\r\n\"Gothel is a cunning witch; she will find out I am not the 'real' Rapunzel if I misbehave.\"<br>\r\n\"She might experiment on me if she know I am from a different world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gleam of fear grows in her heart as she imagines what the witch would do to the one-per-world \"trespasser\". Breath deeply, Theresa decides to play the good girl and behave like Rapunzel from the book as much as possible. With a little reluctance, she changes into the silk gown left on the bed and kicks off her ankle boots. Carefully placing her modern pajama and ankle boots under the bed, making sure that nobody could see them, Theresa sits on her bed, awaits for the Witch's arrival. Her unsettling feet point inward, sometimes patting the carpet, sometimes rubbing against each other; her toes curl, soon straighten. It has been over a year since the last time she placed her bare feet on the floor like this; the insecurity, together with fear for the witch speeds her pounding heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strong gust of wind, a woman in exceptional shape appears outside the tower window. Inconsistent with her hot body is the face of an eighty year old. On her body is a black dress fitting tightly to her body and under her black laced boots holds a swirl of wind. Gracefully, she steps into the tower, forcing a smile on her face, making her look rather ferocious. Would it be much more delighting if the combination of her face and body is not so absurd. Theresa's feet shifts backward and points further inward, lifting her heels, tiptoed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not Rapunzel. I wish only to protect you from harm of the outside world.\" Gothel's voice sounds, soft and light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother Gothel, the beauty outside seeks no harm!\" Theresa tries to act like Rapunzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The outside world is much more complicated than the tower, Rapunzel.\" Gothel continues her persuasion.<br>\r\n\"Promise me, never will you leave the tower again without my company.\" Gothel shows another fearful smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but...\" As if she is Rapunzel, Theresa shows an intent to refute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THERE IS NO BUT!\" To her startle, Gothel rises her volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorr--Sorry, Mother Gothel\" Terrified, Theresa shifts her body further backward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a deep breathe, Gothel softens her voice. \"Now Rapunzel, it is time for another session. Mother will forgive you if you behave well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What session?\" is the only thought in Theresa's mind. </span></div></div>",

A stinging shiver traverses through her body, Theresa resists, pulling her feet further away from Gothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rapunzel, a good girl you shall be.\" Gothel's voice is still soft, but uncharitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwillingly, Theresa drops her defense. She lifts her left foot lightly off the floor and shifts slowly towards Gothel following her pulling grip. Her head is turned away from Gothel, afraid of seeing her feet under the coming ticklish torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGothel sets Theresa's foot on her bed. Her long toes curl and the side of her foot rubs softly against the sheet, begging for mercy. Ice cold finger nail streaks across her arch, from heel to ball. Her toes clench; her eyes close, and giggling echoes. With a deep breathe, a shallow wrinkle on Gothel's face smooths out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such beauty!\" Gothel exclaims; with her fingertip depicting Theresa's soleprint, desultory laughter slips out of Theresa's closed lips. Deep wrinkles on Gothel's face turns shallow, soon disappears as the torment continues. The number of moving fingertips increases, from one to two, two to three. Soon, all five fingers are rapidly dancing on Theresa's arch. The break between her laughters shortens; her foot sways, attempting to stay away from the devil's fingers, but with her ankle pinned on the bed by Gothel's other hand, her striving was in vain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha--Hahahaha--stop--Hahahaha\" Theresa cannot help but begging for a break. To her relief, the dancing fingers stop. Loudly, she gasps, and her clenching toes loosen. Good times are always too short; before Theresa's breathe could return to normal, five fingers have been stuck between her toes, forcing the seams open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha--Hahahahaha\" Theresa bursts into laughters as Gothel's fingernail scraps the seam between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother is helping you cleaning yourself.\" Gothel speaks in a teasing tone. With the depth and number of wrinkles decreasing very second, Gothel's face has looked much younger and vigorous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha--Hahaha\" Theresa could only answer with her laughters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise mother you will not run away again!\" Gothel demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha--Yes--Hahahaha--Mo--Hahahahaha--Mother\" Close to exhaustion, Theresa compromises. Her sweat has wet her newly changed gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGothel stops, releasing Theresa's left foot, leaving her laid on her bed, gasping loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother has forgiven you, for you have taken good care of this pair of precious treasure.\" Gothel gives another quick streak on Theresa's tormented left sole. Scared, the poor girl turns over her body, staring at Gothel and pressing her feet tightly against her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't run away anymore. Much harm awaits to have a touch of your gift, but mother will do you no harm.\" Gothel persuades with intimidation and pretended good-will. </span></div></div>",

The past ten minutes of tickling has terrified her. Never had her read nor imagined that being a fantasy world character could be so excruciating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNods her head, Gothel walks to the tower window. Enshrouded by wind, Gothel's body lifts and dashes off Theresa's sight. Relieved, Theresa huddles in her bed, soon falls asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun has almost gone down when Theresa wakes up. Opening up her big eyes, she yawns and stretches her arms. As if she is still at home, Theresa pushes the quilt aside, sits up and sticks her feet into her furry boots, only to find that her boots are not by her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is real, it is not a dream.\" Theresa mumbles to herself, with a sense of loss. She looks under her bed, her fluffy ankle boots and her pajama are still there.<br>\r\n\"At least, I still have something from home\" Theresa comforts herself. Not even an optimistic girl like her could accept the reality of descending from the princess of her family to a ticklish toy used to preserve other's youth.<br>\r\n\"I need to run away from this witch. I need to control my own fate. I need to go home!\" Fear and grievance are tossed aside; the only thought supporting Theresa is that she needs to go <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooooo---\" Her grumbling stomach pulls her mind back to reality. Recalling that she has not eaten for several hours, Theresa looks around the room for the food Gothel mentioned. Catching her attention is a basket filled with bread and grilled chicken breast floating outside the tower window. Swiftly takes everything out of the basket, Theresa prepares to wolf her food, but her biting mouth stops and her eyes beholds when she sees the basket floats back out of the window and down to ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I use that?\" With her mouth stuffed with food, Theresa thinks to herself.</span></div></div>",

Through the tower window, view is restricted, but several pieces of information could still be obtained for her scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tower is constructed entirely of cobblestone blocks, with no stairs nor doors. The only means of reaching her room is through teleportation or flying, neither of which Theresa knows. However, the basket used to deliver food could be helpful. Surrounding the tower is a ring of white floor covering with a width of several tens of feet, outside of which is turf; straight facing the window is a woods, the temporary destination of her runaway plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa decides not to pull off her plan immediately, but to observe for a few days. In the next three days, nothing but the basket has paid her visits. Meanwhile, she tested capacity of the basket with items of different weight, assuring that the basket will not fall straight to the ground with her carried inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fourth day, when the top tip of sun has just touched horizon, Theresa has put on her old pajamas, with gown worn outside. Her feet are already inside her ankle boots. Lightly stumps on the floor, Theresa feels the security of having her feet enclosed in her shoes. She has everything covered in her plan: <br>\r\nA plate is fixed on the windowsill; once the next basket reaches top of the tower, the plate will press onto the inner side of the basket, tipping and thus emptying it. While the basket is being emptied daily, nobody will find her gone until Gothel comes for her \"session\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such genius!\" Theresa flatters herself. She moves a chair to the window, looking out for the basket to arrive. Whimsically, Theresa sits down only to find herself too short to see anything outside. Theresa displays her signature displeased face, but soon accepting the fact that she is short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm cute.\" Theresa comforts herself. She yawns. The sun is already above horizon, but the basket still has yet arrived. Eager to execute her runaway plan, Theresa stands up and walks around in her room. Minutes pass. Theresa glaces outside, seeing a girl in red hood coming, holding a basket on her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has to be my ride!\" Theresa turns excited; could she finally leave the place that gives her nightmares. The girl drops off the basket directly below the tower window and walks back toward the woods. The basket slowly rises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl is hundreds of feet away when the basket reaches her window. As Theresa planned, the basket tips over and food inside is poured out. Theresa agilely jumps onto the windowsill and grips onto the handle of the basket. With the basket moving downward, Theresa takes her leap. Her feet land accurately in the basket, but out of her expectation, the basket loses balance and tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah--\" Theresa barely resists her urge to scream. Her hand tightly clenches onto the handle, with the basket upside-down and her body hanging in mid-air. Her right boot flew off her foot onto the white floor covering twenty feet away when her body struggled. Fortunate enough, the girl in red hood does not seem to have noticed this little accident. Gasping, Theresa closes her eyes, afraid of seeing how high she is in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two minutes of floating is eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't part of my plan.\" She mumbles, then noticing the white floor covering is actually a layer of four-inch long soft feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a really bad feeling about this.\" Theresa looks at her bare right foot. Feathers have poked between her toes, stroking the seams with gentle breeze. Theresa giggle softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New plan, find my shoe!\" Theresa concludes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe--Hmmmm--mmmm--Hehehe\" Theresa covers her mouth with her palm, but desultory laughter slips out of her mouth. With each step she take, feathers sweeps on her sole and brushes against the seams between her toes. Every half minute, Theresa pauses her search for a minutes, clenching her toes tightly to rest and defend against the stroking feathers. With her boot buried within the blanket of feather, Theresa's search is rather challenging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*A line from Flash the TV show</span></div></div>",

Fortunate enough, her journey to the woods was rather peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have eaten my breakfast!\" Theresa's stomach grumbles again.

The question is, where is the nearest town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall go through the woods and eventually I will find roads!\" Theresa places a fist on her chest, encouraging herself. She picks another handful of berries and resumes her journey, when a young girl in red hood fades into her sight.</span></div></div>",

Without hesitation, Theresa runs to the girl, afraid that she might walk away. To her relief, the girl sits by the pond and undoes her red hooded robe, revealing her tube top and pink panties. Gently dips her robe in water, the girl rubs dirt off it.  The process is slow, but delicate. On the other side of lake, while the girl is washing her robe, Theresa is regretting for her lack in exercise. She starts panting after the first hundred yards and has to slow down. The girl is just about to leave when Theresa faintly yells \"wait\" from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuh.....Huuh.....Huuh....Huuh\"  Theresa pants, supporting her body with her hands on her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it's okay. No rush~\" The girl's soft and gentle voice sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa catches her breath after several  minutes of gasping. Her eyes sweep up and down on the girl's body covered only in her tube top, pink panties and red short boots. A light red shade climbs up the girl's face. She lowers her head and covers her bikini area with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn't mean to!\" Realizing her behavior being impolite, Theresa apologizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your tube top and panties are really cute!\" Theresa adds. The girl's face turns redder and lowers her head even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeholding the young girl in shy, Theresa displays a curious smile and pokes the girl on her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haa!\" The girl screams in laughter, soon stares at Theresa with her face blushed in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too cute. I couldn't help.\" Theresa explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What--what do you want?\" The girl speaks, raising her soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to ask for direction.\" Theresa returns to her serious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to tell you!\" The girl turns her head, attempts to show her authority and anger, but her voice exposes the delight hidden behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeeas~ I will let you tickle me back!\" Theresa compromises, blinking her big watery eyes at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Humph* You shall be forgiven then!\" The girl replies with the arrogance, but both her and Theresa knows they are simply joking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Theresa.\" Being outside the tower, Theresa could finally stop acting as Rapunzel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Maisie.

Minutes of walking passes in the blink of an eye with the two girls chit-chatting. Theresa's step halts as her eyes are caught by a small wooden lodge. The lodge is surrounded by a bed of flowers well taken care of, several tens of feet cleared off any tree. A hand lightly tapping on Theresa's back retrieves her absent mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in! You can appreciate the view inside as well.\" Maisie steps forward and opens the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed a gorgeous place!\" Theresa steps inside the lodge, replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lodge is nothing fancy as top of the tower: wooden flooring, wooden chair, wooden desk, wooden cups, simple but functional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything came from the forest.\" Staring into Theresa's curious eyes, Maisie smiles and pulls out a chair for Theresa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, Gothel helped me building this.\" Maisie drops the bombshell. In shock of hearing the name, pinpricks of cold sweat appears on Theresa's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Theresa. She isn't a bad person, neither am I. We just had some histories. Of course, hers is much longer than mine.\" Maisie pours a cup of water for Theresa and sits back down. Theresa recalls the reason she came to Maisie's lodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were Little Riding Hood? What do you mean? What do you know about this place?\" Speaking at a enormous speed, Theresa shoots her questions at Maisie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I can tell you more, I need you to place your feet on my legs.\" Maisie taps her own knees with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn confusion, Theresa obeys and rests her calf on Maisie's thighs, with her feet sticking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for tickling me earlier!\" Maisie pulls off Theresa's left boot and rapidly drags her fingernail across Theresa's sole. Theresa's foot jerks, but Maisie's other hand renders her attempt in pulling her feet back a failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came from another world.\" Maisie continues to draw circles on Theresa's bare sole, making her long toes curl. \"The world I came from used to be peaceful, at least the town I lived in. My grandma lived---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a forest---Hahaha---can---we---Haha---skip---hahaha---this part?\" Wriggling her left foot to stay away from Maisie's fingers, Theresa squeezes out a few words between laughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Maisie switches her attack mode to \u201cfinger dance\" and continues her story, ignoring Theresa's increasing laughter. \"It started with an invasion on my fourteenth birthday. When I was a kid, grandma has always been telling me that my red hood contains a great secret. For many times I have asked her to reveal the secret to me, she wouldn't. After annoying her everyday for several years, she finally conceded that she would tell me the secret on my fourteenth birthday. I was really excited when the day finally arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then--Hahaha---wolf--Hahahaha--ate---Hahaha--\" Theresa helps Maisie ends her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wolf ate your grandma!! How dare you curse my grandma, and how dare you laugh when you say that!\" Completely ignoring that fact that Theresa laughed because her feet are under someone's torment, Maisie gives Theresa an angry look and pulls her other boot off. Her finger rapidly dances on Theresa's bare soles, filling her mouth with no words but laughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where you heard that, but no wolf has ever appeared in the forest.\" Maisie explains \"I did see my grandma that day, and by my ear, she told me the secret.\" Maisie's word pauses, so do her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What---What---was---it\" Gasping loudly, Theresa squeezes her question out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She told me my hood was magical\" Maisie's word resumes. Resuming same time as her word are her fingers picking at the seams between Theresa's toes. Once again, Theresa bursts into laughters. \"My hood grants absolute luck to its wearer. It prevents any type of direct harm from happening to its wearer.\" Maisie sighs. \"Right after grandma told me this, a portal opened outside her house. People in black robes swarmed out of the portal, tossing magic everywhere. I couldn't understand their language at that time, but now I know that they were looking for my hood.\" Maisie halts her dancing fingers and takes a sip from her cup. Her talking continues, but her fingers are giving Theresa a break. \"With the fortune granted by the hood, I managed to sneak into the portal, but grandma....\" Maisie sighs again. \"I don't know what happened to her. I ran to this place and Gothel found me unconscious in the forest. She gave me a home.\" Slipping Theresa's boots back onto her feet, Maisie squeezes a smile onto her face. \"That's my story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa opens her mouth but could not say a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you have replaced Rapunzel, but it's not your fault. Just remember, do not let people know you are from another world, and do not let anyone know your identity in this world is Rapunzel. Gothel is probably the only one that would purposely leaves you a backdoor for escaping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Theresa opens her mouth and wants to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Theresa say?</span></div></div>",

Neither of them slept well last night, as both girls were trying to pull some ticklish tricks onto each other. Walking on the road chewing a bread, Theresa's mind flashes back to the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaisie was almost like a older sister, the kind that would tease Theresa while taking great care of her. After all, her experience has forced her to grow. Seeing someone that could share her fate, she could not help but giving her a hand; her tease is just one way to make Theresa feel at home. Maisie cooked dinner while Theresa was appreciating the view outside Maisie's lodge, dangling her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to eat, lazy head.\" Maisie walked over and kicked off one of Theresa's dangling boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey pick that up for me!\" Theresa complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, boss\" Maisie picked up the boot and droped it by Theresa's bare foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, stay away from my feet! Hahahaha--Hahaha\" Theresa screamed, but it was already too late. Maisie crouched and grasped Theresa's retracting foot by her ankle. Her fingernails scratched on Theresa's arch. Theresa burst into laughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha--Forgive--Hahahaha--Me---Hahaha--Plea---Hahaha--Please--Haha\" ; Theresa struggled and begged for mercy. With the wiggling and twisting of her body, her other boot has slowly slipped off her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a good girl and your feet will be safe and sound.\" Maisie stopped her tickling. Instead, each of her hands was holding one of Theresa's foot by the balls, and the fingernail of her index fingers were pointing at the centers of Theresa's soles, barely touching them. She lightly shifted her fingers, causing Theresa to scrunch her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am!\" Theresa obeyed, in a greatly exaggerate fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, let's eat.\" Maisie loosened her grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt table, the two girls conversed about their homes, awed that how different technologies and lives could be. Maisie forced Theresa to wash dishes, for she had been wandering around the entire day while Maisie could not rest for even five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, it would be nice to have a big sis.\" Theresa spoke lightly in bed, huddling with Maisie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad I don't have a younger sister.\" Maisie teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You can't just say that!\" Theresa pokes Maisie on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha... You--You started it!\" Maisie struck back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tickling fight broke out between Theresa and Maisie. Wise enough, neither of them pointed out that they would not have many opportunities like this, as they would soon be on an adventure full of dangers and unknown, and nobody knew if they could make it. At the end of their journey, eventually, they would have to part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa reaches Giggleville in the afternoon. Diving into a restaurant, she satisfies her stomach with a good meal in the price of a silver coin.

However, as soon as Theresa arrives at the street, her mouth opens to an large \"O\" shape. The street is at least sixty feet wide, but is still crowded with pedestrians and carriages. Theresa jumps, but her height has deemed that she can never see behind the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn each side of the street, stores eye-catching banners are packed tightly: [BeerDucks, The Best Beer for Bucks], [JewelDrive, One Jewel for Life], [Magicwall, We Have IT ALL]...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooo a magic shop!\" Theresa's eyes seem to be shining when she glances over [Maigcwall]. An image emerges before her eye: She, Theresa, is wearing a white robe, holding a staff in her hand, yelling \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is going to be AWESOME!\" Theresa trembles out of excitement and pushes open the door. She rings the bell on counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming\" A voice sounds from back of the store. Shortly after, a clearly overweight man walks out. \"How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... You got any staff here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... a magician?\" The man asks in doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, but I want to be one. Do you happen to have any of those books that teach magic?\" Theresa shakes her head, soon tosses another question at the shop keeper with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, you can take a left upon exiting and toy stores can be found two hundred yards down the road. We have business here, please do not mess around.\" The man answers impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What kind of store claims to HAVE IT ALL but actually have nothing? It's fraudulence! And don't you MISS me, Fatty, I'm not a kid!\" In disappointment, Theresa yells at the man and smashes a gold coin on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This young lady, selling magic books is strictly prohibited in the Country, everyone knows that! However, we do have potions that could aid you in all types of events.\" Looking at the gold coin, the man sighs and pulls out a small bottle with sprayer on top. \"This, my dear customer, is our latest product. For a pretty lady like you, sweat and smell must be intolerable. A couple spray of this shall give you a fresh and delightful smell right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfume! You got perfume here!?\" Theresa is clearly distracted by the small bottle of magic potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid name! Perfume it is.\" The man praises. Before Theresa could show her proud face, the mans has sprayed a few times on Theresa's gown and boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell this\" the man pauses. \"Perfume\". \"The magical potion, as a side effect, also brings delight to its wearer. It's on special discount today for one gold coin only.\" The man continues advertising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take it!\" Theresa drops the coin in the man's hand and grabs the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do come back!\" The man speaks, watching Theresa exiting the store. \"Delight, indeed. I'd wish I could hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Theresa go next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once again, she walks back into the magic shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you again. That's...really short break between visits.\" The shop keeper pulls his face the moment he sees Theresa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Yup!\" Theresa scratches her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what can I help you with?\" The shop keeper asks with probe, worrying that Theresa might have discovered the little scheme he pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder, if you know any inns nearby?\" Theresa throws her question out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I do! Go three blocks down this way, make a right turn at the intersection and a really nice inn will be five blocks down the street. That's the closest one I know.\" The man points to the right side of exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, thank you!\" Theresa exits the shop, leaving the man in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for two blocks, Theresa starts to have a sensation of light touches on her armpits, but with her pajama worn inside, the touch would not bother her. The sensation has grown a little stronger by the time she reaches the intersection. Theresa stops and itches. Another three blocks down the road, Theresa begins feeling light strokes on her soles. She stumps her feet and shifts them inside her boots, trying to relieve the \"itch\". By the time Theresa reaches the inn, the sensation has become more or less intolerable. The silk lines inside her gown are constantly brushing against her armpits. Even with her pajama shirt in between, the tickling cannot be fully blocked. The stroking on her soles are even worse. From time to time, a small strand of fur would sneak between her toes, sweeping on her vulnerable toe seams. Cannot resist the sensation anymore, Theresa giggles lightly as she walks into the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heee--Heee, A room for two, Hee--Heee, two nights please.\" Theresa covers her mouth with one hand, giggling lightly as her feet are being \"attacked\" by her own boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is your key, room number is on it.\" The receptionist hands over a key. \"By the way, what's so funny, is there something on my face?\" The receptionist asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No--no. Hee--Hee.\" Theresa grabs the key and runs off. Her face turns red, not from embarrassment but from her trying to hold her laughters. The tickling sensation has clearly grown stronger. Sprints into her room, Theresa shuts the door and pulls her gown off. All in her sudden her upper body is relieved from the torment. Not sparing even a brief moment to inspect her gown, Theresa pulls her left boot off and spreads her toes. The boot seems to be much tighter than before. Without having a second thought, Theresa hold her right boot and tries to pull it off. However, her attempt fails this time. The fur inside her boot has wrapped around her ankle, preventing her from removing it. To Theresa's despair, small strands of fur are wrapping around each of her toes, separating them. Blades of fur in the front saw between her toes and fur under her sole brushes against her arch and ball. Unable to hold any longer, Theresa burst into laughter. She stumps her booted foot on the carpet, only to make the fur brushing harder. Her toes try to scrunch, but with the strands holding them apart, she fails. Theresa crawls on her king size bed, scratching the side of her boot, then sole of her boot, but her struggle is to no avail. The boot is like a prison, leaving her nowhere to escape. Fur has completely enshrouded her foot. Each moment her sole, toes and instep are being scrubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha--Stahahahaha--Hahahap\" Theresa kicks her foot, rubbing it against the white sheet, leaving a series of black shoe-prints. Over time, her laughter weakens, her kick slows. Curled up in a tight ball with her hand holding on the boot, the view in front of Theresa darkens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is already morning when Theresa awakes. The tickling has stopped but her hand is still holding the boot, trying to remove it. The sheet is a mess, soaked with sweat and covered with black prints. Theresa pulls the boot, and this time, it comes off with ease. Shaking her head wildly, Theresa places her feet on the carpet. The tickling is indeed there no more. In suspicion, Theresa picks up the \"perfume\" and inspects the bottle closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vitalizer: bring inanimate objects to life.

No! You can't! Ahhhh---!\" The man yells, screams, then becomes silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold shiver runs up Theresa's spine. Certainly, she does not own an ID of any form in this world; if she is found out to be an outsider, what will people do to her? If she is found out to be Rapunzel, what will people do to her? In either case, she will not be treated in a humane way. Confusion and fear mingle. Theresa quickly puts on her gown and slips on her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock* *Knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the door, checking ID.\" To her worst fear, those people are coming. Theresa takes two deeps breaths and forces herself to stay calm. She has only one card that could save the game, but she does not know if this card would work. Either way, she has to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming.\" Theresa opens her door. Two guards in steel armors stand, each with a sword hanging on the right side of its waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show your ID please.\" One guard speaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ID you said? Lady Gothel never preferred your ludicrous IDs. Tell your leader if he does not enjoy the fact that I do not own an ID, he can discuss with Lady Gothel.\" Theresa raises her head giving the two guards a despise and condescending stare and speaks arrogantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards look at each other at a loss. Theresa's acting has fooled them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our apologies to disturb, Miss. Allow us to report the situation.\" One guard speaks as the other one closes the door. The two guard leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa has to come up with an escape plan before the guards come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Theresa do?</span></div></div>",

With the leading guard's attention drawn by the two, Theresa opens her window and places one foot on the windowsill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Squeak* *Squeak* The windowsill creaks when Theresa shifts her body weight onto the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seize her!\" Hearing the noise, the leading guard looks up and sees Theresa. The two guards sprint upstairs and catch Theresa, before she could run out of her room. Theresa struggles, tries to kick a guard in his soft part, but the guard quickly grabs her ankle. With a push on her shoulder, Theresa falls, landing on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Theresa wails. The guards ignore the tiny drop of tear at the corner of her eyes and one guard turns her body around, pressing her shoulders tightly against the floor, facing down. The other guard rapidly ties her hands behind her by her wrists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Is that how you treat a pretty lady!?\" Theresa turns her head and yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are no more than a liar, possibly a criminal. Be ready to face your trial!\" The two guards each grabs Theresa by her shoulder and escorts her downstairs to the leading guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two stay here. Do not let anyone leave unless a valid ID is displayed. You are coming with me, young lady.\" The leading guard wraps a chain around each of Theresa's ankle, allowing her only to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for safety measures, in case you feel like running today.\" Theresa tries to kick the man while he is chaining her, but the he agilely blocks the kick with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those boots of yours, they are quite cute, but I bet what's inside are even better. What a pity to hide them from the outside world.\" The leading guard stands back up, whispering at Theresa's ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pervert!\" Theresa scolds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say whatever you'd like, Lady Gothel never tolerates fraud like you. Her punishment will be undoubtedly delighting.\" The guard smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You--\" Before Theresa could argue back, the guard stuffs a handkerchief in her mouth. \"Hmmmm!!! Phhhmmm!!\" Theresa tries to speak but fails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better.\" The guard grips onto Theresa's her tied wrists and pressing her on her back, forcing her to bend forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phhwwwwmmmm!!\" Theresa growls in anger, but no one could understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your voice for later, young lady.\" Speaking, the guard walks. Failing to resist the guard's forceful push, Theresa follows. She is escorted to a jail room full of tools behind a solid iron door. In the center of the room lies a iron bed with straps attached to each corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Lady Gothel will be glad to see you tied in place.\" The guard grins and rips Theresa's gown open. With ease, the gown is torn apart, revealing Theresa's pajama shirt and pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are some interesting looking inner garments.\" The guard is dazed for a moment. His lack of knowledge makes it difficult for him to determine whether or not these are the upper class clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Lady Gothel will forgive me even if this is a mistake.\" The guard soothes himself. Again grinning, the guard places Theresa onto the bed and wraps the straps around her wrists and on her legs slightly above the tops of her boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly it won't hurt if I have a taste of your laughter before Lady Gothel's arrival.\" The guard removes the handkerchief from Theresa's mouth and walks to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Theresa stops swaying her foot and tilts the tip of her foot upward to keep her boot on. The man scratches Theresa's exposed arch, dragging his fingernail down to her heel. Theresa grits her teeth and tries to keep her foot still. Giggles slip out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't want to show your tootsie, do you? Such cute struggle. Let me help you\" The guard grins and gives another gentle push at the back of Theresa's boot. Under gravity, the boot slips down along her instep. Theresa tips her toes hastily, barely catches her boot, hanging it loosely on her toe tip. The guard crouches, looking up at Theresa's technically bare foot. To her fear, the man places one finger at the exposed in-between of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what this will do.\" Speaking, he digs with his fingernail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha.\" Theresa almost cries laughter. Her toes intend to scrunch, but afraid that her boot will fall, they are forced to stay still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stubborn, stubborn little girl.\" The guard smirks, his finger speeds up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha--Nooo---Hahahaha\" Theresa laughs, the hanging boot shakes lightly, on the verge of falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n****Creak**** The door opens and a charming young lady in black walks in. Her eyes glaces around and stays at the guard tormenting Theresa. The guard halts. He stands up in a haste and salutes Gothel. The door behind Gothel creaks shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who permitted you to tickle my girl?\" Flame circles in Gothel's pupils. Her voice is low but filled with fury. Her eyes behold Theresa, who, now, is locked on an iron bed gasping loudly with her eyes shut, wearing only her pajamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence, and faintly the guard's gritting teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Clamp* Theresa's boot falls onto the cold floor and breaks the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who permitted you to tickle her!?\" Gothel speaks again, but much louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercy, mercy, milady.\" The guard suddenly kneels and begs. Flame rises from Gothel's hand. The man is covered in blaze the very next instant. He tries to screech, but voice would not come out. Within seconds, the man carbonizes and disperses into dust particles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGothel sighs. She unstraps the restrains around Theresa's ankles and wrists and puts the boot back on for her. If not seeing her pajamas that do not belong to this world, Gothel would hardly believe that Theresa is from another world, as she is no different from Rapunzel in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The shadow left by Gothel is traumatic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I have no intention to harm you or tickle you, not anymore.\" Instead of her formal tone, Gothel is speaking in a casual way. Still in fear, Theresa curls up her legs and presses her booted feet tightly against the iron bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us witches and wizards have long lives. Our grip in magic allows us to preserve youth and beauty for much longer than ordinary human.\" Looking into Theresa's watery eyes, Gothel speaks about herself. \"But it does not mean we have infinite time in our hands. Contrarily, as it may take tens of years to make little progress in magical research, our time is barely enough. A hundred and fifty years ago, a brilliant witch named Aurora established a seemingly absurd theory that worlds were created by beings of a higher dimension and are connected. She was mocked and eventually expelled from the Witch &amp; Wizard's Association. She did not give up her theory; instead, she continued developing it and a monumental experiment was performed fifty years later, when this theory was almost forgotten. Her theory was proved to be correct, at least the part where worlds are connected. A portal to an unexplored land was opened. An expedition was started and a team of explorers were sent to the world; my husband was one of them. The portal closed shortly after the team was dispatched. Aurora tried to reopen it but failed. Nothing has been heard since the incident. As a member of the board, I urged to seal the project and establish rescue plans immediately, but the rest of the board were blinded by the interests and deceived by Aurora. I was isolated. The association has since then poured tremendous resources into the study. A solution to preserve the portal for a period of time was found, but a way to reopen the portal was not. In the recent years, Aurora has gained full control of the association. Although still a senior member of the association, my influence is now minimal.\" Gothel pauses. \"It's not important anymore. All these years, I only wanted to find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa could see tear circling in her eyes. Seeing the warm side of this cold woman is just as astonishing as hearing the complicated past of Gothel. Theresa remains silent and tries to digest what Gothel just said, but soon Gothel continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been waiting and searching for means to help him return all these years. Meanwhile, Aurora's claws have finally reached other worlds. Five years ago, she started an invasion, resulting in the catastrophe in Maisie's hometown. You might have heard from Maisie already. I saved her before she was found by Aurora, for my empathy for her as well as a selfish wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maisie doesn't know anything about the portal.\" Theresa interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she does not. I almost lost hope, but then I heard a portal was opened from an outside world. I was really excited, as I thought it could be him. But...it was you.\" Gothel forces a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't want him to see you being old, so you tickled \"Rapunzel\" who happened to be me to restore youth. I thought your session with her was on a regular base.\" Theresa interrupts and raises an irrelevant question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no. Rapunzel was a \"demi\", a spirit, a creature of magic. Her appearance is no different from human but she was born of magic power dispersed around the world. I found her during a journey around the Country and gave her a home.\" Gothel explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot to take in. But why are you telling me all these?\" Theresa speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Gothel remains silence for a second. \"Maisie told me you might have a way to travel between worlds without a portal. Can...can you?\" Gothel's voice is almost shaking when she finally raises her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nP.S. This chapter serves as a transition and supplements a few more settings that may help clear some confusions about the story (or not?). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTL;DR: Gothel's husband went missing due to Aurora's (the final boss) portal experiment. Gothel is only trying to get her husband back. Maisie's hometown was invaded by Aurora's army. Maisie crossed the portal and was found fainted by Gothel. Gothel saved Maisie because she thought Maisie might knew something, who turned out to know nothing. But now from Maisie, Gothel heard Theresa might know how to travel between worlds. (A misunderstanding, but Theresa does know a way to do it. Hint: Dorothy). The names have actually revealed who Aurora is. (I chose Aurora for a reason)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly this chapter is not very well-written. Might have to come back and fix it.</font></span></div></div>",

That is indeed a massive plan.\" Theresa speaks, but her attitude indicate that she isn't truly caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not understanding me.

Soon, her cursing is stopped by laughter, as Gothel's fingers starts dancing on Theresa's lifted foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Gothel, the guards by the castle gate hastily opens the gate and invite Gothel in, but none of them could resist throwing a glance or two at the poor laughing girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Gothel, please allow me to inform the Arch Mage about your arrival. Our sincerest apologies for such poor reception!\" In confusion, one guard offers to report to Aurora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need! I will see her myself!\" Gothel sweeps her hand from right to left. A breeze blows the guard aside. Beholding Gothel, everyone freezes, afraid that Gothel will randomly kill someone, as she is apparently in a bad mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, the door to Arch Mage's quarter opens automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gothel, it's been very long since your last visit. What brings you here? Or should I say, what are you bringing here?\" A voice sounds, difficult to determine the age and gender of its owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put away your little tricks. I know what your voice sounds like.\" Gothel speaks, stops tickling Theresa and sends her forward. \"This is the girl you are looking for\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a surprise!? I never expected you to be the one bringing her here. Come in, please.\" A mellifluous voice sounds. It is difficult to imagine its owner's beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gothel you traitor! Let me go!\" Theresa screams in rage. But the two witches simply ignore her complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could sense her smell of the other world. She is indeed the one. Such splendid gift! Tell me, what are you wishing for, Gothel?\" Aurora asks, but her words are cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My husband's return is what I wish for! Guarantee his return and this girl is yours.\" Gothel's voice echoes in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my promise then.\" Aurora answer to Gothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" The magic circles restraining Theresa disappears. Theresa falls to the floor, landing on her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Theresa moans. Soon recovering from the fall, Theresa sits on the carpeted floor, shifting backwards, away from Aurora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here girl, we have a lot to talk about.\" Aurora grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Aurora's hand gesture, Theresa's body is lifted off ground. She throws a final stare at Gothel, with hatred. Gothel closes her eyes, avoiding eye contact. Unaffected by the silent communication between the two persons, Aurora turn towards the back end of the room, slowly raises her hand. Her palm faces a bookshelf. Several concentric magic circles appear in front of Aurora's palm and several appear in front of the bookshelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will inform you once we find any clue regarding your husband.\" Aurora turn her head and speaks to Gothel. Gothel nods, then exists the room. The door behind Aurora shuts. The magic circles start rotating, seeming to match a specific pattern. In a few seconds, the motion stops. The bookshelf turns transparent and a stairwell appears behind the bookshelf. Aurora walks downstairs, with Theresa floating behind, struggling. The moment Theresa is moved into the stairwell, the bookshelf turns solid again. Darkness enshrouds. In moments, light spheres appear on both sides of wall, lighting the way ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU BITCH, LET ME GO!\" Theresa still has not given up struggling. She screams<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it, girl. Every bit of strength should contribute to laughing.\" Aurora replies coldly, turns back and places a mechanical object on Theresa's left foot. The object looks somewhat like a spider, with eight tiny pointy legs, barely large enough to cover Theresa's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What--What is this!?\" Feeling the cold mechanical leg touching her sole, Theresa screams in fear. Before she gets an answer, the mechanical legs move. With two legs clenching on inner and outer side of her foot, six pointy legs rapidly scratch on her sole.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha--Hahaha--Haha\" Theresa's laughter sounds. For several times, she tries to kick the mechanical spider off with her other foot, but the spider is clenching so tightly that her attempts were to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn laughter, Theresa is led to the secret chamber by Aurora. The chamber is empty, with literally nothing in it. The moment Theresa is moved into the chamber, her laughter starts echoing. At the center of the chamber, Aurora gently removes the mechanical spider off her foot. Despite of her urge to kick Aurora, Theresa is too tired to do so. Her arms and legs are hanging, as the lifting magic is only working on her body. Faintly, another magic circle appears behind her back and holds her up, serving much like a desktop. Four straps of light binds her wrists and ankles, leaving her lying on the magic circle in an X shape. Even though tired due to the previous torture, her toes are still tightly scrunched, on guard for Aurora's surprise tickling attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora grins. The girl in front of her is clearly terrified, which satisfies her perverted desire. To her knowledge, girl of \"that world\" should has be easily startled, just like how Theresa behaves. The only person she actually worries about is Gothel. It is absurdly easy for Gothel to give up Theresa. Aurora has determined that something fishy is happening. She closes her eyes and feels for abnormal magic flow; her hands touching Theresa's body parts covered by clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the rubbing hand on her breast, Theresa screams loudly. To her worse fear, the hand reaches into her pajama top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh!!! Hentai!! Pervert!!\" Theresa's mind clears and tries to cover her breasts with her hands, only to realize that she is restrained on a magic circle. Fortunately, her reaching hand performs no action but pulling out a badge from under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph. It is not so easy to find out my secret.\" Aurora grins and mumbles. Tossing the enchanted badge on the floor and stumps on it. With a crack sounds, the badge is crushed into pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, time to talk about OUR world.\" Aurora stares at Theresa in her eyes, as the girl trembles, with her toes scrunched together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

With each step, the heel of Aurora's boots knocks on the floor, making a clicking sound echoing in the chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had the best education, but it got me nowhere! NOWHERE! My family forced me into a marriage that I deeply abhor just so that our status could be passed on.\" Aurora becomes a little hysteric. At this moment, even her divinely beautiful face looks somewhat ferocious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I locked myself away and dived into books. It was when I noticed the connection between stories and reality. Over the course of history, scenes that only should only in stories had \"magically\" happened. As I studied further into the events, my theory took form. From then, I started writing my own stories and used the power of my condemned family to publish them under others' names, in order to spread them and consolidate the Worlds. Of course, the stories are modified over time but the basis was set.\" Aurora pauses. A glass appears in her hand with water slowly filling up. Aurora takes a sip and sets the glass aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far from Aurora, Theresa is still trembling, and her toes are still scrunching together tightly. However, it is not due to fear. In between her toes, the tiny lines drawn by Gothel has connected into runes due to Theresa scrunching her toes together, recording and transmitting everything Aurora says. Her trembling body and scrunching toes are merely to lower her suspicion. Unaware of what is happening, Aurora continues her talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I planned my own death and rebirth. Death in that World and rebirth as Aurora, the sleeping beauty. I would be reborn as the most perfect girl in this world with immortality and so I did. The world is shaped such way that only women could have the best talent in magic. We are the dominant here. Of course, I also granted the talented ones gorgeous body and sensitive skins, so that I have a way to control them.\" Pausing, Aurora grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why don't you tell me your part of the story? I am certainly very curious about that part of hell after so many years.\" Aurora sits by Theresa's right foot and gently rubs the center of her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I am not going to tickle you if you behave nicely. Tell me about your home world, will you?\" Aurora's rubbing thumb \"accidentally\" scratches Theresa's sole with its fingernail. It is not enough to drive Theresa into laughter but more than enough to warn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Theresa speaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what? Keep on talking\" Aurora urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\" Theresa screams, and closes her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtremely bright light fills the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!! My eyes!!\" Aurora screams as her eyes are temporarily blinded by the extreme luminosity. Shortly, the room returns to normal, only with two additional persons. The shorter one among the two raises the brick in her hand and strikes Aurora on the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gothel! Maisei! You are finally here! You can't imagine how much I suffered!\" Theresa displays a wronged look. Her big watery eyes are filled with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for her punishment. Now that everyone in the castle has been broadcast about her egregious plan, our resistance should be minimal. Maisei, get Theresa off that table and help me lift Aurora there.\" Gothel speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaisei pets Theresa on her head and hastily undoes the straps around her wrists and ankles. Holding her arms, Maisei helps Theresa up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The floor is ice cold!\" Theresa exclaims when her bare soles make contact with the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, put these on. They may be a size too large, but for now, they should keep those cuties of yours warm.\" Gothel speaks while striping Aurora's thigh boots off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the remaining body warmth, Theresa quickly puts her tiny feet in the boots, unwilling to expose them for any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to deal with her?\" Theresa stumps lightly on the floor and asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still need some information from her.\" Gothel speaks, putting on a pair of special cuffs on Aurora's wrists and ankles, locking her onto the torture table that Theresa was once on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These should dampen her power sufficiently to keep her from escaping. Time for you to revenge, young lady.\" Gothel speaks and nods at Theresa. Her hand draws a magic symbol in mid-air and casts a healing magic onto Aurora, waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see how ticklish you are, Witch!\" This time, Theresa grins.</span></div></div>",

Her foot shudders lightly for a brief instant as Theresa's hand makes contact with it. Aurora opens her eyes, staring at Theresa ferociously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think you can possibly break me with a little tickling, do you? I truly pity you for thinking that way.\" Aurora struggles, trying to break free of the straps around her wrists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me!? Where is my magic?\" Realizing that she can no longer cast a spell, Aurora struggles with greater strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember the strange minerals we discovered in another World, Aurora? It turns out that they have the ability to neutralize mana particles. What a pity there is only so much to make one pair of cuffs.\" Gothel steps into Aurora's eye sight and waves at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Traitor!\" Aurora tries to sit up, but the straps on her wrists prevent her from doing so. Instead, she screams at Gothel with fury.<br>\r\n\"I trusted you! How dare you betray me! Where are my royal witches? Guards!\" Aurora yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you built this secret chamber so that people cannot hear the laughter inside when you torture them with tickling, am I not right? It is serving its purpose quite well. And for your information, even if your minions could hear you, they will not come. They are all astounded by that speech you just gave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gothel, excuse me for a moment, can I start tickling her now, her feet are too adorable and tempting to resist.\" Theresa stumps lightly on the floor, in Aurora's boots, to remind her that their positions have now switched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that filthy hand off---Heeeeheeeee---Stop---that---Heeeheeee\" Aurora turns her head and stares at Theresa, but soon her angry look turns into giggles, as Theresa rubs her thumb against the center of Aurora's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were not ticklish, Witch.\" Theresa mocks. \"Seriously though, how did you take care of your feet, they are too soft. Your skin is so silky!\" To further embarrass Aurora, Theresa comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeheeee---Stop----Heeee\" Aurora shifts her foot from left to right then right to left to stay away from Theresa's hand. However, with the restrain, her foot could only move so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty, naughty. Next time you try to dodge, Maisei will join.\" Theresa grins like a little devil, but the cutest kind. She switches technique. Instead of rubbing Aurora's sole with only one hand, her other hand joins. With her right hand holding Aurora's toes, her left hand gently scratches the center of the poor witch's sole with her fingernail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please---Please---Nooo---Haaaaahaaaa\" Feeling her toes being bent backwards, Aurora begs. The helpless witch has completely abandoned her pride under the intimidation of Theresa. However, her beg was to no avail. Theresa's fingernail eventually touches her sole. An extreme sensation zaps through her spine. The witch bursts into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's add one more rule. If you laugh, Maisei joins.\" Theresa complements. However, with her fingernail sliding up and down, the witch cannot possible hold back her laughter. Immediately, she lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maisei! I know you have been bored out of your mind, come and join me! This witch is way more ticklish than you could imagine!\" Theresa pauses and waves at Maisei. Meanwhile, Gothel has pulled out a chair and start enjoying the \"show\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't break her. I still need some information from her.\" Gothel speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will tell you anything! Please no more!\" Aurora begs. With only several minutes of tickling, tears have filled her eyes. She breaths heavily, trying to acquire as much oxygen as she could. However, the two girls decide not to give her much break time. The torment, once again, starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one of the two girls stands in front of one foot of Aurora. Theresa has switched her target to Aurora's heel while Maisei focuses on Aurora's toes. On one side, a hand is clenching Aurora's foot tightly to hold it in place while the other hand dances on the heel. On the other side, a hand is separating Aurora's toes while the other hand sweep between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears climb all over Aurora's face. Her body wiggles and tries to pull her feet away from the girls. However, without her magic power, she is just a ticklish and helpless girl. With her eternal youth, her body will always maintain maximum sensitivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha---Hahahaha---\" Her laughter echoes in the chamber continuously, so loud that Gothel worries it may penetrate into the main castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime proves Gothel's worries unnecessary. Minutes later and no one has come. With all the struggling, Aurora's glossy hair has become a mess. Her robe has come half off. Finally, Maisei and Theresa stops, as they are afraid that they would break Aurora if the torment continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora collapses on the table. She cannot even move one finger at this moment. The most powerful witch in the world now cannot even fight against the strength of a three-year old kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph! You should know how I feel when you tickled my feet earlier!\" Theresa snorts and stumps again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, Theresa, let her rest for a few minutes then I need to ask her something.\" Speaking, Gothel stands up and walks to Aurora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In case some of you do not know, Aurora is the name of Sleeping Beauty, if I recall correctly)</span></div></div>",

Of course, depending on your responses, the intensity may vary.\" Gothel takes the gloves off her hands, one after another, lightly pinching Aurora's big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....wait...\" Aurora is at the verge of broken, drooling. Gasping with all her strength, she continues speaking. \"I will tell you everything. Just no more....please.\" If Aurora is conscious enough, she would be regretting including the rules that sensitivity of a witch grows with her talent. Indeed, being the most talented witch herself, the sensitivity of her body is paramount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is my husband? How can I get him back?\" Gothel asks apathetically. Over the years, she has been suffering from this for too long and she has learned to stay apathetic so that she does not fall into despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... He is in Cinderella's world. I have mistaken the power of inter-dimensional barrier. It prevents connection between two worlds from occurring more than once.\" Still weak, Aurora answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? How can I get him back!?\" Even though Gothel has anticipated this being the result, she still cannot accept the fact that her lover will never come back. She starts to lose patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Gothel! I can explain! No more, please, no more.\" Seeing that Gothel is losing patience, Aurora tries to appease her. She quickens her speech. \"Intrusion among worlds is unnatural, and the laws from nature prohibits this from occurring. Even though natural breach could occur occasionally, artificial portals trigger nature's immunity system. Once an artificial portal between two world opens, nature senses it and closes it permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus on the key point. HOW CAN I GET HIM BACK?\" Gothel strikes the table on which Aurora lies with fury. A loud banging sound echoes in the chamber. Maisei and Theresa are scared by Gothel's sudden burst. Holding each others' hands, the two girls backs away, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! It is possible! I can tell you!\" Aurora speaks in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SPEAK!\" Gothel demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we could use a natural medium that is permitted to travel between worlds, we could potentially travel to the same world again!\" Aurora speaks hastily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where to find it?\" Gothel inhales deeply, trying to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. In case of incidents that could have ruined my master plan, I prepared a backup plan that could allow me to traverse among worlds freely. In the world of Oz, there are a pair of gems possessing the power of space. Even with hundreds of millions of people knowing my stories and enhancing the worlds, only one pair of these gems could exist among all worlds - that is how rare they are and how strict nature is on inter-dimensional traveling. When the two gems are placed in close proximity, they have domination over space. Do remember, on if they are together - having only one of the two gems will not work.\" Aurora has finally caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send us there, right away!\" Gothel demands again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The story of Oz has not been spread widely enough yet. At this moment, the portal could only allow two young ones to cross before it collapses. However, before I do that, tell me, how did you get in here?\" The remnant fear of tickling has diminished. Knowing that Gothel still needs her, Aurora has gained some confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in no place to bargain.\" Gothel's pointy nails scratches over bottom of Aurora's soles. The poor witch scrunches her toes and laughter burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha--Stop---Hahaha--Or---Hahahaha--I won't do---Hahaha--it--\" During laughter, Aurora squeezes out her intimidation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. I guess we still need you.\" Gothel stops. She waves her hand at Theresa, signaling her to come. The two girls are still holding their hands together, scared or the earlier furious Gothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is okay, Theresa, come over here~\" Gothel tries to be as friendly and amiable as possible, but Theresa still seems to be scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry girls, I went over my head, and the anger was not even for you. Forgive me, alright? I just need you to show Aurora the runes I drew between your toes.\" Gothel appeases the girls. Theresa nods to comes close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright dear, take off one shoe first.\" Gothel instructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey those are mine!\" Aurora protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore, and you will not need them anymore. The association has sentenced deprivation of your rights to possess or wear any footwear for the entirety of your natural life, or until you make another major breakthrough for the association, whichever comes first.\" Gothel declares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who gave you the right of sentencing!? I am still the head of association!\" Aurora objects loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When your speech was broadcast to the public a little while ago, your behavior was determined treason and re-election was held immediately at the association. With my reputation and my merit, the members of association reached consent almost instantly.\" Gothel responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ex---Excuse me...My foot feels cold.\" Theresa mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh--right. Just spread your toes a little bit.\" Gothel speaks amiably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....brilliant!\" Although still bounded on the table, Aurora exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a rune forms when all the lines are connected - that is when Theresa scrunches her toes. On this foot is the rune for transmitting voice, and on the other one is the rune for summoning us. And Theresa, you can put your boot back on now.\" Gothel explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You have outsmarted me. Alright, relieve me from these magic-damping straps and I will cast the magic.\" Aurora speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast. I just need one insurance.\" Gothel reaches into her pocket and pulls out a quill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what are you doing!? Stop! Hahahaha---No---\" Aurora bursts into laughter once again when the quill makes contact with her left sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will activate the rune and you will experience tickling hundreds of times more intense than what you are experiencing right now if you do anything suspicious. Before you even think about trying, if I do not lift the spell in time, the rune will activate on its own and will not stop until the ink fades. Hint, this ink can only be erased with a special solution. So, do not try anything fishy and you will be just fine.\" Gothel speaks as the quill rapidly drifts up and down, all over Aurora's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You----Hahaha---bitch---Hahahaha!\" Aurora curses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could make this a more ticklish experience if you do not keep quite.\" Gothel speaks. Several minutes later, two complex runes appear on Aurora's soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we can release you.\" Gothel loosens the straps and Aurora quickly pulls her hands and feet out of them, not wishing to stay in them for even one more second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you thing.\" Gothel demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" Aurora asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away.\" Gothel looks at the two girls. In her eyes are begging and apologies. She walks to Theresa and Maisei and speaks. \"Please, I cannot wait any longer. I wish I could go in there myself but I guess I have to, once again, lay the burdens on you. I will prepare you two the most glorious ceremony and finest gifts upon your return, but now, please, help me!\" Gothel bows at the two girls. A strong woman like her probably has never done that to anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I guess this is for me as well. After all, I need them to help me return home.\" Theresa stares at Gothel in her eyes. \"And do not forget those gifts you talked about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My share too.\" Maisei complements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, Aurora is casting the spell. She mumbles some mysterious words while magic circles fly around her. A gate slowly forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will see you again soon.\" The two girls speak, ready to step through the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Gothel stops them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so sentimental now, we will come back, soon.\" Maisei smiles at Gothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a few minutes.\" Gothel speaks, and with a magic circle under her feet appearing, she disappears. A minutes later, Gothel returns with Theresa's boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are. I guess walking in shoes a size too large in another world is not the best idea.\" Gothel speaking, handing Theresa's furry boots to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just walk through the gate already! I cannot hold it any longer.\" Aurora seems to be struggling trying to keep the gate open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand holding her boots and the other hand holding Maisei's hand, Theresa walks through the gate. Immediately after Maisei follows through it, the gate collapse. So does Aurora. She lies on the cold floor, gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not doing this again!\" Aurora claims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your behalf, your sentence may be mitigated.\" Gothel speaks. Her words are still cold but one could hear hope in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they do not come back?\" Aurora suddenly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....trust them.\" Gothel replies.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The breach in the world of Oz opens. At the same time, a loud banging sound blares. Theresa and Maisei walks out of the breach and shortly, it collapse into thin air. Theresa rubs her forehead to help relieve the dizziness from inter-dimensional teleportation while Maisei seems to be quite alright. People's exclamations pull Theresa's thoughts back to reality. Not far from the two girls lies a pretty lady and her broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we do that? Should we run?\" Theresa whispers to Maisei, looking at the crowd surrounding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. The people seem to be scared but relieved at the same time. Proceed to escape sequence if anomaly occurs.\" Maisei says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Theresa displays a what-the-hell-are-you-talking-about face. Her mouth opens excessively wide to exaggerate the expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means run if something goes wrong, dumb dumb.\" Maisei whispers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cough cough. Did... did you two young ladies slay this evil witch?\" An old man who seems the elder of the village steps forward and points at the pretty lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess?\" Theresa replies, but even herself is unsure about the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The goddess has finally replied to our prayers! She has finally sent her angels to slay the evil witch for us!\" The old man suddenly kneels and start saying prayers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we do it?\" Theresa whispers to Maisei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly. Gothel did tell me that this type of superior magic tends to disturb magic elements around the area, preventing weaker witches from using magic. Maybe she just happened to be flying and lost control due to this.\" Maisei whispers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sense. From what I read in the past, the shoes she is wearing is what we need, right?\" Theresa asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. The version I heard said that her crystal slippers contains the power of space, but if it does contain the power, why does she not use it?\" Maisei thinks, soon replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can try it, then we will know.\" Theresa speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, my brave heroines. In the name of goddess, we appreciate your arrival to our village and slaying the evil witch!\" The old man has stood back up while the two girls are whispering at each others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our tiny village does not have much to offer for you two brave ladies. If you would like, you could take the crystal slippers the witch wears. It is said that these slippers possess outstanding magic power.\" The old man speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is very kind of you to offer, sir. Their power could be very helpful for our next mission.\" Maisei steps forward and replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you must be on your journey to defeat the Witch in the west! You are truly brave!\" The old man exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is so unfortunate that we could not give you much help. Please, have these bread. The are freshly made and should at least satisfy your stomach.\" The old man signals at one of the villagers. The villager runs into his house and soon returns with a loaf of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd gladly accept this. Thank you!\" Maisei replies to the old man and takes the loaf of bread. She hands the bread over to Theresa and walks towards the Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you see I am already holding my boots? Do you have to occupy both of my hands?\" Theresa complains, but Maisei knows that Theresa is only trying to give her a hard time, in a friendly way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just have to complain, don't you?\" Maisei turns around and smiles at Theresa before she strips the Witch's crystal slippers off. She carefully examines the slippers. Both of them are made of completely transparent crystal, which protects their wearer but put the wearer's feet on a display - considering how easily they come off, its purpose is likely more for display than for protection. On tip of each slipper is a small gouge for jewelry. On the left slipper, the gouge is filled with a ruby while on the right one the gouge remains unfilled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be kidding me. I am not wearing this!\" Theresa sees the slippers. Immediately she start protesting. From afar, she could not clearly see the difference between the two slippers. Without anyone noticing, Maisei removes the ruby from the slipper and drops it into her pocket. She has realized that the ruby is the key, not the slippers. However, part of her wants to see Theresa struggle with putting on a pair of transparent slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be fun. I will tell her about the gem later.\" Maisei mumbles to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we hit the road again?\" Theresa asks from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's get going.\" Maisei nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why not stay for one night here?\" The old man asks. He seems to have thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is alright. We do not have much time.\" Theresa replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I insist.\" The old man speaks.</span></div></div>",

Before the old man could react, Maisei grabs Theresa on her right wrist and starts running. Theresa stumbles as the boots on her feet are of the best fit, but she manages to keep her balance. Knowing that Maisei must have a good reason behind this, Theresa stays silent and sprints with Maisei. Seeing so, the crowd splits in half, leaving a path for the girls to exit. The old man's mouth opens, as if he is about to say something, but soon closes and lightly shakes his head. After the two girls are gone, the crowd soon disperses. The old man walks back into his house and starts writing:<br>\r\n\"The mighty and powerful Elphaba, I have acquired clues of Evanora [Witch of East] and her crystal shoes. However, two strange girls traverses through a portal and somehow disrupted her magic, indirectly causing her death. I attempted to lower their caution by offering the crystal shoes, which they gladly took. However, I was still unable to seize them. They are currently heading east and should encounter the territory of mimics soon. I cannot determine how long they will be delayed. Please send reinforcement soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the two girls are chatting as they walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the rush just now? We could have stayed. It would be great if we could stay for the night. I knew you must have a good reason.\" Theresa asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Elder of that village is planning something fishy. I could see it from his eyes. The rest of the villagers, on the other hand, do not seem to know anything.\" Maisei explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what could he possibly be going after, the slippers, or us?\" Theresa is confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logically, us. He would not have offered the slippers if he wanted them. However, my instinct tells me that he is after the slippers.\" Maisei says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we should be fine since you are wearing your red.... wait, I just notice you are not wearing your red hood!\" Theresa speaks but soon exclaims, as she finds that Maisei is not wearing her peculiar red hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... About that. I left that with Gothel to assure her that we will be back. She never demanded it, but I would like to leave her something as a symbol of trust.\" Maisei replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maisei, you are truly a saint.\" Theresa teases, acting as if she is praying towards Maisei. However internally, she is indeed glad that her friend is such a considerate person who would risk her own well-being for inner peace of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saying that won't save your sensitive body from this.\" Noticing that Theresa is teasing, Maisei fights back with her fingers dancing in mid-air, as if she is about to tickle Theresa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's not fair! And I just recall you are still owing me a good round of tickling!\" Theresa says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, where do you want to be tickled, feet again?\" Maisei smiles at Theresa, pretending that she does not know what she is talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Me tickling you! Over all your body!\" Theresa argues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can try, but I will fight back and give you a good taste of my new techniques.\" Maisei disagrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph, you won't succeed. Actually... Speaking of taste, should we try that bread? I am feeling a little hungry.\" Theresa asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Let's find good place to take a rest. You can get your boots changed as well. I saw you stumble earlier. Wearing something that doesn't fit you is probably still a little uncomfortable.\" Realizing Theresa is still holding her short boots, Maisei suggests.</span></div></div>",

Let's have our lunch break!\" Theresa cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is definitely more like dinner break.\" As the girls are walking toward the picnic blanket, Maisei expresses her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just have to disagree with me, don't you?\" Theresa makes faces at Maisei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly Theresa.\" Maisei shakes her head lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picnic blanket is fairly large - enough to serve a group of five or six people. As Theresa approaches the blanket, she tosses the short boots that she has been holding the entire time aside onto the grass and she rolls onto the picnic blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Theresa, stop that.\" Maisei says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I haven't had picnic for so long! It is natural to get excited.\" Theresa defends for her ungentle behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.\" Maisei tosses the crystal slippers right by Theresa's short boots and sits on the picnic blanket. Theresa breaks the loaf of bread in half and hands a half to Maisei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bread is really good!\" Theresa exclaims as she chews the bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For once, I agree.\" Maisei takes a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, the two girls finish their lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew. I like this weather.\" Theresa lies on picnic blanket to looks up at the clear sky. A cloud hovers over the sun, projecting a shade onto the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't get it dirty with your shoes! Take them off, show some respect!\" Maisei pats Theresa on her head and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Maisei, stop being a mom. I thought you said you want to be my sister, not mother.\" Theresa stares at Maisei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.\" Maisei lies down by Theresa and stares at the clear sky with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I haven't been relaxing like this for a very long time either.\" Maisei sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we are done with all these mess, you can return home and be like this all day long.\" Theresa speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but would my grandmother still be around? To be honest I am scared.\" Maisei's eyes look watery. \"I don't want to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be, Maisei. You still have me, you still have Gothel.\" Theresa comforts her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... But if grandmother is still around, I will not be able to see you two anymore. For either case, I am scared.\" Maisei looks at Theresa in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will figure it out, I promise.\" Theresa says, looking back at Maisei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls close their eyes, and when they open their eyes again, the sun is starting to go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh, I can't move.\" Realizing that she, together with Maisei, is wrapped around by the picnic blanket, Theresa moans. She struggles but it was to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something, something soft is crawling around my boots!\" Maisei cries out. While the upper part of picnic blanket wraps all the way from the girls' breasts to their thighs, a huge mouth opens at the lower part of the blanket with its tongue extending outside. Spreading all over the tongue are a series bumps of flesh. Each time the tongue licks, the bumps adheres to Maisei's boots. With the tongue retracting, the bumps try to pull Maisei's boots off. Maisei scrunches her toes and tightly clenches to the sole of her boots. The tongues is unable to remove Maisei's protection off with the first round of its attack. Maisei exhales as she survives the first round. She struggles with even greater strength as she knows the second round will come at any time. However, even with Theresa trying at her greatest strength, they could not break free. The second round comes. Maisei clenches to the soles of her boots again. She survives the second round, but her boots has been pull slightly away from her feet. The tongue licks again and again. Each time, the boots are pulled further apart from Maisei's feet. Maisei grows anxious as she feels her protection being torn off. Finally, with a final lick, both of her boots are tugged off at the same time. The tongue wraps around its trophies and returns to the mouth. Shortly after, it strikes again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No! Give them back to me!\" Feeling the breeze on her feet, Maisei cries in fear. Before she could say more, the tongue makes contact with her soles. The bumps brushes against her silky skin and starts secreting fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha---Help---Hahaha--Theresa---Hahahaha--Help---Me--Hahaha\" Maisei screams with laughter. Her toes have already scrunched together but it was to avail. In fact, Maisei scrunching her toes further excites the creature. The tongue licks at a higher rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha---Hahahaha--Help--\" Maisei continues laughing and crying for help. It was the only thing she could do. All this time, Theresa is trying to help. Despite knowing that this will provoke the creature, Theresa is trying to poke the tongue with the tip of her toes. Initially, the tongue ignores her. It is have too much joy licking and bring laughter to Maisei to react to Theresa's provoke. After the fourth time, Theresa pokes it. The tongue can no longer stand. It switches target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaisei gasps loudly, taking her break, while the tongue starts licking Theresa's boots. It does not take long for Theresa to lose her footwear. With the boots being a size too large, it is much easier for the tongue to pull it off. It is Theresa's turn to laugh. With one sudden stroke of the tongue, Theresa can no longer hold her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha--No---Hahaha---Fogive---Hahaha--Forgive me--Hahaha\" Her laughter is even louder, as the tongue, covered with saliva, brushes up and down on her soles. With the tongue being so much larger than Theresa's feet, it could easier cover Theresa's entire soles. The saliva further lubricates her already extremely soft skin. The bumps make the situation a lot worse. With each lick, Theresa's laughter grows louder. For one brief moment, the sensation is so strong that Theresa fails to keep her toes scrunched together. Catching the chance, the smaller bumps sticks between Theresa's toes so that she could not longer hide the seams. Tears climb all over Theresa's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Theresa is starting to feel the lack of oxygen from all her laughing, the tickling sensation weakens. The tongue is no longer attacking both of feet. Rather, it is only attacking her left foot. At the same time, Maisei's laughter sounds. Surprised and confused, Theresa tilts her right foot downward, finding that something soft is in front of her foot, blocking all the \"attack\" for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeee--Hahaha---Theresa--Hahaha--Stop--Haha--Moving--HeeeHeee--Hahaha-- Your---Hahaha--Foot--\" With laughter between words, Maisei finishes her sentence. Knowing that Theresa cannot take all the tickling alone, she sticks her own foot in front of Theresa to help her. Even though afraid of being tickled, she does not wish her friend to bear it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that one girl is helping another, the creature grows further excited. Its tongue swipes from left to right then right to left for a full-area lick. With the tongue and the bumps on it rapidly brushing over their soles, the girls' laughter becomes louder, especially Maisei's. With both of her feet under attack, she is taking twice as much tickling as Theresa is. One minute later, Maisei's laughter gentles down. As Theresa realizes that Maisei will be broken if she continues taking the full tickling strikes, she places her foot in front. Over the next ten minutes, the two girls take place bearing the full attack while the other take a brief break. Certainly, for each of them, one foot is still continuously tickled, but at least it could still be bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother ten minutes has elapsed and the creature seems satisfied. Its tongue retracts into its mouth and soon the mouth closes. It is like nothing has happened except that the girls are breathing heavily with their feet covered in saliva. The picnic blanket sits quietly under them as if it has never turned into a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill gasping, the girls rolls off the blanket onto the grass, as they no longer have the courage to stay on a mimic that just took their footwear and gave them a good round of tickling. The girls wipes their feet again the grass turf to remove the saliva. Fortunately enough for the girls, the crystal slippers and Theresa's own shoes are placed far away enough that they were not eaten by the mimic. Theresa slowly crawls to her shorts boots and swiftly places them on her feet, while Maisei stares at the crystal shoes, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theresa, can we switch? Please!!!\" Maisei stares at Theresa into her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Don't even think! I can assure you my boots won't fit.\" Theresa refuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph! I demand you to switch with me!\" Maisei pulls her older-sister face at Theresa. Clearly she has taken enough rest and they both have had enough experience with tickling creatures to recover from this quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Theresa stands back up and wipes the dust off her clothes. \"Maybe you should try activate the power of these slippers. They are made of the gems, right?\" Maisei asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, they are not...\" Maisei sighs and stops joking. \"Look at the tips of these slippers, each of them have a place for a gem. Here is the gem, just one.\" Maisei points at the tips of her slippers, then pulls a ruby out of her pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, there is another one?\" Theresa asks, but her eyes are still staring at Maisei's shoes - more specifically, her feet. The transparent crystal slippers displays Maisei's perfect feet without hiding any details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop staring! And yes. According to the tale I read, the evil Witch Evanora has always wanted these slippers. However, the other evil witch's power is just as strong as hers. They disliked each other and has fought for many decades. She might be possessing the other gem. Otherwise, why would she want the slippers so much?\" Maisei answers with a blush of red on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense. If I recall correctly, she is the witch in the east. Maybe we can find her somewhere in the east?\" Theresa speaks, but unsure of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be my guess.\" Maisei says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better get on the road then. Hopefully we can find something that don't put your feet on the display in the next village.\" Theresa walks to the road made of golden bricks and looks back at Maisei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Theresa... Can you...hold my hand? These slippers have heels and I'm not particularly familiar with these.\" Maisei's volume goes lower and lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly~\" Theresa walks back to Maisei and holds her arm around Maisei's shoulder. \"Feeling better now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank...you..\" Maisei turns her head away and mumbles.</span></div></div>",

Some say tales are to entertain children; some say tales are to teach lessons, but the truly wise ones keep the secret to themselves, that tales are to cover the dark truth with sugar coats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a theory: words create worlds. With words flowing onto paper, forming sentences, paragraphs, books, worlds are created. With more details of a world known by more people, connection between worlds can be enhanced. At some point, a breach can be open, allowing some beings to pass from one world to another. However, this opportunity is extremely precious, as worlds repel each other while interaction occurs. After a brief moment, the breach between the two worlds will be closed, forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on this theory, dark tales were created. An egregious being behind the scene has planned her revival in one of the tales and to gain control of our world. However, accidentally, Theresa is teleported into the tale world instead of his army being teleported main world. How will Theresa survive the crude reality in the tales? How could she escape from the tickling filled in the tales? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagination is your gift, be creative and let's put together an extraordinary story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo blood<br>\r\nMinimal cursing<br>\r\nNo M/M or F/M.
